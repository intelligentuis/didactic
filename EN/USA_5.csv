  Oh wow. I hope you are getting some money for that. You can sue for that... They caused you to go to the dr. The dr isn't supposed to cause you to go to the dr.. I would check into a lawyer. Medical Compensation. I would look into that. This is something serious. People need to be held accountable for that. They shouldn't be wasting your time and causing you to have to go to the hospital because of their mistake. They are trained professionals and I went to school for the things that they're doing. They should not be doing those kinds of things to patients. I would definitely check in to a lawyer and getting you some help.

   Did anybody take the covid shot? I am concerned. I feel dizzy and feverish.
  ","
  No I didn't take it because I don't take any of those shots when they come out because one time and only one time only I took one and I got sick so in my opinion when you get those shots all they do is make you sick. Probably not in everyone's case but in my case it did so it's not going to help me it's going to hurt me. Hopefully your immune system is strong enough to fight it off because that's the point of the shot. It's inject you with a little bit of the virus and see if your body can fight it off and not all the time everybody can fight it off. They say that the shot doesn't get you sick but in my opinion sorry if you weren't sick with it at all and then you get the shot and then it gets you sick a week later then that is the shot getting you sick. Idc what any doctor or scientist says. That sh- just pisses me off when they want to try to say that that's not the reason. Good luck. I'm sure you'll be fine.

We have weekly tasks that we have to complete but me? I don't usually ask them on Anonymous. But yeeaaah

  Honestly you might want to check into your doctor about your migraines because he could be another medical issue that you're having. And some medical issues are serious. Like things going on with your skull. Or maybe early on symptoms of maybe having seizures or something or maybe you're not sleeping correctly and you just don't know it. Or maybe you're grinding your teeth at night and not realizing it you should definitely check into seeing that with your doctor and seeing if maybe you can get something checked out.

   Are you more often lending or borrowing money?
  ","
  I don't lend money just to anyone and if I do I make sure it's a very small amount and I don't usually expect it back. It's only usually a couple dollars. A lot of the time people don't return it but if I ever borrow money which is super duper duper rare I always give it back the day after or the date that I told him I'm going to give it back to them and usually I give them more back because I thank them so much for helping me out. I do not borrow money almost ever. Because I don't like having to stress about getting it back because that's just how I am. I am not one to lie and not pay someone back. That's why I don't give money out a lot because a lot of times people don't give it back and they should feel bad about that and people don't so I don't just give money out to anyone especially people I don't know unless of course like I said I give him a couple dollars and I never see them again but I don't expect that kind of stuff back those are things that I want to do for people and I don't want anything in return back

  I definitely try to hold back my laugh if it's something inappropriate and not called for it to be laughing at. Like a child slipping or something on there behind at the end of the day that's really not funny because they feel embarrassed and they might have hurt themselves but some people like to laugh about that. Only laugh at the child starts laughing If the child starts crying then it's not a laughing matter. Are you see an elderly person fall and they nearly hurt themselves some people start laughing at them when they can't help themselves and then they don't want to help them up and they just leave the person sitting there flying there but they want to laugh that's just wrong. Hopefully I answer this question right

  I will say there are trolls haters people that are going to want to make you angry catfish on every site and app that you go on. There is no escaping them. As of this app we definitely have them. You have to ignore them. Right now you're using the shout-out features. You can use it to get some pretty cool people to follow you but not everyone's going to be pretty cool people. You're going to get people that are going to want to waste your time and sit there and stalk you but if you give them reactions then they're going to keep going but if you ignore them then you don't have to worry about them anymore. If you don't want to stay that's up to you but this site is pretty cool and has some awesome people on it when you get to looking. But there are people that are greedy and there are people that want you to like their post and give them things even though they should earn it. But you just have to stick to yourself and remember to not get angry when someone comes on your page that you don't know at all and have never met or talked to you have to remember to not react to them. Because that's the only reason why they're here is to make people angry

   Why do you think family fights so hard, especially siblings?
  ","
  Some families do. You'd be surprised that some families don't fight. And it's kind of weird honestly. You should definitely not be a perfect family or act like you are at least. Keeping that image is actually bizarre. But I definitely see what you mean by why do some families fight so much? Because there are some families that are really bad. Like sometimes we have people come in our store and they're just screaming across the store at each other or hitting each other or calling each other names are snatching things from each other and then they want to know why everyone keeps being so rude to them or talking so down about them. If you're going to show that reputation then people are going to do that to you. But yes I have always wondered why some families fight so much.

   How do I find my biological father? I found his inmate record so how I get in contact with him now?
  ","
  I mean. Find out the number to the jail asked about the Ferguson and then asked if you could talk to them the worst they can say is no and then you can be like well how do I get and to contact with him? I wouldn't even tell them what you're trying to do because then he might not want to talk to you immediately. But if they ask why I just be like I just have a question for this person and if they do keep persisting to know why then I guess tell them. But that's the best thing I can tell you is to just call them and ask to speak to him or ask how to speak to him or if you can come in and talk to him

   Share a post or picture of something that you read and felt very deeply about or something that made you cry, or something that you just liked. No one will ever know which.
  ","
  This is my most favorite quote. It means a lot to me and it deeply explains how I feel about my marriage and how I feel people should look at their marriage and how they should look at relationships. It's not all about one thing it's about a lot of things at once and the most important things. You not only are in a relationship with that person but that person is your best friend and friendship is important for a relationship. You should get along with that person 100%. You don't want to be with someone difficult that doesn't treat you right or something. It's not all about looks. It's about attitude and what they want in life and other things. Connecting with them. This picture means a lot to me and explains so much.

   How open are you to making new friends?
  ","
  I don't mind making new friends but if you're going to be toxic or drama or anything that's going to negatively affect me I'm not going to be friends with you but I will always give people a chance. But the minute you start acting strange it may not last that long. And it's nothing against anyone but I'm not going to hang out with dad influence type people and run my life. Making Circle small is a good thing. Because if you have a big circle than you're letting in toxic people because honestly in this whole world probably 85% of the people in this world are toxic or like to be toxic or want to be toxic and I'm going to avoid that many as I can

  Will Jason's always keeping me safe and always making me feel like I am safe and I love that. That is definitely one perfect trait about him. He always is confident to keep his priorities straight and he always lives up to that. He's always really good with people both boys and girls and I think that's very respective or however you would say it. He's very strong very smart and very skillful. These are most definitely the things that I find absolutely perfect about Jason and I love about him plus more

   Are you going out for New Year’s Eve or are you staying home? I’m picking up a pizza and going home and we are going to get into our pajamas and watch a movie. Which one you ask? I don’t know yet we will decide.
  ","
  Well I was going to go out for New Year's and stuff but apparently we're supposed to have some tornadic weather and if it rains a lot. While I live out in the country and we take back roads and it's a hilly area out here and if it rains even more than a couple inches all the back roads get flooded and we can't get to where we have to go or we get stuck where we're at. So if it's going to get really bad then we can't get there safely. And if there's tornadoes that could be potentially dangerous for us in our vehicle. Plus we have dogs and we need to take care of them so we don't need to be getting stuck anywhere. Rather be safer than sorry. And we bought fireworks and everything this year but it's okay we'll save them for someone's birthday maybe or something

  Yes because I know what's going on with myself. I don't need someone to make something up and tell people about it. I don't care what people think about me. I know what I am and I don't need anyone to tell me different. When I tell someone something I make sure to embarrass the crap out of them and make sure they never want to say something like that about me again to people. I bring the liar out of them. Instead I embarrass them. I think people are funny when they make up rumors I find it entertaining to hear such things about myself

  It is. but make sure you get someone that really knows how to make it because sometimes it's really fishy and gooey if you don't know how to cook it. usually you have to batter them a lot and clean them very well. But yes catfish is very good! Fried catfish! yaaas some pictures for ya. Enjoy.

   What does it mean if a boy starts being nasty to you after 3 years of knowing them, they are good friends with your boyfriend and they used to be so lovely in the summer towards you but now all of a sudden they’ve turned on you for absolutely no reason?
  ","
  Sounds like your boyfriend has been telling him some of the things he does with you or something which isn't really good. He should keep those things in between both of you but this is just me assuming. But honestly why would he start doing this towards you? Being nasty? After all he is best friends with your boyfriend. Maybe they have been discussing some of the things that you and your boyfriend doing together and maybe your boyfriend's best friend is starting to look at you a different way. Which isn't really good. Like I said I'm just assuming. Don't automatically think that this is what it is but I would definitely start asking your boyfriend when he discusses with his best friend about you because at the end of the day I don't think it's appropriate for his best friend to be being nasty to you especially if you're with someone especially his best friend. I would have a discussion with him. But I'm friendly I don't want him to do that type of discussion. Good luck. Hopefully I helped

  Thanks. 😊 I really appreciate Punk. You rock. Yep. I am 35 today. I don't feel it at ALL yo... Haha.. But it's all good. I feel 20 still or 19 haha or something... 😅 but yes today has went well. Tomorrow is my official birthday and I'm going to celebrate it at work. I wanted to work because I get to see a lot of people. I did not want to spend it at home by myself. I found out my husband is off though so it would have been nice but I get to spend it with him when I get off. And I'm completely fine with that. I get to see some really good friends at work. You would be surprised a lot of my co-workers and people that come in are good friends of mine. So spending it at home would be really sad. I unfortunately don't get to see my family for my birthday this year and that will be the first time I have ever spent my birthday without them. It's a little hard but I guess it's okay. This covid-19 stuff has really messed up everything but I guess we have to do what we have to do you know? But today did go well. It went better than I thought. We went antique shopping. And went to a few flea markets. And then we went out to eat at my favorite restaurant and I ordered the lobster and scallop and shrimp plate. So it was really good and I was spoiled today. My husband got me quite a bit of things including a really old antique beautiful jewelry box that sings when you open a chat. And this beautiful All-American purse and other gifts. I'm going to put my most special things in there that he got me. It's beautiful and I love it it is sentimental now in my life. Today definitely has went well. Got to ride around also. Because the place we went to was hours away. Again like I said thank you for the birthday wishes and you be safe and good night.

  right right. Just when I started getting into my space it basically was going out of style and they were closing it down and I was really sad because I had never really gotten into my space.

  yeah sometimes I would run out of questions and I would look up lists but most of the time I come up with the questions that I ask.

And then I asked them do you have any picture frames on your wall? Any favorites? Take a picture and share it! Random questions like that that are original and different

   What’s the best brand of water to drink?
  ","
  And honestly there's really no perfect company to get water from and drink. There's always some sort of catch or joke from something or someone. But I would really be careful with Aquafina and Dasani water because there is salt in that water. I know Dasani has salt in it read the bottles and you will see what I mean. I have seen people develop blood pressure issues from drinking Dasani. Because it does contain salt and a lot of doctors will recommend you not take it and some doctors will recommend you take it for certain things. So don't always believe what you hear and what you see on the front of a water bottle. Honestly it's not even go to drink out of a water bottle because that's another section in the class that you will find out. What happens when water sits too long and a water bottle. That's a long-term way of getting cancer. We're consuming different types of oils that have diffused into the water bottle over time especially from different temperatures and just from its sitting that's why water has an expiration sometimes because after it has been sitting in the. We're consuming different types of oils that have diffused into the water bottle over time especially from different temperatures and just from its sitting that's why water has an expiration sometimes because after it has been sitting in the plastic for so long it actually becomes ruined and not drinkable. Say you were to take a water bottle and put it in your center console of your car and then you forget about it for two weeks. I would not recommend you drinking that water. When you do go to drink that water you will notice it has a foul taste to it and then it almost tastes dirty. That is because the water has now diffused some of the water bottle into it and you're not drinking different types of plastic and oil and stuff. Not good for you not good for your body. You can check out more stuff on this online yourself on an environmental site probably. Or just go read up on ordering a book maybe.

  This year. I did not think it was going to be bad and it was really bad. But at the same time we made the most out of it. It could definitely be worst. So I mean I guess I could say it's just another year.

   What all did you’ll get for Christmas? 🎄
  ","
  This right here is probably my most favorite thing I got for Christmas. My husband made this for me and surprised me with it on Christmas in a little early in the good morning. I absolutely love it. We were in a long distance relationship before we finally got together and got married. We were in a really long one. Almost four and a half years. And we lived miles apart. So this was a very thoughtful and sweet gift. He put the exact day that we got married and this is what the constellation of the Stars looked like the day we got married. ❤🙏😍 absolutely sweet and beautiful. I love it so much! love you Jason!
  
  I got lots of cutlery and kitchen things from my family members and friends. And then I got to post for my birthday and a speaker for my birthday I got another speaker for Christmas. They're both waterproof break-resistant type speakers. Looove them. And then I got a cookbook / storybook on someone's career and stuff and it looks awesome I have been reading on that. It's a southern Cajun cookbook. So I can learn even more. I got this really cute mug. And so much more
  "
27513,"
   Did you get What you wanted
  ","
  Yes! Or really just things I wished for. People gave me things they new I liked and those kinds of presents are the absolute best. Thoughtful. Kind and well thought out, sweet presents! 😍 So Yes. I got everything I could ever want. Everything was great. I am grateful.

  We might do this but I'm just not sure yet. I kind of already know what I'm getting. When me and my husband buy for each other we don't usually wrap the gifts though he has gotten me a few surprises I'm just not sure yet what I want to open on Christmas Eve. I just might open one of my mom's Christmas Eve presents. We always open one on Christmas Eve so I'm glad you said something cuz I just might do that. I miss my mom. I unfortunately don't get to see any of my family on my side for Christmas. It's really sad but it's okay. I really miss them. If only they weren't 400 500 miles away

  ","
  I really like spiral ham even though people always knock it down. I really like it with the gravy and the brown sugar Coke juice on top of it with pineapples. I really think it's good. So that's probably my favorite was some stuffing or something. But we always try to make some homemade dishes like this year we're doing homemade macaroni and cheese and green bean casserole. We're also doing rice dressing cornbread stuffing. Then we're doing gravy ham bread rolls cake and a few other things. But it's all going to be really good

  Welcome to Ask.fm.
  
  This happens to all of us. I constantly get people doing that all the time. People making accounts just to send disturbing and weird and odd questions out and then disabling the account or getting it reported and blocked and removed. This doesn't just happen to you and no one is specifically targeting you or at least most of the time is not a specific Target. Most of the time there's just a lot of creeps catfish and just strange people that have nothing better to do than harass us on the internet. On this site. But I just thought I would let you know that it's a regular thing on this site. Nothing for you to get too upset about. I literally have been on here for years and have always gotten the same results. For both of us to decide by the way. LOL not me it's in a sarcastic way... But really welcome. By the way...

   Jealous and envy is something we all have and that is what I am, in face I’m the definition of it!
  ","
  Being honest that if you have ALOT of jealousy & envy.. it really isn't a good thing.. Yes we all have it and even some times often.. But just a friendly tell here. You don't have to follow the advice. No. But you should really work on not having it too* much. Too much of either isn't even close to healthy. People won't want to be around you if you show toooo much. Be creative yourself & love the things you are & do & not others so much. Do your own thing. Discover your talents and skills and show them off. Your not going to be the best at EVERYTHING. That is near to impossible. Have full confidence and determination in anything and everything you do. It's okay to get ideas from other people but don't always show that you're completely jealous of everything they have and do. Then it's just gonna kill your self-esteem and kill for everyone... Or don't envy everything they have and do. Especially all of the time like I said. But like I said you don't have to follow this advice. This is just a friendly thought. I know quite a few envious and jealous people and to be honest I never really see them around a lot of friends. And these are extremely jealous and envious people. People just don't want to be around them. I mean if that's what they want then so be it but why would you want no one to be around you? No one like you? Why? If so. Then so be it. 🤷 But again. Good luck. 👍 🤘

  He sure does today. A few of them do. But I gave them chances.. You can only give someone so many chances... One of them was a very horrible person... only cared for himself? And then when he went to far with what he did wrong the last time I told him before that if he did it again that I was out? 🤷 He didn't listen.. he didn't take me serious. I was out. Out like a light and never came back. A shame when someone loses the best thang' they eva' had ya know? But I wasn't a dish and not give him warnings and chances now... I gave them.. but I am not sitting around looking like a dumbash neither... No way. I moved on with my life and found someone to treat me better. Someone that actually deserved me. Cause my previous ex that I am talking about DID NOT. He realizes now... That he fuked up. I was veeery good to him. But he wanted to act stupid. So he lost that. His lost.

   that is cool. i have thought of wanting to go on one
  ","
  Well just make sure that you are careful when you go with someone that is experienced and don't mess around with too much stuff. What I always tell people to do don't ever separate from each other when you're in places and watch out for holes bring a flashlight or a head flashlight make sure someone always has a phone on and working and charged and maybe try to bring extra water food and Light and a first aid kit just in case if you get lost stuck or hurt. Bring something to protect yourself and do not break into places. It just says no trespassing ask for permission. It is not fun sitting in jail for not following the rules. Plus he might ruin adventuring for other people. Just be careful all around. People don't understand these kind of things to happen to you while adventuring

  Helps children that are really sick or are in need of like a wheelchair or maybe a special kind of medical bed or a surgery that they need done or they are going to be doing really bad. Surgeries that are going to keep them alive.
  
  Just donating your blood can really help the world. Try to donate your blood every two or three months. Especially plasma.ii
  
  Bushfire Charities I like to give to because you would be surprised how many bushfires they have throughout the year and multiple different parts of the world. You can donate to certain areas of the world also.
  
  I like to give to just vet's. Try to go and give money to vets or really shelters more or less. Because they want to save so many more animals than what they can't. So many animals have to get euthanized because people don't have the money to take care of him and there's just so many and some of them are mean and we want to try to avoid that. Try to give people a chance to give an animal a second chance.
  
  And then maybe... Try to give to poor families that are struggling. Sometimes people like that sign up for certain programs. Like one-parent families. Like girls or guys that have three or four children and they're raising them on their own or even more five or six children.
  
  Orphanages. It's really good to donate mostly items to orphanages but they love money to to help feed and take care of the kids and get them new beds and blankets and stuff like that.
  
  There are just so many. If you ever need any more suggestions just let me know.
  
  Giving is good.

  The last few sentences didn't go through right on my answer sorry. What I was trying to say is I met my husband in high school but not in high school I met him while I was in high school. He was already graduated. I think my husband graduated two or three years ahead of me. But yeah I never really dated people in high school because a lot of the people that I went to school with were not the best kids. A lot of them hung out with people that did drugs or they did drugs. Plus I wanted to focus on Sports and school. I didn't actually start dating people truly until junior year and that's when I met my husband. I almost went into the military but instead when I met him I decided not to because I saw a future with him eight years later we're still together and married

  Just sometimes certain situations and things that happen in people's lives can make them turn.

   Favorite compliments to get?
  ","
  I love it when people compliment my hair and ask me how in the world did I get it that long and that nice looking? I take all those types of things as compliments, huge compliments. I really like it when people compliment me by my talents and skills. Like when I sing or my creations and art. I love it when I get compliments and stuff like that. And the last thing that I probably love the most when I get complimented by is my food. I love to cook I'm Cajun so it's a big deal to make sure that my food tastes great. And when people compliment it more than just saying it tastes good and they're like this tastes amazing and start asking me what did I put in here and how did I do this and oh my gosh that's great. It really makes me feel good to see that smile on their face.

  I am very good. How are you? Today is a great day. We got to go to a really nice festival and my husband got me my birthday present and I got my husband one of his Christmas presents a little bit early. I put my birthday present under the tree considering it's right after Christmas. Just so I would be more excited to get it during Christmas. But yes today is a good day. Everything is going well. And all three of my pittis said hello Mary Jane G Fred and Dixie said hello. Thanks so much my friend for the hellos and checking in with me. I hope everything is going all right with you! Happy holidays to you by the way! Happy late Thanksgiving and happy early Christmas and New Year! And yes I will be 25 soon isn't that crazy how the years go by? I'm excited but not sure what I will do for my birthday. Maybe travel and maybe get some good food.

  I just want to go riding. I love traveling and going riding and seeing different Landscapes and going to different shops. Especially Antique and Flea Markets. I love going to Farms. Museums. Especially art museums. History museums. And I really enjoy going to different rest stops and checking out some of their little tourist attraction areas and tourist shops. And then sometimes I like to browse across the beach because they have the best stores. Get you a spray paint shirt or hat or something. Or maybe even a magnet. Traveling is fun to me. Sometimes it's just something I feel like doing

  Yeah. 😁 I actually got to go to an event.

   Yeah I haven’t seen a lot of my family this year
  ","
  Yeah usually by this time of the year I have went to my mom's anywhere from four to seven times considering I live about 300 to 600 miles away from her depending. But this year I've only seen her once or twice... Really upsetting to be honest. And most people are just like... well it's all for a reason.. Blah blah.. and I'm like.. just shut up. I am tired of hearing the same thing. Nothing is getting better.. Understand this whole covid-19 thing needs to be stopped they say... and not continuously spreaded but we can't stop our lives forever. And that's the thing that pisses me off when someone tells me over and over like I am a horrible person for missing the events and people that we wants used to spend time with your round. They get mad at me and tell me will again it offer a reason why would you want to continue to spread? I say.. what is so wrong about me missing things? And wanting it to all be back the same. Though it's never going to happen. We cannot sit here for 3 to 10 years waiting for this stuff to go away when it's not going to. Like any other sickness it will fade. It just takes time. In the meantime we just have to all be cautious and careful. But we can't forget our roots and our family. Cause I already know this.. That it's not going away but literally this sickness stuff has got people scared and hiding in their houses and not even coming out to see daylight. It has got people literally working from home eating from home and not doing anything and having people deliver their groceries and everything. I haven't seen one of my family members and almost an entire year because they are terrified to come out of their house now because they have now scared them to death. I think that is completely and utterly ridiculous on every extent. B/c they literally are terrified. It's sad. But like it's going to take all of us to understand that it's not going to go away and that we means all connecting even if it means connecting one by one. Our lives must go on

   What are some of the first things you do in the morning?
  ","
  Well the first thing I do is walk around the house and make sure everything's looking okay and I turn the heater on if I'm cold or I turn the air on if I'm hot. Then go into the bathroom and try to freshen up brush my hair my teeth put some nice clothes on wash my face either put a little makeup on it just depends going to try to get me something to eat pack up everything and try to figure out what the temperature is outside if I need to wear a jacket or if I need to wear boots or if I need to wear heavy socks or an extra pair of pants or something. And then I try to pack a drink. If I don't eat anything at my house I will go get breakfast from somewhere. It just depends. I also walk my dogs and feed them depending on what time it is. Sometimes my husband doesn't go into work yet so he can feed them. And this about almost everything I do. Get my bag and make sure I have everything me and then hit the road.

Or a poster. We are definitely very laid-back fun people

Cory in the House was also pretty good Sunny With The Chance was decent and and then of course we have Good Luck Charlie. The Cheetah Girls in High School Musical. But there's so many other shows that I liked as well. I like the Thirteenth Year. That's probably one of my most favorite shows.

   How many times have you had to move in your life? And how do you find it? It’s considered one of life’s most stressful situations, do you agree?
  ","
  Maybe 3 times? Twice?
  
  Considering moving back and forth not even a mile from my house to my grandmother's back to my mom's back and forth Just too live in a different spot and work was closer. Just a little bit closer. Plus I was trying to take care of my grandmother because she needed someone there to care for her. But I don't really count that so if I really had to tell you how many times I actually have moved in my life would only be once. And I guess I'll count moving to my grandmother's ass never too. But I moved back and forth a few times. Which I love living in both places that's why I move so much. I love living with my mom and my sisters and I love living with one of my sisters and my at my grandmother's. Everything was so nearby that I literally used my bike is transportation for literally 2 years as I lived there. Now I moved from Louisiana to Mississippi and I love it. Though of course I miss at home but I have two homes now. I can go back home and have a good time with my family and I can come here and spend time with family in law and my husband and my pitbulls.

   If someone asks you to ‘hang out’ what type of thing would you plan to do? 😊
  ","
  If we were back home in Louisiana... there is so many different things you can do. Let's pretend it's Mardi Gras night right? Or a good Mardi Gras day right? We could go and get some very small breakfast and go walk around on the Levee for just a little bit and then we'd probably start heading to the house to get a few things and some food together to go to a Mardi Gras parade. I would probably go pick up some friends and we would get some chairs and tables and we would set them up before the parade and we would just enjoy some good music and just sit around and conversate a little bit. Maybe buy some really cool merchandise from the trailer that ride around for Mardi Gras. They sell many different types of merchandise that you can wear at the parades and go home with. Sometimes we'll play different types of games and will play with the kids and throw footballs and baseballs. Sometimes will even set up in the middle of the road and actual baseball game until the parade start. Usually will start lining up and waiting for parade even almost 7 hours at a time or longer. Just to celebrate. We eat really good food and have a great time. And catch awesome stuff. After the parade would probably go home and look at the things that we got wash up and get ready to go and watch movies in the living room and probably bake cookies at the end of the day. And in the day in the best way you can after a wonderful Mardi Gras celebration.

I don't want to be around those kinds of people anyway. I never could understand why people have a problem with kind happy people. You want to know why they do? Because they have no happiness in their life and they can't be nice to people or kind people. They don't want to be. And I understand people are going through things but there's no reason to take it out on people to bully another individual or make someone feel less than you just so you can feel better. I feel like those kinds of people need to be taught a lesson and a serious lesson. But at the end of the day they never really learned anything. Or at least that's what it seems like. In some cases.

   What is Cajun food?
  ","
  Cajun food is basically soul food. Haitian Cuisine is basically just down to earth Southern Homemade type foods. Usually they have a lot of flavor to them. A lot of color to the food. The food can be slightly spicy but it's never super hot. Most of the time you add extra spices to your own bowl. Not to the main pot. But basically Cajun food just has tons of flavor. It's really really good food. I grew up around Cajun culture and they just have some of the best food ever. A lot of it isn't the most healthiest for you so most of the time a lot of it you have to have on occasion. But red beans and rice is really good for you. It's got beans in it it's got sausage in it it's got ham in it lots of spices. Mild spices not hot hot spices. The cornbread just a really buttery sweet cornbread and then the cheesy cornbread is just a slightly sweet cornbread with cheese and a little spice to it. And then the potato salad is just a simple potato, eggs, little mayonnaise, very little mustard, sprinkle of salt and pepper and parsley. Nothing too extravagant or strange. Just your everyday potato salad. And if you like Relish in yours you can add a teaspoon of relish. I'm not too much of a fan of vinegar in my potato salad. If y'all eat that in your country. It's a very everyday American side dish. Something easy and yummy. But red beans and rice is definitely a Southern food homemade Thai Dish. It's very warm. So if it's cold out it's a good dish to make when it's freezing out. Made to warm you up. It's mouth-watering to be honest with you. It's just so good. It's soupy kinda.

   In recent years dietitians have advised us against eating the amount of carbs we see in the food pyramid. Regardless of what you eat, do you think it's wiser to follow the food pyramid they enforced when we were children or the one they enforce nowadays and why?

   If you are choosen for any tv shows.(it can be travel show,cooking show,fear factor,dating show)
Which kind of show will you choose?
  ","
  If I could be on any paranormal investigation live action on TV show I would totally do it. If I could be on Wicked Tuna I would totally do it. TV show for that matter honestly. It's a honor. I wouldn't mind doing a cooking show but they would have to make dang sure that they have plenty of Cajun seasonings and don't pester me on how I need to cook things. Once they are done they're delicious and that's all that matters. Everybody has a certain technique in how to make things. You just need to always remember to be professional, safe and of course presentation. You need to always present your food and make it look like it's going to be tasty. And you need to hurry and make it in a matter of time. You don't want to sit there for 3 hours. If you're going to sit there for 3 hours then you need to be there and preparing early so when your guests get there they don't have to wait more than 15 minutes and their seats to get their food

I didn't like missing school because then I would have to sit there and Miss more classes and have to catch up on more classes and more classes and more work and tests so that's why I never like to miss school.

   Have you ever eaten something only to realize that it was actually expired?
  ","
  Yes and sometimes when things go bad it doesn't mean they're immediately bad that day it just means that the stores that they are in can't sell them at that date anymore. Some things really are bad when they go bad like some cut fruit. I wouldn't trust baby food because considering you're giving it to an incident. But if you get like sour cream? Sour cream takes a while to go bad even when it reaches its expiration date. Chips are pretty decent until you open them. Even after expiration. Not all chips though. Milk can sometimes be fine even at its expiration and sometimes you can even go bad 3 days before its expiration. You just have to be careful. Jugs of tea usually don't go bad on their expiration date. Everything has to have an expiration date or at least almost everything especially when a store is selling the item. It's insured that the item is safe for the customer to consume or be around. If not then you cannot sell it.

  I say ""Of course"" alot because that was just the word I just chose to say. It didn't mean anything mean or rude. I wasn't saying it like... ""Well. How could you have not see these things or something?"" No. Don't take how I said it in a wrong way.
  
  Using the words, ""Of course,"" to answered this more along the lines of just being very excited, happy and eager because I love questions like this. The number questions. I just wanted to answer it positive. So I said of course. Saying many times and that I loved it.
  
  Don't take the things I say out of context because most of the time I'm only answering it in a really excited and happy way and that's the only thing I am getting out of it. It's not me being rude what's so ever or in any form. 👍

  He is very good with people but he does not put up with BS he'sVery strong. Mentally and physically. He's very self independent. He is a very good worker. Very good worker. Extremely hard-working. He is the kind of person that will protect his family no matter what. He's very creative. Would die for his family. Works all the time. Family man. Just always about business and taking take of all of the priorities. He is a VERY SMART person. He is very chill though talkative. Again so good with people. Gentlemen. Both nice to girls and guys even strangers. Performs random kind tasks. Recycles. Hunts fishes fixes cars always helping people and is therefore people.

The tourist attractions of course who doesn't like them right? And then the experience with our pitties. We have three pitbulls now. A little newborn puppy and then we have Old Dixie she's about 13 and we have G he's about mid Age 5 and 1/2. And we take them everywhere with us because that's just what we love to do with them. G's a water dog so he loves the beach and Dixie loves people and she loves to be loved. So taking our dogs definitely amps of the experience. So that's probably my most favorite part about traveling is the unexpected and the spontaneous moments that happen

  Right. Definitely can be challenging at times. It can never just be 100% easy all the time. Like moving? I honestly don't think that's easy for anyone. At least not fully. There's some stresses in moving somewhere. And I tried my very best to forgive people. But I don't give third and fourth and fifth chances I only give you one or two chances and after that that's it. And it depends on what you've done. If you've crossed the line immediately then that's it. But if you haven't crossed that line I'll more than likely will give you a second chance and even if you have crossed that line sometimes I still have nice and try to give Second Chances.

  We got this little angel yesterday! She is just literally a angel. She was found underneath our car while my husband was at work. When he went outside and noticed something under the truck and it was a little baby 6-month week old blue nose reverse brindle. She's like gray with like white brown peach little stripes on her and then she has white spots on her stomach and toes. She's adorable. She's got these crystal blue eyes. She's a cuddle bug. Definitely we were blessed with her. Somebody just dropped her off in the cold to freeze. I never understood how someone could do that to a little baby. I named her Mary Jane because she kind of smelled like some good Mary Jane when we picked her up. Hehe.. Well I guess the person that used to have her smokes a little trees. No judge there. Ended up becoming her name after all. I think it's really pretty. She's just the sweetest. She's a little Rebel too. Haha. Me and my husband really feel like she was blessed in our life. She was put under our car for a reason. That's why we kept her. Plus G my other Pitbull needs a little girlfriend. And then of course we have a Dixie which is his mom off. So now I have three pitbulls LOL three little ones LOL did not expect to get another one last night but am blessed to have her definitely

  I never really played much of the witcher's but I've heard lots of good things about them and I definitely heard that the third one was really good. My husband has played The Witcher and he said it's pretty good. He likes it. But yes we are extremely excited about cyberpunk coming out and us getting to play it. I definitely think it will come out on the release date that is a fact. We have been waiting way too long LOL it's about time!

  All of my pups. They are definitely like children to me. Also my family. I appreciate them. I miss them. I have not got to see them very much this year because it's covid-19. Right now I'm on my way as we speak to go and see my mom and family and friends of course. But as I said before I am very appreciative of having them and being able to go see them because like I said I'm not always able to go see them. But I'm going to spend a few days before, a early Thanksgiving with them and I am thankful for that. Haven't got to see them really at all this year. Better to appreciate the small things in life and things that you can get rather than complaining about absolutely everything and it not being perfect or something.

  It's really nice out here in Mississippi but I would definitely have to say I love living in Louisiana. The people are different. They're very judgmental at the same time. In this area... Like race and stuff. I don't know how to word it. But I grew up here my whole life. Everybody is always fighting. But I grew up in an area where we just accept each other because we grew up together. But there is some touchy places but over all the places great the food is great it's beautiful and you're close to everything. The culture is amazing. I really like Louisiana I miss it. This is where I was born and raised. I definitely recommend that people but be careful because the crime rate is it high and told it is high for no reason. You have to be really careful when living here.

  Working at the store that I do you kind of continuously are always helping people. I talked to a lady that wasn't feeling very well. She's sick... Like... She is old and not doing well... Not like Covid sick.. No. But she touched me with what she said and I think the same thing back I touched her with what I said. So I guess I made someone feel alive today not alone. I guess you could say that's a thing of kindness I did though it's something I do on a regular basis. Talk people and make them feel like someone actually gives a crap about them. Try.

   What makes you happy? Nervous? Alone? Tired?
  ","
  Spending time with friends and being productive makes me happy. Being outside and adventuring makes me happy being able to express myself and be creative makes me happy.
  
  Doing too many things at once makes me nervous and frustrated. Bean talk to buy more than one person makes me really nervous. Being an area with more than 10 people makes me nervous depending on how close they are to me. I don't like being claustrophobic. I don't like it when people touch me.
  
  Alone? Not feeling loved. Not being productive. At least the other people. I like doing things with people. I don't like to sleep alone.
  
  Just draining my brain or my body constantly for hours and hours and hours.

  Only a few select people I called buddy because I don't exactly remember their name but they're always really kind to me and they're kind of close to me because they see me every single day so I call them buddy for short. I'm really terrible at names so I just called them buddy because they're my buddy. I only talked to him for a few seconds. Basically regular customers at my job. They don't mind me calling them buddy because they always say remember me? I'm buddy? And I don't mind if people call me buddy or pal it just depends on who they are. And I don't call too many people pal. I do that more or less as a joke

   what’s your most prized possession? 💎
  ","
  My baby blanket.
  
  A quilt that are my grandmother sewed. And then another quote that my grandmother said that I got from my mom's house. Why so many blankets? Because blankets to make keep you warm. Plus I take the blankets that I sleep with absolutely everywhere and I used to sleep with all of these blankets periodically every single day. Of course because you know... But anyway another price position is something that my grandmother gave me it has the Lord's Prayer in it. It's a necklace that you look inside of that the really really tiny. It's a really really tiny little see-through hole and you look into it and it comes up as a giant prayer. It's pretty much an illusion cross. It's super tiny but when you look inside of it it looks like a giant piece of paper. It's the most fascinating thing I've ever seen in my life. And then I have a box of military things and things that my grandparents gave me. Things that I hold onto to remember them.

  You do 100% from where some companies get their water from. I actually in high school took a separate class 1 Environmental Science and in this class one giant section was on water. Types of water. And the sources on where you get the water. You'd be surprised where some water comes from. Someone is from aquifers under the ground. Some water is pretty much just unfiltered dirty water that has AKA ""nutrients"" in them. Some water is super duper purified and some of it is just partially purified and they just slap a label on it to try and get people to buy it. And especially that wire that is purified where do they get it? You need to go and look up the section yourself and find out yourself. It is appalling to find out where they get their water from sometimes. Considering nobody really owns some of the water lands in certain places. There's a hint. Pretty much everyone for themselves. And just hope they don't use all the water. Pump it all. And then some water has salt in it. A lot. And then other places also. This is just a few. I literally took a class on this. Water is water but it just depends on where you get it and then what is done with it after.

   In your opinion does ask.fm need to fix in order to make this site better?
  ","
  The reporting system and make it to where people that aren't doing anything wrong. They don't get their account shut down. I'm talking about the catfish. The spammers. The scammers. The people that are being violent and posting extremely nasty and inappropriate pictures and comments. And the people that ask inappropriate comments and ask for pictures. There needs to be a better reporting system. Like if somebody report someone 50 times and then you look at the reports and the person isn't doing anything wrong then don't terminate them. But if you see 50 reports and you clearly see on this person's page that they're posting inappropriate things and asking people nasty questions and that they're being violent and showing violent activity then get rid of them. Not the people that are making the side better. Get rid of the ones that are making it worse.

  I like geography Louisiana history and any history class that I took back in middle school because the teacher made it fun. I liked environmental science in high school and geography but I didn't really like the teachers because they were boring and mean so they made me pretty much not like the classes. Fine Arts was a pretty good class to but the classmates were horrible to the teacher so they almost made me not like the class. I literally almost had to beat someone up for harassing the teacher for no reason. They were literally everyday stopping the class from continuing because of their attitude and because they didn't want to learn.

   @blessedwifeyandmommy28
  

  My apologies. I was trying to say not all Spirits are bad. But of course we have that one side of the Paranormal world that is evil. Sorry about my typos I am voicing the text because it's a lot to type
  "
28602,"
   I’ve seen it and have had it happened first hand. Also with a ouiji board. You’re right though. Unless they experience it themselves they will not believe it.  Some spirits aren’t bad though 😊
  ","
  Spirits are bad now but other entities can be harmful. All the researches I've done on Ouija boards. Most of the time people don't play them correctly and bad things come from them. You really have to be aware and careful when using Ouija boards. I have years and years of research and practice in learning how to use a Ouija board properly. I have explained to people so many times how to use them. Properly. And why they shouldn't use. The do's and the don'ts. But there's so many different things about the Paranormal world that are complicated that I'm not going to get into because there's so many different branches and such a long conversation that I would be here for hours explaining it. My years of experience and researching. I would actually just have to be face-to-face with a person to show them how much information I have. It's pretty cool
  "
28603,"
   and I think every person has his or her own path. happiness can be different. most of people want to find their soulmates but some people don't and there's no special person in the world for them. that's not my path but I respect that 😊
  ","
  And that's basically the same thing I just stated above. That's the same way I look at it. Everybody has their own pass that they choose to take in life.
  "
28604,"
   Is it normal to want the people around you to be happy, even if it means being unhappy yourself?
  ","
  Yes I have felt this way but the same time you still need to find that way to make yourself happy also. Because all people deserve happiness
  "
28605,"
   great thoughts. but what about people who found happiness in being single?
  ","
  Good for them. If that's the truth and what they want then they can do whatever they please. Birthday ever so happened to go out and search I definitely think there is a person for every single person in the world. It's up to them to accept it or not. Which is okay

   in my opinion official marriage isn't necessary for everyone. it's OK and I don't mind it for other people, but I don't want it for myself. it doesn't prove love, it's just legal agreement. Also I hate weddings. And what do you think, is it necessary for every couple to get married officially?
  ","
  No I don't think every couple should have to get married no. I never stated that. Do I think everybody has potential to be in love? Like everyone has a soul mate somewhere out there? Yes. Does everyone need to get married? No

   Do you own a cowboy hat?
  ","
  I don't but I have been really wanting to get one but can't find one that looks like it suits me. To be honest it's really hard to find a cowboy cowgirl hat that suits me. I'm not much of a country girl though I do live out in the country and a lot of people probably would call me that I'm more of a Cajun girl so wearing a cowgirl hat but just not look right on me to be honest with you. I don't want to feel like that everyday want to be cowgirl so that's why I don't try to stick to that type of dial. I'm more of a biker tomboy kind of girl. Along the lines of type of dress wear
  "
28613,"
   what is the best age for marriage in your opinion?
  ","
  Honestly as long as you're the age I don't think it really matters as long as you know for sure that you're ready to get married that person, both of you. It's a really important commitment. It's really hard to get out of a marriage than it is to get into a marriage. Buy paper is what I mean. So don't just jump into a relationship and not even wait a couple weeks and then get married. I would probably wait a good couple months at least and get to know the person and their family and how they are and how they live. And just know for sure that you want to be with that person. As long as both of you know for sure that you are ready to get married then I don't see a problem in it. Like I said the legal age of course. Me and Jason knew for sure that we were ready to get married when we were only a year and a half maybe together. But we waited till four years because one money to we just wanted to make sure that we were ready but we were. But we did the right thing I think. Plus there were tons of obstacles and distance in between us. So it was a little hard for us to get married. We wanted to make sure we were together when we got married. Physically in person together. We were in a long distance relationship for 4 and 1/2 years before we permanently we're together and living together. I never regret marrying Jason. He is wonderful and I love him very much. But of course not every relationship works like me and my husband's did. You really need to make sure that you are ready to be with a person. It's an extremely important decision to make in life. And if you want to leave leave. Don't stick around and let them control you.

   You are one of my favorite persons to follow! Not many believe or like the paranormal 😆☺️
  ","
  Thanks! I appreciate the compliment. At one point I didn't believe in it neither. Just at one point in my life I witnessed to certain things and that's what made me believe. Just certain events and things that I have witnessed made me believe. Some people laugh at it. Some people don't believe in it. But that's just because they're Skeptics and they have seen it firsthand. And that's okay.
  
  I have been interested and curious about the Paranormal as young as the age of eight years old. And I have been working in the field since I was around that age also. So it's been a long time since I have been researching the topic. So yeah.

Gives you just enough time to try to get a brunch and and be able to get out and actually see someday time. I usually get up anywhere from 5 in the morning to 1 in the afternoon depending on what I have to do the next day.
  
  I work anywhere from 7 to 10 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon the latest. So yeah. I usually get up every day early. If I'm off I'll probably sleep till 9:10 or 11. If I don't feel well and I just want to stay home and do nothing I'll sleep till 1 or something usually when my husband's home. If he's not I don't like sleeping in

   I have experienced this yesterday and I was upset for it by the person's behavior. but the person is shameless still now.
  ","
  I would have told that person off. Here in America sometimes people can't get a job. Because of homelessness. Once they see that you're homeless they don't want you because they don't see that you're clean they don't see that you're this they don't see that you're that but the thing about it is is the fact that you're even trying to come up there and get a job when it's so hard to get the courage because it's embarrassing to be homeless. To be able to have the courage to go up there and actually try to get a job regardless of what it is and how much it is is the bravest thing you could do and it is a good thing. As long as they're in there trying and they look like they're trying and you see their story maybe try helping them out and really seeing the real person behind the homelessness? Starting on homeless with no money whatsoever is hard especially if you've been homeless for a while. They could have no type of proper clothes for working or maybe even no shoes. Maybe buy them a pair of shoes. Or maybe two or three pairs of socks. Or maybe buy them a pair of khaki pants. Honestly they could be an extremely intelligent person, something just happened. Things happen. Family members died or something... maybe they're handling something in life really hard. People get addictions and then they overcome them... Some don't... Sadly but they still are homeless. Many things can happen. They could get sick. They could be even a veteran... people just want to judge. They never want to look at the big picture or put themselves in someone's shoes. But when they they're homeless they're crying and they're sobbing just like that person was that they were making fun of. Now they will really see what it's like once they get into the situation and then when they get mad when people make fun of them but they were the ones that were making fun of someone else once. Then they will realize but they did was messed up and they should have never did it. Karma is horrible.

  It's just them showing their care for you. At least I care for you. Some kids wish their parents cared.

  Good morning everyone!
  
  I am really excited about today because short noticed a day or two ago I got told that my in-laws are coming over to spend time for Halloween. So I'm really excited and happy today because they are coming in about an hour or so!
  
  I'm going to be saying happy Halloween until probably November 1st so everyone just get over it. Halloween is too short of a holiday to just say it for 1 day so I'm going to say it for the next few days. I love Halloween. It's a good way to spend time with your family and be silly and just have a good time. So I hope everyone else does the same! Have an amazing day

  With the line of work that I am in the Bloody Mary ritual is a ritual and a type of science. We try not to do it because sometimes it can conjure up bad things. In lines of research that I have done. So no I don't actually try to do that. The real actual attempts of it. Especially the negative bad ones. There are bloody mary rituals that can be taking way too far and actually literally conjure bad things that are near to impossible to get rid of. Because the bad thing is there's no reverse with the rituals. Once you do it it's there. There's no going back. Reversing it

  I don't know how many people have been around for the start of Justin Bieber. When he just first became a thing. He was extremely young. So he never really got to live an actual natural life for long. Once you're as famous as he is there is no going back. It was young and talented and that's what happened. Fame and money. But in the song and I'm going to post below is his real thoughts on it. Even though you have all that thing in money does it mean that you're happy it really means that you're really lonely. People aren't going to listen and people aren't going to be there for you as properly as you think they would. But this song right here. I have been here since day one. I have always been a fan of him. A huge fan of his actions? No. Just because he was really young and around the same age as me when I found out that he got famous at the same age. I know for sure he wishes he could go back though he doesn't take any of the fame and love for granted though I think he really doesn't miss his old life. A life without judgment. A life without criticism. If you have been here since day one for him you will understand this video. If you haven't put yourself into his shoes. What would you do if you were 11-13 years old and a kid and got famous? Yeah. There. Look at that.

I like it but the bad part is a lot of people don't click and that's the only thing I don't like about it but I do like the way it look I will agree. Doesn't crowd up the page so much. Some people go on for thousands of questions talking with people. Which is a bad it's just a good way to have the page looking if you're going to do that. Because I have done that myself.

  I really love to embrace the rain. Listen to the sound of it. The wind. Sometimes I like to go out in it. Stand under the porch and sometimes reach my hand out and just feel it. I never wear a coat when it's raining because I never stay out and it too long. I either run out to my car and of course when I eventually get to my destination I hurry inside but I honestly embrace it when I am out in the rain because I just love the rain. I love to hear thunder. It's just something different with the day. Adds character. Lately we haven't really been getting a lot of rain which is sad but it's okay. We're about to get another hurricane down here. But you would be surprised how to some people how much the rain means to them. Some people are not able to see the sky and Rain like we are able to. And they appreciate just that small thing. Being able to witness it. It's just something I don't take for granted. I love the rain. ❤

And then I'll probably put tools in there because it seems like nobody uses them anymore and I'm sure in 35 years they will be considered ancient old school artifacts or something lol XD

   What is the worst thing someone can do that isn’t illegal?
  ","
  This isn't the worst but this is pretty horrible and messed up. Shooting a dog just because it doesn't know any better and it came over to your house and it is trying to play with your chickens. Shooting it and trying to mame it and hurt it when not even realizing that it's someone's loved pet and it actually happens to be a little girl's pet. Horrible. All they had to do was come over and tell the neighbor that their dog was in their yard messing with their livestock. Chickens that maybe cost $0.50 to a dollar that were bought. They're going to slaughter the chickens. They're not even that important. But let's kill a expensive loved animal that is a little girls dog because you are a evil person. I never understood how people work. Now there are thousands of little pellets in this dog's body and they are going to have to take each and every one of them out of him. He is literally the sweetest dog in the world and it never hurt a fly. All he wanted to do is play with the chickens. And of course we have people like this in the world that can't physically walk themselves over and verbally speak about the manor. Even maybe call the police? But have to shoot the animal? I do not feel like that as the answer whatsoever.

I'm not sure what you guys know me by or not but I'm sure you guys know me by singing for sure and paranormal investigation. And researching. Another few hobbies that I really like I enjoy drawing painting and wood burning. These are things throughout my life I love to do off and on. With singing. I say for many schools events funerals football games parties weddings all kinds of different things. I have done this throughout my life. I also have even let a choir at a school for a few years. I really really enjoyed this in loved it. Another thing that I really like that I haven't physically been able to get into but I have been researching it is Gem mining. Another one magnet fishing. These are two things that I would absolutely love to physically get into doing. I also left playing sports as a child. Volleyball and soccer being my favorites and then I also played basketball and baseball. If I had to say the number one sport that I was best at was volleyball. Being the team captain for 2 years and playing for almost seven to eight years of volleyball I almost went professional. A couple injuries happened and that's why I did not go professional. I also used to write poetry and some songwriting with a very close friend of mine while I was at the peak of my singing. Over the years I have been moving a lot and haven't been doing as much as I used to but I still love to sing. I don't do much songwriting anymore like I used to but I still every now and then like to pick up a book and write something down. I also love to cook. This is something that my family culture and everything has always been into. I love cooking things for people and then seeing their reactions. Smiles. Also gaming. These are some of the things that I love to do.

   Do you do henna often? 
You must be an artist or super creative 😊
  ","
  Myself? Sometimes. Not too often though because it is very tedious. I do love art though. I love to woodburn. I really been wanting to get into wood carving. It's kind related to wood-burning, you can associate for two together and make beautiful art out of there. These two things are very popular around where I live. I also love oil paints and acrylic. Sometimes I do it'll. More of a landscape painter more than anything. And really neat abstract. And then I love interior designing. Decorating houses and different types of places. More better at just on and I'm going to building them though but I can design the builds.
  
  This is one of my henna tattoos I got done around getting engaged, got it done at a Renaissance Festival. This really awesome girl did it for me. It's a really beautiful elephant. Loved it and still love it.

  You're okay. I totally took it as you being curious. You're fine. I like it when people ask me about my tattoos. Especially about the stories because they're really special. I don't ever get something on me unless it's extremely special. I put a lot of thought and meaning into the tattoos on me. I love henna as well. I don't know if you've ever had that done before. Henna tattoos are the best! Especially because you can get something outrageous and it go away in about a month.

  This world is so crazy I at least keep my phone on me for emergency purposes but there's plenty of times where I don't get on my phone but maybe once a day for an hour if that.

Especially if I don't have time to really check much I just kind of peek at them but there are many days that I don't spend time on my phone.

   Now I'm teaching you how to make a Cheesy jalapeno Mexican cornbread with your chili.
  ","
  This is also a continuation from the last question. And to this thread.
  
  After I ate at the jalapeno. I had two dashes of salt I add 3 tablespoons of butter depending on how sweet you want your cornbread to be. 2 is okay. Usually you will use a cast iron skillet to make your cornbread. You want a small cast iron skillet to make your cornbread about 1 in tall. You were going to want to take a stick of butter and rub it on the cast iron skillet walls and on the floor of the cast iron skillet. Why? This acts as vegetable oil and also taste better instead of using regular vegetable oil. Rub it densely against the sides of the cast iron skillet. You're going to want to chop up an egg add milk according to the Jiffy box instructions go ahead and additionally I had a half a teaspoon of sugar to your cornbread. Then add a 16 oz of shredded cheese usually sharp cheddar to your cheesy cornbread. Now that you have the jalapeno all of the ingredients on the back of the Jiffy box the cheese the sugar and the salt added you can cook this cornbread from 20 minutes to 30 minutes in the oven until the top of the corn bread becomes brown and the inside of it isn't too mushy.
  
  You can also eat mild Cajun chili with some corn chips. And some extra cheese if you really want. And then of course you have your cheesy jalapeno cornbread! Bon appetit!
  "
28895,"
   Continued chili making and cornbread.
  ","
  When you go to try the chili. It needs to taste really strong. It's probably going to need some salt. This is when you add your salt. It's at again. You don't want to add enough salt to your taste but just enough to where you almost need more. If you salt your food too much it might be more/too salted for someone else. So very carefully add your salt. The thing about it is when you go to try your chili you need to sit there and really think what it's missing. Is it missing some more garlic powder? Is it missing some more chili powder? Do I need to add a little bit more salt? Does it need more tony chachere's? Do I need more bell pepper? You go ahead and you add what you want. If it tastes fine then eat it. But the thing about it is you really need to sit and think. Is it missing anything? If you add any seasoning to your chili make sure you mix it and let cook for another 5 minutes to let the seasonings that you added additional to melt into your chili and keep mixing it off and on for the next five minutes.
  
  Say for instance you're done with your chili right? You need something else to eat with it. How about cheesy jalapeno cornbread. To make that I get the regular cornbread Jiffy from the store if it sells around where you live. I follow the instructions and then I add one tablespoon without the juice of pre-packaged cut up jalapenos. You can get them in a jar on the aisle at the store usually or in a can. If you get fresh jalapenos be careful when you cut them because they can cause acid burns your fingers. Use gloves and make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap after. Only add one medium sized jalapeno to your cornbread if you use fresh jalapenos

  Go ahead and add your three or four cans of beans.
  
  It doesn't really matter how many cans of beans you get as long as you get enough. Three or four cans. Just don't get only kidney beans and only chili beans unless you have to.
  
  Again you can go ahead and add the beans to your ground beef and vegetables and Seasonings.
  
  Mix it together really really well. And if your chili is not watery enough then you need add a little more water or go ahead and add all of the kidney bean juice. It's your opinion on what you want to do with your chili. If you want your chili more dry then you don't have to add any more water or any of the canned beans juice. But honestly I would recommend having your chili a little watery. Especially if you're going to be eating it with chips corn chips or corn bread. So if you want to have it watery go ahead and add one cup of hot water to your chili. With the beans vegetables seasoning and the beans juice that you already have in the pot. Go ahead and mix your Chilli together. Mix it extremely well for about 2 to 3 minutes. Leave it on a really good temperature that it's boiling on. Let It boil for about 5 to 10 minutes with all of the seasoning and vegetables in it. Make sure it doesn't get dry and burn. Add more water as you can to make sure it stays watery. You should be able to see the water at the top of your chili. That's usually the density that you want. Make it a little soupy. Barely tho...
  
  And go ahead and try it. When you add the beans make sure that you try to crush up some of the beans in your chili. Why? It will add texture color and make the chili taste better with the inside of the beans mashed up inside of the chili. It really does matter if you crush up some of your beans. Not all of them. Just as you started maybe smash him up against the wall of the chili pot.
  
  Will continue...
  "
28897,"
   This will continue. Chili seasonings.
  ","
  This is a continuation to Cajun chili seasoning adding.
  
  After you add the garlic ingredients seasonings.
  
  If you have to dried crushed bell pepper you can add a little bit more if you would like. Even though it's dried it's going to read marinate and become a different texture in your soup with the juices. So don't be alarmed by the heart pieces of bell pepper.
  
  You're going to want to add the two chili packets that you bought from the store and then add a couple dashes of the regular chili powder that you have. Maybe four or five dashes. Not too much just enough.
  
  Depending on if you bought fresh cilantro or in the bottle cilantro. If you bought regular cilantro cut you up about four or five pieces and put it in the chilling. If you want to add six pieces of cilantro you can. Fresh cilantro is stronger than in the bottle cilantro. So be careful with the fresh cilantro adding. If you have dried cilantro from the store off of the baking Isles then you can add a full teaspoon of cilantro.
  
  You are going to want to get two cans of regular kidney beans any size it doesn't matter light kidney beans dark kidney beans it doesn't matter you can mix it up. And you're going to want to get two cans of regular chili beans. It should just say chili beans on the can. If you don't have chili beans in your area just get four cans of kidney beans. If you don't have kidney beans in your area than just get three or four cans of regular chili beans. The only reason why you don't want to get too many chili beans is because they come with the chili flavor in the can. Regular kidney beans come with a more Bean taste. That's why you want to mix them together.
  
  So you have four cans of beans? Or 3. How ever much beans you want in your chili really.
  
  You want to drain half of the juice out of each can. You don't want to add all of the juice to your chili. If you want to you can but I would recommend raining at least a quarter or half of the cans juice from each can.
  
  Will continue
  "
28898,"
   Seasonings... Chili
  ","
  Salt at the beginning you're really not going to add this first. But if you really want to go ahead and add it. Don't even put 1/4 of a teaspoon in your chili at start. So maybe just a dash or two of salt . A dash basically meaning one or two good shakes.
  
  You're going to want to put a decent amount of pepper. Probably a half a teaspoon.
  
  Crushed red pepper you're probably going to need to put half a teaspoon of crushed red pepper. Maybe a couple more dashes after the half a teaspoon. The red pepper really gives the chili a wonderful taste. I promise you put it in there it will not be that hot. It will add a little taste spice but that's it.
  
  The next thing that you're going to add is Tony chachere's if you're stores sell it around there. You're going to want to add probably a half a teaspoon of Tony chachere's.
  
  If you sell Slap Your Mama seasoning you probably are going to want to do about three dashes of slap your Mama seasoning.
  
  If you were able to find the minced garlic in your store put a teaspoon of minced garlic in your chili. You're also going to want to add a dash of garlic powder. And if you were able to find The Garlic hot sauce put 2 tablespoons of garlic hot sauce in your chili. Don't get mixed up with tablespoons and teaspoons. Teaspoon smaller than a tablespoon. Teaspoons are usually associated with seasonings. Tablespoons can be also but they are larger than teaspoons.
  
  This will continue on.

   This is a continuation on how to cook Cajun chili and cornbread on the side.
  ","
  So the type of seasonings that you're going to want for this chili. Usually I get to pre-made chili packets from the store when I make about 3 lb of ground beef chili. So get two of them. Just in case get a thing of chili powder. It comes in a premade bottle. Get that just in case if it's not chili tasting enough. You can add that and it's pretty much the same thing in the chili packets. The next type of seasonings are going to want is of course salt pepper red pepper chips. I promise they're not that hot get them they add flavor to the ground beef. You're going to want dry bell peppers if your store has them. If not the one that you cut up should be enough. You're going to want to get cilantro parsley Tony chachere's if your store sells it this is the best in chili. You can also buy it online from Louisiana products sell stores. Are you suggesting called Cajun sauce. This is a special ingredient that you're only able to actually get from the stores in south Louisiana. So unfortunately you're not going to be able to add this. But it's okay. Are you the garlic tasting hot sauce. As long as you don't put a lot of the hot sauce it won't make the chili hot. It will only add flavor and make it mild. You're going to need garlic powder or minced garlic. Slap Your Mama seasoning if you have it where you live. You're going to need cayenne pepper. And I think that's all of the seasoning that I use.
  
  And of course you're going to have to carefully add till taste.
  
  But if I had to be exact on how much of each one I put in there I will describe it for you.
  
  This will continue on...

   This is a continuation to my recipe for Cajun mild chili and Mexican jalapeno cheesy cornbread.
  ","
  As you're letting the ground beef cook down. Keep focusing back and forth on your vegetables and of course your ground beef.
  
  After about 30 minutes of letting your vegetables cook down they should be done. You can actually poke them with stuff and see if there mushy. Do you want them to all be mushy. If they're not mushy keep cooking them until they get to this texture.
  
  So say that you are done with the marinating of the vegetables and that you are done with your ground beef cooking down. If you want to add a few spices to your ground beef you can. If you want to wait until you add everything you also can. You just might have to let everything cook down for about 30 minutes in the end. It's very important to stir your pot and let it cook about 30 minutes after you put everything in. This helps the seasoning cook into the juices and all of the ingredients inside of the pot. It helps them all infused and taste correctly.
  
  So you can go ahead and add your ground beef to your vegetables that you marinate it for about 30 minutes or so and got them to a mushy texture.
  
  So now you just mix it together really well. Now you only have ground beef and well cut up vegetables.
  
  You can start seasoning everything now. This is your first attempt to seasoning. You are not going to get correct the first time. You really need to know your seasonings. You don't want to add too much of something too strong. It's sometimes part 2 fix a pot after adding too much of something. You really want to focus and make sure you don't add any salt really. When you're adding the other seasonings sometimes they have salt in them. Do you want to wait till the end add salt.
  
  This will again. Continue. Not only am I putting the ingredients but I'm telling you how to do it as well. Trying to show you the technique. If you don't know then you're really not going to know how to do it. So I hope you enjoy reading on.

   This is a continuation to show you what I put in my chili and my corn bread.

  This is a recipe to my
  
  🔻Cajun Mild Tasting Chili.🔺
  
  Feeding about 3 to 5.
  
  So the first thing that you're going to want is about 3 lb of ground beef.
  
  In one pot you're going to Brown the ground beef.
  
  In a separate pot there is a such thing called at the store as all seasoning bags. They're on the frozen aisle where the vegetables are. It's already cut frozen seasoning bags. The frozen bag will read celery onion and bell pepper in it.
  
  If your store does not sell this then I recommend you getting a medium sized onion. I'm medium size bell pepper. And then you need to get three or four celery sticks and green onions and cut them off very well and put them in the chili. You're not going to need a lot of green onion. Just enough. You can never put too much onion bell pepper celery green onion in your chili. So it doesn't matter how much you put. Just make sure that you put enough. By the way if you don't like these types of vegetables it doesn't matter because once you put them in your chili they're going to condense in and you're not even going to realize that they're in your chili. Just try it and go with it and you will see what I mean.
  
  Now don't add this to your ground beef. You want to cook this in a separate pot and marinate your vegetables down before you add them to anything. For about 30 minutes you want to put your vegetables on high. You want to put your vegetables in that pot as soon as it gets hot enough and you want to add 3 tablespoons of butter water and olive oil. Every time your vegetable start to get dry out a little bit more water. Do you want to let these vegetables marinade really really well. The smell will be wonderful as you wait.
  
  As you're focusing on the vegetables your ground beef will be able to cook down. Make sure that you mix it periodically as you're trying to focus on the vegetables you don't want to burn your ground beef. You don't even want to cook it on high. Just slowly cook it.
  
  This will continue on...

   Omg.. That sounds amazing! 😍 Could you post the recipes?! (Especially for the bread)
  ","
  So what I do for the chili. It is a lot of ingredients. And honestly all of the seasoning is by taste. So as long as you have a very strong tasting. It's going to be a good chili. Another thing is people get so nervous about making it too spicy or hot really more or less. Spicy isn't really hot. It's just your tolerance on what you can handle when you eat it more or less. Hot is hot. So I never understood why people say spicy is hot? Maybe it's just a different opinion. I respect that.
  
  But anyway.
  
  Here's the main things I put in my chili.
  
  It also depends on how much you want to make. Do you want to make enough for yourself only? Do you want to make enough for three people? Or do you want to make enough for like a party size of 10? It just depends. Because then it gets harder to cook it when you get into the bigger quantities. I'm going to tell you how much to make for three people which honestly it's enough for 5 but really and truly if you really like the taste of your chili it's only going to last you maybe two days. I'm going to explain to you what I put in my chili and the next thread.

  ","
  - paperwork and you have to talk to the right kind of people. Once you start getting everything together you need to be really cautious and careful when you move to a new country especially by yourself. And you have to learn to fit in. If you make it obvious that you're from another country then people might judge you and not help you. There's nothing wrong with being yourself but unfortunately if you really want to fit in and get a job and be able to do stuff like everyone else can around the area you really have to try to accustom yourself to the area. They want bilingual and intelligent people. So when you move to that country you really have to understand their language. You also have to know the slang. But it is very nice here but I'm not going to tell you that it's 100% safe in the USA. Anywhere you go is going to be nasty and there's going to be nasty people. Unfortunately. But we are very free here and you did a lot of opportunities here. And I can understand why you want to come here. But like I said before I would definitely try to look and go into Canada first and then maybe a year or so later try to come to the USA if you really want to. It's probably going to be a lot before you can come to the USA but at least you can start today and try to make your way to your goal. You have to start somewhere

  ","
  I'm not 100% on the details on how it works to move from one country to another but I can tell you this... I have a friend that lives in Brazil or really, he grew up there. Well the part of Brazil that he lives in is really horrible violence and there's a lot of really bad people that live there. Not everyone and Brazil is bad, no. But where he is from it is really bad. You can't even go to the grocery store and back safe. This makes him feel really upset. So he tried to move to Saudi Arabia. It was worse there...but! he found really good work... unfortunately it got really bad and he didn't like it and he also really missed his family. After about four five or even six years of living in Saudi Arabia he moved back to Brazil. It's still really bad there and he would like to move again. But this time he wants to move to the USA. He tried to look into moving to the USA. He tried talking to me about it but I knew nothing about it. I befriended him because he seems like a really nice person. I have been trying to help him learn English so when he does try to come to an English-speaking country he's able to at least know the basics. I have been teaching him English for about 3 years now. He tried to look into moving to America and it's way harder to move here then to the other place where he's trying to move to now which is Canada. I say the same for you. I would try to move to Canada before trying to move the USA. It's not a one or two-day process it might not even be a one or two-year process. But you might as well go ahead and start now. Time will help. You need to stay in school and keep making money. Unfortunately that's how this world Works. Everybody Time will help. You need to stay in school and keep making money. Unfortunately that's how this world Works. Everybody wants money. Plane tickets cost money. But it's nothing impossible to save up for.

  I mean I'm sure I have had some do this. Sometimes people don't even say nothing when they do it. That's the really creepy people that you have to watch out for. Is The Quiet Ones. But I'm sure I've had many do this. But be very careful some people are crazy especially if you never really got to 100% get to know them if you know what I mean. And it was a short relationship or something. I gladly never had this happen really. It was always a long-term relationship. But like I said I'm not sure if they even did this to me but I'm sure they have. I have never done it to someone that's for sure. But if you're being harassed by someone and it starts to seem a little scary and threatening you need to really contact your authorities and make sure that they need to be told to leave you alone if not get a restraining order or something. Stay safe and good luck!

  I will answer the first question. No not every educated person is smart. It depends on how you do it all and how you feel about it all if that makes any sense. I know some people that have went to college for 8 to 10 years and some of them are still as narrow as a dang... Idk.. It's just bad.. or they might be super intelligent but don't have a single emotional thoughts of their selves. Or their narrow-minded or they're just straight up rude and forget their morals they were taught growing up by their parents or they forget the people feel. They just act like they're perfect and that everyone around them has to be the same way. If that makes any sense

   How do you let go of someone you love so much?
  ","
  Depends if you mean a family member or if you mean.. like a boyfriend... Or even a husband.  like through a divorce or even losing them, like them passing...
  
  Because if you mean a family member sometimes it's just really hard the loss of a family member. And you really never let go of the situation. It's usually always hurts. Only time can heal.
  
  If you mean like a boyfriend from them cheating or you just don't want to be together with them eventually you will move on to bigger and better things.
  
  If you mean through a divorce sometimes that can take longer but you still move on eventually. Heartbreak can really last a while. Months.. years... Longer.... :(
  
  And then if you mean if you lose somebody. Like you lose your husband. That's extremely hard. It does go away kind of but not fully ever. Again time can only heal. Mourning the loss of a very close loved one like that is really hard. I could never imagine losing Jason. It would take me a very long time to even slightly heal from something like that.
  
  But there's a few different views on this kind of question. Hopefully I answered it right in some way.

   If  Michael Myers was coming after you, what would you do?.

  I would feel really bad for him. I promise you. He wouldn't make it with me and how I know how to defend myself. Walking up on an Americans redneck/cajun bayou home is like digging your own grave. 😆 Good luck.
  
  We are used to these types of wild animals listed bellow.
  
  - Insane and out-of-control wild boars in which they are overpopulated down here. What makes them so dangerous? They have the sharpest Tusk they can get up to 500 pounds and they're extremely fast and usually run in packs.
  
  - Humongous Panthers -
  
   Extremely vicious fast selfie and they are huge. MEAN MEAN and do not fear nearly anything.
   
   - We do have Bears out here.
   
   - Giant coyote packs.
   
   - Large mean deer.
   
   - Bobcats.
   
   - Mean birds and more

  I used to go out with a hold my breath longer than a minute it was like a minute and in like something seconds I can't remember we used to do challenges to see who could go into the water longer. Definitely as I get older it just seems like my lungs are losing practice. Plus I have a singer's voice and you have to learn how to hold your breath a lot while singing so I guess that has a lot to do with it with helping me. I find it fun swimming and to be able to hold your breath for a while definitely comes in handy.

  Good morning.
  
  I just don't understand why people ask such questions. And then judge people for their answers especially. That's why I don't answer these questions. Plus I don't really get into the politics anyway much here in America because it just always leads to arguments and drama. I was raised to not even talk about political views because that's all it ever did was a ride arguments. Especially in today's age nobody knows how to have a proper conversation with real based facts and then not get offended and just respect persons answer they just want to get angry and tell them they're wrong about everything. That's why I just don't talk about these types of things especially on the internet to people that I don't really know 100%. Because you're just going to get label into a group based off of your answer because they don't know you. They're just going to mention the obvious or what they think is the obvious. Every year I get mom or dad with questions like this and I just don't answer them. I have never really gotten into the political system. I don't want to. Because once again it just causes arguments. And as I said before no one just can have a regular conversation about something without getting angry. So yeah. 🤷

  Cause I don't try to cussInfront of anyone really but slang. My culture is sland. Coona-- French has nothing but slang in it. So we all kinda speak slang in my family all the time. Can't help it. Just apart of us and how we are.

   How is working in the paranormal field?
  ","
  Year-round me and the team I work around in research different locations and learn the history on them and then we go and visit their locations and investigate and just check out the places. We use different types of paranormal tools to investigate the area. Try to prove whether or not the area really is living up to its standards of what's going on around there. Try to understand what's going on and why it's there. What kind of entity is there. And just try to give people answers to unanswered questions. It's more or less just a hobby, but it's definitely work at the end of the day. It's something I really enjoy doing especially with friends and family. It is a really good hobby to get into. But you really have to know what you're doing you can't just go into it blind. People can most definitely come along for the ride but there's no guarantee that everything is going to work out the way that they want. Everything is very unexplained and unexpected. Crazy. Can get dangerous at times. But in all is just a rush.
  
  I've been researching the Paranormal and many different other subjects around the Paranormal for over thirteen years now. It is something I'm very into and curious about.

  1st of all. Good morning you guys. Srry I haven't been on much. I have been working like crazy and am a little sick. I am trying to get back. But anyway. Good morning.
  
  _
  
  2nd of all. I would like to comment on a few things I have been seeing.
  
  I think it's funny when people ask why I spend so much time on here but my late post under this one I am answering now says, ""12 hours ago."" Last time I was on was 12 hours ago. Half a day away. I was asleep.
  
  And then I worked everyday this week. Actually I worked almost 12 days in a row. I work anywhere from 5 in the mornings till like 6 in the afternoon. I might get on and say good morning and answer a question or two if I get the chance. Because I am busy at work or doing something at home. Like cooking or cleaning or just doing something important. But from 5am to 6pm in the afternoon is again almost 12 hours. A full half a day. I only really get to come on one good time in the afternoon on here and I don't always have time to do everything.. Like both answer and send questions out, because I follow so many people. But it's the fact that I came on is all that counts.
  
  I know there is a few jealous and no lifey people on here that wanna ask mean or stupid questions... Like.. Why are you on all the time? When in fact I'm not. I can't be. I would like to come on maybe more. But I will say, I am daily active. But just like with any other app other people choose to get on everyday. I choose this one. This is a little hobby/journal of mine. Instead of paper. I choose this as my paper. And again like any of app you or someone may choose to get on alot on. I choose this one, though I am not even able to get on but every now and then throughout the day, when I can, that is all that counts. And is fine.
  
  If you don't like me. Idky but you don't have to follow nor talk to me.
  
  Here's a question for you.
  
  Why do you sit on apps and ask people that aren't bothering youstupid useless questions for no reason? Try that one. 👍

Talked 247 and got to know anything and everything about ourselves. Met months later and it was like we knew each.other all along. It was special, yet crazy. He made me crazy.

I'm finally verified and I am absolutely excited and happy. They have been wanting to verify me for a while. And I am very excited to be. You guys made me to this point and I just want to thank each and everyone of you for this gift because if it wasn't for you guys I wouldn't be verified. And I greatly appreciate it.

But if I'm right I'm just going to explain to you what I'm talking about and if you don't believe me oh well. 🤷 Don't understand. Oh well. I ain't got time for that. People will learn in the end if I'm truly correct. But that's not always the case either. Even when I think I'm right sometimes that's not always the case either. We're only human though. We all make mistakes.

  like I said to someone else this morning. This year just all-around has not been a good year. Ever since I lost my grandmother in November 2019 since that it seems like everything is just been getting worse and not better. Everyone has been going through a lot and it's really hard to get through a passing of a family member especially someone very close to you. The best thing I could say to you is try everything you can remember the good memories about down and not to forget them and to remember that they're in a better place and that they're not suffering. As I said before it's not easy to get over a death in the family at all. If anything you never get over it it's always there. Again the best thing to do is to remember the great things. Only time can heal such... I will pray for you and send positive vibes your way. And sincere condolences to you and your family and their family. For this is a sad time for all of you.. ❤🙏😔

   Hi. How common is PDA (public display of affection.... such as holding hands, hugging or kissing) in the country where you live? Are you pro or against it? There is no wrong or right answer to this, I just want to know your opinion. Ta😊
  ","
  I mean mostly in schools and that work this kind of thing is regulated. If you're at home or on your own walking in public as long as you're not taking it too far and you're being appropriate a kiss or a hug or a hand holding isn't really that bad. Even cuddling and holding each other close while walking isn't that bad of course the whole covid-19 and social distancing is important but if you're always around that person anyway and know where they've been and who they've been around honestly there some sort of a loophole for that person with you. Spanish always remember that there's kids probably watching and that you shouldn't be too inappropriate because they could be seeing your actions. Some people say I don't care sometimes kids don't understand that stuff and it's better for us to try to be appropriate about it and keep it at a minimal especially in school because they're trying their best practice social distancing and it being safe from getting sick of covid-19. They don't know where you have been but all they know is you are around a lot of kids in which you don't know where they have been and you don't realize that you could be getting sick and not even know it. So it's better to just try to space ourselves out and social distance anyway and try not to show any sort of PDA in school towards anyone
  "

It has been so hard... :( It's all good though. She isn't hurting anymore and she's with my Paw paw, so I know she's happy. For sure.

  Eh.. depends on where you are at because the laws are different everywhere. But usually you're not allowed to do any type of street racing whatsoever.

But if you're racing at a race track and you have all the right licenses and permissions you should be able to race regardless.

When you originally texted me this 6 hours ago around 6 or 5 p.m. from 12 p.m. till then I was just getting done eating Chinese food and going out with family to flea markets going to the Harley place to get fitted for helmets and getting a motorcycle jack.
  
  Today was very fun and productive. I enjoyed it a lot.

  Yeah you should check it out on YouTube. It's actually a really good way of keeping the environment safer and cleaning up. Getting metal and things that shouldn't be in the water out so they don't pollute the water further than they already have. It's also exciting because you never know what you get. It also can be really dangerous so be careful with some of the things that you may pull up. But again those things shouldn't be in the water either. Basically picking up litter that other people have thrown in the water

  ","
  I have been chased by many different dog's and had to nearly defend myself. I have had dogs bite me but not chased me and then bite me.
  
  I have one dog follow me home and I didn't realize he was following me and when I I got off my bike put my bike up I noticed he was behind me and I didn't know whether or not he was nice or not but I had a weapon on me just in case and I already had it drawn. I have never drawn a weapon so fast in my life because I really thought I was about to get attacked. I waited a second and checked his demeanor and he seemed like he was okay so I put it away so I wouldn't seem like I was scaring him and called him over and he came up to me and he was just the sweetest. I was so relieved that he wasn't mean. I almost wanted to keep him. He was a stray Pitbull the sweetest. Someone's in the neighborhood. Sometimes random dogs are the nicest and sometimes they're not but you always have to be aware and still careful.

   How do you discover this paranormal places or people who need help?
  ","
  I go to different locations that have had things happen and people pass and learn the history and what happened there and do investigations to see if the Paranormal there really is there. It's very interesting. You're very curious when you go to these places. Sometimes people mess with things are not supposed to and sometimes they need guidance and I have been researching for over 14 years and I have a lot of experience and knowledge in this field to be able to try to guide these people and help them. Sometimes people get themselves in the wrong positions and mess with the things. Sometimes people need things explained to them a certain way so they understand the severity.
  
  A lot of the time it's a learning experience and you see different things. Witnessing the things. Being able to see them first-hand and proved that something's there and the evidence is showing. It's really hard to explain because there's just so much to it. I've been doing this for like ever.

   Whats woodburn?
  ","
  This is wood burning. When burning is when you use a tool that is a little hot and it's in the shape of kind of like a pen and there are many different types of pens you can use for different effects. When it gets really hot it burns the wood and you can create art with it you can also do wood carving and carve out certain things. This is one of the pieces that I did. For me and my husband. But wood burning is a really easy and simple hobby you can get into the kits are only $10 to $40 depending on what kind you want to get it and how many pieces you want. But I have wood burned quite a few different pieces. It's very enjoyable. Of course it can be a little dangerous but honestly just don't touch the burner and your fine. It is a forum of woodworking kind of in a way but wood-burning added on

  And then on the sorry I do paranormal research and adventure and go to different locations and learn the history and help people. That's something I just kind of do for fun and as a hobby. And other Hobbies of course and I enjoy doing them too. I also sing game and love to woodburn.
  
  We clean even more than we did before and we have to wear masks continuously and apply sanitizer a lot to ourselves and to a different surfaces even more than we already did before. We have to practice social distancing and we cannot be hugging and touching a lot. People don't really go out a lot or go anywhere or to events anymore like we used to.
  
  Lately it has been seeing that it has been calming down though and that's good.

  This isn't exactly the funniest but it was funny to me and her at least I watched it happen. This lady thought my friend was pregnant and she wasn't. Isn't. She's just a little tubby LOL and she said no I'm just fat LOL. I thought it was funny because how she said it back and I told her you're not either! you're just curvy LOL she's really not even that big LOL but we just thought it was funny and laugh together. Definitely a huge misunderstanding and the lady was totally innocent and thought she really was pregnant and was going to congratulate her.

  That's really really neat. It's so nice to hear other people's hobbies because people have such different hobbies. That's really cool that you would like to do that. I like to perform on stage too though I can get a little scared sometimes I still find a rush and it when I do it. I have been in a movie before but I was in the background performances and I was in like 8 to 12 different scenes. I can't remember. Movie called my heart. It was really fun and we worked for like twelve straight hours.
  
  But yeah that's really neat. I can definitely see covid-19 doing in the way of that. I haven't performed that much on stage. But I used to canter for a church for a few years other than that I sang at a bar every now and then on stage. And if sang the national anthem a few times at different places and sang at funerals and stuff like that. Few parties. For schools colleges and more. I love to sing. That's probably my most favorite hobby.
  
  But I hope that covid-19 calms down so you can get out and do your hobbies and be happy!

  No not really you just all-around look like you are young.

   Why do humans have such a strong urge to distract ourselves from the real world?
  ","
  I guess just because there's so much bad and craziness going on in the world some people want to separate that and their lives that they want to have. They don't want to reach towards reality or maybe just not all the way. Maybe some. Sometimes they want to have something different and feel that they can do anything regardless of how crazy this world is how many obstacles are in the way.
  
  Like gaming. You can go on there and build a house with some games. And then again you can get unrealistic and have a dragon as a pet or have a child that is half angel or something.
  
  Some people just really want to disconnect from the real world sometimes. To really feel like they're living.

   What’s the most interesting documentary that you have seen ?
  ","
  I don't know who exactly consider this a documentary or not but I kind of do and you probably could see why I think that. If you haven't remembered the Ariel Castro incident you really should go and look it up and watch a few videos on it and what happened. I find that documentary extremely intriguing and crazy. I feel so horrible for the victims that were in that whorehouse. Here is a summary of what I am talking about. Basically three people were kidnapped at honestly a pretty young age. One being 14 one being 17 and the other being 21. They were taken and held captive for as long as 12 10 years. They were lured into this house by this predator and were then on tortured and some of the most craziest and horrible ways you could ever imagine. If you are very sensitive to certain situations and stories I would not recommend you looking up the story. But just to hear it and prepare yourself for some of the craziest things that happened in the world I recommend looking it up. It is crazy will you here in these girls have went through. As crazy as one of them giving birth to the Predators child. Check it out. After 12 years 10 years they escaped and made it out. That's the good news and they are happy strong and doing good now today

  I've only ever have one and it was pretty funny. Sweet and funny. Out on the Levee wall in Louisiana and I was looking at some barges and we were talking about the barges as he was getting the ring ready and getting down on one knee and then he asked me right there but the reason why he asked me right there is because that was my grandfather's favorite place to walk back and forth with my grandmother and so that spot was very special to me and my grandfather used to watch the barges go back and forth and I always said I wanted to get married right there so we pretty much kind of did if you think about it in a way but it was funny because we were looking at a metal garbage barge and then right after you asked me and in which it was sweet and funny

   Can you tolerate unmanageable restless kids of your guest in your house?
  ","
  Like having five to 15 year olds just running around the house not sleeping for days at a time while I'm trying to get sleep and they're making noise? Absolutely not. There will be a bedtime. And it would be understandable. It wouldn't be like 6 PM. It would be like 9 or 10 p.m. where everyone has to lay down and be quiet at least. Nobody has to go to sleep but if you're going to be loud that is not okay. You are welcome in my house but you must follow the basic rules of being in anyone's house. And that is being quiet when the Sun goes down because others may be sleeping. Just because you're not sleeping doesn't mean others aren't. So no if someone was to have their kids over at my house and they would be loud I would not allow them back over unless they told me for sure that their kids would listen to the rules. You must respect people when you go to their home. You are the company but at the same time you still need to respect the owner's requests.

  This is actually a really hard question to answer because there are so many different types of people on this Earth and there are so many different types of mindsets says if you really think about it.
  
   There could just be one little small thing different about someone's mindset and that's a different mindset. I just really think people need to just be chill and go with the flow and just be kind to people.
   
    Understand common sense and react off of that. If you know something's bad, don't do it. If you know something is good then maybe you should be doing that instead.
    
    We should always be continuously learning. Helping people and keeping our ecosystem clean because we live in that. Take care of kids. They are innocent. Take care of elders especially when they can't help themselves.
    
    Be kind to strangers and keep your distance still. Make things comfortable.
    
    I think people just need to think about doing things normal. Or at least try to. But at the same time be able to express themselves and be unique in their own ways.
    
    And then keeping an open mind about things. Letting people do them in minding your own business. Let people do them. And you focus on yourself.

   Would it cause backpain?
  ","
  It can...
  
  Just depends.
  
  They always say you're supposed to stretch before you workout. Like if you lift weights or go for a jog.
  
  They always say you stretch for about 10 to 15 minutes and you should stretch every part of your body before going and working out and picking up heavy things.
  
  You should stretch your back out your legs or arm your neck all of that if we're going and working out. Especially if you haven't worked out in a while. And they say even after you're done working out to do the same stretching methods that you did before when you worked out before starting.
  
  Sometimes you can pull a muscle on accident or even irritate a nerve.
  
  You really have to be careful sometimes with working out you don't want to just go into it hardcore. If you start working out say for instance do you want to do push-ups maybe start off with just doing 5 and the next day doing 10 and then the next day doing 15 and then the next day doing 20 you might even want to start out with doing less everyday like 5 push-ups for a whole week straight and then the next week start with doing 10 for 5 days straight.
  
  Picking certain days to work out your legs and certain days to do heavy pickups with your legs and heavy pickups with your arms and then working on your chest area and stomach.
  
  It's really complicated but you can look up certain YouTube videos to follow.
  
  You can even work on different dieting while you're working out.
  
  Hope I helped.
  
  It's never easy getting back into working out but it's always the right thing to do regardless.

  If you go from lifting weights to not lifting weights if you were start lifting weights again it might actually hurt. But that's the best way I can answer this question because I know from experience. I used to lift weights and if I stop for a few days or a week and got back onto doing it again it would actually her a little bit. Like I would just be sore for a few days after but it would be okay.

  I do remember saving kid from drowning. His parents were angry at me though he was drowning. I guess they were angry because the way I looked at them. They literally almost lost their child because they weren't paying attention. If I wouldn't have jumped in that water I think you wouldn't have made it sadly. I guess regardless of the fact of what they would have said to me I still did it because I didn't want the little boy to go through that. I wanted to hurry and get him out of the water as fast as I could. That's why so many people don't like to go swimming because their parents make things like that happen to them. They should have been right next to him and he should have have floaties on and he should not have been anywhere near the three or four feet area. The little boy was literally maybe three. You may be 2 ft tall if that. It really angered me and I was too young and didn't understand how to call Child Services. If I would have known how to do that I would have.

   Why is being ""friends"" bad?

  It's not bad to be friends at all. It's just... Some people when they talk to you.. regardless of the fact if you're with someone or married or single they still want to be more than friends. Especially if it's obvious that you're with someone. Even if it's written and color on your forehead they're still going to expect more than friends. If they want something they're going to ask for it and that's all they're going to want.

   Is it a bad idea to cut your own hair? Have you done it before? 💇‍♀️💇‍♂️✂️
  ","
  Well.. I wouldn't exactly recommend someone to cut their own hair, but it's not impossible to do it. I would most definitely not try tocut my hair in the attempt of trying to cut it correctly because I probably wouldn't succeed. But that's just my thoughts on it. Like... I don't think I would do it well or right LOL. Though I do know how to cut hair but I know how to cut guys hair and not my own. I feel like that would just be really hard to do. I literally get my hair professionally cut by someone that lives a whole state away. And she's been cutting my hair for more than a decade. 15 years? Maybe longer? 😆 lol She is the only person I let touch my hair. I am very strict about how my hair is done. And I pay good money to get it done. And my hair is real. A lot of people think my hair isn't real in it is LOL

   hmm Good answer! but i am talking about the feeling that how can we understand that in which house we are living is it a abnormal haunted place?
  ","
  Well I mean you have to know what you're doing. Usually the amounts of research witnessing it firsthand and then using what you have experience and research to actually figure out what is going on in the certain location that you're in. It's not easy and it's not always 100% what it really could be but you trying to use all of the theory and facts that you have researched to break down what you are experiencing and seeing. It takes lots of investigating and figuring out but like I said you really have to know what you're talkin about and know what you're doing today was actually tell what you're dealing with in a home. Because there are many different levels of the Paranormal. I mean many different. Some things are really evil some things are just spirits that passed on and are stuck and some sort of a ghost Loop. Sometimes it's just a really angry spirit that is seeking revenge or is in denial of their death. Or they don't even know their dad. Some people die unexpectedly and quick and don't even realize that they're dead. And sometimes they need help moving on. Those are the really sad stories. But I have dealt with really good cases and I have dealt with really evil and scary cases. Cases better unsolved and Can't Help the People. Those are the ones that are hard to walk away from. But like I said it just all depends on what you're dealing with. I have been doing paranormal research is for almost 14 years now. I have dealt with so many different types of cases it's crazy. Interesting. Intriguing. And just different. I tried to answer any questions that people have.

   What is the best way to promote a start up business and website and promote?
  ","
  The best way to promote a business is to show your work. To show it to a lot of people and then have them spread the word on the kind of work that you do.
  
  Example...
  
  Say for instance you do speaker installations. Really cool and creative and different speaker installations. We will say this... you do it for someone or maybe a friend for free to show them your work and have them spread the word... then say... all the sudden you get a phone call you go ahead and do their speaker installations and make it really cool and give them a card and have them spread the word out and maybe give them a discount to just spread the word for you you start your business out cheap at first and try to brag and show your experience as much as possible and show that you really can get the job done. You really have to know what you're doing now if you're going to get a little arrogant about it because that's the whole point you're supposed to seem like you really know what you're doing because you do. So you won't be able to see your work so they can spread the word because if your work is really good they will do that.

  Yeah I wish that was the case. The owner was being the same way unfortunately but it's okay. I just ignore them and get what I need done regardless.

   I must complain to the person who is in charge of that branch or I would do something against the company in any way to inform others about their activities if I was there. I have never and can tolerate this type i injustice in my life. No matter people will hate me and IDK..

  The bad part was it was the manager that was treating it that way. It's sad when they put people like that in charge. I should have actually really nice and we knew her really well but something just made her change and we don't know why people lie. And they believe people that lie

   So sad...Such a terrible experience you had faced🙄😥
  ","
  The only reason why they're treating us like that is because one time I came in and their computers messed up and technically took the money off our card for the groceries that we had but they wouldn't give us our stuff because they're saying it didn't go through properly or something? Even though the money left the card and said that we paid for the stuff. That infuriated me because we actually needed food in the house and they would not let us get it.
  
  So now every time I come in it seems like they remember us and want to be rude to us still even though THEIR machines messed up.
  
  That wasn't the first time that has happened to me. One time they charged $300 to my card when I was trying to buy one belt that costed maybe 10 $15 dollars... and then I had to sit around for almost an hour trying to give my money back and they gave ot back to me in cash and I was actually on vacation out of town. Absolutely ridiculous. And then they want to treat me bad after they messed up? It just doesn't make any sense. This was Walmart by the way. They always seem to mess everything up. I can't stand that store. Every time I go and they want to do something to us to accuse everyone else but not themselves.

  Yes and no. They didn't apologize. And I wasn't even stealing. I was trying to find a toy for a little girl turning 4. It was for a party. And Idk why they kept sending people over to our lanes to look. Maybe it was for someone else?? Idk but all I can say is I reeally dought that I am gonna steal a 8 dollar Play-Doh set... People just think they can do whatever they want and thibk it's necessary. It really made me mad tbh. My conscience is way too much. I would feel like sh until I returned it or paid for it. So I couldn't steal. My conscience would eat me alive. And no. They didn't apologize. They think they are the best for being like that. A shame. Should be ashamed of themselves and go actually worry about people that are really causing problems.

They had fleas all over them they had wounds all over them they were shaking cold they look really hungry and they were just terrified.

  Getting attacked by someone when I was totally minding my own business and not doing anything wrong to them. They apologize though. I think they realize that they really messed up and didn't understand what they were doing. And they didn't like beat me up they just hit me once. They were trying to joke around and make it seem like they were going to hit me and they accidentally did. But it still doesn't make any sense. You could literally be doing absolutely nothing wrong to somebody and get attacked the only reason why I didn't do anything back to them is because I thought they were crazy for randomly attacking so I was thought to myself get away from them because maybe they're insane and they just might not have anything to live for. There are certain people you just do not react to and you get away from. It was a guy and in that instance I just wanted to get away from him because I was totally caught off guard. Was totally confused to why he attacked me for no reason and I didn't even know him. It just goes to show you how I'm saying this world really is. This was a really long time ago. This was like 8 years ago.

  I prefer walking into a cold room when it is scorching hot outside. I like the heat when it's cold too but I actually love the cold more. Honestly if it was freezing outside I still wouldn't mind walking into a room when it is cold I can put socks on long-sleeve pants and shirt and bundle up under the blanket and I could also put on a heater. But even if I didn't have a heater it wouldn't be that big of a deal I rather be cold than hot

  ","
  Singing makes me feel whole. Perfecting something so much and then using it to impress people and make them happy.
  
  And then I love making people laugh also and perfecting my jokes until it just makes them crack up.
  
  Same thing with painting or wood burning or wood carving (I haven't really gotten into wood carving as much as I have wood burning. Both fun and cheap hobbies to get into by the way) love painting things for people because then in the end there smiling in are happy because I painted something for them and I work so hard on it and did my best.
  
  And then again same with cooking. You sit there and perfect a recipe and/or a dish and then you let someone try it that doesn't even like the food that you cook (like the type. No you you and your food. Doesn't like the kind of food you are cooking.) but they try it and then you at that moment then have changed their opinion on it! That is awesome! I literally made a shrimp and corn and celery onion soup and someone didn't even like any of that and they tried it and loved it and I change their perspective on it! or really the Shrimp? I think it was the shrimp. That was what they didn't eat. Seafood? But that is still great! They loved it!

   It's alright. But I'd like to ask, why do you think this is the right thing to do? I mean avoiding any controversy.
Isn't sharing our views is most of what we do here?
Now I'm not objecting nor am I insisting that you should answer. I'm just discussing the idea behind not answering.
  ","
  I don't exactly have to answer it but I already stated it above, I avoid controversy on here because there are people on here that just like to be ugly and make people upset. I stated that above. I don't find it necessary just to pick on people whether they like something or not like something. And I'm not talking about you I'm talking about trolls because there are trolls on this app. That's why I avoid certain controversy on social media.
  
  It's nothing personal towards anyone is just I have already tried to talk about certain controversial type things on here and it has ended badly. Extremely badly. So I already have my experience what has happened after talking about certain controversial type things

   I asked this question anonymously by mistake. You like my answer for the same question so I thought of asking you.
  ","
  No you're fine it was literally just because someone asked me anonymously. Now that I know it's you I feel more comfortable with answering it. I hope that you are not upset at me. The only reason why I asked you did that way it's just because I thought it was another troll trying to ask me a controversial question. Don't ask me a question and then judge me for my answer whether it's right or wrong. And that's annoying. But I know that you wouldn't do that. I do believe Evolution but it's really hard to explain honestly. But I believe in different forms of it. I hope that you respect my answer and understand that I was not trying to go at you. Just more or less people that ask anonymous questions and then wants to judge people for their answers. I can't stand people that are like that again I did not think that you were doing that

   Give 5 self-improvement tips ✨
  ","
  It's always good to try to wake up a little early in the morning so you can get your day started and feel fresh. I recommend trying to go to bed at a decent time. If you're not able to talk to your local doctor and try to figure out different alternatives to help you go to sleep better and faster. Being able to wake up early and exercising and getting a healthy breakfast is a good way to make your life so fresh and start off the day with good energy. This is a good self-improvement A lot of people don't go to bed on time and wake up early. Nor get the amount of sleep that they are supposed to get. Try that. It is nice.
  
  Remembering that you are beautiful inside out. You have to tell yourself that.
  
  Doing random acts of kindness and paying it forward.
  
  Just trying to keep the environment around you and your self clean. That is a really good self-improvement thing to do if you don't do these few things.
  
  Exercise and socializing. Exploring and trying new things.
  
  All these things are really good things to try to do for self improvement.

   What is the simplest thing that would make someone gain your respect? And what is the simplest thing that would make them lose it?
  ","
  Offering them a drink or food item immediately right when I meet them. It just goes to show that I am here for them and I could take care of them and even spend my own money on them. But don't get too carried away because that's what will make me lose your respect easily. If you get Grady and you're only there for the money and the things I have to offer. Cuz that's not what I'm there for it's just me showing you that I can care for you and that I am here for you and that I don't mind spending my own money on you.
  
  Greed jealousy and envy will make me not want to be friends with you. I like people that appreciate things and don't take things for granted as well. Don't waste day. If I see that you make some food and then you all the sudden don't want it and throw it away that makes me very upset. I was grew up and taught to not waste. I also grew up not the richest and I'm okay with that. Because it taught me certain things that I needed to know in life. I think everyone should grow up like this sometime in their life. Being in the low times with low money and knowing how to budget and appreciate what you have in front of you especially the people.

  ","
  I don't really understand what the beginning of this question means because I just don't get the lingo. s/o and I don't understand the face thing. So my apologies there.
  
  But I will say this... your partner shouldn't be sending someone any type of hearts and that other person should not be sending them any type of hearts because hearts symbolize love and if that's your partner and they're sending love symbols to someone else that is inappropriate and uncalled for in a relationship.
  
  Me and my husband don't do that. We don't even do it without thinking we just only talk to one another. We don't have a reason to speak to any other human being in the way that we speak to each other because we are married and love one another and want to speak to each other and only each other like that. That's how it should be. The way that you to talk should be a secret and only in between the two of you. You should not tell other people or things that you to do because that would ruin how special it is.
  
  And we allow each other to be friends with other human beings even of the opposite sex? Absolutely. There's no reason to get angry at someone for wanting to be friends with other human being. But only friends. And make that clear and don't talk to them 24/7 because then it looks like you're doing something.

   If you were seated in a restaurant and protesters entered and demanded acquiescence to their political movement, how should you react if they are screaming directly in your face?

  I would get up and leave unless a manager or restaurant owner got it taken care of immediately and if they touch me I'm going to defend myself. I'm not going to do anything I don't want to do. If I wanted to protest then I would already be out there with them. I'm just really trying to have a bite to eat and you're in here screaming at my face. I'd probably call the police and tell them that they're making a disturbance and then they would come take care of them but I would still leave because I'm not about to sit there and have a situation on my hands to where it's going to possibly get violent because I didn't do anything wrong but measly walk into a restaurant and get a bite to eat.

   How do you react when people ask too much of you?
  ","
  Trying to understand what you exactly mean do you mean like people ask for you to do too much at once? Or maybe answer something that's a little too personal but you do it anyway. Because if it's the first one I just try to tell them you're going to have to wait because I'm not able to do all that at once and I take my time and I do each thing until I get to them and then I helped them out.
  
  The second one it just depends on who I'm talking to because if it's something extremely personal that I don't want to tell you because that's my business and it's uncomfortable for me to talk about. Only depends on who you are.
  "

   What’s your opinion on social media?
  ","
  I like it because you can communicate with people from all over the world whenever you want. This is a very big boom in our generation now.
  
  But I think that people should be more aware of their surroundings when they're online because there are literally more people on line that lies and what you think telling the truth.
  
  You also need to be careful so no one steals your identity and tries to be you online.
  
  Giving too much information out is not safe on the internet and you should honestly keep your circle small and only trust certain people and make sure that your parents meet them especially if you're young or under the age of 20.
  
  Because you just never know how gullible you think you are and so you actually meet a true catfish online.

  Growing up I always used to remember going fishing with my mom and her teaching me anything and everything she could about fishing. Or at least what I could when I was paying attention. But I really enjoyed fishing with my mom. I also remember going to visit my great-grandparents and my grandparent's folks and family members, putting flowers on their graves. I remember driving an hour to two hours away and sometimes getting car sick but we would get to this place where we had pretty much a family reunions and we'd have all of these pies and there was just so much food I remember, but we would have so much fun and there was a playground and everything and I got to play with so many kids. At the end of the day I had a really good time. I'm just mentioning all this because I remember the old days I miss them. I also remember going to a family member's house where she had ducks everywhere and I wanted to hold one so bad chasing after them. Again these were the good days. Still good today but these were definitely the good days. I miss my grandparents.

  To visit the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
  
  Go to the Bass Pro Shops Pyramid.
  
  Visit the Graceland Mansion.
  
  Visit Dollywood.
  
  Visit the Tennessee Civil War Trails.
  
  Parthenon.
  
  Valley Railroad Museum.
  
  While in Tennessee you must go to Knoxville. You can go out to eat and visit many different places in Knoxville. Honestly you would have to go for a week just to probably Adventure the whole place. I'm sure. Considering how popular it is.
  
  Can go to Lookout Mountain.
  
  The Titanic Museum.
  
  Craighead Caverns.
  
  Bell Witch Cave.
  
  Oak Ridge.
  
  Virginia Falls Pocket Wilderness.
  
  Crystal Shrine Grotto.
  
  Gatlinburg Tennessee.
  
  Chattanooga.
  
  These are all really good places to go in Tennessee but to be honest this doesn't even scratch the surface of Tennessee. There are many hikes and trails that you can go on but I would definitely not recommend on going by yourself I wouldn't even recommend going with two people. I would recommend bringing about four to five people going on these trails to make sure that you were safe and bring lots of water and first aid kits. But to visit Tennessee it's amazing. It's a beautiful place. Wonderful people and good food. I would definitely go out to you a few times also and don't forget the amazing fun bars.

  Extremely.
  
  I love the holidays.
  
  To be honest with you Sept-Jan. is my most favorite time of the year. Because it starts to actually become the season that I love the most.
  
  Fall because I love seeing the plants and grass change colors and winter because you don't have to cut the grass 😆 and then.. it's cold out and you can actually enjoy yourself outside 😊  without being extremely hot and sweating. And I love the cold. I honestly don't even have to turn the heater on. 🔥 Because I just like the cold. You can keep your doors open as long as it's not too cold and it can keep the house cool without having to turn the air conditioning or the heater on. You can conserve more electricity that way. One day I'll be able to redo all of my windows in the house and make it to where I only open the windows and not turn on any lights so we can conserve even more electricity.

   Have you ever been grade conscious?
  ","
  Like... being scared what people are going to grade you as? Like judge you? Or what people may think of you? Or what you look like? And grade you based off of that? Nope. Everyone has taste. Different taste. Eye of the beholder I say.
  
  People have no need to open their mouth if there's nothing nice to say someone. Especially if there's nothing wrong with them and they look completely fine. Especially if they feel comfortable in their own body. And they feel happy and confident. No need to say anything to them at all.  Leave them be. I understand if someone smells a little strange or maybe their hair is a brushed just right or something.. or maybe they're wearing a dress that's a bit too short in your opinion... or maybe it's a guy wearing tight jeans... To be honest.. it's better just to mind your own business and keep your mouth shut. Let people do them. Because at the end of the day that's them doing them and it's not affecting you.
  
  But say for instance there's nothing wrong with a girl and she's just sitting there and you just think that maybe her feet are a little too big. So you take it upon yourself to go up to her and tell her that. Just keep your words to yourself that is totally uncalled for and to be honest her feet probably aren't even that big to other person. Just to you it might be. Shallowness is definitely a thing. You need to look at a person from the inside. Not more from the outside because to be honest you could fall for someone that's totally beautiful but they have a horrible attitude. I would not want to be with someone that has a bad attitude regardless of how fine they look. I want someone that actually wants a future. Someone that has confidence is extremely determined and is ambitious and have a wonderful future that they wish ahead of them. That is a wonderful person. Someone that has all of their priorities straight and is excited to make a family and make themselves into something. That is a nice personality and that is hot to me. 👍

   What celebrity irritates you the most?
  ","
  Probably Danielle Bregoli considering she literally at the beginning of her fame got famous off of being a brat. She'll never admit to that though because of how she is. She'll probably always say that she got famous off of rapping but she actually never got into the rapping industry but maybe a year or longer after she got famous for being a brat. She got famous for going on Dr. Phil and bragging about stealing cars beating the crap out of people including her own mother. Regardless of what your mother is doing to you unless she is trying to kill you you do not beat the crap out of your mother.
  
  What an inspiration. She also contradicted herself because she made fun of the Kardashians for being famous for no reason but yet on she got famous for no reason more or less getting famous for being a brat on television and disrespectful to an actual doctor. Again what an inspiration. And she doesn't really exactly irritate me, it's just like what has came to the world to make a brat, literally a convict famous.

  Ask people nicely if you can receive their questions. Most of the time people will say yes. If you ask me nicely and come off Anonymous if you can receive my questions I will do so.
  
  I do not mind adding you to my Ask. That's what we're all here for right?
  
  Another way to get popular on this site is to make shoutouts. When you make shoutouts, you discover new people every time. Sometimes you send it to the same people but most of the time the shoutouts will be sent out to randoms. And more randoms and different randoms every time. If you like there answers, you can follow them and start sending them questions and eventually they'll start sending you some back, but not all of them will send you questions back, but some of them.
  
  And again you can ask people if they can send you questions. I don't feel that anything is wrong with that. After all that's what we're here for right? To ask people stuff and for them to answer.

   Can human nature be changed? 

Should it be changed?
  ","
  Depends on what kind of change you mean because if you mess with human nature too much it can mess with everything. Too much change in the cycle of Life can mess up other species. If you're meaning it like that. Saying like if we'd make all the mice disappear it can really screw up the chain of cycle with animals. A lot of animals that eat mice would disappear.
  
  Unless you're talking about changing human actions. And how we do things. We should change because people need to just be more kind. There's nothing wrong with having a little bit more kindness. Not completely just kindness because then that would mess up the world there has to be bad eggs somewhere for people to be able to learn.

  Used to own one or two but I don't anymore but I honestly want to get another one. I would like to get a mountain bike. For 2 years back home where I used to live that was my only form of transportation. I lived close around everything I needed within the same five miles. So honestly I didn't even need a vehicle. Save the environment and get exercise by riding a bike. I really miss riding bike. I would literally ride during the rain. The snow LOL. I even drove in 10 degree weather I think 20 degree weather that is freezing to me! And when you get on a bike it's even colder! The wind shear

  I would be more specific because you just saying girls means all of them? Because I don't even know who you are and I don't think that would gross me out and I don't think anyone that's bisexual grosses me out. As long as they don't come up to me and start touching me or something I'm totally fine with people and what they want to do that's them not me. And as long as you're just kind of respectful like you would be with a regular relationship and don't just walk up in front of people and start grabbing each other and kissing each other and licking each other or whatever xd 😆 LOL that's just weird and inappropriate for any type of relationship

  Different for everyone. I think my marriage is important me and my husband. Married or not I still love him. Before we got married I love him just as much as we got married. But these laws and what you can do and can't do not being married sometimes it's annoying so getting married it help to be able to ease through those things. Being able to like you known be able to do certain things for one another without having the other one there to do it. It's hard to explain. but that's not the reason why we got married. But it's a benefit from getting married. Me and him got married because we wanted to spend the rest of our life together and it was just another step that we wanted to take in life. Plus I wanted to take his last name it made me feel good and proud and I just love him and that's just what I want to do. Our choice. We were ready. But like I said it's different for everyone

   does all water taste the same? 
which brand is your favorite?
  ","
  To be honest with you yes. I actually took a class on this. Passed also. It's a section in environmental science. Really information on. Tells you about the different ways that they filter water where it's from and what's in it and what they do with it and sometimes what measures they go to get it. And more. Water dirty at first and goes through a cycle continuously. The same cycle. It has to be cleaned for you to be able to drink obviously or you're just drinking bacteria water and pee water. And just nastiness. Some water is less clean that other water and some water has minerals in it some water goes through different types of chemicals some water is just straight purified some Waters from aquifers groundwater
  
  They have water with salt in it which honestly isn't the greatest for people that have high blood pressure and can just cause you to be more thirsty and defeat the purpose. Water such as Dasani and Aquafina. If you read the back of the bottles they will soon as they contain salt. Doctors will not recommend that water to people that have high blood pressure issues. For it is not good for them.
  
  I also don't like Crystal Geyser water because it tastes like they put some sort of chlorine in it and it's really gross. Sometimes Nestle water can be nasty too because I think it comes in batches or something maybe? Wherever they get the water I don't know. Also you can't leave bottled water warm too long or the oils condensed into the bottle and can cause cancers. Be careful with your bottled water. Because it does matter. It can affect your health. Do your research and you'll find what I have

  Well everything in my biography and that is listed in my hashtag is things that I absolutely love to talk about. But I will miss them because I enjoy talking about them.
  
  1. Paranormal because I have been studying on this subject for years almost 13 or more. I love talking about it and I love researching it. Love going on an adventure in learning about the history. Any question that you have that is needing answers to I can answer for you. So you are more than welcome to ask.
  
  2. Geography because I like researching that and I really wanted to go to school for it. A ton of money goes into going to school for that it can be even almost up to $100,000 sometimes and it is like seven to nine years of schooling. That's just crazy but I still research it and learn everyday. Maybe I can get into it with experience.
  
  3. Singing because that is my most favorite thing to do. I'm extremely passionate determined and ambitious about that.
  
  4. Animals. That was another thing I kind of wanted to get into marine biology but again so much schooling and money. But it's okay. I still get opportunities to be around marine animals. Love the water.
  
  5. Cars. I love learning about them it's a challenge. Love working them. A really good therapy type holiday to get into if you are needing something to do throughout the day or week.
  
  6. Christmas. Fourth of July. I love talking about holidays and celebrating them with family and friends.
  
  7. Memories and Good Times growing up. Because growing up was great. Being with my sister is where we used to live and my friends growing up was wonderful.
  
  8. Video gaming because I am most definitely a video gamer. I have been playing since I could remember three or four years old at that.
  
  9. Painting and creativity because I like wood burning painting and really honestly I just really like art. Yes I have some art. Love it! Another really good thing to get into to keep you busy throughout the day and weeks. Good hobby idea.
  
  10. Cooking. Cuz I'm Cajun.

   Self sabotage in relationships... It's something we don't entirely talk about.... Mainly due to ""ghosting""... I'm curious, at what point do you ""shut down"" from a friendship? What does it take for you to give it up entirely? Or are you more of a fighter? The glue that keeps it together?
  ","
  I mean I don't really know considering I'm married and I have been for almost 7 8 years now. So I'm not sure if I can really relate to this question.
  
  But if you mean people that are jealous and they want to try to break you up I think that's childish and inappropriate. Home-wrecking type people. I think people just need to leave people in the relationships be.

   if you’re a parent, what’s something you were judged for doing with your kid(s)? like co-sleeping, screen time, etc. if you don’t have kids or don’t want to answer, feel free to use this as a filler.
  ","
  I don't have any kids but one thing I can't stand that would drive me insane if I did have kids is seeing other parents telling other parents how to raise their children. Unless you see neglect or actual abuse and I don't mean discipline and scolding. If you see actual neglect or abuse then you need to report it immediately. I cannot stand when I see someone just straight-up coming up to someone just because they might be spoiling a child or they might be popping a child on their butt for being bad or they are not feeding them because they know that they just fed them and they are fine. And seeing people come up to them and tell them what they need to do and to do this and that when they have no idea what that parent doesn't that kid and that parent knows what they're doing but that kid correctly. Stay out of their business and mind your own. Do not tell someone how to raise their children when they know what they are doing. If you see something wrong then report it. 🤷👍

  Lately in the past few years I have been really wanting to go all out because it really brings my vibe up and makes me in a good mood when I super celebrate for holidays. Me and my husband just don't have all that kind of money because we are just starting out with getting stuff for the house for different types of holidays because we are new homeowners in the past few years and couple obviously right? You have to build your items up for holidays because you don't have any at the beginning. Me and my husband really want to get a few cute yearly doormat it's like one for fall winter summer spring. And then we want to get different things to hang on the door. We want to get a few things to maybe stick in the yard maybe for Halloween put some hay bales and pumpkins out or something for Christmas maybe get a few deer or something to put in the yard and put some lights up and then for maybe the summer get a small pool or something like that. And then for spraying we can get like some plants and try to grow some plants or maybe plant some new trees in the yard. We try our best to decorate for certain times of the year but it's not always doable.

This is what it is like to live in Louisiana. Everybody is so open happy and always is having fun. This was a bunch of adults too and kids. So much fun and so cool!

Not kidding that I paid $20 after waiting almost an hour in line behind almost twenty-five people and had another 25 people behind me and the only reason why we didn't get out of wine is because we couldn't because we were boxed in

Get yourself out there that you will send questions spams if people will ask

   Is every selfish person an envious person? What’s the difference between them?
  ","
  The main difference between envy and jealousy/selfishness is the emotion of coveting someone or something else that someone has small jealousy is the emotion related to fear of losing that certain person or thing. Having that something or someone taken away.
  
  Jealousy is like keeping watch. Guarding. Making sure. Almost controlling.
  
  And then envious AKA envy it's just really someone that dislikes someone because they have something or someone that they want.
  
  Jealousy is more attached feelings then Envy. When Envy is more likely just something you don't like. A person because they have something you want or they're ""better"" (seeming better than you) than you.
  
  Example. They have money for and you don't have money, so you want that. And so.. You don't like them for that. Or... they have a big house so you don't like them because you want that or... they have long hair because they don't have long hair and so because of that they don't like you. So many examples.

And of course I get troll accounts regardless on my page but I usually just ignore them because all they're here for is drama. Don't have time for them. They don't know me and what I've been through.

  So whoever just came on my page and told me so basically meetinf my husband on a video game is basically like using an online dating app.
  
  Weellp I'd hate to break it to you LOL by the way it's funny that you're jealous because that's the only reason why someone would say something like that. Because I don't judge people that use online dating apps. I just don't use dating apps.
  
  I go out and find a person. I unexpectedly met Jason online playing a video game. I've dated people in real life all my life IN PERSON. I just so happen to find a companion online on video gaming. I've been playing video games my whole life. I just think it's funny that someone made it seem like online gaming is like online app dating when it's not. XD 🤣🤣🤣 Plus me and him met not even a few months after we met online. Considering we were long distance and lived hundreds of miles apart. I just think it's funny that people are jealous LOL. But I'm married to him anyway. Don't get salty somewhere else. Don't get mad at my love story just because you can't get one. 😅🤷 People ARE HILARIOUS.

I pray for each and every one of these loves. I wishing miracle in their lives to heal and get better. Make-a-Wish today and help lives.

   What household chores have you done today?
  ","
  Today I'm really exhausted so I haven't been able to do much because I worked most of the day. And I haven't really been getting a lot of sleep so I took a nap for the first time in a long time. But today I did clothes. I cleaned some of the bathroom. I cleaned some of the kitchen up. But that's all I've done today was surprisingly.
  
  Yesterday we did quite a bit. Got all the garbages together which we had a lot and we got rid of a few things that needed to go to the garbage such as a really old steam cleaner but we haven't been able to throw that away yet because it's really heavy and I think we're going to donate it because it's still fixable but we don't want it anymore. Or we just might get it fixed depends. And then we had a old vacuum cleaner that needed throwing away which we did. And then I steam cleaned the carpets in the living room we rearranged the living room we vacuumed the living room. We rearranged the living room so that his grandmother can walk around safely because she is getting to where she cannot walk around a lot and she's falling a lot, so we're trying to make the living room and the house safer for her to walk around in.
  
  And then we got the dishes done yesterday. Oh today we also mops a little bit I forgot to mention that. We did a lot yesterday honestly. And today. I probably could have got more done today but I am just exhausted. I have just been working so much. But I will have a week off soon. It will be my first week off and almost a year

  Growing up and still do. I played a few years of soccer growing up for about 3 or 4 years I played soccer. I played basketball for about 4 years maybe five. I played baseball for about 4 years again maybe 5. And then I played volleyball for about seven or eight years and I was team captain for a few years. I always enjoy playing sports growing up. And then I almost joined the weight lifting team but decided not to because they had a bunch of rules and diets that you had to do and I just didn't have time to pay attention to all of that and school work and working. I also ended up quitting volleyball in high school because of a bad injury and I wanted to focus on my schoolwork. I was going to go to college for it and try to get scholarships and stuff but I just decided to just only focus on my school work. For the longest I wanted to go into the army that's how much I love sports I almost wanted to go into the army to get more fit and just volunteer for my country.

   What are red flags in a friendship most people brush away?
  ","
  When they ask for a lot of things from you all the time and they don't return favors and they don't give you back anything ever. Ex: Aye.. let me borrow $20, when you say *borrow* that means you're going to give them back the $20 and it advance, later on. When you never give it back that's kind of a red flag because why would you use the word borrow if you're not even going to give it back right? Learn your wording before saying something. Especially if they do it over and over again very soon together. Almost every week asking for $5,$15,$20,$30 and not returning it at all. That money adds up. They're using you at that point. That is a red flag and is not normal in a proper friendship.
  
  When someone keeps asking to borrow your car and they bring it back in horrible condition no gas trash everywhere and sometimes even have it wrecked... and they don't offer to clean it put gas in it give you money or even fix it.
  
  This is showing that your friend is not and does not respect your belongings and they don't care. Even if you tell them can you fix this or give them gas money or clean it and they do not hit. That is not a friend. Again that's a friend that is taking advantage of you and is using you regardless of what they say. It's even hard for some people it's even realize that's what they're doing. This is wrong.
  
  When your friend keeps telling you we're going to hang out and then doesn't show up or actually meets up to what they are saying. When you say you're going to hang out with someone and they then have dropped all of their plans to hang out with you and then you don't show up that is upsetting and that is not what a friend should do.
  
  And more.
  
  Just some.

  Yes I noticed it but honestly it's just a direction to go to the email to message the which is what I have been doing all along, how it has always been to contact them is what I mean. But I like the little area that they have going on with a direct message showing people where to go and stuff ya know to contact them. It's definitely easier the way they are going about it now, showing how to contact them because I didn't know how to do it at first I had to ask a million questions just to contact exam which is kind of sad so I'm happy that they did the messaging tabs thing because now it's showing someone where to go to message them.
  
  So yeah. I like it.
  
  I do. Wish you could just message message them tho and then they just get back to ya later through that, but email works too. They have always gotten back to me through email. Always. I thank them for that. 🤙

  I don't know about Hawaii but if I got the opportunity to go I would but it's really expensive honestly the taxes are really high and I'm always been nervous about volcanoes but I honestly wouldn't mind going to Hawaii. If I had to pick Hawaii or Alaska I would most definitely pick Alaska in the summer. Too cold for the winter in Alaska. But why would I pick Alaska? Is beautiful there's so much land as untouched the nature of it it's beautiful the hunting is great. Not many citys or towns or people. Really cool Heritage that you can learn about there. Can learn lots about fishing and hunting.
  
  I have always wanted to go to Alaska. Spend a week or two in the summer and just soak in the natural preserved habitat it is.

   Absolutely true. Kids these days couldn’t last a day without their phones or social media
  ","
  Yep.
  
  And actually I have answered this question so many times on here. One time I answered it an anonymous person decided to come forth and of course not show themselves lol and decide to try to tell me that I could never do that. They don't know me and I've already done it before. I'm a 90s kid. Phones were not that important. Phones were expensive and only used to communicate with people. We didn't really have text message and computers were expensive and internet was insanely expensive especially on phones. I grew up as a tomboy playing with the neighborhood kids. The only time we came in and play with electronics was when we came in and played with the electronics with no internet. We played offline and we played with tons of kids socializing and having fun. Not playing by ourselves in our room screaming and television 24/7 everyday of Our Lives. I do play video games sometimes by myself but I still play them with groups of people and have a good time and socialize. And I don't take the game too seriously. At the end of the day it's just a game. It's not real.
  
  My point is I think it's funny that random people that don't even know me and the age that I come from and what I grew up through already. It just goes to show that strangers know nothing about you and have no room to talk. And anything and everything they say doesn't affect mem

  This wouldn't happen. I don't usually lend money because it can lead to arguments if not paid back and stuff. If one of my close friends needed money. I would probably just give it to them without asking for it back. Of course it was a reasonable amount of money asked for. But honestly my friends wouldn't come to me and ask for money like that.

  And then just the other night I had a dream that I was pregnant and I actually felt what it felt like to be pregnant for some reason and I have never been pregnant before?! So confusing and was 100% realistic as ever. Really surprised me. For real. Was crazy.

   What is your favorite memory with your grandparents?

  Cooking just about anything and everything under the moon. My Paw Paw telling me that he always wanted to go to the Moon. He always loved watching Neil Armstrong land on the moon. He would always tell me about that. He said one day if he wants the lottery he wants to take me to the Moon. He just thinks that that is so awesome.. Used to love helping my Paw Paw with the fish that he would catch. He would catch some huge catfish. Or I would be in the kitchen helping my grandfather stuff a roast the cook for the night. Or we would go to McDonald's and get a McFlurry and some french fries or a McDouble. I just miss those days. Or Walking On The Levee with my grandparents.
  
  I remember cooking with my grandmother playing board games with her and just having good discussions with her. And then me and her would say the rosary together. I just miss all of that. I really do. I would go to the store on my bike just to bring her pie and spoil her. Because she deserved the world. I remember joking with her. I remember seeing the look on her face when I would get her presents. And Surprises with flowers all the time brought joy to her voice. I love making my grandmother feel special because she very much was. She was a very big part of my life and still is today. I thank both of my grandparents. I miss both of them.

  Exactly. And then you see all these things on the news of random people st*bbing other people's children in the head and people taking children and taking them away from their family and hiding them in their basement for 10 to 12 years at a time and then finally they escape. People going in and sh**ting up schools and stuff. It's just horrible. And then you think well.. these were supposed to be our heroes? Makes it hard to trust even them sometimes you know? Usually strangers but you know what I mean you go to your teachers trusting them even and sometimes they turn on you.
  
  Growing up these things were blind to me. I never saw these things. I always saw the good in adults. And then one day I saw something that changed my life and just made me think differently. Made me be more cautious of anyone and everything. That's how I always should have been but I mean I was young? What can you do everybody goes through it growing up. We all realize it one day. The part that said is it's unfortunate. We kids grow up thinking everything's perfect and then it turns. Life hits you.

  Idk. Isn't for me to tell.
  
  Been at it since I was as young as I could remember.. Prob the age of 4? Or 5? 6? Idk... A long time... That's all I can say there.
  
  But I will say this. I have sang for numerous events, high schools, middle schools, elementary schools, colleges, football games, funerals, churches, parties, bars, I think weddings, can't remember,but I'm pretty sure a wedding I think. And more.
  
  I have had tons of experience throughout my life. And practice every single day.
  
  I was in a choir for many years and then I led the choir for about a year or so and right before I graduated from my middle school I was attending. I was honored to do this and had a lot of fun doing it. Was under a lot of pressure but still got up there and staying in front of hundreds and hundreds to maybe even a thousand or so people. I love the audience and I loved the applause. I literally would crave this.
  
  I always go by the username Ice_Frosen_Vocals because I just absolutely love to sing. I love the cold. I love being in the cold. People always say that I always made them froze when they heard me singing and I gave them Goosebumps. I always took this as a great compliment and is also a slight idea to why I came up with the Frozen part of my username.
  
  I'm extremely passionate about singing. It is always what has made me happy in life. When I'm down that's always what I turn to is singing.
  
  Many people that have been around me that have gave me tips have seen this and me. That I just absolutely love doing it just for myself. And not just for myself but for others and I just enjoy seeing smiles. Entertaining people. It is just something that comes natural to me. That I love to do. I love entertaining. Love to sing. 😊❤ Big love for me. #Singing #IceFrozenVocals #Ask #Passionate #Passion #MakesMeHappy #WhatMakesMeMe.

  ","
  If you gargle hydrogen peroxide do not eat for 30 minutes after. And if you gargle it at night I wouldn't even drink anything after. Let it sit. After you gargle it do not put any water in your mouth at all. You can wipe your mouth. Just look at the dentist don't put any water in your mouth. Let it sit in your mouth and your throat. What the hydrogen peroxide does is it attacks the acids that are in your throat that are causing you a sore throat and if you actually do this right away when you start realizing you have a sore throat it can actually make it go away faster because you're handling the acids before they make you have a severe sore throat. It creates a scab in the back of your throat that's why you don't want to continuously do it too much because then you will irritate the throat. Just like if you were to cut your leg you want a scab if you keep messing with the scab and putting alcohol on it you will just irritated. That's why I said don't exceed more than three times a day. This is what I was told also when I was doing it.
  
  And honestly if you have a sore throat you really honestly only have to do this for 2 days the gargling. It should go away after that. It's just start showing change.
  
  If it doesn't help then that means you were too late when you started gargling and or it might be something different other than a sore throat.
  
  Again good luck
  "
31319,"
   What do you do to treat a cold. Continuation
  ","
  Continuation
  
  If your throat is severely hurting. Get you some mint mouthwash. Take two oz and pour it into a cup. Then get you some hydrogen peroxide and then pour about 1 oz into the same cup mix it up real well make sure that the liquids or warm if you have to get you some really warm water and add 2 oz of that as well before adding the hydrogen peroxide and the mouthwash. You want the liquid to be warm it will really make your throat feel good. Take you some salt and shake it into the cup then gargle it three times. I would only do this if you are a certain age because you do not need to swallow it. Do not swallow hydrogen peroxide but if you read the bottle you can gargle it and it will help with sore throat. You do this about twice a day. After you wake up in the morning if your throat is hurting do it once. Only do it after you eat. Brush your teeth first and then do your everyday mouth washing but just add these ingredients also. Before bed I would do it again. I would not exceed more than 3 times a day doing it because it can actually worsen it if you keep doing it. But you just do it once or twice this is really good for sore throat. I personally do this and it works every time. Good luck with your sore throat and I hope that you feel better good luck with your cold.
  
  Now I am no doctor but these are just the things that I have used to help me get rid of a cold a sore throat or just a lot of mucus.
  
  I would honestly consult with your doctor before actually but it's up to you to take these ideas
  "
31320,"
   What do you do to treat a cold? Asking for a friend 🤒
  ","
  Depending on personal medical conditions. Usually taking Tylenol or some type of fever reducer and pain reducer helps. Helps with some of the symptoms. It helps with reducing.
  
  Taking some sort of a syrup for colds help. Make sure you look into what you are taking and make sure it's okay to take with Tylenol or pain reliever tablets. Also make sure the Stirrup you are allowed to take also. Just in case you have any type of medical conditions such as high blood pressure.
  
  Sometimes Out of Water such as Alka-Seltzer can help. Again make sure you can handle and take that before taking. Warm liquid.
  
  Theraflu is really good.
  
  Sleep and rest and taking it easy. For at least the amount of the fever lasting.. you need to let your body focused on getting better. You moving around is not letting your body focus. Your body is focused on moving more than getting better.
  
  Lots of liquids.
  
  Stay hydrated.
  
  More than usual.
  
  Warm moist air.
  
  Take 2 warn 15 min. showers a day. Even though your body may be seem cold it's freaking out. Stay comfortably warm. The mist from the shower will help you. Even if you cough that means it's helping. Promise. A Dr. would say the same.
  
  Salt water gargling depending on your symptoms of your cold of course.
  
  And then honestly if you have a cold I would recommend going to the doctor and getting prescribed medication to help you get better from being sick. This is the best way to cure a cold. Prescribed medications. You can also get over the counter but all it's going to do is lessen the symptoms.
  
  Also drinking vitamin C can help you get better.
  
  Change your clothes frequently throughout the day and wash your face a lot. Brush your teeth normally as you should.
  
  Wash face at least 2-3 times.
  
  If your throat hurts try warm tea a little bit of lemon and honey. Depending on your age adding a little bit of bourbon to your drink can also help.
  
  If your throat is severely hurting. This question will continue on to another...

  This didn't really anger me it was kind of funny but it still was really annoying.
  
  Yesterday at work, I had this lady call and she wanted to know if we had any jelly jars also known as, ""Mason Jars."" Okay?
  
  Well I'm a cashier in the front (by myself at the time) at the moment and I'm no where near the Mason jar aisle right? I could have just paged her to someone else to help her but we're supposed to help them as best as we can right? Only cashier. But it wasn't really busy at the time. So I told her I'm a cashier I will be right back I have to go and check. Because I'm no where near them right? Just like I would do with anyone else. I went down the hall on aisle one which is very far from my register and I went and look and we had three small cases of mason jars left and we had one case of big mason jars.
  
  I took a picture and everything came back to the phone. Mind you... I was only gone for maybe a minute and I only been on the phone with her for maybe 2 minutes. Right? Came back and was very polite to her on the phone and said that we only have three small cases left of mason jars and one big case left. She argued and said that she was looking for jelly jars. I said yes ma'am we have some here left over, there are three little cases and one big. Mason jars and jelly jars are the same thing. I guess she thought I was talking about something else and I explained to her that I wasn't and that it was the same thing and told her my bad and SHE GOT MAD and told me I didn't know what I was talking about and that she wanted to talk to someone that knew. XD SO RUDE. 😆 And me I'm like??? I do know what I am talking about? I said it right and really, tbh I didn't have help her b/c that is the only cashier in the front at the time. I wasn't rude to her at all and I helped her and told her exactly what needed to be told. And she told my supervisor I had her on the phone for 30 minutes even in the phone call was only 4 minutes long. Xd HILARIOUS. Xd How people lie. Haha.

People trying to make certain phenomenons real. Those kinds of people ruin it for the rest. Because there's actual real phenomenons out there and people researching them and showing proof while there's other people making fun of it and trying to photoshop stuff to make things look real when they're really not.

  The actor correct? Well, apparently he performed on both British and American stages and was/is a very good actor and has won various awards for that. Tom Hardy mostly takes leads in the movies that he plays in.
  
  He's been on television shows. He's been an actor as late as the 2000s so far from what I have researched on the guy.
  
  That's pretty cool. Pretty impressive. I'm sure he's probably did some work in the 1990s too but hasn't really hit off until the 2000s. But that right there is an assumption, not fact but the beginning of this paragraph is fact.
  
  Actually I just did a little bit more research on the guy and apparently he started in 1998 until present and still acts till this day. My apologies. I cleared up my assumption...

  That's wonderful ideas. It's gets protective children. Though I really do love real hugs and stuff. Now is not the time for them. We have to keep our distance from each other for now.  people are just not understanding that. Virtual hugs and are hugs and high-fives and elbow touch instead of handshakes is what we have unfortunately for the time being. But it's just necessary. Would you not need to spread kovan. We need to try our best to stay healthy stay clean and keep our distance.
  
  There are very very few people that I hug nowadays. In the past I still didn't really give out a lot of hugs just because I never really liked being touched. But friends and family yes. I do like hugs. But for now we must hold off.

  I'm healthy. I feel and look healthy. I ain't no stick and I'm not some giant fukn hippo ?? but.. and even if I was either one of these why does it matter? It's me it's not you. XD LOL. It's my business and what I have to do the next day. Me and what I have to deal with.
  
  I just think it's funny that people have nothing else better to do than to come on the internet and interrogate people to figure out those types of things and then make fun of them regardless if they're the right weight or not.

  don't touch me.
  
  I have personal space.
  
  And I don't really understand why it's so hard to read that when I keep pulling away from you.
  
  Really frustrating. I just wish people would respect. Self-respect and have respect for other people. And they're things. And their property. And just in general. And most importantly their personal space needs to be respected!
  
  Has your mom never taught you(them) that? Every parent teach a child how to give people space.
  
  Idk. It's whatever. Especially in today's society. We are living in covid-19 ages. A pandemic. We shouldn't be doing a lot of touching of one another especially if we don't know each other and where we've been. And the best thing about it is a lot of people think I'm being harsh, but would you honestly be okay with a stranger and them just be able to come up to you and just start touching you and hugging you and grabbing your arms and your hair and touching your body and stuff and just coming straight at you? Getting all up in your face and just. Yeah.... No, you wouldn't like that and if you do that is just strange on so many levels.
  
  And see me? The minute I get physical or start telling them something... ""Oh... Well now I'm the bad kid. The bad guy."" But if they were to say it. It would be okay. I probably am a little harsh about things. But I mean you know better. And if you don't know better than you need to learn it. And sadly if I have to teach it to you then Gosh so be it. ?

Play sports play games talk about the old days. Swim all kinds of things. And then of course you do have your New Orleans parades that can get a little rowdy usually.

   What’s one pet peeve of yours that you wish that you could get rid of- because it hampers your enjoyment of life?
  ","
  1. I have a heavy conscience though it's not exactly a pet peeve that would want to get rid of. Just sometimes it gets guilty of things that aren't even that serious. But at the same time as I said before it's not exactly a bad thing. As least I try to do good even when it's not necessary other than trying to do bad at any moment if that makes any sense.
  
  2. I can't stand the fact that I bite my nails I just really wish I would stop it is just two hardest thing to do with my nerves. My nerves are really bad and my anxiety is really bad. What can you do you know? Can only Thrive. No one's perfect.

   Would you consider yourself to be artistic? If so, what kind of art do you create?
  ","
  I was being created in multiple ways. I love many different types of art. I love music. I love to sing. I left play many different types of instruments. I love to dance. I love many different types of culture and their dancing. I like to paint. I like wood burning and wood carving. I like to create and build many different types of things. I feel like food is a type of art. I love cooking and then making me beautiful presentation at the end. I've always been very interested in glass blowing and pottery. Just many different types of art. Anytime. I love it. Art makes me really happy just looking at it being around it watching people do it.
  
  If any of you would like to see some of my artwork you're more than welcome to ask. The only reason why I have it attached to anything to this yeah it's because I just don't know what to share. I don't know where to start. Where to begin. But I will most definitely tell you I love being creative I left creative people and I love art

  Alright. Followed.
  
   I gotcha. I probably won't ask any questions tonight because I'm tired and I have work in the morning but I will ask questions probably either tomorrow or the next day. But typically I send questions out about two or three times a week and and all I sent about 20 Questions out for a week if not more or less. It just depends. And they're not everyday generated Ask.fm questions. They are questions that I have sat down and thought about and originally came up with my myself.
   
   I hope you're enjoying my future questions spams. Have a good night

   Do you prefer to be grounded in reality, or do you wish to escape it?
  ","
  I am honestly extremely realistic. It actually aggravate people sometimes. It's really hard for me to get into certain movies. Of course obviously ones that are really unrealistic. Cartoons are hard for me to get into. Animes. Though I do watch some cartoons and some animes but not many. I don't read too many books though I try my best to. It's just really hard for me to find something that fits my taste. Or maybe it's just hard to get my attention in general. But all I know is I do like to read and I do like to watch TV and movies it's just hard for me to find one that I enjoy. If you know what I mean. But sometimes I do like to escape reality in my own way. But I definitely would call myself an extremely realistic person.

  And even if he or she comes up to you and ask again. I know lying isn't good... but sometimes you just got to tell people no.. and if they are like.. asking like ""Well why? Why can't you loan me some???"" Just be like.. ""Man.. I feel that I need it for the things that I need in my life..."". and don't even go into detail about it just be like, "" I just feel like I got things I got to take care of too man.."" Even if it's 5 dollars. Just be like. I need that. Even penny counts. Seriously. Because at the end of the day you really do and it's honestly not a lie..
  
  And seriously every penny counts. I have a kid that comes to my store and collect all the pennies off the floor and honestly he could probably buy a car at this point. He has saved so many coins. Every penny counts absolutely. Every dollar especially every $5 especially.
  
  You got to be able to provide for yourself and then to be able to provide for another human being plus yourself. (If you were to get a girl and have kids think about that) (Girl's want a man that's going to be able to provide for a family and for herself and for himself. For them. The family.) This is important in life. Priorities.
  
  You have to learn to say no and if people get angry will then let them be angry. If they leave your life and that's you got to be able to provide for yourself to be able to provide for another human being plus yourself.
  
  This is important in life. You have to learn to say no and if people get angry will then let them be angry. If they leave your life. Then that's what was meant to be. The real people will stick around. The fake toxic people that want to use you will send out and leave your life and you'll have less stress.
  
  That's stressful. Feeling like you have to be responsible for that person at the moment. That's stressful especially when you don't want to be. Delete that stress from your life. It's on needed it's uncalled for.
  
  You don't have to do that. You can say no. Ya need to say no. It's okay to say no. ?

  I wouldn't exactly call myself popular on here but if you want to I appreciate the compliment.
  
  But I mean overall I have just been on this app for a really long time. Stay consistent. Come online and talk to your followers. These guys are like family to me. This app isn't just an app. I have met such an amazing people on this app. Friendship. Off of people your friendship. You get to meet so many different people from all over the world. I find it honestly and honor. Really cool and really awesome. I love culture and I love geography. So I guess you could say I find a love and having this app 3 and I'm also super patriotic and love representing my country. I'm proud to be an American and I'm proud to be alive.

You get more rewards ?when you get interesting & creative with your answers! ??(& try your best to stay respectful with your answers & try not to be too offending about the things that you say. It's okay to state your opinion but don't be ugly about your answer.)

  Thanks I really appreciate the compliments. I really try my best. I think it's funny the other day someone asked me do you acting different outside this app or are you the same?

I don't put on a show. This is really how I am. Today lady at told me. Said to me, ""You really are always happy aren't you?""

   and the bad thing about it i asked the person can he loan me some money and he sent it to me on cashapp but then he said he wanted it back so i sent it back to him cause i'm not like that at all
  ","
  Sometimes you have to be careful with borrowing money from certain people, because sometimes they get angry because they expect it back when they want it. And sometimes you don't have it when they want it. Bad things can happen to you. Especially if they know certain people. People can flip over just $15... I have heard of people robbing people for just that much.. It's crazy.. Sad.
  
  I don't borrow money from people period. And if I do I return it within a day or a week which honestly it's only a few dollars. And I still don't like to even borrow that. It to me just makes me feel a lack of independency in myself... Ya know? I always like to have my money right. If I have to sacrifice something then I will to make sure I have enough money for my bills and myself. I paid for the needs first and then the wants come second. I remember oh what do I have to pay this month? Water bill this that this that. Oh I need deodorant. I need that so I'm going to get that. I don't need a new pair of shoes if I already have a pair or two or even three. That clearly can wait. The needs are what you have to get. I make sure that I'm taking care of before asking for money. And if I have something I can sell to get money to be able to fix it then I will do that before even asking someone for money.
  "
31481,"
   Do you ever ignore text messages of your friends or family for no reason? Why or why not?
  ","
  I'm not exactly really ignoring them it's just because I'm doing 50 things at once or I'm with a customer and I can't answer it in front of a customer. I would get in a lot of trouble for that. While I'm on the job I'm not even supposed to have my phone but they allow me to have it. So I'm going to respect them and not use it while I'm with a customer. But usually right after I'm done with the customer I check my messages. But I always answer friends and family. Always. If it's a random stranger or advertisement or spam message sometimes I ignore them. Even strangers are usually immediately message back. Depending on who they are. I did a lot of messages. Especially a lot of stranger messages. I have to be really careful because some of them are really strange people. Some of them asking me really sexual nasty vulgar questions. Some of them asking me just disturbing things. And some of them trying to scam me and more. That's why a lot of the times I only answer your family and friends. But this is only just because I get literally a ton of messages. Sometimes it's hard to get to all of them there so many. Can get frustrating at times.

  Literally just as I was sending this to you and talkin about memory issues I had someone call me and I forgot to give them something LOL literally everyone has a flaw and makes mistakes. I admit to it. I think it's slightly frustrating but funny at the same time but at least I try right? I explain that to them and they already knew and they said it's okay. I do it all the time it's not like I'm not going to see them tomorrow. It's not more or less more of a procrastinating type thing I'm literally forgetting on accident. I literally do hundreds of things per day and have thousands of thoughts going through my mind. Making the list is out of the question. I would probably have a book.

31484,"
   What do you call someone who calim they love you but owe you money and then have alot of nerve to ask you for money but you turn them down cause you feel like they was trying to use you?
  ","
  Using.
  
  Someone using.
  
  And then.
  
  Slightly attention-seeking.
  
  But this is just my personal opinion because I've had this happen to me before but not exactly a relationship just a person. And that's what I referred them to someone using you and then someone that's slightly attention-seeking. Basically they like the attention that you give them. You make them feel loved. That's the sight in a relationship more than a friendship. But mine was more of a friendship but again I take them as a using attention-seeking type person.
  
  I never really got stuck in these situations too much because the minute they started doing it I usually cut them off because I'm not gonna be their bank.
  
  I work hard for the things that I get in life and I work hard for my money. And I'm not about to sit there and just hands just someone that didn't do anything for it. That should be the thought that you think of. You're not a bank. You're not anyone's bank.
  
  And sometimes the person that's giving them the money doesn't see that. But honestly if anyone regardless of their quote on quote feelings for you. If they're literally just getting money from you and leaving that's what they're doing. They're using you. Sometimes you just have to have someone on the outside to tell you that.

   Why do jealousy hurts so damn big time?!!!!
  ","
  I always tell people jealousy isn't a good thing.
  
  Jealousy he can break up friendships, relationships and even make family members break apart.
  
  Jealousy is not really isn't good. I mean of course everyone is going to be somewhat jealous and/but that's okay. But when you're going to be an obsessed person and just envy people all the time and everyone around you and constantly just be angry at them because they're successful over because they worked for that... that's not good.
  
  An ex. of little jealously.
  
  Okay jealously.
  
  Being like... I wish I had her hair or thise shoes.. or I wish that I could sing or jump or run like that. That's different but when you goes to the extent of being angry and cutting her hair off or tripping her while she's running. Or taking her things just because you can't have it so you think she can't have it... then that's when jealousy is taken too far. (Not saying you're that jealous, no) I'm just saying jealousy can hurt in ways depending... Like it and your character.. Reputation.. I know a lot of people say I don't care what people think of you but do you honestly want people to think that you're selfish? And lazy? It won't amount to nothing. Then fine.
  
  But watch how you(anyone) are being jealous.
  
  Or really honestly just be yourself and be happy with what you are. Try and stay determined and be passionate. Have self esteem and confidence in yourself. Be proud of the person you are and there's no reason to be jealous of other people. ??

I don't know if I would be with anyone or not but I would be fine with that. I wouldn't want to be with anyone else but my husband. He does everything for me and is my world. He spoils me and protect me and make me feel special every single day. The way we met is such a wonderful love story to me and him. I would never want anything else.
  
  Maybe I'd be traveling or something. But since I'm settled down and happy where I'm at. Me and him eventually are going to do that. But if I wasn't with him I probably would have still did that alone sadly. But it's okay. We're like I said I honestly don't exactly know where I would be without my better half.

  Yes but I don't do it because I'm not fully certified I would only ride with a meteorologist if I was to do it. I don't encourage people that have not had experience and inwhich I have. I have slight experience with storm chasing but I wouldn't exactly call it chasing it just happened while I was there. But I love the subject. Love researching the subject. Was gonna go to school for but decided not to. Really hard a lot of time almost seven to eight years of schooling and it's really expensive. The most definitely love learning and researching about the weather. Watching it. Mother nature is definitely interesting.
  
  But I would definitely not encourage you to go storm chasing if you're not in a safe vehicle and you're if you're not riding with someone that is certified or at least knows what they're doing.
  
  A lot of people go storm chasing that don't know what they're doing and end up becoming a victim of being killed by mother nature. Mother nature is going to do what he wants to do. And it's 100% unpredictable fully

   If me and my girlfriend are in long distance but she hates FaceTime should that upset me if all we do is text or should I say something cuz I really wanna hear her voice
  ","
  Communication is key. Any kind of communication. And you two should be able to communicate in anyway you can comfortably. Respectfully. That's the best answer I can give you. If she's not wanting to properly communicate with you then things might not be going the way that they should with you two. That's just my opinion though. If I was in a relationship where someone did not want to properly communicate with me then I would think something is not going right and it might not be meant to be. Which of course if she feels comfortable with doing that that's different. Just depends... But sadly this is me being honest. Hope the best for you though. Hope you guys can work things out.
  
  I was in a long distance relationship for almost 5 years and had to keep in constant communication with my now husband. ? Me and him are doing wonderful now are together and married. I will tell you now communication is 100% in the answer to a relationship. Having a friendship and having a relationship with a person and having self-control and patience. Being able to work together and agree and disagree on things together. If you don't have these things you're not going to be able to stay together in a long distance relationship or even a regular relationship. Face-to-face. A long-distance relationship requires a ton of patience. Hope I helped.

   When you go out to eat at a restaurant do you have a ""usual order"" and get the same thing all the time... Or do you try something new each time?
  ","
  A lot of times I order the same thing but I also like to try different things too
  
  Even sometimes I'll order both and I will just get a to-go plate. And just try something new because you never know you might not like it. So I honestly think it's okay to order the same thing but maybe order something else on the side and try it and if you like that the next time get that. Usually when I'm with two or three people though because that I have helped to eat it.

    @TylerSaft
   
   this is a continuation of the last question and answer that you have been talking about me with. We were talking about a paranormal and a camera
  ","
  Why the reason and having so many duplicates of certain equipment? If you may wonder. The reason why you want to have so many/much as b/c you would be surprised how much energy is taken from your batteries camera & lights & other electric tools that you use on your investigations. Spirits feed off of energy and electric tools that are full of energy. That's why sometimes when you're on investigations and start to feel funny that means they're feeding off of your energy. And then you start to notice shortly after a lot of activity. Spirits made energy to be able to create that activity. Usually negative spirits feed the most off of people and equipment because they're the ones that want to cause more activity and more noticing. Usually that's the case. Or a lonely or sad Spirit. Usually a negative spirits in general. So that's why you want to bring more lights because if you're out at night investigating and your camera lights go off you need to have your phone light and your phone all the way charged but sometimes your phone will die. You'll notice that your phone is at a full charge and then miraculously after a 25-minute investigation your phone is weirdly at 15% or even dead and no service for some reason. And then say for instant you bring a couple of flashlights in your backpack you go to turn one on it doesn't turn on for some odd reason the brand new batteries that you put in it's are dead. You check the next flashlight it works for 5 minutes and then dies. Then you have no lights right? So if you have the extra camera lights then you're good. Should always bring backup plans when investigating at night.
  
  Then batteries for your camera? Why so many? The same thing happens to your camera batteries. They will die so you need more batteries just in case if the one your camera died and another one just in case it up and dies and honestly another one at that one dies. I have seen up to four batteries died in the same 30 minute for some investigators. Backup plans

   Hi me again from yesterday  would you suggest any of these for ghost hunting?   #1:
   
    https://www.amazon.ca/Spectrum-Camcorders-Infrared-Paranormal-Investigation/dp/B07BD3KJLV
   
   or  #2:
   
    https://www.amazon.ca/1080p-Infrared-Vision-Spectrum-Camcorder/dp/B00CCUYSPY
   
   ?  if so which one or if both?
  ","
  I mean either one of those or any night infrared camera is good for at night ghost hunting. You don't always have to go at night either. Activity happens throughout the day regardless but it's always good to get an infrared night vision camera just in case that night if you want something to help you out to see more. And of course they have night vision where you can turn off all the lights and all you can see in the camera is either a little white light or a little green light that's only seen by your viewers and the only thing you can see is through the camera to walk. And then of course the camera in general helps to see at night a lot better. You can even get a regular camera and just make sure that has night vision on it and you can buy one of those. You don't have to specifically buy one of those you listing. But of course if you I want one of those then sure. But Canon Cameras are really good.
  
  I recommend going to Best Buy so you can fiddle with the camera a lot before buying it. I find their service very good. Of course if you have one in the area. Regardless of covid-19 I would not buy a camera online. You are going to want to touch it and mess with it before buying it.
  
  You're also going to want a few lights for the camera. I would suggest getting three to four lights because your lights will get drain really easily. Always have fresh lights on you. Especially when you're out ghost hunting at night.
  
  Do not ever go ghost hunting by yourself. Bring at least two or three people and do not split up. This is my #1 rule with ghost hunting. You can split up into 2 groups or more, but do not ever go by yourself because you never know what could happen to you. Crazy people in the world and you could accidentally trip and hurt yourself or worse.
  
  When buying a camera you also want to get at least 4 to 5 batteries because battery life won't last long on cameras and if you're going to want to record all day long or long videos you're going to need lots of batteries.

   that sounds like so much fun! I am pretty new to ghost hunting myself but have been interested in ghosts, spirits and the such since I was about 8 years old,  I am researching and learning as much as i can each week and have bought a book  on communicating with spirits via electronics and spirit --
  ","
  Yeah I got interested at a really young age too. Ever since then I just always have been researching it. I definitely encourage you to make sure that you research a lot before using certain tools because it can get really dangerous. You could be communicating with things that are 100% human and can follow you and attached itself to you. But also can attach itself to your home or objects. And it's really hard to get rid of the entity especially if it's attached to you. So I definitely encourage you to be really careful when using certain tools which I'm sure you're aware of already. But with that empty being attached to you it's not a pleasant experience it can be really dangerous to not just you but the people around you so just keep that in mind. But I give you great respect in researching the Paranormal because it's a very different subject. A very touchy subject. Very controversial. A lot of Skeptics. All the physics of it all it's just intriguing to me. It's always been.

  Yes. Especially if I get asked or if it's a dollar or two. Especially if they're doing food drives in the area because I'm helping people now and that are there and that are in my area. Sometimes you get hundreds upon thousands of different charities that people want me to donate to. If I had Millions I would donate each and every one of the charities hundreds of dollars but every now and I try my best to donate a dollar or two or even $5. I love helping people. I dedicated most of my life to volunteer work and helping the homeless people that are struggling with food and natural disasters water clothes and more.

  I most definitely don't mind making new friends but it depends on the ones that I keep very close to me and trust with certain things.

Of being friendly anyone and everyone and not judging and being open-minded but at the same time knowing their limits say who they know and what they say and do they trust. You just don't want to go around telling everyone your personal business.

   Btw, I still don't understand how these wonder boxes make the voice of spirits so clear, without any static noise... Maybe you know?
  ","
  I don't actually know the complete and utter physics of makings of the actual fantastic Wonder Box. (I know some mechanics and how to use) but's very hard to make it and takes forever and it's really expensive. I can tell you this, there are plenty of apps that to don't require the static noise (cost like 10-15-20 bucks) and frequency noise to speak back and forth with spirits or entities. Those apps are actually legit. I made sure of it and they're actually made by paranormal teams and used by real paranormal teams and they have been proven to be real by paranormal enthusiasts. The two real apps that work are the ""Necrophonic App, and there's one other one, Dead Wave.""
  
  Again, you don't have to have the static noise everytime. Old Ghost Boxes were made with the static noise radio frequency changing b/c that was the only thing they had back when that 1st Ghost Box was made but technology has boomed over the years and now they have been able to make a real Ghost Box without the sound of white noise.
  
  But I do warn you when using a Ghost Box or The Wonder Box, that you can actually communicate with something that is unhuman and dangerous. You're not always talking to a spirit. You have to be really careful when using a Ghost Box or any type of communication device or object (Ouija board) b/c you can have something really negative follow you or get connected to your house or a object of use during the communicate session aka seance. You want to be careful not conjure up something... You want to know what you're doing. You have to know the right proceedings to starting a safe and proper seance. People always get too intrigued and just jump into it too fast before searching and then they make the mistake and then they conjure something and it follows them. And it's really hard to get it off of them even with self-healing.
  
  So I do warn you before doing anything of the above as crazy as it sounds. Make sure you do your research before using any type of paranormal tools.

  ","
  Yes. I have done tons of research on house paranormal. With the kinds of things that our research and do I had to research Health considering he's a big part of the Paranormal world. There's many people that use the Spirit box and it works with them. A lot of people are pretty surprised with the results.
  
  But are you referring to the Wonder box or the real Spirit Box? Cuz they have a static Spirit Box and then they have a Wonder box. The Wonder Box as a super duper higher class Ghost Box basically. It's literally sound waves that allow spirits to speak back and forth almost like a telephone. Trying to figure out which one you're meaning. I'm guessing you're meaning the Wonder Box. The regular static ghost box is almost like a first-level crap and goes box LOL. But Wonderbox, if your meaning that, if so yes he communicates with Spirits better than ever. With that device. The Wonder box actually takes months almost a year to make because it's so hard to make and it can be anywhere from two or three if not more thousand dollars. They're really expensive and he can make them for people but he only makes him for people that are paranormal trained. I find the Wonder Box extremely intriguing. I have done a ton of research on it. Very interesting. Very cool. I consider high-class paranormal tool using.

  You shouldn't just ask a bunch of random people on a site? It's up to you what you want to go to school for. It's your life. Your future and your money. What do you love more? What do you enjoy more? Ask yourself those questions and then choose. If you don't know about neither then I'm not sure if either of them are for you. You should want to go to school for something you enjoy doing and you like doing.

   14. have you ever have an online relationship? how did that go?

  Yep. Me and my husband were in a long distance relationship for about four and a half to five years before we finally got to be together for good. Me and him met online on the Xbox 360 on a game called Grand Theft Auto V. We met almost seven years ago. Unexpectedly by the way. I've always played video games since I was really really young like three or four or five years old. I've always loved playing video games and then when I reached the age 12 or 13 I started playing online and then when I was about 13 or 14 and got my first Xbox and then a few years down online I met all kinds of cool friends and friends like family online. And then randomly in a Lobby of Grand Theft Auto I made friends with Jason from the start. We made really good friends at the beginning and then soon after started dating met a few months later (6-7) and then kept going back and forth for a few years and then you got engaged (2018) and then a few years later we got married and now we're together and happy. Better than ever. Long-distance gamer couple. Nothing's impossible.  ❤??

   hi! i just started ask, do you have advice for any new ppl like me? x
  ","
  Well you just got a new follower ✔. Me. People will follow you when they see you question on my page.
  
  And I ask a lot of questions too. So be aware. This afternoon I'm going to be sending out a lot of questions.
  
  My advice to you is don't let people troll you on here. There are people on here that are on here specifically just for that. There are people on here to ask you super personal questions and judge you for them and make fun of you. I would probably not put your mental health issues on here either... Or just be careful about that subject. Some trolls will make fun of you about them. (If you have any issues of course I wouldn't know) Me just saying that for you to look out for you... Warning you. I would never do this but these anonymous sometimes witll. But yes Ask. is working on trying to get rid of those kinds of people. Be careful and try to ignore the questions especially if they come an anonymous and start asking you a ton of questions at once that just don't even make any sense.
  
  I would probably not answer too personal of questions like... where do you live exactly and any type of financial questions if they get too specific about them I probably wouldn't answer them. Don't give like... all sorts of specific questions on what you look and stuff. People could be trying to steal your identity or take your money or worse. Find you. And that isn't always a good thing... Their intentions is what I mean. They have catfish on here so be careful with that also. Me just looking out for you... A lot of new girls on here don't pay attention and aren't careful. There have been so many girls that have gotten catfished on here it's crazy and other apps.
  
  But over all this app is all around wonderful and you can meet lots of good friends.
  
  I have just learned to ignore the haters and trolls.
  
   Just remember none of these people know you fully so there's no reason to get upset about anything they say because they don't actually know you. Right? Good luck! Welcome!
