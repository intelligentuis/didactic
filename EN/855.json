However when michael our oldest brother and the oldest child of my siblings was young our mom, found an interview where a 14 year old girl  was talking about college and how she was just soaring and excelling. My mom was fascinated by her story,  but was a bit wary of the idea because homeschooling wasn't very common at the time in the early 90s. My mom however went to public schools and did not enjoy her experience at all. Due to bullying, and skipping grades she would sometimes be bored and waiting for the lecture to be over with. So she wanted us to advance at our own pace instead of being rushed or forced. And be able to skip grades if that was what was best for us. Her and dad decided to home school all of us from k-12 and developed their own curriculum which focused on Latin, greek, classic literature, catholic faith and critical thinking. Mom wanted us to have to learn to think for ourselves, to be curious and love learning, and to have strong moral compasses. she signed  us up for every activity possible in our  area- swim team, musical theatre, basketball, gymnastics, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, karate, and many more. We all grew up to be a loud, vibrant bunch. We were very well \u201csocialized\u201d and had a lot of friends. Most people didn\u2019t guess we were homeschooled when they met us because of our social and people skills.\n  \n\n  To this day, we all count our homeschool experience as one of the greatest tools in our lives and careers. Because of homeschooling, we have had a lot of free time to learn instruments, practice singing and harmonizing, and write songs. Homeschooling gave us the space to be free to be ourselves. Being unique and independent was highly valued in the Cimorelli household; we were not told to \u201cfit into the mold.\u201d This ideal shaped our music and decisions for years to come\n  ","917470":"\n  We had a really bad storm last night, some places are flooded in Tennessee...\n  \n\n   https:\/\/fox17.com\/news\/local\/flooding-hits-gatlinburg-pigeon-forge\n  \n","917471":"\n  Never ...

I\u2019ve been trying to achieve balance and peace for so long but I\u2019ve consistently been anxious and overwhelmed and stressed pretty much all the time. Last week I talked about implementing new routines which I\u2019ve been doing for about 3 weeks now and this week I feel like they\u2019re actually working! I think I got the night routine down and my week structure down, but still working on a morning routine that works for me. The biggest thing I think that\u2019s helping me is taking Monday and Wednesday night as self care nights. I don\u2019t look at my phone, and I take the whole night from like 7:00 on to do whatever kind of relaxing\/enjoyable things I wanna do. Not laying in my bed watching Netflix tho, stuff like doing a face mask, clean my room, taking a shower, dancing, songwriting, whatever it is just putting myself first in that time. Knowing that I have those nights coming up makes me more relaxed in general too cause if I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed or stressed I\u2019m like ok well I know on Monday and Wednesday I get to relax, so there\u2019s a light at the end of this tunnel \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc I\u2019m also adopting a new mindset that\u2019s like I can only do what I can do. I don\u2019t need to do everything everyday. I identify what the most important things are to do for the week and then plan them in and if I don\u2019t have time for them, I plan them into next week. I used to feel like the more I do, the more worth I have as a person, but that\u2019s not true at all. At this point I would rather be relaxed and fulfilled, instead of doing as many things as I possibly can and then burning out all the time. Realizing too that when I\u2019m relaxed and feel balanced, I do better work and I\u2019m more creative so really it\u2019s a win win. Also I released a music video yesterday for my song #BrownEyedBoys go check it out if you haven\u2019t seen it!
