hardest to compete against others who may or may not be slightly better than them to impress others such as a judge . which is why justin bieber for example in his one movie people were worried with him being so young and singing and touring and loosing his voice , singing through strep that he would permanently damage his vocals because he wasnt matured or train to do that . as seen here . . . lisa was sick in and we were on tour , my sister lisa is a high in the band as well as me but my voice wasn t fully matured or trained to hit her vocals at the time and i was also dancing as well and

next to her and saw her choke the first time and the others were busy focusing on the chat","791150":"i always got yelled at for doing dumb stuff such as pitch screaming","791151":"i don t try to loose my voice completely . when it starts to cut out and my throat is burning i go on vocal voice rest","791152":"probably because she knows her voice is not as strong and needs to rest but she likes
