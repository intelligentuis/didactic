  Grandpa- he was my first funeral to attend. Fought in world war 2. One of the boat guys. Greek but didn't learn the language. He'd ask me how school was even on weekends and about my best friend. We didn't have a strong relationship.
  
  Mom's side:
  
  Nana - She's the only living one still, 90. I like how she used to be a hair model. Looks elegant in old pictures. The way she carries herself. Hate how she's getting dementia.
  
  Grandpa- I was the closest with him. He'd play games with my sister and I. Felt more like a father figure at times. Makes me want that grow old with type love. They almost hit 50 years together but died before that. They were planning a cruise for that time :(

  ""Consider a tree for a moment. As beautiful as trees are to look at, we don't see what goes on underground - as they grow roots. Trees must develop deep roots in order to grow strong and produce their beauty. But we don't see the roots. We just see and enjoy the beauty. In much the same way, what goes on inside of us is like the roots of a tree.""

   What do you like about Socrates?
  ","
  The whole ""know ourselves"", to be honest and do what we know to be right‚Äînot to hide behind the herd. Sheep mentality. Use your mind and believe in the right practices. Question everything.
  
  These quotes are pretty great too.
  
  I decided that it was not wisdom that enabled poets to write their poetry, but a kind of instinct or inspiration, such as you find in seers and prophets who deliver all their sublime messages without knowing in the least what they mean.
  
  False words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil.
  
  Where there is reverence there is fear, but there is not reverence everywhere that there is fear, because fear presumably has a wider extension than reverence.
  
  Worthless people live only to eat and drink; people of worth eat and drink only to live.
  
  Death may be the greatest of all human blessings.

  I don't remember what language it was in. Might have been subtitles, can't remember. I'd say french, Danish, Dutch, or Italian if it wasn't English.

  Had the idea to take a bath. Was looking for my di.ldo to accompany me. The house I was in was all weird.. i kept going in and out of rooms. Passing doors on the way too. Opened one door and it was like a lab inside. There was a doctor lady looking at brains and hearts on the monitor. Talking about blood and stuff. Was weird. Remember asking how mine was and they didn't tell me. Just kept on looking at the screen and seemed like they were digging for something..
  
  then there was a wall of doors that you'd exit.. seemed like a school or factory type thing. There were a ton of boxes piled up in front of one of those doors. Some male doctor was yelling at me.

She ended up getting pregnant and I guess quit going to college because of it. There was another girl that we befriended but that didn't really go anywhere outside of school either.
  
  There was only like one girl that I had a lot of classes with and would see often enough but didn't hangout with outside of school either.

  ","
  Graduated in 2007, went right to college. I ended up taking a semester off in 2010 since my paperwork got messed up which didn't help the depression at that time. Went back once the new semester came. Was still friends with her at the time. Activities included zumba, walking and at home workouts. I didn't end up finishing my degree. Had 2-3 classes left, math and science and during that time we were moving (2014)
  
  I joined the gym around 2014 and that really helped me see more results. I would still gain a little,  maintain and lose weight. Glad I found out it was due to pcos and all that. Metformin and doing keto the last few years.
  
  I've never been married. I have had crushes at times but nothing ever came of them.

   It kind of answers the question, but there must be more. Like your social circles must have changed, your interactions with other people, your environment, your attitudes...you know, more substantial sht than how much you drank.
  ","
  Not too much. We kind of all went our separate ways after graduating high school. Only one stayed since we ended up  going to the same college. Nothing changed with that friendship at the time. Then she ended up graduating and going on to a different college which I didn't see her much then. Her stepdad also died. Which kind of made her talk to me even less. We still have eachother on social media but haven't talked in a while. It's sad seeing old memories since used to comment a lot...
  
  My best friend is still my best friend. Its different though since she has three kids. But ya, we always start right back where we left off.
  
  In Maine, it was more family friends there. Including a friend that's like another sister to me. There's not really anyone around my age and if there was they'd end up being alcoholics and into weed or other drugs. Never really looked or said anything to me.
  
  I don't really feel like my interactions changed besides ones already mentioned. I've always had a ""shy"" sizing people up vibe.
  
  Environment has been MA to Maine and AZ. It's hard meeting new people. Some aren't friendly when I try or never see again. I had plans on meeting new people in 2020 but coronavirus decided to screw that up even more currently. Literally had some hiking and shopping trips planned with people on meetup.
  
  I don't think my attitude has changed at all.

  I thought it was more rhetorical. Quite frankly I'm tired of always going over it on here, my own mind etc
  
  If the ex wants to know certain things then he should do so in private or in person.
  
  I don't feel like anyone else should need to know everything that happened. People need to stop acting so entitled on here because I don't give everything away. When I do say things they take it too far. When I even mention a guy, I'm hounded with questions. Whenever relationships are mentioned someone has to bring up my last one.
  "
473416,"
   You can think back to those times and try and figure out what happened. It was obviously a different time of life, and you attracted a particular type of guy.

  Think that's more about the people in question instead of a gender dynamic. Effort, the things shared, common interests and goals. Lots of things can make a relationship better but i wouldn't pinpoint one is better than the other in a general sense. Mental wellbeing could play a role too. The way you treat eachother. So many factors enter into the relationship.

Even said that I was hungry a few minutes before the light headedness lol
  
  That hasn't really happened before. I've fainted at the dr once because he told a bad joke. If I fainted at other times it was because I was sick or not taking the best care of myself but it was never an open display like that. More in the bathroom taking a shower and got too hot or whatever.

  I was just thinking that he should have slept with Martin's mom to make them better. Seemed like he had an antidote to the madness? Didn't have to get as far as it did. He clearly didn't like the son that much to begin with. They never really interacted.. he was always with the daughter having her sing and whatnot. Kind of got creepy vibes from the dad at times.. like did he engage with his daughter before? Seemed like he lingered too much.. kept going back and forth on if he did something with Martin before or just his mom. Like what type of doctor would show his body to a teen? lol
  
  The mom doing the hj to that doctor. Looked freaking miserable but then had a smile at one time. Yikes XD
  
  The ending was creepy. Like did killing one of the offspring make it suddenly disappear or did he legit do the mom? Think she was the one in the opening scene and not his actual wife? Wonder if the daughter still liked Martin even after all that lol you'd think he'd be locked away or something.

Two  workers came over and talked to us. Taking names of us and made the guys leave to their suite. The people that talked with us ended up getting another person that was on a golf cart and they made that dude follow behind us as we walked out. They were all never come back and stuff lol

  - having an open mind can help. Go on when you feel like it.. better conversations can happen. If you feel down then that might not be the best time to look/talk to someone.
  
  - sometimes I feel like the only one putting in effort. If someone is more reserved, only one sided then they probably aren't as invested in you/the conversation.
  
  - I end up unmatching people if they haven't replied in forever, felt no connection with, can't remember why I matched them in the first place, boring conversation. I'd rather not waste energy on people who also didn't feel anything.
  
  - be real. Take decent pictures. Have a good profile.
  
  - maybe ask a guy out if you feel like the guy is hesitant of asking you.
  
  - trust gut instincts about the person. Most guys who ask for sc probably aren't serious of actually wanting someone etc

Seemed odd when tried offering her money to leave. Shocked when he was punching/kicking her like that later on. Felt bad for the mom too.

  You input old period lengths and the days. Will make a ""trend"" out of it following how many days apart and the lengths given. It will tell you when you should ovulate and also tracks period. You can track symptoms, protected/unprotected s*x, mood, morning after pill, discharge types, bc

  Earlier in March she mentioned her mom having pneumonia and her children have still been seeing her.
  
  I think her daughter is better. Haven't heard anything new about her. Apparently they were saying it was croup, chest and ear infection. Then said that she didn't have an ear infection so they didn't end up giving her medication. Which is really weird since she was throwing up, fever of 100+, flu symptoms galore. Apparently they gave her a steroid shot though. Not really sure how that would help much. She's not even a year yet.
  
  She's been shaky, sore throat. Talked about sneezing and runny nose in a different post. Her fever was only in the 99's.. will be getting zithromicin for it.

  Nope. Hard to read things far away.

476002,"
   Do you believe love is real?
  ","
  Yes.
  
  I think sometimes it can be an illusion too. Not loving someone enough as they should. Or when relationships die and you then know that it wasn't real love. Atleast that's how it felt with the guy I dumped. No real feelings after the breakup. Found someone new and that taught me the realness of love, how it should be.

   Were you a troublemaker as a kid?
  ","
  I was an angel that didn't get caught üôÉ
  
  Nah, great kid.
  
  Teen... I shoplifted with my best friend a few times. Got kicked out of a resort.. trespassing. We were leaving anyways so it's funny they stopped us and got escorted out by the golf cart following behind us. I smoked cigarettes at 15, haven't since. Trouble by association I suppose XD The family friend that died lately actually would call my friend ""trouble"" at times as a nickname. Here comes trouble and all that XD I wasn't into drinking that much back then either. I've tried more alcohol in latter years but still rarely too.

   But if a guy is ugly isn‚Äôt it a waste of your time and effort to try talking to him back when you could easily talk to better people.
  ","
  Yes. Even if he was more good looking and there wasn't a genuine connection with the person then you are still wasting your time and theirs. A fact some people forget especially when dating is involved. If I dont mesh with someone easily then I don't see the point of still talking to them too.
  
  Some would most likely still call that picky but it's kind of normal? lol. Why waste time on people when it doesn't feel right? Anyways, I go for personality over looks. I also still need an attraction to the person.
  
  I was thinking in general terms/being nice.. not really wanting to date the person way. If personality was better, liked other things about them, got along well then them being ""less than"" in the looks department wouldnt matter as much as long as I still felt something for them.

  I'd rather trust them.  If someone was younger/older and we got along well then age wouldn't matter. I like 2-5 year age gaps.. them being older is more ideal. I've dated younger before and we were just at different levels in life.
  
  I got odd vibes from the 26 yr old and just didn't want to talk that way with him when barely know anything about him. That would have been more of a distraction than anything else. I don't always need to talk to people that way. Plus I'm sure someone at 26 is more into parties and that lifestyle instead of wanting a family etc

  We both didn't love eachother like we should have.
  
  My best friend set me up with him. Think he liked her a bit... but the main thing was that his ex was coming back into the picture. We just distanced ourselves from one another after that. I didn't feel like fighting, didn't feel like I had a chance. I assume they got back together ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Øhe died a few years ago.

   How come your teacher told you about your great aunt's death?
  ","
  I was absent and he read the obituary which mentioned my name or last name.. made the connection. He came up and was all ""sorry about your loss"" it was weird. I was like what? ü§£ then he explained about seeing something. I was like ""I hope not"" about losing someone.
  
  Didn't see anything in the paper or online that day.. ended up hearing about it from a family friend a bit too late and everything clicked into place.

  Civilization :p
  
  A lot of information that wasn't covered in my other history classes. Getting a bit tired so nothing is really jumping out at me straight off the bat. Lots of British history though.
  
  Also about the teacher's ""lady friend"".
  
  The teacher was also the one to tell me that my dad's aunt died. He thought I knew. It was awkward to say the least since he didn't give a name. Just mentioned how it was someone older, naturally, I thought of my nana and called my mom afterwards asking her if she was still alive.
  "
476689,"

  Mom - yes
  
  Dad - not really. I was concerned when he apparently went missing though. Turns out he left his phone at work over the weekend. My mom and some other people were calling him for a few days. Didn't look like he'd been to the house. My friend ended up driving past to see if he was there before going home and his car was there. Made her uncle go over afterwards to figure out what happened/where he been XD

  That I was bad for talking to guys in that way ü§£ that I should have more self respect.  Idk stuff along that line but he'd go way more in depth too.  Like he'd say something, we'd be good again and he'd take it even further. Dude made me cry lol
  
  And the whole time he was still trying to be one of those guys.
  "
476700,"
   Would you agree that most people wouldn't want to have someone as a guest if he is know to have a drug problem together with his mother who is also known to have a drug problem?
  ","
  Yes but I also wouldn't single people out like that. Especially when they've never even met the people. If someone didn't have a place to go then I'd be accepting like a true Christian would? I wouldnt purposely try hurting people with a cryptic blessing either. I wouldn't even acknowledge them not being there then. Like none of us were going to go. It was a huge ordeal.
  
  Also the 2nd time meeting her whereas the bf was in the picture for years and now a problem??
  "
476701,"

  "
476706,"
   What do you dislike about Christianity?
  ","
  The ones that give it a bad name. When it only benefits them and not the people involved. Being two-faced.
  
  My uncle's 2nd wife was hosting Thanksgiving once and my sister's bf at the time and his mom were into drugs, they had nowhere to go. It really shouldn't have been a problem.. her being Christian and all ü§£ They didn't end up going in any case.. but my parents and I did. She literally made a blessing about them finding a place to go and all this other crap.. like damn, lady. Clearly don't mean that since could have been fine. Made everyone miserable the whole day leading up to it.  Thought my mom was going to attack her at the dinner table ü§£ü§£ü§£ on top of that, she didn't ever meet them either.. just so petty.

  I know someone who has a farm and they are pissed off because the Mexican workers they hired (with visas they pointed out) are scared to come here. Meanwhile she's also all ""the gym might close"" so they will close the farm instead of actually getting work done? Seems like they'd bust their ass to get it done because of the gym closing and for a living. I'm sure neighbors would help out as well. Weird how she wouldn't think of all the options she could do and just throws in the towel so quickly. I'm sure deadlines matter but ya...
  
  She literally wrote ""we no longer have a job"". It's produce... pretty sure wheat, hay, corn and other farming would be more of a battle. Really hope she reconsiders just closing up like that. Wouldnt you fight and exhaust all options? Seemed like she just found out and venting instead of looking at everything they still could do.

  It could be that way..
  
  More like it's been years for me (pcos). Like 2018 was the last real time.. and then I spotted in December, had cramps and everything else but more a phantom period.

  I  based my cycle and all that off of the fitbit one and it told me 8 days which would be the day that I actually ""planned"" to get it.

   paranoia is a sign of a guilt complex. you should look into guilt complexes. kidding initially but serious with the latter. those of us that have guilt complexes can live a life and not even be aware. maybe a book. im fascinated myself and will probably do a bit of a search and skim. im no reader.

   (Most) guys don't suck. If you're being curved or are just attracting low quality guys, I would take a good, *HONEST* look at yourself and ask what _you_ have to offer, and whether it's worth it to a _man_ of quality. There's a lot more to quality than weight.
  ","
  Good advice but seems a tad condescending too. Especially the last part since I really don't care about my weight these days. I know not all guys suck.. just the simplest thing I could think of instead of repeating myself from earlier. The situation sucks, not the person.

  Guys suck

  "
477390,"
   So it turns out you've never actually had sx with a guy. That's fascinating.
  ","
  Just because someone is private about that doesn't mean anything. Not everyone needs to know what has gone down or if condoms or other bc happened. You guys take things way too far if an inch is given.
  
  Also don't get how shaming someone for not having s*x or not being s*xually active at the current moment is such a bad thing either. Odd how you care about other people's s*x lives or lack of one more than your own.
  "
477391,"
