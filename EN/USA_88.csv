  With her, he's more go, go, go type thing, pulling her. Won't stop to wait. I'll be telling him stuff and he'll listen to me 🤣

  Dad's parents;
  
  Grandma- I don't remember her. She died when I was really young. Only know her from pictures and things said. Sewed a lot, drank, amazing cook.
  
  Grandpa- he was my first funeral to attend. Fought in world war 2. One of the boat guys. Greek but didn't learn the language. He'd ask me how school was even on weekends and about my best friend. We didn't have a strong relationship.
  
  Mom's side:
  
  Nana - She's the only living one still, 90. I like how she used to be a hair model. Looks elegant in old pictures. The way she carries herself. Hate how she's getting dementia.
  
  Grandpa- I was the closest with him. He'd play games with my sister and I. Felt more like a father figure at times. Makes me want that grow old with type love. They almost hit 50 years together but died before that. They were planning a cruise for that time :(

  ""Consider a tree for a moment. As beautiful as trees are to look at, we don't see what goes on underground - as they grow roots. Trees must develop deep roots in order to grow strong and produce their beauty. But we don't see the roots. We just see and enjoy the beauty. In much the same way, what goes on inside of us is like the roots of a tree.""

  Not sure if I'll have any dessert later. It's still been keto friendly if I do.
  
  * hummus and clementines aren't the best on keto but I've still had at times. It doesn't effect me much at this point.

  ","
  The whole ""know ourselves"", to be honest and do what we know to be right—not to hide behind the herd. Sheep mentality. Use your mind and believe in the right practices. Question everything.
  
  These quotes are pretty great too.
  
  I decided that it was not wisdom that enabled poets to write their poetry, but a kind of instinct or inspiration, such as you find in seers and prophets who deliver all their sublime messages without knowing in the least what they mean.
  
  False words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil.
  
  Where there is reverence there is fear, but there is not reverence everywhere that there is fear, because fear presumably has a wider extension than reverence.
  
  Worthless people live only to eat and drink; people of worth eat and drink only to live.
  
  Death may be the greatest of all human blessings.

   Pretty much same as here. The only difference I’ve seen here is more people wearing masks. I don’t wear them myself unless I have to. Like when I go inside a customer’s home. We’re told if we don’t wear it we’re fired. I only leave home for work, you?

  I feel like people are only wearing masks and gloves when they go to the grocery store here. Or if an essential worker, existing conditions, sick etc

  It's fine. I don't always show my serious side on here. Idk people don't always understand my humor or bluntness. Sagittarius and Boston thing XD they definitely don't understand how I'm single, not married or have kids.. always getting shit on all of those points. Not everyone has kids at the same time etc
  
  I suppose that depends on who I'm being compared to.. a mom would be more mature (granted that's not ALWAYS the case either) some people who are married aren't always mature much either. Just because they have a label attached to them doesn't make them way more mature than others ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  A ten-year-old mattress weighs double what it did when it was new due to debris that it absorbs over time. That debris includes dust mites (their droppings and decaying bodies), mold, millions of dead skin cells, dandruff, animal and human hair, secretions, excretions, lint, pollen, dust, soil, sand, and a lot of perspiration, which the average person loses at a rate of a quart a day. Good night!

  A rainbow can be seen only in the morning or late afternoon. It can occur only when the sun is 40 degrees or less above the horizon.
  
  An average of 100 people choke to death on ballpoint pens every year.
  
  You are more likely to be infected by flesh-eating bacteria than you are to be struck by lightning.
  
  According to Genesis 1:20-22, the chicken came before the egg.
  
  Like fingerprints, everyone's tongue print is differentBabies is born without kneecaps. They appear between the ages of 2 and 6.

She worked at kohl's when in high school and some college. Then worked at a consignment shop. Nothing is listed on her page about a job right now so I'm not sure what she's working as unless its just a part of his crew. Went to an award ceremony for him.

   If you are only allowed to choose one, which one would you rather choose 1) a busy occupation with lots of money. 2) Get relief from the government without work 3) easy but less profitable occupation

  Probably go with 3. I want something that I enjoy that also helps others.
  
  One seems like it's more selfish and overly money hungry. The busy part makes me think that they wouldn't have free time for the reasons why they are creating the money in the first place.
  
  Two is more the lazy way and you don't really grow as a person from it. Its understandable in certain situations but shouldn't be the end all.. keep moving forward, ya know?

  Had the idea to take a bath. Was looking for my di.ldo to accompany me. The house I was in was all weird.. i kept going in and out of rooms. Passing doors on the way too. Opened one door and it was like a lab inside. There was a doctor lady looking at brains and hearts on the monitor. Talking about blood and stuff. Was weird. Remember asking how mine was and they didn't tell me. Just kept on looking at the screen and seemed like they were digging for something..
  
  then there was a wall of doors that you'd exit.. seemed like a school or factory type thing. There were a ton of boxes piled up in front of one of those doors. Some male doctor was yelling at me. I guess I didn't want to be a science experiment or something lol XD the boxes were filled with blood. I didn't like whatever that guy was playing at and rushed outside knocking over the boxes of blood. Like a fuc.k you type of deal 🤣 kept running. He was running after me. I ended up having something in my hand. Don't remember what but I threw it at him right in the balls. He winced and went down. I made a joke about him getting it up again type thing. Think I continued to run.

  It was a community one so always had new people around each semester, wouldn't see the old ones again. We'd get along but never ended up hanging out with anyone in the end. No real strong bonds. I'd eat lunch with the friend I've mentioned.. we had some classes together too. Another girl that we both knew from hs ended up eating with us too at one point. She ended up getting pregnant and I guess quit going to college because of it. There was another girl that we befriended but that didn't really go anywhere outside of school either.
  
  There was only like one girl that I had a lot of classes with and would see often enough but didn't hangout with outside of school either. We would catch up a lot when we did see eachother around the building. Met her the first day at orientation. She was scared to go in the building alone lol XD she looks just like my best friend's sister so that was a little weird haha.

   Interesting. Let me ask a slightly different question: what have your major yearly activities over the past 10 years (e.g. 2011: sophomore in X College doing full-time courses towards Y degree, 2012 - 3: finished degree, got married)?
  ","
  Graduated in 2007, went right to college. I ended up taking a semester off in 2010 since my paperwork got messed up which didn't help the depression at that time. Went back once the new semester came. Was still friends with her at the time. Activities included zumba, walking and at home workouts. I didn't end up finishing my degree. Had 2-3 classes left, math and science and during that time we were moving (2014)
  
  I joined the gym around 2014 and that really helped me see more results. I would still gain a little,  maintain and lose weight. Glad I found out it was due to pcos and all that. Metformin and doing keto the last few years.
  
  I've never been married. I have had crushes at times but nothing ever came of them.

   It kind of answers the question, but there must be more. Like your social circles must have changed, your interactions with other people, your environment, your attitudes...you know, more substantial sht than how much you drank.
  ","
  Not too much. We kind of all went our separate ways after graduating high school. Only one stayed since we ended up  going to the same college. Nothing changed with that friendship at the time. Then she ended up graduating and going on to a different college which I didn't see her much then. Her stepdad also died. Which kind of made her talk to me even less. We still have eachother on social media but haven't talked in a while. It's sad seeing old memories since used to comment a lot...
  
  My best friend is still my best friend. Its different though since she has three kids. But ya, we always start right back where we left off.
  
  In Maine, it was more family friends there. Including a friend that's like another sister to me. There's not really anyone around my age and if there was they'd end up being alcoholics and into weed or other drugs. Never really looked or said anything to me.
  
  I don't really feel like my interactions changed besides ones already mentioned. I've always had a ""shy"" sizing people up vibe.
  
  Environment has been MA to Maine and AZ. It's hard meeting new people. Some aren't friendly when I try or never see again. I had plans on meeting new people in 2020 but coronavirus decided to screw that up even more currently. Literally had some hiking and shopping trips planned with people on meetup.

  ","
  Think that's more about the people in question instead of a gender dynamic. Effort, the things shared, common interests and goals. Lots of things can make a relationship better but i wouldn't pinpoint one is better than the other in a general sense. Mental wellbeing could play a role too. The way you treat eachother. So many factors enter into the relationship.

  Started to get light headed. Next thing I know I'm bleeding on rocks face first👍low blood sugar, apparently. Mom still claims it was about anxiety over doctors but I was literally done for the day so that doesn't exactly make sense lol my stomach was even rumbling inside at one point. Even said that I was hungry a few minutes before the light headedness lol
  
  That hasn't really happened before. I've fainted at the dr once because he told a bad joke. If I fainted at other times it was because I was sick or not taking the best care of myself but it was never an open display like that. More in the bathroom taking a shower and got too hot or whatever.

For some reason I already took the class before and was thinking of finding my old notebook that had all the terms already in it instead of doing all the work again. I remember opening the book and it had LNR written in it.. which was weird because I usually did my actual name instead of initials.

  I was just thinking that he should have slept with Martin's mom to make them better. Seemed like he had an antidote to the madness? Didn't have to get as far as it did. He clearly didn't like the son that much to begin with. They never really interacted.. he was always with the daughter having her sing and whatnot. Kind of got creepy vibes from the dad at times.. like did he engage with his daughter before? Seemed like he lingered too much.. kept going back and forth on if he did something with Martin before or just his mom. Like what type of doctor would show his body to a teen? lol
  
  The mom doing the hj to that doctor. Looked freaking miserable but then had a smile at one time. Yikes XD
  
  The ending was creepy. Like did killing one of the offspring make it suddenly disappear or did he legit do the mom? Think she was the one in the opening scene and not his actual wife? Wonder if the daughter still liked Martin even after all that lol you'd think he'd be locked away or something.

I  don't go into that much detail these days either. I only mentioned the first two days being harder.. dude shouldn't know that its ending soon when its been more days than just those 2 mentioned.

  Been friends since the 1st grade. Mom of three now. Was in her 1st wedding as a bridesmaid. Unofficial aunt status quo
  
  Like another sister. She's three years older. She lived with us at one point. Know all her family etc
  
  This one is kind of cheating since we haven't met but we're pretty close. Known for 11 years. Always fun talking with. Have the whole December birthdays and same age going for us. Also share the same birthday as her sister! And she shares her birthday with the 2nd person I talked about. I trust her the most out of online friends.

  We were trespassing. Weren't supposed to be there. They have a boat that goes out on the lake and have a dance party on it with others around your age. We did that. Met some guys while on the boat. It landed at the shore again. My friend and I had to leave after that, they were walking us back pretty much. Luckily we told them how we weren't supposed to be there. Two  workers came over and talked to us. Taking names of us and made the guys leave to their suite. The people that talked with us ended up getting another person that was on a golf cart and they made that dude follow behind us as we walked out. They were all never come back and stuff lol
  
  Uh... definitely been back multiple times over the years since then 🤣
  
  Also they had a movie theater there where they put a projector and one of the people we were with once had the idea to lock them in since the door had the padlock on it 🤦🏼‍♀️so that happened.

  Agreed. Felt like it was a little different at one point but then her stepdad died.. I didn't know about it at the time and then things just seemed even more different. Talked to me even less. Her mom did remarry last year though. They also got a dog, surprisingly. She got bit by a dog when younger and was scared of them. Nice seeing stuff but its def not the same as it once was. Tried talking at times but she either ignores it or we talked about stuff that didn't really matter...

  Not sure. I'm picky 😉
  
  - having an open mind can help. Go on when you feel like it.. better conversations can happen. If you feel down then that might not be the best time to look/talk to someone.
  
  - sometimes I feel like the only one putting in effort. If someone is more reserved, only one sided then they probably aren't as invested in you/the conversation.
  
  - I end up unmatching people if they haven't replied in forever, felt no connection with, can't remember why I matched them in the first place, boring conversation. I'd rather not waste energy on people who also didn't feel anything.
  
  - be real. Take decent pictures. Have a good profile.
  
  - maybe ask a guy out if you feel like the guy is hesitant of asking you.
  
  - trust gut instincts about the person. Most guys who ask for sc probably aren't serious of actually wanting someone etc

  Earlier in March she mentioned her mom having pneumonia and her children have still been seeing her.
  
  I think her daughter is better. Haven't heard anything new about her. Apparently they were saying it was croup, chest and ear infection. Then said that she didn't have an ear infection so they didn't end up giving her medication. Which is really weird since she was throwing up, fever of 100+, flu symptoms galore. Apparently they gave her a steroid shot though. Not really sure how that would help much. She's not even a year yet.
  
  She's been shaky, sore throat. Talked about sneezing and runny nose in a different post. Her fever was only in the 99's.. will be getting zithromicin for it.

  ","
  Yes. Even if he was more good looking and there wasn't a genuine connection with the person then you are still wasting your time and theirs. A fact some people forget especially when dating is involved. If I dont mesh with someone easily then I don't see the point of still talking to them too.
  
  Some would most likely still call that picky but it's kind of normal? lol. Why waste time on people when it doesn't feel right? Anyways, I go for personality over looks. I also still need an attraction to the person.
  
  I was thinking in general terms/being nice.. not really wanting to date the person way. If personality was better, liked other things about them, got along well then them being ""less than"" in the looks department wouldnt matter as much as long as I still felt something for them.

  I'd rather trust them.  If someone was younger/older and we got along well then age wouldn't matter. I like 2-5 year age gaps.. them being older is more ideal. I've dated younger before and we were just at different levels in life.
  
  I got odd vibes from the 26 yr old and just didn't want to talk that way with him when barely know anything about him. That would have been more of a distraction than anything else. I don't always need to talk to people that way. Plus I'm sure someone at 26 is more into parties and that lifestyle instead of wanting a family etc

  The teacher was also the one to tell me that my dad's aunt died. He thought I knew. It was awkward to say the least since he didn't give a name. Just mentioned how it was someone older, naturally, I thought of my nana and called my mom afterwards asking her if she was still alive.

  He was a slave. With his owners permission he found a teacher that taught the stoic philosophy ways. Epictetus believed that all external events are beyond our control and that we should just accept that things happen that way for a reason. He also had a student of his that would write his teachings down. Made books on the subjects.

   in the movie right? like way way abridged? thats what i mean. in monte cristo the whole essence of the character was soiled. im the end of the film they way they had events play out was almost nauseating and a complete disservice to the authenticity of the character. mondego fight  🤮

  Yes. Just didn't feel right. Whether the actors or what. They were just going to places instead of mentioning the why, how they picked where to go. They left out key things that made the book come alive. Seemed very low budget.

  I know someone who has a farm and they are pissed off because the Mexican workers they hired (with visas they pointed out) are scared to come here. Meanwhile she's also all ""the gym might close"" so they will close the farm instead of actually getting work done? Seems like they'd bust their ass to get it done because of the gym closing and for a living. I'm sure neighbors would help out as well. Weird how she wouldn't think of all the options she could do and just throws in the towel so quickly. I'm sure deadlines matter but ya...
  
  She literally wrote ""we no longer have a job"". It's produce... pretty sure wheat, hay, corn and other farming would be more of a battle. Really hope she reconsiders just closing up like that. Wouldnt you fight and exhaust all options? Seemed like she just found out and venting instead of looking at everything they still could do.

   Are irregular periods getting your period multiple times in one month or not getting them for months at a time?
  ","
  It could be that way..
  
  More like it's been years for me (pcos). Like 2018 was the last real time.. and then I spotted in December, had cramps and everything else but more a phantom period. Then Feb had spotting which grew to an actual period but I didn't really have any symptoms with that one besides the bleeding and feeling tired etc
  
  I  based my cycle and all that off of the fitbit one and it told me 8 days which would be the day that I actually ""planned"" to get it. I think I messed up the Fitbit tracking when I said I had spotting.. was only 1 day but yes.. flo seems better already XD thanks for the recommendation..also lol @ this question

   (Most) guys don't suck. If you're being curved or are just attracting low quality guys, I would take a good, *HONEST* look at yourself and ask what _you_ have to offer, and whether it's worth it to a _man_ of quality. There's a lot more to quality than weight.
