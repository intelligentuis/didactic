really a reflection on my behavior and thought processes .","296958":"i check my personal email every day , and while i m at work i always have my email open so i get emails instantly .","296959":"hello do you have a question ? ?","296960":"my entire personality needs improvement . it s literally disordered . lol .","296961":"the weather was the same near me this morning afternoon very windy , chilly , and overcast . i believe it s supposed to rain either tonight or tomorrow morning .","296962":"discovery , growth , and determination .","296963":"no , i don t believe i ve ever watched one of those movies before .","296964":"they were asleep .","296965":"my boyfriend is my voice of reason .","296966":"lmao , no . i don t post those kinds of photos online .","296967":"the answer to your last question wasn t an invitation to ask more sexual questions . i don t generally talk about my sex life on the internet .","296968":"lmao , yes . my boyfriend and i had no shame when we were in our party stage .","296969":"i prefer beer , but i m only going to try to have beer on special occasions because of the calories involved .","296970":"no . life isn t guaranteed .","296971":"last night was fun","296972":"i m never in a position where i have to deal with anyone who is fake . i don t surround myself with fake people , and if i ever have an inkling that someone around me isn t being genuine to themselves or acting out haphazardly for attention , then i purposely stay far away from them . i don t have time in my life for that kind of nonsense .","296973":"it ultimately depends on what that favor is . i cannot promise anything .","296974":"it s absolutely disgusting when he puts his dirty , wet socks on me when he s getting undressed after work . lol .","296975":"it isn t something i would willingly do if i had my own toothbrush , lol . but there were one or two moments in the past where i had to use his toothbrush because i forgot to bring mine .","296976":"yeah i just said the term makes me uncomfortable . that s regardless of whether it s online or in real life , it means the same thing .","296977":"that s your personal opinion . just because you re comfortable with the term doesn t mean that other people are comfortable with it . for future reference , do not call me ma am . it s simply a term i m uncomfortable with people using in reference to me .","296978":"you make it seem like wanting attention is such a terrible thing , lol . sending this message out to multiple people is a bit contradictory to your message , though this message in itself is attention seeking , so you re exhibiting the very trait that you re supposedly bashing .","296979":"no . i don t click links that people send me on askfm , so it would fall on deaf ears .","296980":"fyi for your information .","296981":"i didn t hear about that report . however , if that is indeed true , then i m not surprised . humankind is exterminating all sorts of species just by existing , and we re not contributing to the growth or evolution of existing animals at all .","296982":"i answered a question similar to this minutes ago . in short , yes i had a good day . fyi , please don t call me ma am . that makes me feel hella old and disgusted , lmao .","296983":"i would choose brains over beauty . you can only remain attracted to someone for so long if all they have going for them is physical looks . what truly matters in any type of relationship is how well you meld together , your shared interests and passions , and the conversations you have which are all things that occur within the brain .","296984":"yeah , dozens of times . i always just step away from the situation when i m pushed to that degree of anger .","296985":"this is a very false statement , my friend . veganism is , in fact , healthy as long as the person pursuing the lifestyle takes the proper steps to ensure their health and wellness , just like you should when you re not vegan or vegetarian . i ve always believed in the concept of being vegan , which is why i try to always use cruelty free products and vegan products whenever possible . it s just not something i ve ever pursued when it comes to my diet yet .","296986":"i m not sure why trans is in there , considering being transgender isn t a sexual orientation . transexual is an extremely antiquated , outdated term for a trans person . to answer your question , however , i m bisexual .","296987":"hello things are going well . i had a great day at work actually , i felt super productive and tied up a lot of loose ends regarding the projects i m working on . last night was also fun relaxing i saw my boyfriend for the first time since last week , and we had a large campfire in his backyard while we talked listened to music together .","296988":"i don t know anyone named courtney who lives in australia , lol . the only courtney i know is my friend who recently deactivated .","296989":"i m pretty good at cooking breakfast food probably because it s super easy to make breakfast food , lol . you just have to scramble or fry some eggs , put bread in the toaster , fry some bacon if you desire , etc etc . however , my boyfriend makes the best breakfasts . i m not sure what he does exactly , but his scrambled eggs always come out delicious .","296990":"in my opinion , it depends ultimately on what that person did to screw up their first chance . sometimes people should be given the benefit of the doubt and or a second chance to redeem themselves , but there are some situations where it s impossible to allow that relationship to move forward .","296991":"of course , i feel lonely on certain occasions . i believe everyone has the capability to feel loneliness regardless of how many friends or partners they have .","296992":"i like more personalized questions these days , and i very much enjoy questions where people ask me how my day went , how i m doing in my relationship , my mental health struggles , my work and education , etc etc . i m open to answer nearly anything . the only questions i don t answer are ones that are gross invasive , obvious attempts at trolling , and pointless questions that are immature or ridiculous .","296993":"yes , it s possible to want to break up with someone you love . sometimes regardless of how much you love a person , you re simply not compatible and or they re not good for you or vice versa . love is not the only thing you require in a relationship , and there are several components that tune into what makes a relationship work .","296994":"i don t really know enough about the conspiracy to develop my own opinion on it . however , i do believe that the conspiracy is hella interesting ! !","296995":"perhaps . i ve never tried a vegan lifestyle before .","296996":"well it s been years , so i m fairly certain he s sticking around .","296997":"all the time . he s extremely reassuring when it comes to this sort of thing .","296998":"last friday . my coworker and i were scheduled to clean up after lunch , and he didn t join me to clean until minutes later when i was already done . then another coworker decided to tell my supervisor , even though it wasn t her place to say anything , which pissed me off even more .","296999":"yes , i very much so enjoy my job . it s stressful at times , but it s the best job i ve ever had .","297000":"no , not really . after working in retail and cleaning disgusting shelves and picking up after people , you kinda get used to it .","297001":"abandonment . it s irrational because my boyfriend would never leave me , but i m constantly terrified that he will .","297002":"uh , it isn t the summer yet .","297003":"since it s been upstairs , i ve used it twice so far on sunday again last night .","297004":"lol . i didn t even think of it that way .","297005":"you can appreciate a friend s features without having intimate feelings towards them , lmao .","297006":"no , the only language i know is english .","297007":"i have a few acquaintances who are partially native american , yeah . i don t know anyone who s full native american , though .","297008":"he ll ask me my opinion on things he s not sure if he likes or not , but i don t go out and choose his clothes for him , lmao . that s controlling behavior .","297009":"i don t use yelp , so here s my seltzer haul from this afternoon","297010":"yes , and i ve actively sought revenge on people as well .","297011":"of course ! ! askfm is basically my personal diary anyway , lol .","297012":"tomorrow , i m working all day and then seeing my boyfriend after work .","297013":"no , not in a serious manner at least .","297014":"i ve never gone actual camping before , unfortunately . however , my boyfriend and i sometimes set up the tent in the backyard and sleep outside , which is always fun .","297015":"i do both , lol . i keep some of my thoughts to myself , but i also know when it s warranted to speak my mind about something . in the case where i keep things to myself , it s usually in situations where my opinion would only hurt the situation . sometimes it s simply better to remain quiet in some situations .","297016":"it depends on the situation . i don t normally like saying no to things in my life , especially with respect to my job or in my friendships . but there are some things i m either uncomfortable doing or i simply don t want to do them this happens mostly around friends , though , so i feel the need to explain why i m saying no because i don t want them to think i have something against them personally .","297017":"yes , i know a few people like that . they give off the impression that they don t care about anything and can give any opinion they want regardless of how much it can hurt people , but then when they get called out on their behavior , they retreat and don t even confront the issue and or pretend it didn t happen .","297018":"lately , i ve been catching myself saying are you fuckin kidding me ? under my breath a lot , lol .","297019":"i m sure when i finish , i ll be posting about it on here and or on facebook , lol .","297020":"can t wait ! ! depending on how i feel later and how tired i am , i want to watch some more . i ended up not getting much sleep last night because i was watching it until am , lmao .","297021":"omg , i literally started watching it last night ! ! i m up to the third episode , i believe . i don t have a roundabout opinion because i didn t finish watching what s available already , but so far i find the show to be very compelling . i m around the part where gypsy rose is beginning to really question her mother s attempts to make her seem sicker than she actually is , and she s beginning to rebel . i m so excited to see how it turns out later on , considering we already know what happens to the mother through flash forward scenes .","297022":"i m doing well i got out of work two hours ago , and then i stopped at target on the way home to pick up some seltzer and coffee . i got home about minutes ago , so i ve been sitting down and relaxing before i go work out .","297023":"i don t partake in it , so it isn t something i think about .","297024":"no , nothing really offends me these days not unless someone is personally targeting me and saying something terrible to me on purpose in an effort to get under my skin . even so , my offense isn t as much anger as it is concern .","297025":"yes , i know what ramadan is .","297026":"panic , mainly .","297027":"there are obviously people i dislike , but i don t have beef with anyone at the moment .","297028":"i used to watch them a lot when i was younger , but i can t handle them these days . they make my anxiety skyrocket , lol .","297029":"no , i ve never owned an iphone .","297030":"it s currently am , and i m going to bed . i watched nearly three episodes of the act before i realized how late it was .","297031":"if anyone has any questions , they would be greatly appreciated","297032":"unless our families decide they miraculously want to pay for our wedding , it s naturally coming out of our own pockets . like i said , it isn t a priority to us .","297033":"i don t have children , nor do i believe i want children in the future , so this question is irrelevant to me .","297034":"aw , thank you","297035":"yes , i am wholeheartedly against physical discipline as a form of punishment .","297036":"it isn t as easy as just believing , lmao . unfortunately , existing in today s society costs a plethora of money , and weddings to accomodate both of our families are expensive .","297037":"yes , we both work full time .","297038":"paying for bills , getting a new vehicle in his case , and moving in together , among other things . we have various financial obligations before we can even think about paying for a wedding .","297039":"it isn t a concern of ours at the moment . there s a lot of things for us to do before we can consider getting married .","297040":"yeah , i have friends who are men .","297041":"i m fairly certain , lmao . we have a good relationship and there s no reason for us not to get married in the future , unless he believes otherwise .","297042":"obviously . just because you re friends with someone of a different sex doesn t mean that you have to be more than friends with them .","297043":"most likely , we ve been together for years .","297044":"no , i m in a relationship .","297045":"i m doing well . i m just watching hulu before i go to bed .","297046":"hello do you have a question ? ?","297047":"it s been a while since i read a book , unfortunately . the last one i read was i am not a serial killer by dan wells .","297048":"yes , absolutely . shelter is a basic need .","297049":"no , the only things i send myself are little or signs , in the off chance i want to talk about something that no one has asked me about .","297050":"lmao . no , i m not interested in making new friends .","297051":"no . i don t know you , so i won t accept your request .","297052":"my username is poetalunam , same as on here , but my account is private i only accept people i know .","297053":"i don t have a whatsapp account .","297054":"scroll through social media , watch a documentary on television , play video games , and sometimes i ll read or write creatively .","297055":"lol , hell no . i do the bare minimum when i run my errands unwashed jeans , sneakers , and a hoodie with my hair up in a ponytail . i m not looking to impress or talk to anyone when i m out shopping or running my errands .","297056":"right now , it s fairly chaotic . i really need to tidy things up , but i ve been exhausted lately . perhaps i ll try to motivate myself to pick some things up tonight and finish up tomorrow night . it isn t terrible but it s to the point where it makes me feel claustrophobic because not everything is in its rightful place .","297057":"once every few months , if even that often . i ideally should be shaving my head every few weeks or so , but it isn t a priority to me . i m planning on making another appointment for the middle of june so i can refresh the blue and get a fresh shave .","297058":"going out drinking at night with my friends . i don t do it as often as i used to , but i still regard it as a mistake because i always feel terrible in the morning . however , i keep repeating those behaviors time time again .","297059":"i prefer chips over popcorn . lately i ve been eating veggie chips if i need a snack between meals .","297060":"i already have a plot title for a book that i m planning on writing , and i don t feel comfortable revealing those details .","297061":"there isn t a song that makes me happy , so none . my moods aren t so much influenced by music in that way , music simply amplifies whatever i m currently feeling .","297062":"i thought i lost my debit card on saturday night , but it turns out that i placed it in the wrong pocket of my wallet .","297063":"nightshade and nirnroot .","297064":"no , i ve never been in a position where i had to attend physiotherapy physical therapy . i ve never broken a bone , and i never went to the doctor for the times i believe i sprained a muscle .","297065":"i ve never not tipped a server , and i don t have any intentions of not tipping a server either . even if i have terrible service , i ll leave at least something because i understand that servers rely primarily on their tips in order to pay their bills . i don t believe tipping should be mandatory , but i still strongly believe that if you don t have enough money to tip someone at least for regular service , then you shouldn t be going out to eat at all .","297066":"i think it varies case by case . it would be virtually impossible to monitor every single case of cyber bullying , but there are obviously some cases that are worse than others , which can lead to detrimental effects on someone s mental health . in the case where someone is very negatively affected by cyber bullying to the point where it leads to a drastic change in mood , personality , and behavior , including sh or s uicidal action , then legal consequences should take place .","297067":"i support welfare in general . there s nothing wrong with needing extra help when it comes to the necessities of living , particularly in terms of food , shelter , and making sure you and your children are safe . a lot of people who criticize welfare , such as food stamps , claim that there are so many people who ab se the system , when that isn t true whatsoever . there are stringent rules set in place for someone to receive government assistance and not everyone is qualified for them . i also think it s ridiculous how people who criticize those on welfare are essentially saying they don t believe those people deserve the basic right to exist comfortably .","297068":"men are ostracized for having what are seen as women oriented jobs because of the societal expectations that are in place regarding what a man s job is vs . what a woman s job is . it s seen as less manly for a man to be doing a job that is typically occupied by women , especially in the case of caregiving , nursing , etc etc . ideally , there should be less stigma associated with men doing what are stereotypically seen as womenly things , because the narrative behind those things is utterly false and it doesn t make someone less of a man for doing them .","297069":"the one who cheated is at fault . cheating isn t acceptable if you re unhappy with your sex life , and there s an expectation of open communication and trust in relationships . ideally , the person who s unhappy with their intimate life should talk to their partner about these feelings so that they can come to a mutual agreement regarding what they should do to either spice up their life or make other arrangements .","297070":"i believe it s your responsibility as a parent to clean up after your child , regardless of whether or not you re in a public facility and it s the server s job to clean the table . people who don t take responsibility for their own , and by association their children s , messes shouldn t go to public places . it s incredibly entitled to leave that mess for someone else to clean .","297071":"no , i don t have any injuries . my back is aching , but that s not unusual for me .","297072":"i believe there s such a stereotype of women being the sole caregivers to children that it erases the responsibility of men being fathers to their children as well . women are typically viewed in society as being the main caregiver to children , even when they re in a relationship with or married to the father , because of their maternal instincts as well as the age old expectation of women to be mothers instead of any other archetypes . in reality and idealistically fathers should be just as responsible as mothers for taking care of children . women shouldn t be expected to take extra care of their children in the event of them being gone for a period of time just so that it alleviates responsibility on the father . a father is just as much of a parent as a mother , and their responsibilities toward their children should be equal .","297073":"yes , they should lose custody of their child ren . if someone is convicted of domestic ab se , then they have no business being around their own children because they re just as much of a danger to those children as they are to their spouse .","297074":"any form of drama involving he said , she said bullsh t . some people simply get so heated over a rumor they heard about themselves , when in reality it doesn t really matter . those who know you and care about you won t believe the lies , and those who feed into the drama aren t people you want around in your life to begin with .","297075":"not generally , no . the only opinions i care about are those of my boyfriend and best friend .","297076":"the first cup of coffee cigarette in the morning , having long conversations with my boyfriend or close friends , writing creatively , receiving positive reinforcement , photography , doing art , playing video games , sunbathing outside with a book , and having a drink with friends .","297077":"i don t remember tbh , and my phone won t tell me because my google account is linked to my google searches that i use at work on my desktop computer , so those searches are all work related things .","297078":"there s nothing planned that i m looking forward to , so nothing at the moment . perhaps my boyfriend and i will plan a vacation soon .","297079":"i prefer doritos , specifically cool ranch .","297080":"oh , most definitely . lmao . i ve done too much horrible sh t in my life for me not to go to hell .","297081":"i know how to use applications like microsoft office and some adobe products , but that s pretty much it .","297082":"depends on what you need to talk about . askfm is for asking and answering questions .","297083":"i usually go to the steakhouse , the diner , a chinese japanese restaurant , or a local mexican food place .","297084":"this has absolutely nothing to do with this thread , lmao . it was in my bedroom .","297085":"no , the furthest west i ve traveled has been to texas .","297086":"sure , that sounds plausible to me . there will always be a degree of miscommunication at times , and sometimes people s words come out differently than how they intended .","297087":"upstate new york . there was a dude ranch resort i used to frequent with my boyfriend and a few of our friends , and those vacations were always extremely fun .","297088":"my boyfriend is a fairly messy person , and that s really the only thing that bothers me about him . i like keeping things tidy organized , but he s usually so busy that he doesn t have as much time to clean as he wants . on the flip side , however , he is very good at cleaning when he has the time to do so .","297089":"i wouldn t be in this field if i didn t enjoy it , lol . it s what i graduated from college in and pursued post graduation .","297090":"sitting in the same position for long periods of time isn t healthy at all , and its caused me to gain weight because i m simply not burning energy throughout the day .","297091":"i m a writer editor for a publishing company .","297092":"if i had a physically demanding job , then i wouldn t need to exercise . however , i ve worked in offices for the past four years and the sedentary lifestyle is becoming detrimental to my health .","297093":"i m doing well ! ! i m incredibly proud of myself for making the push to exercise today , and i m planning on walking at least one mile every day until further notice . now that i have a treadmill in the adjacent room upstairs , i really have no excuse to not exercise every day .","297094":"the same it s always been mostly lean proteins and vegetables , some carbs here there , and the occasional splurge on junk food although i ve been transitioning to veggie chips instead of regular potato chips . the weekends are normally more carb oriented because it s when i like to treat myself , i . e . i had an egg sandwich this morning for breakfast .","297095":"i just finished working out eating dinner , so now i m going to hop into a shower . y all should send me questions to answer for when i come back ! !","297096":"does holographic iridescence count as a color ? ? lol . i ve been obsessed with holographic things lately . but also , i would pick that because the colors vary depending on what angle you look at it , and i think that s very telling of me because my personality is prone to change depending on who i m with . idk if my close friends and boyfriend would say the same , though . it s difficult to really determine because my personality mood changes so often , so it can t be confined by one specific color .","297097":"since five people is a lot , i m only going to do this for two people youcuntx book i am not a serial killer series by dan wells tv show forensic files song comache by in

season two game of thrones soundtrack https www . youtube . com watch ? v ls sirpogy","297102":"a common myth that actually isn t true is that planned parenthood solely offers abortion services when in reality , abortions are only a small percentage of the services pp offer . they also offer gynecologic obstetrics health exams , std testing , birth control , breast exams , etc etc . a lot of people rely on pp for their services because they re not only efficient , but they work with you on a sliding scale whereas other doctor offices don t . even if pp only offered abortion services , there s nothing wrong with that at all . abortion itself is demonized greatly in society and there are still so many misconceptions regarding it , especially with respect to late term abortions . there should be no shame in getting an abortion , nor should there be guilt because you re not committing an act of m rder . you re doing what s best for your own physical and mental health , and it would be more of an injustice to raise an unwanted child in a system that doesn t cater to it .","297103":"i believe in order to be a parent , a person and or couple must have the financial means to support having a child , have the emotional capacity to cope with having a child , and have an extremely safe lifestyle and environment for that child to grow up in . everything relates to that child s safety , and if you cannot guarantee that safety based on your own concerns or dilemmas , then you shouldn t have a child .","297104":"i don t believe there should be a limit like that on food stamps , no . you simply can t police what a person eats , and often enough , junk food is much , much cheaper than buying healthier alternatives i . e . , doritos chips versus veggie chips . people need to eat , and the government already doesn t give recipients of food stamps enough money to sustain a healthy lifestyle to begin with , and often these people need to really ration their allowances on a weekly basis . if someone wants to buy junk food , then they should be allowed to do so . there s nothing wrong with splurging on a bag of chips dip every once in a while .","297105":"obviously not . you re clearly not my boyfriend , and he s the only person who i wish to marry in the future .","297106":"it varies from person to person because we all have different coping mechanisms . personally speaking , my healthier coping mechanisms include listening to music , sleeping , talking situations out with my boyfriend and or close friends , attending therapy , taking medication , etc etc .","297107":"uh , it shouldn t taste bitter . rofl . however , if you don t like carbonated things then i can see how you would dislike it . i used to dislike carbonated water soda etc etc . , when i was much younger . it somehow grew on me , though . especially now when i drink seltzer , i know that i m aiding my body so it gives me more incentive to drink it .","297108":"no problem i enjoy having civil discussions about topics that are normally taboo , to increase awareness of the hazards of certain things like p rn and whatnot . these days , i m very much anti p rn but i can t ignore that it was something i used to do a lot when i was much , much younger .","297109":". . . have . i even knew that my parents knew because they would make small comments about it without actually coming forward and saying this is bad stop . luckily i grew out of being sxxually explicit as a kid and started growing more into sxxuality appropriately , if that makes sense . it still has really affected my sxx life in ways i d rather not detail but i definitely didn t have the worst case scenario because i still had a good family despite that . the worst case is that i have a hard time finishing without seeing or thinking about pxrn . i hope that anon gets what they were looking for thank you for explaining your experience ! ! i can relate with this a lot because i was definitely hyper s xual when i was a teenager , and i can probably attribute that to the p rn i watched as well . i started having s xual experiences from the time i was years old , which is way too early in my opinion , and p rn also gave me an unrealistic expectation of what sex would be like . i m grateful in that my experiences weren t worse , but it definitely had the potential to be much worse than it was . i could have fallen into sex trafficking or started out in the industry from a very young age , and thankfully that didn t happen . however , it happens to a plethora of people when they re young .","297110":"yes , i drink carbonated water quite often including right now . it s easier for me to drink flavored seltzer water instead of just straight water , so it s where most of my water intake comes from .","297111":"i m thinking about finishing up the freelance work that i didn t finished last night . i just turned on my laptop poured myself a glass of seltzer over ice , and i m also listening to the game of thrones soundtrack .","297112":"they re not people who i want to be around it s healthy to have an ego in general and to have confidence in yourself , but it certainly isn t healthy to have an inflated sense of self and think that you deserve x just for existing . that isn t how the world works .","297113":"well i can t speak on behalf of that anon , but discovering p rn at an early age can hinder development because of the increased emphasis placed on sex . it can make people value sex greater than it should be valued , and it can also lead to p rn or sex addiction . thankfully that didn t happen to me , but i still regret discovering p rn at a really young age . it simply isn t something appropriate for a child to see , especially when they re as young as or years old .","297114":"considering it s raining heavily and a bit chilly where i live at the moment , it probably isn t the best time to go to the beach .","297115":"yeah , i totally understand this . i started watching p rn when i was around years old too , and because i was intelligent for my age , i already knew how to delete my cookies and browsing history so that even if my parents checked the computer , nothing would appear on there . it also didn t help that there was a separate computer for me in the dining room , while my father used his own personal computer in his bedroom . sometimes i wish my parents were more aware when it came to things like the internet , because i was definitely too young to see some of the things i saw , but at the same time , i also found a community of people who genuinely helped me with my mental health during a crucial time of my life , and i don t know if i would be alive today had i not met them when i did .","297116":"hello do you have a question ? ?","297117":"i believe i was around or years old when i first started using the internet unsupervised . honestly , i believe i was too young to use the internet completely because i was open to all of the horrible wonderment of the internet from a very early age , and it could have had devastating effects on me . i don t really feel comfortable with the idea of children using the internet for that reason there s simply so much danger out there , and it s usually disguised as something fun or meaningless . it s easy to fall into the traps of people who have nefarious reasoning and intentions . and it isn t that i wouldn t trust my future child , but i wouldn t trust the situation at all . children are naturally naive , so i would be terrified that they would fall into a situation that they cannot get out of .","297118":"it s extremely difficult for me to let go of people if i was previously attached to them . my emotions when it comes to other people range from not caring about them whatsoever to caring so deeply intimately about them that i simply don t know what i would do without them . there was one person in particular whose presence was difficult to let go , but it was for the best because they were a terrible person and i had to do what was right for myself .","297119":"lol . that definitely was not who i was thinking about when i typed that answer , but if the shoe fits .","297120":"i went to the very first let s play live event hosted by achievement hunter they set up their gaming consoles and had huge screens showing them playing video games and doing other comedic routines at radio city music hall in new york city a few years ago . it was one of the most fun nights i ve ever had , even though the line to get inside was wrapped around the building and i was standing in the pouring rain for an hour . i ran into griffon ramsey and barbara dunkelman while waiting on line for a drink , so i took a photo with both of them and thanked them for just being themselves . the crowd response was enormous , and it was one of those instances where you felt like you were part of something greater than yourself .","297121":"someone who s ab sive both physically mentally , toxic , manipulative , etc etc . someone who thinks solely of themselves and tries to warp situations into making themselves out to be the victim when they were actually the offender . someone who does typically bad things with no respect for those around them and with no remorse for their actions .","297122":"i wish i didn t give up on exercising last year when i was working out i ultimately lost my motivation for a variety of reasons my gym partner moved , my depression came back , i got heavily into drinking , etc etc . if i had stuck with my exercise regimen , then i definitely wouldn t look like how i am today i would be happier with myself . regardless , it s useless to focus on the past like that . the only thing we can do is continue moving forward and make more goals for ourselves .","297123":"it ultimately depends on the existing relationship between the child and their parents , i believe . if they value their relationship with their parents and are close to them , then they may feel more comfortable introducing their partner earlier in the relationship rather than later for example . there s really no best or worst time , in my opinion . everyone has different standards and values when it comes to dating , so it s whatever is most comfortable to the person .","297124":"i know of the show once upon a time , but i thought it was a fantasy television series for adults , lol . regardless , i ve never seen it before .","297125":"i enjoy waking up early in the morning on the weekend , before anyone else is awake , and listen to music from my laptop , drink coffee , and check up on social media briefly before starting work . the few hours of peace and quiet are beautiful to me .","297126":"probably just shake my head and walk away . i m not going to cause a scene over something that s going to end up being meaningless to me , but they should definitely be informed that recording someone without their consent is highly disrespectful and rude .","297127":"emotional stability , financial stability , and a support system .","297128":"i would probably approach them and ask them to delete the video because it s disrespectful .","297129":"i don t believe i ve ever spent an entire day without my phone , tbh . i ve gone on vacations where i left my phone in the hotel room , but it wasn t for the entire day because unfortunately my parents required me to check in with them every once in a while .","297130":"no , i don t chew the tips of straws .","297131":"you can know what they look like , but you can t determine a person s personality or who they actually are just based on a photograph .","297132":"your encouragement is much appreciated , thank you uwu .","297133":"yes ! ! now i have literally zero excuse to not exercise , so it will force me to do some miles every night .","297134":"we moved the treadmill upstairs today , i m so excited ! !","297135":"no , i don t have conversations with random people outside of askfm .","297136":"yes , my occupation is a writer editor .","297137":"i m just answering questions in my inbox .","297138":"my boyfriend and i broke up once early on in our relationship after i had moved miles away for college . there were a lot of difficult things going on in my life at the time , so going on a date probably wasn t the best idea . however , i went on a date with someone and it ended up terribly , because i spent the majority of the date explaining why i was sad and telling them that i missed my boyfriend , lmao .","297139":"i believe i would , yes . however , it would have to be under a circumstance where it was obviously warranted or expected of me , such as in the case of a tragedy and i wanted to show solidarity . to randomly cover your head without reason may be interpreted as making a mockery out of the religion , so the timing is important .","297140":"i don t think i would go so far to say it s a fear , but spiders freak me out . lmao .","297141":"i m doing fine , although i feel terrible . i went out drinking last night with a few friends , so now i have a hangover . that coupled with the fact that my allergies have been acting up has made existing this morning quite difficult , lol . i just doubled up on allergy medicine , took advil , and then took my regular morning pills . hopefully that s enough to make this discomfort subside .","297142":"hello . thank you","297143":"yes , i own an xbox one ! ! my favorite video games that i would recommend are skyrim , fallout , destiny and , assassin s creed syndicate although most of them are good , the bioshock series , the halo series , the wolf among us , life is strange , outlast , layers of fear , and far cry .","297144":"askfm doesn t allow me to record videos , so unfortunately no .","297145":"haha , close ! ! i woke up , had a cup of coffee , then went back to bed . had another cup of coffee and breakfast , wrote some freelance assignments , took a nap , continued writing , had dinner , and did my makeup . i m going out for drinks soon .","297146":"it wasn t , but whatever makes you feel better , my dude .","297147":"? ? ? ? ? ? ?","297148":"no , i don t have a big ego at all . if anything , i have zero ego because i have low self esteem at times .","297149":"no , i didn t . lmao . i know why she deactivated , and it has nothing to do with me .","297150":"glasses vs no glasses","297151":"i wear glasses every day . i can t see anything without them , my vision is absolutely terrible . i ve worn glasses since i was years old and my sight has continually worsened since then .","297152":"lmfaooooo . oh my god , that s a great analogy .","297153":"no , not that i m aware of . unless my parents own a gun and never showed it to me , haha .","297154":"i love the hollow nuggets the most , or at least the ice that comes in those giant bags of ice from the grocery store . my fridge has an external ice maker and i also like the cubes , but sometimes they re too big for my liking .","297155":"i want to have more experiences , whether it s going on vacations more often or going to concerts , having outings with friends , etc etc . i m tired of having the same routine of sitting at home after work on the weekends and doing nothing at all besides housework . it s bland and it s making me lose motivation and a lust for life .","297156":"no , love alone isn t enough to make a relationship work . you need to put in the time and commitment to make a relationship work , as well as have open communication with your partner at all times to establish a foundation of trust .","297157":"i m pretty sure my mother is pro life , because we had a conversation once and she said something like , i just don t understand how anyone could k ll a baby like that referring to abortion . so i tried explaining it to her that when abortions happen , the fetus isn t viable and she wasn t understanding . my father and i , on the other hand , agree with most things . he s left leaning like i am .","297158":"yes , i m good at multi tasking . it s something i ve always had to do from when i was young , ranging from high school college courses to now being in the workforce .","297159":"no , not really . a discussion implies a civil , casual conversation . while a debate implies something that s much more heated serious .","297160":"i would rather have a discussion . it s easier to rationally discuss a dilemma instead of having a heated debate over it .","297161":"i m not interested in whatever it is . i ll pass on the google search .","297162":"i have no idea what that even is . i m not a physically affectionate person anyway .","297163":"no , that s not me at all . i don t like clubs or dancing , nor do i like being in places like big cities where there are a lot of people . i m much more comfortable going to a quiet bar with a friend and having a conversation .","297164":"i don t go to clubs , so i would probably feel very uncomfortable .","297165":"you re asking me to psychoanalyze a song i ve never heard before , lol . the band stated that the song is about the music industry .","297166":"it doesn t sound like a racist song , no . it isn t even about race , lol .","297167":"i m sure it s because they re attracted to me , otherwise they wouldn t waste their time sending me gross messages .","297168":"i unblocked you , so you can follow me . don t make me regret it .","297169":"having people over the house with some booze and food , perhaps with something on the tv or playing music in the background . i also like having campfires in the backyard and playing beer pong , although i haven t done that or even thrown a party in years .","297170":"people often ask me about my music taste , so i figured maybe some people would want to see what my playlists are or what i m listening to .","297171":"i ll give him the benefit of the doubt and unblock him .","297172":"uh , what . if you want to make inappropriate comments , then i m not going to unblock you . lmao .","297173":"it isn t normal , but it s also very common , especially among people with issues with self esteem .","297174":"yes , all the time . my head is practically always racing with various thoughts , and sometimes i respond to my own thoughts within my head not out loud , lol .","297175":"i ve never heard of people eating hot dogs with mayonnaise before , lol . usually people put mustard and or ketchup on their hot dogs around here .","297176":"i don t know who you are , first of all . however , i will unblock you if you insist that you won t interact with my posts in an inappropriate manner .","297177":"oh , i apologize . i thought you meant in terms of pregnancy . i ve actually never heard of this terminology before , and it s certainly an interesting concept . i don t believe it s unethical , no . it sounds like a medical psychological form of unorthodox treatment to people who have problems with sex who want to attain a regular sex life , and as long as both partners are comfortable with the idea , i see nothing wrong with it .","297178":"uh , that isn t how surrogacy works . when a person takes on the responsibility of being a surrogate , they become artificially inseminated through in vitro fertilization . there s no physical contact involved .","297179":"i don t get catcalled in real life , but occasionally people will message me on social media attempt to get with me . i usually either don t respond to them or block them .","297180":"technically i m not yet , but regardless i can take any sort of photo i want . it has no reflection on my age i very much enjoy this photograph .","297181":"you must have said something disgusting to me in order for me to have blocked you .","297182":"absolutely ! ! my account isn t private . https twitter . com poetalunam","297183":"oh , rofl . there are so many clueless people on askfm that i genuinely thought you didn t know it was me , lol . sorry ! !","297184":"a message from courtney ! ! i believe her other social media is under the same username she used on here","297185":"it s not someone pretending to be me it is me , and it s my backup account in case this account gets banned . i log onto it once per week to answer the questions that accumulate in the inbox . i also have it tagged in my profile","297186":"lol , thank you ! ! it s from last year , but i ve always liked it for some strange reason .","297187":"thanks , my dude","297188":"i m not high right now . i haven t gotten high in over a month .","297189":"it depends on the opinion . i don t think i would be able to date someone if they were pro life or had views that discriminated against people , i . e . poc , trans people , disabled people , lgbt members , etc etc .","297190":"haha , no . if i m having espresso , then i usually order an americano or a double shot over ice .","297191":"i used to shy away from them try to put the conversation off for as long as possible . however , in recent years i ve developed a desire to have more hard conversations with people because it keeps both people humble , and i try to also face them head on . when spoken to the right person , the hard conversation can strengthen your relationship .","297192":"i don t have many talents , and i don t believe any of them are hidden . my main talents are writing , editing , time management , and ingesting large amounts of coffee within a short period of time .","297193":"having a relationship with someone is different from just having sex with someone , in my personal opinion . you can have no strings attached sex with a person simply to gain sexual satisfaction without having an intimate connection with them . if he admitted that he wasn t satisfied with our relationship on a sexual level , then i believe i would be fine with him pursuing sexual relations elsewhere , and he s perfectly capable of having sex without developing feelings for someone else . it s different in an open relationship because you are developing feelings for another person and you re actively dating them , just as you re dating your first partner . i wouldn t be able to handle the thought of him committing his emotions to another person while also maintaining our own relationship because our emotional relationship is sacred to me , and i would be afraid of that other person winning him over because i m a general mess of a human being .","297194":"this may come as a surprise to you all , but i ve actually never seen a single star wars movie .","297195":"no , but i am . lol . i don t know if i would be able to handle the thought of him being with someone else , and i definitely wouldn t want to date someone besides him .","297196":"probably not . my boyfriend and i have discussed it in the past , and we both agreed that it wouldn t be for us .","297197":"i would most rather live a year long life that s filled with excitement adventure . to live for as long as years with no exciting experiences to show for it seems rather tortuous and boring .","297198":"i m not entirely sure , because while i believe that people who are typically bad people don t have any productive value to add to society , there are usually at least some people who do find value in their existence , even if the majority of society doesn t agree with their actions or behaviors .","297199":"perhaps english literature , haha . i really enjoyed my english literature courses when i took them in high school because they were interesting and diverse .","297200":"i honestly don t remember the majority of my childhood , so unfortunately i don t have an exact answer to this question . i don t know what i ate frequently , let alone remember which food reminds me of my childhood .","297201":"aw , this is reassuring . thank you very much ! ! as much as the law firm was a terrible job , i genuinely enjoyed advocating for the rights of disabled people , whether they were struggling with physical or mental disabilities , and sometimes both . we sought to win them their well deserved disability benefits , which we often did , but unfortunately i couldn t continue with that job because it was so detrimental to my own mental health .","297202":"most people don t recognize their privilege , unfortunately . a lot of people are ignorant to what privilege is and whether or not they have it , and they often speak up over disabled people and discount their struggles . i witnessed it a lot when i was working at the law firm because we specialized in disability law . our clients were even discriminated against by their own doctors .","297203":"yes , you re correct . i don t have any physical disabilities , so i never experienced ableism as it relates to physical conditions . however , i do have mental illness where i ve experienced ableism based on my mental conditions , even though they re not legally disabling .","297204":"i didn t imply that , because i said that there are probably people who aren t white who haven t experienced racism a few answers above . but you re correct i obviously wouldn t know what it s like to experience racism because i never have i never will .","297205":"i recognize my privilege , as i stated in an earlier answer . just because i benefit from white privilege doesn t mean i don t acknowledge that other people don t have the same privilege .","297206":"a dictionary definition doesn t take into account the sociological effects of privilege or racism , it s honestly just a rudimentary definition that doesn t necessarily evolve with the times . freedom shouldn t be a special right , but it nevertheless is , and racism is unfortunately normal and commonplace . it s harmful to not acknowledge that racism is widespread in today s society .","297207":"i don t know if they would experience white privilege , considering they re not white , but it s definitely a privilege to have not experienced racism in your life . unfortunately in today s society , it is a privilege . just because it s a basic human right in ideal terms doesn t mean that people recognize it as such . a lot of people , mostly people who are actually white , think of other races as inferior and don t believe they deserve the same rights .","297208":"if they don t directly experience racism , because i m sure there are some people who don t , then they obviously have the potential to experience racism because they re not white .","297209":"yes , it s called white privilege . white people don t experience racism , but people of other races do . white people have always been in positions of power have been the oppressors in society , not the other way around . naturally , white people can be discriminated against but there s a difference between racism and discrimination .","297210":"people value my opinion higher than those who aren t white or cis , and i don t suffer from racism as a result of my white privilege . i do have people discriminate against me for being non binary and i face a lot of transphobia , but it s mainly online because i don t advertise my gender in real life .","297211":"i think this varies from person to person , because it all depends on the individual s value of family and the severity of the dysfunction within the family . personally speaking , i would have preferred to have no family over having a dysfunctional family . my family has been dysfunctional for as long as i can remember it s been detrimental to my mental health . i don t place much value in my own family at all , so it would have been better for me if i didn t have a family at all .","297212":"i benefit from privilege because i m a white cis passing person , but i would prefer having opportunities over privilege because i don t want to be defined by my privilege . i try to use my privilege to speak up for other groups and make things right , because i feel it s my duty to do so . however , i would prefer to have opportunities based on my work ethic and talents .","297213":"uh , probably certain drugs . lol . i always said i wouldn t smoke marijuana or do cocaine , but nevertheless , i did both when i was a young adult .","297214":"following your own dreams is much more important than following the dreams your parents want for you . you re your own individual first foremost , and even if your parents push for you to go down a certain career path , you have to remember that you need to do what s best for yourself because you re ultimately in control of your own life not your parents .","297215":"the last meal i made for myself was veggie burgers and french fries . however , the last meal i ate was the vegetable soup i had for dinner last night .","297216":"i wouldn t say that i ve fallen in love with someone , but i was very infatuated with someone when i was a teenager who didn t know who i was .","297217":"i don t enjoy cooking because i m simply not good at it , rofl . i don t see it as a chore , though , because it s necessary although most chores are necessary , but eating is obviously very important . on the flip side , i do enjoy cleaning and doing laundry because it makes me feel better when they re done .","297218":"i generally don t vote in local politics , and this past year was the first time i actually voted for my region . although i don t generally remain abreast of local happenings , i did do some research last fall and voted accordingly .","297219":"i like being in the center of attention when it comes to my close friends and boyfriend , but when it comes to other people strangers , i prefer being in the background because the spotlight makes me uncomfortable .","297220":"i think the fast pace that the news spreads across social media is a blessing , tbh . people are able to read the news and become informed on current events moreso now than ever before , and it also spreads to different countries so that now people are more aware than in past years . it s always good to be informed .","297221":"just because i don t think i m attractive doesn t mean that he doesn t either , rofl . he s very much attracted to me , otherwise we wouldn t be together .","297222":"no , i m not a superstitious person by any means .","297223":"i m not in situations where people have the opportunity to call me attractive or any related synonym , lol . it simply doesn t happen during my life . occasionally my friends will call me cute if i send them a selfie on snapchat , but i don t agree with them .","297224":"none of the above . i don t find myself to be attractive at all .","297225":"no , i quite enjoy it actually ! ! the purpose of askfm is to ask and answer questions , so i enjoy it when people ask me things and especially when they follow up on questions with additional inquiries into my original answer .","297226":"it depends entirely on what sort of chance they re looking for and their behavior towards me in general . if someone wants to become friends , then i m normally resistant to the idea because i m under the belief that friendship cannot be forced upon others and should happen naturally . that s why it always puzzles me when people on askfm say can we be friends ? because friendship just doesn t work that way .","297227":"no , it doesn t provoke any emotional response within me . it s just a name .","297228":"no , i m neither cute nor am i a girl . the term simply doesn t apply to me .","297229":"yes , it s happened on a few occasions in the past . thankfully it was never anything dire , it was normally just a vague response to a statement or question that was sent to the wrong person because i clicked on someone else s name in my messages by mistake .","297230":"i didn t even know that was the name of china s military forces until just now , so evidently i don t have an opinion .","297231":"no , i m clearly a full grown adult . lmao .","297232":"criminals trying to break into homes , breaking into cars , etc etc . the ring doorbell has a camera on it , so it records any activity picked up within the vicinity of the device . that includes people walking up to the front door and can also include people dwelling near the cars in the driveway or in front of the house .","297233":"i haven t watched youtube in a while , but i enjoy watching videos from gaming channels such as markiplier chilledchaos jacksepticeye achievement hunter rooster teeth seananners when he used to be active i also enjoy those live streams of lo fi hip hop music , because they re very relaxing to me and they help me write .","297234":"lol . yeah , it would definitely be along the lines of movies such as hostel , oldboy , audition , etc etc .","297235":"you can say people with intellectual disabilities .","297236":"things that are too grotesque to explain on askfm .","297237":"i used to have terrible , reoccurring nightmares when i was younger . they stopped after i reached adulthood , thankfully , but it was always the same set of nightmares that would consistently plague me and frighten me every night . it was horrifying .","297238":"lol . i ve never seen it myself because i don t have the app on my phone , but i m actually grateful for it because it has taught my parents to be more vigilant and less trusting of our neighbors . i ve always known that my town isn t the safest town , so i would always lock doors the second i came into the house , etc etc . meanwhile , my parents have no problem keeping the front door wide open or unlocked for hours it has always bothered me . after they downloaded the app and saw all of the criminal activities going on , they started locking the doors right away . whew .","297239":"neither i m more of a realist than anything else . i don t view things in terms of all good or all bad , and i like the approach circumstances from various perspectives and mindsets to try to predict the most probable cause or reaction . sometimes when i get into a depressive mindset , i do become very pessimistic . but the feeling is only fleeting , and once i m feeling back to normal , then i don t have those pessimistic thoughts anymore .","297240":"i really have to be in the mood for the beach in order to go , especially now that i ve gained weight and don t feel comfortable in a swimsuit . even when i go to to the beach , i don t go into the water very often unless i get super hot . most of the time , i prefer laying on the towel in the sand and getting a suntan .","297241":"i distinctly remember one person my parents used to bring to the house who made me feel uncomfortable , but i don t really remember why he made me feel uncomfortable . he just had a creepy aura about him . eventually my parents stopped being friends with him and his girlfriend , i also don t know why , but they stopped coming over the house when i was still very young .","297242":"no , that s not possible in my house . my bedroom window is two stories high and there s nothing to break the fall .","297243":"no , but my parents do . they have that smart doorbell i think it s called ring , and there s a community forum on the app where neighbors can post their videos of criminal happenings in the town .","297244":"i honestly can t remember , but it s a decent sized screen . i m definitely not about to take out my measuring tape and measure it , rofl . i got my tv a few years ago when my old tv s backlight died out , and it wasn t worth the price to try to fix it . so i ended up just buying a smart tv .","297245":"i can name perhaps three of my own friends whom i consider true friends . i also consider my boyfriend s best friend to be a true friend , but he s not so much my friend as he is my boyfriend s friend , if that makes any sense .","297246":"i used formspring frequently ! ! i think that s how i found out about askfm , actually . i joined askfm in i think because formspring was dying off .","297247":"this is from three days ago , my dude . why are you still bothered by this ? ? lmao . regardless , babycadiexo clarified her age when she dated her ex and it wasn t a big age gap . the anon was clearly lying just to try to prove their point . regardless of who it is , if someone is dating someone much older than them and they re a teenager , then i m going to express concern .","297248":"i know some people in florida who endured the hurricane , but they didn t sustain any damage from the storm , thankfully .","297249":"yes , i have . it s too bitter for my taste .","297250":"no , she wants to spend more time focusing on streaming and askfm was distracting her from that .","297251":"oh god , lmao . i forgot about the whole safe space thing .","297252":"i don t know anything about local politics , so i really don t know .","297253":"i m probably more left leaning than anything else . it s been a while since i ve attempted to define my beliefs , though .","297254":"hm , that s interesting . i could think of a handful of things you can dedicate your life to that s better than bashing people who did nothing to you .","297255":"no , i never heard of him before .","297256":"occasionally , yeah . i don t usually have a setting where i have the opportunity to sit down and listen to a podcast , though .","297257":"vile .","297258":"yes , i have malt drinks on occasion assuming you re talking about the alcoholic kind . my first ever alcoholic drink was a malt beverage , lol .","297259":"i don t believe i ever had an official talk with my parents about sex . if i did , i don t remember it at all . i knew about sex since before the age of , so i can only assume it was from my friends .","297260":"i used to have friends like that , but i haven t done anything wild or ridiculous since my early s . i ve since disbanded from those friends because we all ended up being toxic for each other .","297261":"i generally didn t get in trouble because i was a good student . however , there was one incident where i was pulled into the principal s office when i was in high school and they accused me of writing a death threat on a desk . i just remember sitting in a small room that only had a table and two chairs , and the police officer was asking me various , intimidating questions and basically assumed that i was the one who wrote the threat , even though other people also sat at that desk at other times during the day . they eventually let me go , but my anxiety skyrocketed that day and i nearly had a panic attack in the office .","297262":"when i m around my boyfriend , i always feel safe . he s a significant source of comfort to me , and every time i see him , i m overcome with a sensation of safety and being home . when i m not around my boyfriend , sometimes i do feel rather unsafe . i can certainly defend myself , but i m always terribly paranoid that someone is following me , watching me , keeping tabs on me , etc etc . i also get into mindsets where my impulsivity takes over and i have the urge to do dangerous things , so that plays a part in it as well .","297263":"as far as i m aware , i don t move at all when i sleep . the only thing i do is that i grind my teeth while i m sleeping . i really need to get a mouth guard . i don t cuddle with anything , unless my boyfriend is in bed with me , lol . when i m sleeping alone , however , i sprawl out and wrap myself into a blanket burrito .","297264":"i ve never had it before . however , i dislike custard so i probably wouldn t like it at all .","297265":"when i was much younger , yes . i wanted nothing to do with relationships during most of my teenage years so i never really noticed when if someone was flirting with me .","297266":"i don t own any of those kinds of shoes . right now , my favorite pair of shoes are these sleek , black ankle boots that i ve been wearing almost every day .","297267":"if you need psychiatric advice , then you may be better off consulting someone who s a mental health professional . i can relate my experiences and feelings to others , but i m not a doctor .","297268":"no , i don t have any drug allergies . i just have regular seasonal allergies , i . e . pollen and whatnot .","297269":"i prefer pasta , curly fries depending on how they re made , and soda .","297270":"i have five profile pictures you can look at to see what i look like . i don t have any new ones .","297271":"yeah , i drink energy drinks on occasion ! ! i just tried the new red bull today , actually , and it was really good . it s called beach breeze it tastes like tropical fruit and coconut .","297272":"courtney deactivated her account last week .","297273":"no , rofl . it isn t that deep . it s just something that i don t really enjoy .","297274":"neither , i m just not a fan of swimming .","297275":"the crow heathers i am not a serial killer american psycho django unchained","297276":"i would choose to feel no pain for the rest of my life . then i would get my entire body tattooed , lmao .","297277":"i met some of the crew from achievement hunter rooster teeth , if they count .","297278":"i m pretty sure most people want to be wealthy , lol .","297279":"no , not really . if i go to the beach , for example , i m much more content with laying out on the towel in the sand than going in the ocean .","297280":"i don t have a favorite car because i don t care about cars . as long as it runs well and has good miles to the gallon , it s fine by me .","297281":"i went to a water park once or twice when i was a teenager .","297282":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","297283":"no , i don t add people on xbox live unless they re already an existing friend . regardless , i also don t generally play live games and the ones i do , i already have a small group of friends who i play with .","297284":"i ve been smoking cigarettes since i was years old .","297285":"i play on an xbox one .","297286":"well yeah , if i didn t like smoking then i simply wouldn t smoke .","297287":"bored af anyone have any questions ? ? ?","297288":"i believe they re equally important , which is why it s integral to try to establish tone of voice when speaking to someone via writing , whether it s through text message or social media . tone is often lost in text based messages and can lead to miscommunication . when speaking face to face , what you say and how you say it are equally important because if you say something that s supposed to be helpful but it s in the wrong tone , then the other person could get offended . there are also statements you can say that can be rephrased a different way to convey better understanding .","297289":"april was somewhat of a turning point for me in terms of my toxic behavior , because i started to regain control of my impulsive behaviors for the first time in years . now that it s been just about a month , i can definitely feel a genuine change within me . and alongside that conscious difference , my relationship has gotten stronger because my boyfriend is essentially my full support system and backbone , cheering me on , because no one else seems to really care . i m looking forward to progressing more in the month of may , and not only regaining control of my urges but also cultivating more motivation within myself to be healthier .","297290":"was this a mass message , or just sent to me ? ? rofl . i don t really see myself as brave , i m very much afraid of a lot of things in my life and it prevents me from living my life to the fullest .","297291":"yeah , you re absolutely right . i honestly can t foresee the day where she would admit that she did something wrong , even if i m the one who will bring it up to her first which i can t even fathom doing until i m percent out of her grasp . she s the type of person to lie through her teeth even if presented with evidence to insist that she s right everyone else is wrong . even if i brought up the years of ab se to her , she would tell me that i was being dramatic and probably talk about me breaking down her reputation and making me out to be the enemy .","297292":"mandrakes","297293":"as much as it saddens me , i do appreciate that someone understands what it s like to deal with a person like that . my therapist asks me sometimes if i believe i would be able to forgive her , and honestly , i m not at that point nor do i believe i ll ever be at the point of forgiveness . there s still so much anger in me , probably because i still see my mother on a daily basis , so who knows how i ll feel years down the road from now .","297294":"no , she s never seen a psychiatrist and would refuse to acknowledge that she would ever need one . she constantly harasses my father and i for seeing our respective psychiatrists and therapists , and like i stated in my previous answer , she believes she s the only sane person around . she brags about how she doesn t have any mental health issues , smh . it s honestly something i came to terms with long ago , but the fact that i m still stuck at homes means that i have to continually deal with it until i find a better living situation .","297295":"i have considered that extensively , but she doesn t actually have a mental illness as far as i m aware . i ve heard the whole narcissistic ab se term thrown around before and i could understand if she had narcissistic traits , but again it s something she would never admit to . for example , she frequently exclaims that both my father and i are crazy and she s the only sane person in our household . she asks me about my anxiety attacks and depressive episodes and has no clue how to understand them or sympathize with them . even if she was mentally ill when she was ab sing me , that doesn t excuse her actions . you can be mentally ill and have a distinct concept of right vs wrong behavior . mental health doesn t justify toxic or harmful behaviors .","297296":"unfortunately , she did . she ll never admit now that she said those things when i was growing up , and i know that my memory problems are severe , but i still remember those statements clear as day . she ll probably never admit that she went wrong in her parenting just to keep up her gist of gaslighting me for all of these years , and although i m hyperaware of her tendencies and behavior now , it doesn t make those statements any less harmful or her attempts at redeeming herself any better .","297297":"statements along the lines of that they wanted me dead , that i m a burden to everyone around me , that my life is utterly meaningless , etc etc .","297298":"i don t remember specifically the times , but i do remember having to wake up around am and i would be in school by am . my last class ended around or pm at the latest .","297299":"there were a lot of rumors going around regarding teachers at my high school , haha . one of the bigger ones was that one of the th grade science teachers was addicted to cocaine , because sometimes he would enter the classroom and his eyes were huge and bloodshot and he would do nothing but yell at the kids all day . there were also rumors of teachers sleeping with students i think one teacher actually did .","297300":"if my spouse refused to acknowledge that there are problems in the relationship , regardless of how many times i tried to talk to them about it already , then i would inevitably leave the relationship . relationships are not one sided , and you cannot ignore a person who says that something isn t working anymore pretend that everything is fine .","297301":"yes , i know quite a few happy marriages .","297302":"no , they re married but they re definitely not happy in their marriage . before my mother fell ill , she would talk to me frequently about getting a divorce . however , now my father and in part myself is essentially her caretaker , so they re together out of obligation .","297303":"the majority of my money is spent on my bills , as well as gas for my car , food , coffee , and cigarettes .","297304":"no , my past doesn t define me . my past explains why i behave the way i do , but what defines me currently are my responses to my surroundings and how i can effectively change my behavior that has been ingrained in me from a young age .","297305":"soda doesn t exactly have any mind altering substances in it , besides one could argue caffeine , so i don t really see any basis upon which the law could limit how old someone should be to drink soda . but regardless , i do believe soda intake is an issue , particularly in the united states . soda shouldn t be cheaper or more readily available than healthier alternatives , such as water or some forms of juice although juice has a lot of sugar in it too .","297306":"my boyfriend and best friend are both inspirations to me . they ve both been through a lot of hardship in their lives have managed to remain motivated and successful in spite of their struggles . they also both struggle with a lot of medical complications , and i ve always admired how they rise above their illnesses and don t allow them to get in the way of what they want to do .","297307":"i enjoy a lot of hobbies , but i seldom get to partake in them . things like playing video games , reading , writing , painting , listening to music , photography , etc etc .","297308":"it depends on the individual , which is also the point i have been making since last night , lol . there s no clear cut age that someone should or should not date assuming both parties are over the age of , it s simply a matter of life experience , goals , and vigilance . someone who is and the other is could surprisingly work out , while another couple with the same age gap won t work out . everything varies case by case . as long as the younger individual is being hyperaware so that they don t become manipulated .","297309":"you re right , and that was the point i was making as well . i just don t see how a relationship like that can work out when one person is just entering college and the other already has a career established , for example . there s a large difference in circumstantial life events and milestones .","297310":"lol . just pulling sh t out of their ass to try to prove their point , evidently .","297311":"yes , i agree . god forbid i get concerned if i hear that a teenager is dating someone who s in their mid s , lol . people who are even in their early s can be prone to manipulation if there s an obvious power imbalance .","297312":"why would it matter if the roles were reversed ? ? y all are making it out as if i said it was utterly wrong , when i never said that . lmao . if you read back on my messages from last night , you would see that i would be concerned about the age gap due to potential manipulative behavior . y all also forget that there was a significant age gap between me and my ex , so .","297313":"i never said that they were , but it s something to be cautious about regardless . a year old is legally an adult , but they re still a teenager and its perfectly acceptable to be cautious about who a teenager is dating when their partner is in their mid s . there s a large potential for manipulative behavior . just because i said that a person may have those tendencies doesn t mean they do , or that everyone does . like i stated last night , there will be good men and women who exist among us . unfortunately though , not everyone is a good person .","297314":"what s wrong with saying that they may ? not everyone is a good person or has pure intentions .","297315":"he s five feet , seven inches .","297316":"i don t expect everyone to agree with me , lol . if i cared about what other people thought , then i wouldn t have voiced my thoughts on the matter . regardless , my opinion wasn t extreme or anything i basically said it goes on a case by case basis . a year old and a year old aren t necessarily in the same stages of their lives so i don t see how those relationships would work out .","297317":"i stated in my previous answer that i wasn t single . but yes , i have a boyfriend .","297318":"no , i m in a relationship .","297319":"my week is going all right . i ve been sick all week , but i m slowly getting better . this week is also going by pretty fast for me , i m happy that its wednesday already .","297320":"i prefer neither , but if i had to pick one , it would be beef .","297321":"idk what to tell you . i inherited my family s short genes , haha .","297322":"uh , yeah ? ? i wasn t aware that white people can t be short , lmfao . i m short because my family on my mother s side is short . although , i m actually the shortest one .","297323":"lol , yes i m a smol bean .","297324":"no , i don t have solar power unfortunately . i try to make it for it by using energy saving lightbulbs .","297325":"no , i have one brother .","297326":"all of their answers are interesting and entertaining to read .","297327":"i m five feet tall , lol .","297328":"two hours per day .","297329":"it doesn t change the fact that an adult is attracted to someone who is barely legal . if they realize their age and still try to pursue them , then that s predatory behavior . there s no rational reason for a grown adult to pursue a teenager .","297330":"like i said , it varies and goes on a case by case basis when it comes to that sort of age gap . no doubt there will be some good guys , but it would personally make me cautious if i knew someone who was around my age and was dating a year old .","297331":"that s irrelevant , though . that s years down the line , and it has no reflection on the current moment when the year old is still a teenager and the year old is in their mid s .","297332":"perhaps in those cases , it really varies because they re still in a transition stage of life . i would be cautious if i knew someone who was was dating a year old , for example .","297333":"that s a bit of a borderline situation for me , but overall there s still a large gap in both age and life events . a year old is just starting college , while someone who s has already had their career started . they re in totally different areas of their life so i don t see how that would work .","297334":"this is true too ! ! it s completely unnecessary , and guaranteed they also exhibited the same behavior when they were younger , going after literal children much younger than them . if anyone tries to justify an older man going after barely legal teenagers , i m throwing hands .","297335":"? ? ?","297336":"agreed . and it also doesn t matter if they re mature for their age that s hella predatory behavior .","297337":"yes , that s exactly it . there are only toxic reasons behind it and anyone who tries to justify a year old trying to date a teenager is scum .","297338":"although there is a correlation between mental illness and creativity i believe ? , you cannot be so creative that it would make you have a psychotic break . if anything , that inclination was already there prior to being creative , so the main issue is that the mental illness wasn t treated correctly .","297339":"it doesn t surprise me , although i do expect that there will be some jobs that can t be replaced by artificial intelligence . i don t believe my specific job , for example , would be suited for ai technology .","297340":"i wholeheartedly agree . the only reason men that age pursue teenagers is because they re easy to control and manipulate .","297341":"yes . there s absolutely no reason for someone in their s or older to be interested in teenagers unless they have nefarious reasons .","297342":"not unless they re using it to prey on younger users . there s nothing wrong with being in your s and using social media , lol .","297343":"it s easier for me to control my spending when i m shopping in stores , especially considering there s less of a selection for me in stores as opposed to online . i do end up spending more money online , though . however , it doesn t happen very often at all .","297344":"well , that s your prerogative . me and my friends have done a lot worse sh t than downloading music , lmao .","297345":"no . there are a lot worse things you can do to be considered a bad person , and downloading music illegally isn t a big deal .","297346":"i don t have an opinion . i used to do it all the time when i was a teenager , lol .","297347":"i believe manipulation is always bad . it may have advantages directly to the person doing the manipulating , but it comes from a toxic mindset .","297348":"snowy mountains in the heights of alaska .","297349":"of course cats think , lol . most animals have the capacity to think , to my understanding . at least the more complex animals with more intelligence .","297350":"it depends entirely on my mood , so there isn t an exact time or day when i normally feel most creative . sometimes i wake up with a profound idea in mind , so i spend the entire day writing and planning it out . other times , i can go weeks without an ounce of creativity .","297351":"my bed . even my boyfriend s bed doesn t compare to how comfortable my own bed is , haha . i have two mattress pads , a weighted blanket , a down comforter , and four really soft pillows .","297352":"i haven t shopped at hot topic since i was years old , lol .","297353":"i fear abandonment the most out of everything .","297354":"my day was all right . it was honestly hard to get through the day because i ve been sick lately , and today in particular was pretty terrible . my throat is on fire , i keep coughing violently , my head feels like it s exploding , etc etc . i really hope i don t have an upper respiratory infection or strep .","297355":"i originally answered this with basically an idk , but a song just came on my spotify playlist that i believe i heard on the radio , lol . my blood by twenty one pilots https www . youtube . com watch ? v hvbclcerogm","297356":"my entire life is a joke , so .","297357":"it could certainly increase someone s confidence , sure . some people are unhappy with the way their body looks , so by exercising and obtaining the body they want , their confidence in themselves could increase .","297358":"besides the people i talk to regularly , i recommend following sweetnothings urlsareshittbh youcuntx origamibirds psyquietrist daintybumblebee kittiemeowsie","297359":"getting up early on the weekends to do my freelance work . i used to hate waking up super early , but i ve developed an enjoyment of having the few hours of absolute silence in the morning before everyone else wakes up .","297360":"i have no clue , haha . i never went to the doctor for it . i m assuming it s just a side effect of my anxiety .","297361":"no , i disagree . not everyone wants to have children that s perfectly okay . there shouldn t be so much pressure for people to have children , if you don t want kids then that should be fine . a lot of people don t understand that though , they believe it s to be expected .","297362":"sometimes i do , but having stomach problems isn t something new to me . it happens to me fairly often .","297363":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","297364":"no , i wouldn t do that to someone .","297365":"maybe if you had a backpack or something , yeah .","297366":"i always burn store bought popcorn , lmao . and you can get the fresh butter on the movie theater popcorn . not to mention the fact that it would be extremely difficult to sneak in your own popcorn into a theater .","297367":"yeah , but i love movie theater popcorn lol .","297368":"neither , i don t eat candy . i ll just usually get a popcorn .","297369":"it s something i try not to think about often , but i m sure it ties into my bpd and body dysphoria somehow .","297370":"no , i feel fairly disconnected from my body , as if it isn t actually mine at all .","297371":"it isn t a matter of when , it s a matter of if . i don t know if i want children in the future .","297372":"not very far . most of my plans are spontaneous , usually decided the same day .","297373":"babycadiexo","297374":"lol . i might do that later tonight . my boyfriend told me to watch a youtube video about a video game called astroneer because he just bought it , and it s actually a really cute game . it s like an outer space version of minecraft .","297375":"yes , this is the very last season . there are only three episodes left .","297376":"i was actually watching one of the hbogo behind the episode things after the episode , and the creators purposely broke up the battle scenes to little mini battles following each character so that it wasn t monotonous . i just loved the development of the scenes in general , i was literally on the edge of my seat , and gasping , and almost crying , lmao . people will complain about anything , it s pathetic . just enjoy the damn show smh .","297377":"the only thing i want to rant about is about game of thrones , and i know some of my followers haven t seen the newest episode yet , so i don t want to spoil it for them ! ! i will say this , though i m so incredibly happy with the way the episode happened , and it moved me to so many different emotions . it felt like a movie , haha .","297378":"i can t see any positive value for jealousy . it s a negative and toxic emotion , and even if it does drive someone to do better , it s coming from an unhealthy place .","297379":"why would you want to stay with someone out of convenience when you know you don t love them anymore ? ? that s cheating yourself and your partner out of happiness . never settle for anything less than you deserve .","297380":"bad guy by billie eilish https youtu . be iklfahnyzxs","297381":"depends on what he was saying . if he was being gross and vulgar , then i would screenshot the messages and send them to her .","297382":"no , i disagree . if love turns into a habit and you re not passionate about that person anymore , and you re just staying with them for convenience or out of obligation , then perhaps it s time for you both to move on .","297383":"probably , but i don t think either of my parents would care either way .","297384":"i m sure everyone does . i don t personally know any , though .","297385":"sometimes . i still have clothing from years ago , so it really depends on how my style has changed .","297386":"i don t have a movie that always makes me cry . if i watch something for the first time and cry , then i m usually desensitized to it by the second time .","297387":"actually , yeah . i just spent some money on clothing this weekend , and next weekend i m planning on going through my wardrobe and donating everything that either doesn t fit me anymore or that i simply don t wear .","297388":"no , none of my friends wear a hijab . i went to high school and college with a few people who did , though .","297389":"for the most part , yes . i splurge on rare occasions , but i generally only spend my money on the necessities .","297390":". but the upside was that it didn t put any points on my license .","297391":"yeah , i got a speeding ticket once a few years ago . i was on the highway and going mph over the speed limit , haha . i think it was in a mph zone .","297392":"like i stated in my last answer , i talk to my boyfriend on the phone , lol . it s easier to call him rather than text him . we usually talk on the phone every day .","297393":"nope . and regardless of how many times you ask this question , my answer isn t going to change .","297394":"contrary to popular belief , there are still instances where you have to call people , lol . unfortunately , you cannot text doctors offices , insurance companies , or mechanics as examples .","297395":"i don t talk on the phone unless it s with my boyfriend . it s just much easier than texting .","297396":"depends on what kind of game show it is , because you don t necessarily need to be intelligent to be on a game show . regardless , i probably wouldn t do it because i don t like crowds of people .","297397":"i ve never worn a uniform for school , but i wore a uniform when i worked in retail years ago . when i initially got hired , i had to wear the store shirt and khaki or black pants . then i wore a lab coat when i worked in the photo lab and pharmacy . in my current job , i don t have to wear a uniform . my job is pretty casual .","297398":"i have no idea , lol .","297399":"i ve never seen it , but crude language doesn t bother me .","297400":"i ve stopped smoking marijuana for the most part i used to smoke daily when i was in college , and now i only smoke maybe once every few months . marijuana itself isn t hazardous , but it made me want to drink more and i ate more often .","297401":"my favorite band probably isn t going to make music anymore , so idk . i would bring my boyfriend and his best friend , my best friend , one close friend , and one coworker .","297402":"lol , yes . i had evanescence , linkin park , ville valo from him , stone temple pilots , and marilyn manson on my walls .","297403":"lol . gotta watch it late at night in a dark room ! ! i m contemplating on watching it again , that s how good it was .","297404":"you keep bringing up the name nazar , but i don t know anyone by that name , lol . this is utterly useless to me

romantic context ? ? no , i have a boyfriend .","297408":"i just don t understand why everyone was complaining that the episode was too dark it s supposed to be dark , it s a battle against humans and the undead and it took place at night . i had all of my lights off so i saw it just fine .","297409":"tonight s episode , but i also re watched last week s episode as a refresher beforehand .","297410":"i would never post spoilers ! ! i m just so emotional . lmao .","297411":"if they can handle a brush and paint , i don t see why not .","297412":"literally me after game of thrones

t know much about other cultures .","297419":"smoking and drinking alcohol .","297420":"yes , i believe so . there are so many people in this world and we have the potential to be compatible with a lot of them . it all depends on whether or not we have the opportunity to meet them .","297421":"i don t believe in past lives , so no .","297422":"i think it s immature . you re not going to solve an issue by ignoring them . there needs to be open communications in relationships , both platonic and romantic .","297423":"it s wrong to try to actively change your partner the most you can do is talk to them about their wrong behavior and explain why you believe they can do better . if you try to forcibly change a person , then you re acting manipulative and will end up making that person resent you .","297424":"yeah , i used to love those movies . i didn t see any of them past the third or fourth one , though .","297425":"yes , i enjoy violent movies . my favorites are probably american psycho and django unchained .","297426":"i try my very best not to hold grudges . sometimes i can t help it and find myself angry with people over things that happened long ago , but it s something i

which is as a writer editor for a publishing company at the moment . i ve taken on extra responsibility over the past few weeks and i m constantly cross referencing my work to make sure everything is correct before i send it off to the next step .","297431":"i wouldn t say never , but if i m angry with my boyfriend or a close friend , then i prefer to solve the issue immediately . sometimes it s not possible due to me or them being busy , though .","297432":"if i m arguing with someone which is rare , lol then i normally prefer to solve the issue right away in that moment . there needs to be communication between people , and i fully abide by the saying don t go to bed angry because it s detrimental to your physical and emotional well being .","297433":"i wrap it in a towel to get the excess water out , and then i just let it air dry naturally . i don t like applying heat to my hair .","297434":"probably positive reinforcement is very important , and kids need encouragement for them to succeed at the things they re doing .","297435":"yes , if i have future children then they will do chores around the house . it teaches them how to do simply household things , as well as responsibility and discipline .","297436":"depends on who it is . if my boyfriend is sad , then it really affects my mood . however , anyone else doesn t have much of an effect on me . if a close friend is sad then i ll feel bad for them , but idk if i would feel sad with them .","297437":"it depends on a variety of things , because it doesn t necessarily mean he s ignoring you . it could simply mean that he s busy , he hasn t seen it yet , or he doesn t have the energy to respond to it yet .","297438":"i can certainly dance , but it doesn t mean i dance well .","297439":"a pronoun is

, was that what you originally meant ? ? lmao . no , i have no desire to own a motorbike .","297447":"i would rather own a car . if i only owned a bicycle , then it would take me hours to get to work

would absolutely love if sansa stark ruled the seven kingdoms . she s proven herself to be a worthy ruler , and she s extremely methodical and intelligent . my only concern is that she s perhaps too cold , in that she may be almost a ruthless ruler and not understanding .","297450":"i will be so upset if brienne dies . she was just knighted and was so happy to be recognized , and i would be so

related to tyrion lannister , lol . his penchant for drinking and knowledge about various subjects has always resonated with me , and he has always exhibited a logical perspective which is why he s probably so good at being daenarys hand .","297452":"so excited for game of thrones tonight listening to all the soundtracks while i work ! ! ask me questions","297453":"no , i have no interest in doing such a thing .","297454":"i like everyone i follow because their answers are interesting and entertaining to me , so i can t really pick favorites . however , i m personally the closest to misphire , shehitsback , and littlesha because i talk to them fairly often outside of askfm .","297455":"i ve always judged books by their cover art , haha . if something catches my eye while i m in the bookstore , then i m more likely to pick it up and read the synopsis on the back .","297456":"i m generally drawn to people with bright , bold personalities . most of my friends are strong and independent people who aren t afraid to state their opinions regardless of who they re talking to .","297457":"i mean . . . i absolutely love both , lmao . regular french fries are great depending on where i get them from usually local delis and stuff have amazing french fries , but curly fries are equally as delicious , especially when they re loaded with spices .","297458":"i like vanilla frosting , but that s pretty much it . i can only have small amounts of it , otherwise it irritates my stomach . i ve definitely never eaten a whole can of it , lol that would be a death wish .","297459":"i m passionate about animals , so i would definitely be angry with that person over flushing a fish who is alive and well . she definitely should have re homed the fish instead of unnecessarily k lling it . i don t know if i would necessarily end a friendship over it , but i would certainly be disappointed in them for even thinking that such a thing was okay to do .","297460":"i m strongly pro vaccinations . there s absolutely no reason not to vaccinate your children , and you re putting not only your own child at risk but also other children by not vaccinating against deadly diseases . the rate of measles , for example , has gone up severely over the past few years or so due to the anti vaxx movement , which is absolutely disgusting to me . i don t believe i have any friends who are anti vaxx , but if i did , i would certainly talk to them about the benefits of vaccinations and how they re helpful to society .","297461":"probably not . i don t care about who sends me anonymous messages , and most of the people who send me things anonymously aren t being mean or malicious .","297462":"i don t have a closet or a bathroom near my room , so this doesn t really apply to me . i keep my bedroom door open , though , because otherwise my room gets pretty stuffy and uncomfortable .","297463":"i used to buy alcohol so i could drink every night , but it s been over a month since i ve done that . i ve been moderating my alcohol intake and decreasing it severely , and now i ve only been drinking every weeks at the most . regardless , the drink i bought last night was . that isn t exactly expensive , lol .","297464":"no , i don t believe in destiny . i believe life is more of a domino effect , with each of our actions influencing everything around us , and there s really no pre determined fate or destiny for us all .","297465":"the first ones that come to mind are demi lovato lady gaga . both have been quite open about their struggles with anorexia and bulimia over the years and have donated their time and money to charities related to eating disorder treatment .","297466":"yes , i m fairly good at budgeting . i don t normally spend money on things unless absolutely necessary , and when i do splurge , i make sure it s on items that i ll actually use .","297467":"my app hasn t changed in quite a while .","297468":"i don t

questions , this isn t the type of thing i tolerate people asking me . thx , next","297471":"lol , yes definitely ! ! kaz was definitely up there in the characters i disliked , but i think i was most disgusted with ferguson which says a lot about pamela s acting skills to have such a strong reaction to a character . she was absolutely vile .","297472":"lol yes . franky is definitely my favorite but i also really love allie bea as well . it s definitely the best prison show i ve ever seen , it totally blows orange is the new black out of the water . i m so happy that my friend recommended wentworth to me years ago because i was totally obsessed with it for a while .","297473":"depends on an individual s preference some people prefer tall men , others prefer short men , and there are also others who don t particularly care .","297474":"no , i ve never said that to myself surprisingly . although i have my own issues with alcohol , i ve been monitoring myself fairly well and i don t need to quit drinking entirely .","297475":"no , i simply act like myself .","297476":"i only just heard about this now . obviously it s a terrible tragedy and my heart goes out to everyone affected by the shooting .","297477":"i m not sure if my high school had a room like that . i didn t misbehave when i was in school , so i never got in school suspension or even detention , for that matter .","297478":"hello i m doing fine . i feel much better than i did yesterday , although i still have body sores and a headache . i ve been trying to take it easy and i m going to relax by watching some television tonight .","297479":"netflix parks recreation forensic files wentworth criminal minds supernatural hulu the x files ghost adventures brooklyn nine nine it s always sunny in philadelphia rock","297480":"ideally , i would like to be a wolf . however , i m definitely more like a sloth , lmao .","297481":"i like both cats and dogs it ultimately depends on their personalities , because there are some cats who are loving creatures while others are a holes , and the same goes for dogs too . i think if i had the option , i would choose a dog first though .","297482":"i have zero acting ability , so i realistically wouldn t choose anyone . however , my favorite fictional character is lestat from the vampire chronicles based on the books by anne rice , and i think it would be fabulous to play as him .","297483":"my entire state of being is nervousness , lol . that s what happens when you have an anxiety disorder , unfortunately .","297484":"i used to dress sorta punk ish when i was younger , but these days , i don t care so much anymore . i don t dress for style , i dress for comfort . back in the day , i did wear plaid skinny pants , combat boots , and mostly black clothing . i also colored my hair funky colors and had it in various styles , including a faux hawk , and i had my labret pierced .","297485":"i suppose my best year was , when i was years old . it was my senior year of high school , so i was excited to leave move forward with my life . i met my boyfriend and started dating him that year as well , and it inspired a new curiosity about life within me .","297486":"this is going to sound weird and gross , but i feel nostalgic about my sadness when i was a pre teen and teenager . i feel as if i had a legitimate reason to be depressed svicidal back then , meanwhile these days , i don t have a reason it just happens without a reason or if there is , it s insignificant , and it makes me feel guilty . i have this weird sense of nostalgia for those times when i was young , because out of my depression came bouts of creativity . i was bursting at the seams with an almost manic fervor to create , and i wish i still felt that way at times .","297487":"no , i didn t receive anything special for good grades or good behavior . it was expected of me most of the time , and because i was naturally a good student , i didn t receive praise or anything since it wasn t out of the ordinary for me .","297488":"my favorite activities hobbies from when i was younger are actually the same as the ones i have now primarily reading , writing , playing video games , and art . when i was younger , however , i had a lot more time to dedicate to my hobbies than i do now .","297489":"i have two friends whom i still talk to on a regular basis from my childhood meaning early teenage years my best friend , and another close friend i ve known since i was years old . everyone else has pretty much fallen off the radar , or we ve distanced each other for one reason or another . i also didn t grow up having many friends at all .","297490":"either sushi or scrambled eggs with a side of toasted rye bread .","297491":"mental illness can t be cured like other physical illnesses . you can go into remission , but you still have the disorder . the best course of treatment is always to consult a professional , whether that s with talk therapy or medication . everyone is different .","297492":"hello do you have a question ? ?","297493":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","297494":"i don t , because i m not . people just don t ask me about why i m not a good friend , so it isn t something spoken about often .","297495":"the last time i pushed the boundaries of my comfort zone was few days ago when i made specific decisions regarding a project i m working on at work . i was somewhat afraid to make those big decisions because i felt it wasn t really my place to do so , but i stepped forward and gave my input because it was expected of me .","297496":"i thoroughly enjoy reading the answers of everyone i follow , which is why i follow them in the first place . however , i m closest to shehitsback , misphire , and littlesha .","297497":"everything i say shows my true colors , lol . my true colors are varied and entirely depend upon my mood in that particular moment .","297498":"no , not at all . i m not diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder or consider myself to have that diagnosis . on the contrary , i have borderline personality disorder .","297499":"i m neutral towards people , but that doesn t mean i m not kind to others . i m usually nice to people unless they give me a reason to behave otherwise .","297500":"my boyfriend and my best friend , as well as one or two close friends .","297501":"no , not generally . i only make promises in terms of my work production and my friends boyfriend , and i wouldn t want to disappoint them or inconvenience them by not taking responsibility or not fulfilling a promise . i often do things for other people that have no effect on my own well being , and sometimes i ll sacrifice my own happiness to ensure other people are comfortable .","297502":"no , that s one thing i pride myself on my responsibility . i don t make promises unless i m sure i can keep them , and i m always willing to go the extra mile to ensure that i fulfill that promise or responsibility . especially when it comes to professional settings .","297503":"it s incredibly easy for me to lie , but because of that , i try not to lie because i don t want it to become a habit . it also depends on who i m talking to , because some people are easier to lie to than others . i ll lie to my parents , for instance , but not to my boyfriend or close friends . there s simply no point in lying to them .","297504":"i m already female , considering that s my assigned sex . i m still non binary regardless of my sex , though , because sex and gender are different entities .","297505":"death would be a blessing in my eyes because you simply don t suffer when it comes to death . you just cease to exist . and while i wish these people would cease to exist , i wouldn t wish death upon them because that s often the easy way out .","297506":"i am quite aware of what celinem said . both leigh and lee are used by men and women , thus meaning they re gender neutral .","297507":"my sympathy has long been lost for certain people , especially those whose presence and behavior leads me to anger episodes .","297508":"that s the opposite of what celinem said , lol i agree though it s a super neutral name ! reading comprehension is a gift , my friend .","297509":"yes , my anger is triggered by the behaviors of certain people in my life , whether they intentionally want to anger me or not . sometimes just a person s presence in my life is enough to set off my anger if i m already heading towards that mood , since my anxiety and depression sometimes come out in the form of irritability .","297510":"it makes me wonder if it s a regional thing as well . leigh has always been a gender neutral , almost masculine , name to me because i see more men using it than women . leah lea are more feminine names in my opinion , while lee is also gender neutral .","297511":"my emotions can change at the drop of a hat with no rhyme or reason to them . i can go from being in a content mood to feeling completely numb and dissociated usually triggered by something , though , whether it s significant or insignificant . i also experience bouts of rage , where i do sometimes lose control although i ve been working on controlling those impulsive behaviors .","297512":"i don t remember what my first big disappointment was . i can only assume it was in myself , though .","297513":"leigh is a gender neutral name , actually . it s used for both men and women . the first time i heard that name , it was used by a man .","297514":"my nickname when i was a pre teen and teenager was lee . nearly everyone from that time period called me lee , and i enjoyed it because it was gender neutral . as i got older , i changed my nickname to leigh because i felt that it suited me better .","297515":"i ve always wanted to go on a legitimate vacation when i was younger , but my family never did vacations . a lot of people my age were accustomed to taking family vacations during the summer months , and i always wanted to do the same , but it unfortunately never happened . the first actual vacation i took was with friends during my sophomore year of college .","297516":"i m going to answer these questions regarding my pre teen and teenage years , because i don t remember much of my adolescence younger than the age of or so . when i was around that age , the first bands i became interested in were linkin park , evanescence , and korn . i also listened to sum , green day , limp bizkit , eminem , hawthorne heights , straylight run , and other bands . i still like some of that music , particularly linkin park and korn , but i haven t heard the other bands musicians in years .","297517":"yeah , i would probably consider them to be racist in that instance . there s absolutely no reason to use racist slurs , and for a person to resort to using slurs when they re in the heat of the moment means that it s almost second nature to them . they may not realize it themselves , though , and they may actually believe that their behavior is okay .","297518":"yes , ugh . that has happened to me on several occasions , haha . i normally just sit and wait in my car when that happens unless the place is closed , or i internally battle with myself about just walking in early and seeing what happens . there have been a few occasions where i got to my doctor s appointments super early , but they took me anyway because they didn t have a previous appointment .","297519":"i don t know much about the loch ness monster , but it wouldn t surprise me if it existed either . like i stated in my previous answer , there s so many things left undiscovered on this earth especially when it comes to wildlife in deep lakes and seas so it would make sense to have creatures that we didn t know existed previously .","297520":"i don t know much about bigfoot or the yeti , but it wouldn t surprise me if they were both real . there s still a lot we need to learn about the planet we live on , and there are so many things left undiscovered .","297521":"no , i don t know how to roller skate . i tried learning once when i was a child , but i was absolutely terrible at it and haven t done it since .","297522":"yes , i believe in aliens and ufos . i think it s ignorant to assume that earth is the only planet that can sustain life in this universe , and we simply haven t discovered those planets yet because they re too far out of reach .","297523":"i had to learn how to parallel park while obtaining my driver s license , but i ve only had to do it a handful of times since then . i still remember how , so i think i can still do it effectively , but i almost never need to .","297524":"aw , i love when people ask me my own questions . normally i try to ask people questions that i would be willing to answer myself , lol . i do believe that i m holding onto something that i need to let go of , however . sometimes i get into old mindsets from when i was younger , where i become stuck in a depressive mindset and believe that nothing can truly get better . i hold onto that sadness and exasperated feeling , because it became familiar to me and i strangely find comfort in it . it s something i ve been trying to work on letting go , because i m in a different stage of my life now and i don t need to hold onto those feelings anymore .","297525":"yes , some racist people have the capability to change . i ve never witnessed it first hand either , but i still believe that someone who is racist can realize the toxicity within themselves and actively change their perspectives to be more inclusive . often when this happens , the racist person was simply raised in a racist environment and was conditioned to think the same way . as they get older , they may realize how problematic that mindset was and seek to change themselves .","297526":"i dislike when a person is disloyal , dishonest , and manipulative . i also don t like when people have an arrogant personality or are willingly close minded , which usually involves them being racist , sexist , homophobic , transphobic , etc etc . i do believe that some people can change their personalities , or at least toxic traits that become apparent to them , as they get older . while we grow up , our traits and interests inevitably change . however , it s also important to note that not everyone evolves as they grow older , and some people retain the same toxic traits that they had when they were younger .","297527":"well my weekend just started , considering it s not even am on saturday morning . however , it s been fine . i just finished my first freelance assignment , and i have about five more before i m finished for the weekend . physically , i m still exhausted and rather sick . yesterday , i woke up completely nauseous and dizzy , but i went to work anyway . i ended up leaving early and spent the remainder of the day in bed because my entire body was sore i suspected that i had a fever . i m feeling slightly better today , but not percent .","297528":"yeah , i text my mother sometimes when i m busy with working on freelance work in my room and don t feel like going downstairs to talk to her . she ll usually text me first and i ll respond accordingly .","297529":"i like the idea of reincarnation , but i don t personally believe in it . i think it s interesting to fathom the concept of being reborn again into something different , and it certainly would explain if there s life after death , but it isn t something i believe actually exists .","297530":"i don t know your partner , so i can t really determine if he s racist based solely on this information . he may just be pointing out the differences in culture . however , if this is causing a rift in your relationship then perhaps you should try to talk to him about it more and get him to realize that you re not being over sensitive . explain that there isn t much of a difference between him and yourself . it makes me wonder if perhaps he s insecure in the relationship considering how often he seems to bring it up . maybe he unconsciously thinks that the differences in culture may not be good for your relationship , although perhaps i m also overthinking this .","297531":"i try not to allow my bad habits to hold me back from success , which also includes my mental illnesses . in the past , my anxiety disorder held me back in a lot of different ways , because i was too anxious afraid to take new opportunities in fear of failing at them . however , these days i ve learned how to properly deal with my anxiety and pursue my goals despite feeling anxious over them . i understand that i shouldn t allow my anxiety to control my life , and i persist in spite of it .","297532":"i don t believe the average person thinks beyond their immediate surroundings , no . most people are primarily concerned with how things affect their own lives , not so much the lives around them or the world as a whole . i ve realized over the past few years that a lot of people also aren t aware of a lot of global affairs and events that could affect them in the long run because they don t care about politics , history , current events , etc etc . people don t consider the world beyond themselves because they simply believe that nothing will personally affect them , when that isn t the case at all . there are certain laws that have been passed that will sometimes ultimately affect a person s life , whether they believe it or not .","297533":"yeah , this happened to me during my high school early college years . i wanted to pursue creative writing as a primary subject of study , so i majored in the subject during my freshman year of college . some people around me told me that i wasn t going to find a job in that field because it would essentially be a useless degree , and i didn t believe them at first . however , during the end of my freshman year , i realized that they were somewhat right . it was too specific of a major to really find a versatile array of jobs in the field , not unless i wanted to pursue further education and go into teaching , which i didn t want to do . i changed my major to communications professional writing , which is much more diverse because it encompassed not only writing , but also business , marketing , and journalism . since then , i ve had two jobs in my field .","297534":"i don t really know what you mean by limits in this context . however , there s a large problem with not taking no for an answer in today s society , especially in terms of dating and consent . a lot of people are under the impression that just because someone doesn t say no , it automatically means yes when that isn t the case whatsoever . when people don t take no for an answer , they re essentially forcing themselves upon other people and not willing to accept the truth . they ll continually try to pursue others regardless of the other person s feelings , and it can turn into a red flag for manipulative ab sive behavior .","297535":"uh , a few weeks ago i tried the chocolate cherry cold brew coffee from dunkin for the first time , lol . it was ridiculously good ! ! i get it every once in a while now , especially since they have medium cold brews between pm every day .","297536":"i believe someone is a bad parent when they re not looking out for the welfare and happiness of their child ren . these types of people normally care more about themselves than others , including their children , and will go and do things even if it s not in the best interest of their child ren .","297537":"normally when i m asked this question , i say that i wouldn t change anything because i m currently happy with the way my life is turning out and i wouldn t want the domino effect to change anything about my life in the present . however , i honestly think my life would have turned out better had i not endured years of ab se as a child , which led to the development of my mental illnesses . my mental illnesses aren t usually debilitating , but they have prevented me from taking some opportunities and they make it generally harder for me to live my life . i ve nevertheless persisted in spite of them , but they re still there .","297538":"i would say a or . i m not abnormally intelligent or anything , but i am fairly smart when it comes to certain things . i also had the privilege of going to college and earning a degree , whereas a lot of people in my country don t have that opportunity which goes to show how truly awful the education system is here .","297539":"i don t believe i have just one object that s a prized possession of mine . i find sentimental value in the jewelry my boyfriend has bought me , though , so those would probably qualify as prized possessions . i also have a deep connection to a painting he commissioned for me from a friend of ours who s an artist , as well as a signed poster from mike shinoda that s hanging on my wall .","297540":"i answered this question not too long ago , actually . regardless , to answer your question i mainly eat when i feel hungry , but because i have such a regular routine every day , those times are normally the same every day . i usually eat breakfast between am , lunch between pm , and dinner between pm .","297541":"thank you","297542":"no , i ve never been interested in playing pubg . i ve watched my boyfriend play on countless occasions though .","297543":"a large cup of coffee , a cigarette , and my boyfriend s company .","297544":"i don t know who either of those people are , so i don t have an opinion .","297545":"i somewhat agree with it , but i also disagree with it . it s important to surround yourself with people who contribute to your personal growth , and if you feel that you re experiencing low self esteem and that your companions may be adding to those feelings . then you should rid them from your life . it helps to have supportive friends who aid in your development , not stifle it . at the same time , however , depression isn t necessarily caused by being around people who are a holes , lol . it mainly stems from genetic causes as well as your upbringing . so you could be surrounded by positive people and still have depression , it doesn t discriminate . in that respect , i believe the quote is a bit misguided .","297546":"no , that s incredibly disrespectful . even if you have a falling out with a friend , you should still respect them enough to keep their secrets to yourself from when they confided in you when you were friends . you wouldn t want someone doing that to you , so why would you do that to someone else ? ?","297547":"i just emailed a tattoo artist i ve been following for a while in the hopes of setting a consultation and or appointment with her , yeee . i haven t gotten a tattoo in years , and i m overdue for some new ink . now i m anxious af because i m afraid she s not going to get back to me , lmao . i found her email on the tattoo shop s website , so i hope she still uses it ! !","297548":"not really , no . i like moderately spicy food , but anything hotter than that is way too much for me .","297549":"i m somewhat good at identifying toxic traits in myself if they become apparent enough , but i also require other people telling me if i m being toxic because sometimes i also don t realize it . recently , i have had to overcome my drinking habit because it was becoming problematic and toxic to other people in my life , particularly my boyfriend . i was drinking nights per week and often getting blackout drunk , and it wasn t healthy for either my physical or mental health . so i ve recently cut down severely on when i do drink , and i also don t allow myself to get drunk anymore if i do decide to have a drink at night . it s been difficult admitting that i have a problem , but it s better to acknowledge it rather than ignore it .","297550":"i would absolutely love to be able to teleport , lol . it would be so much easier to teleport to where i need to go instead of driving or taking public transportation .","297551":"one of my favorite books is girl interrupted by susanna kaysen . i read it for the first time while i was still in high school , and it was an amazing introduction to the struggles of mental illness for me , and it made me feel less alone in my battles . it also gave me insight into borderline personality disorder , which i was later diagnosed with when i entered my s .","297552":"above all else , i admire honesty and loyalty in other people . it s rare to see people who are true to themselves and true to their friends these days , and are willing to talk to their friends or partners when necessary to implement real change in their lives . a trait i despise in other people is dishonesty and manipulative behavior . i won t associate with anyone who exhibits those traits .","297553":"i graduated high school years ago . my life has gotten better since high school , since i struggled a lot of mental illness during that time . i honestly didn t think i would be alive to see my th birthday , let alone live to be years old . since graduating , i received my driver s license , held three jobs , and graduated from college with a bachelor s degree . my mental health has gotten significantly better and i entered a great relationship , where my partner is fully supportive of me and understands my mental health . i also let go of old , toxic friendships and gained new friends in return .","297554":"no , i have no interest in modeling .","297555":"not that i m aware of . if someone hated me that much , they never made it known to me .","297556":"no , i don t believe so . i don t have any enemies , as far as i m aware .","297557":"yes , it s common knowledge that photographers and models photoshop their pictures to give a flawless appearance .","297558":"i ve never been in an ab sive relationship before , but i do know that it is extremely difficult for people to escape from those kinds of relationships . you never know that a person is ab sive from the beginning , and it develops over time without you even realizing that it s becoming ab sive until it s too late . in such cases , it s hard for people to leave those relationships because they fear for their lives , that their partner will retaliate against them for leaving and hurt them . that s why there are shelters for domestic ab se survivors , it gives them a safe place to live while they re trying to leave a relationship .","297559":"lol . yes , it often confuses me when my coworkers or supervisor exclaim how hard of a worker i am , when really i don t believe the work i do is very in depth or hard at all . i suppose i ve just always been naturally good at time management , so it appears that i work really hard when the material actually comes very easily to me .","297560":"i prefer shopping online . i don t like going into stores and dealing with people in the stores . i usually find better things online than in stores anyway , and they re normally cheaper with better coupons .","297561":"to the anon who was asking about sh and intrusive thoughts sorry , askfm deleted my answer because of the content of the post . however , to reiterate , yes i do experience thoughts of h rting myself and sometimes others , and i get intrusive thoughts frequently . sometimes they re stronger at night , but it mostly happens whenever i get into a depressive or dangerous mindset where i m feeling destructive or s icidal .","297562":"i would ask my parents why they thought they raised me well , when my memories indicate that they did nothing but emotionally physically ab se me during the early years of my life . to this day , whenever i express some sort of negative emotion or feeling of depression or anxiety , my mother claims i raised you so well , i don t know why you came out this way , which has always been incredibly invalidating .","297563":"it ultimately depends on the culture the woman gets married into , whether or not that culture is tolerant of women having freedoms , as well as the relationship as a whole . in addition , it also depends on the woman s willingness to immerse herself in that particular culture , because some people are more adaptable than others . depending on the couple s relationship , it could negatively affect their children s lives , but i think that has more to do with parenting styles as opposed to cultural norms . there generally isn t a bad connotation to being raised in various cultures unless that culture is inherently oppressive . one of my cousins married an indian man a few years ago , and they often travel to india to spend time with his family . it simply works for them .","297564":"yeah , absolutely . martial arts is a great way to teach children self defense and give them a sense of companionship and discipline .","297565":"i would be happy to have experienced all of the friendships i ve developed over the years , as well as my relationship with my boyfriend . i truly value all of their significance in my life my friends and boyfriend have been my greatest support system and i m so grateful for their presence .","297566":"i m excited to see how game of thrones will conclude , considering i ve been an avid fan for the past few years ! ! i m really enjoying the new season so far , even though there hasn t been too much action . it s just been so interesting seeing all of the characters reunited once again . i m also interested in seeing extremely wicked , shockingly evil and vile the movie about ted bundy that will be on netflix next week .","297567":"what do you think about something that once existed for decades but doesn t exist anymore . in all seriousness , i don t have an opinion . i don t know much about the ussr or its historical or political contexts at all . perhaps if you asked me think while i was taking history classes in high school and college , i would have a more informed opinion .","297568":"i don t have an opinion . i know nothing about his policies or tenure in office .","297569":"i can t believe i hit over followers in two years on this website , jeez . ya ll buggin .","297570":"if they have , then they didn t bring it to my attention .","297571":"it s only pm , so i didn t eat dinner yet . i m probably going to have leftover steak , green beans , and mashed potatoes from earlier in the week , though .","297572":"i think it s terrible when people purposely post spoilers online for others to read ! ! especially with big franchises like the marvel films that a lot of people love and become emotionally invested in . it s common sense to keep the spoilers to yourself until you know that a particular person has seen the movie show etc etc . , and then it s acceptable to talk about it to that person .","297573":"i don t see an issue with people watching movies or shows through pirating websites . my perspective is that those movies shows already make more than enough money through regular avenues , and it wouldn t make a difference if a small percentage of people pirated their content instead of contributing money towards the content in the first place . they re big corporations productions . there s also the dilemma of what you just described , people having certain medical illnesses that prevent from them going out and seeing movies in the theater and whatnot . it s just easier for them to enjoy the movie in the way most comfortable to them .","297574":"he told me , which was a small component in why i forgave him . he was eaten up by guilt and couldn t hide it from me , so he ended up telling me one night soon after it happened .","297575":"it depends on the context of the cheating , how long i ve been in a relationship with that person and the current vibe of that relationship , and how i feel towards my partner in general . i wouldn t say that i would never forgive a partner for cheating , because i did forgive my boyfriend for cheating on me much earlier in our relationship , but i believe that if he cheated on me now then we would have serious problems in our relationship . especially if it was more than just a one time event .","297576":"mumble rap , lol . or most soundcloud rappers in general , i should say . the only musician who falls under that category that i do like is lil peep , i believe .","297577":"nope , i have no idea how to do cpr , much less be certified in it .","297578":"i believe the longest movies i ve watched were the lord of the rings films ! ! i absolutely love them , though , even though each movie is over hours long .","297579":"normally , i have no problems falling asleep at night , unless i ve had a lot of caffeine that day . if i find that i can t fall asleep , though , i usually lay in bed and check my phone until i feel my eyes start to drift , and then i ll roll over and close my eyes and try to focus on relaxing my body enough to fall asleep . there are certain instances where i feel wide awake , at which point i ll get up to have a cigarette , perhaps make a cup of tea or water , and listen to relaxing music .","297580":"if i wanted to say who it was , then i would have said their name in my previous answer . lol .","297581":"yes , i had a huge crush on my best friend when we were years old . we actually ended up dating for a few months when we were that young because she felt the same way towards me for a while .","297582":"it doesn t feel like the flu , although i do have a slight fever . normally when i have the flu , i m vomiting profusely and that isn t happening right now . i feel feverish , my body is sore , i m incredibly congested , i keep sneezing and coughing , and i have a constant headache at the front of my skull . if this persists until next week , then i ll definitely see a doctor because i might need some sort of medication . i m not going to waste money on a co pay if it isn t that serious and all they ll tell me is to rest and drink liquids , though .","297583":"oh , lol . sorry , i didn t realize that was what you meant . i don t ask for them to pay me for watching their dogs , no . i ve been best friends with her since we were both years old , and it s the least i can do for them . it s also beneficial for me because it means i can stay at their house and enjoy the peace and quiet for a change .","297584":"i think my parents passed their sickness down onto me , lol . my father got sick first , and then my mother came down with the same thing last week . i m exhibiting symptoms that mimic their symptoms when they first got sick , so i m probably going to be feeling this way for the next week or so .","297585":"yeah , i get paid extra for the freelance work that i do , on top of my regular paycheck .","297586":"i don t go out in public with my parents , so i haven t been put in a position to be embarrassed since i was a teenager . i can t remember if they ever embarrassed me in public that long ago .","297587":"i believe it depends on what message you re trying to convey . when you miss hanging out with someone , it gives off a different connotation than when you miss who an individual is as a person . also , when you say i miss you , it gives off the impression that you have deep feelings for someone unless you already have a close relationship with that person , then it s no big deal . if all you feel is that you miss seeing someone , then perhaps saying i miss hanging out with you is more precise and to the point .","297588":"initially , i was supposed to dog sit my best friend s three dogs this weekend because she and her family were going away for greek easter they re greek orthodox , but now i just came down with an illness , so i don t think i ll be doing that anymore . now that i m sick , i m going to spend the weekend sleeping , eating a lot of soup , and possibly work on some freelance assignments for work since i missed half of the work day today .","297589":"i absolutely love thunderstorms they re incredibly relaxing and peaceful to me .","297590":"yes , there is one person in particular whom i hate .","297591":"i don t have an answer to this question . although it probably has to do with the same reason why you re also asking this anonymously as well .","297592":"yes , i struggle with mental health conditions on nearly a daily basis . i m diagnosed with major depressive disorder , generalized anxiety disorder , panic disorder , and borderline personality disorder . when i m feeling down , i ultimately have to wait until the episode passes because nothing can really make me feel better otherwise . i have really unhealthy coping mechanisms at the moment , but i also do try to talk out my feelings with trusted friends , which can aid the situation temporarily .","297593":"yes , i agree with you . entry level jobs usually require a bachelor s degree or more of experience , although it depends entirely on job to job . i wouldn t have had the experiences i have with jobs had i not acquired a bachelor s degree first .","297594":"the nightmare before christmas , i suppose ! ! i don t know of any typical halloween movies besides that one a few other ones . although i prefer marilyn manson s cover of this is halloween over danny elfman s version .","297595":"i prefer sunrises , but i rarely get to see them . i find the colors to be so beautiful , but at the same time , i m never awake early enough to see the sun rise .","297596":"yes ! ! i watched it the other day . i thought it was a good episode tbh . my coworkers seem to think it was boring , but i really enjoyed the interactions between various characters who haven t seen each other in literally years . and , of course , the knighting of brienne was absolutely amazing . i teared up knowing how happy she was in that moment .","297597":"the best thing to happen to me is probably meeting my boyfriend tbh . he s changed my life for the better , and i have him to credit for helping me realize my true potential and working towards the best version of myself .","297598":"my favorite flowers are yellow roses my favorite trees are birch trees .","297599":"no , not while i ve been alive at least .","297600":"my day was fine it wasn t too great , but it wasn t terrible either . i wasn t as productive as i anticipated because i was tired , but sometimes you need more relaxed days to help get you through the rougher ones . i m seeing a friend tonight whom i haven t seen in a while , so it should be nice to catch up .","297601":"definitely not , haha . i only like moderately spicy things , so i ve never been a big fan of hot sauce in general . also , if it isn t going toward some charitable cause or raising money for something , then i m definitely not doing it .","297602":"not really , no . most people knew who i was , but that was because i was an artistic kid . it didn t make me popular among the crowd , it just made my name stick out to most others .","297603":"no , i ve never broken a bone before .","297604":"what makes you think i didn t ? ? just because you tell someone about ab se doesn t mean that they ll believe you . no one believed me for years except my best friend when i was a teenager , because she ended up witnessing it first hand one day .","297605":"absolutely not . verbally physically ab sing someone is not the correct way to parent a child .","297606":"i didn t have any easter eggs , and i also didn t buy any chocolate for easter . i don t generally celebrate easter with my family , although we did have a small family dinner on sunday .","297607":"if you re trying to get me to talk about my undergarments , it s not going to happen . you can scurry along now .","297608":"no , i ve never been arrested before thankfully . i ve done a lot of stupid sh t that could have gotten me arrested , though .","297609":"a tank top and jeans .","297610":"i used to know how to speak rudimentary french , but i ve since forgotten the language because it s been about years since i ve practiced . however , the best way to learn a language is to study it extensively try to practice it whenever possible in conversations , on the internet , even reading in the different language is helpful too .","297611":"yes ! ! i consider misphire to be a good friend of mine , and we live in different countries . we keep in contact through social media , specifically facebook instagram .","297612":"i can t play any instruments currently , no . i used to play the guitar , keyboard , and ukulele when i was a teenager , but i ve long forgotten how to play or even read music .","297613":"i m actually in a fairly decent mood rn . i was extremely productive at work today and managed to finish everything that was on my personal agenda , which was fantastic . i m a bit nervous , however , because my supervisor said i have to train someone tomorrow , and i always feel anxious when put in positions like that . other than that , i m good . i m currently drinking iced coffee and waiting for my phone to charge before i go over my boyfriend s house for the night .","297614":"winona ryder ! !","297615":"i used to use forks to eat sushi , and it was horrible . you end up stabbing the sushi and the entire thing falls apart . would not recommend .","297616":"i just got home from work after a minute long commute ! ! i m tired , but i m excited because my boyfriend said that he s up for having a campfire in the backyard tonight . when he s done doing yardwork , i m going to buy some firewood and head over to his house . as for a picture , this speaks to me on an emotional level","297617":"yeah , i can use chopsticks . it s the only way i ll eat sushi .","297618":"i only eat when i m hungry , but it is somewhat on a timely schedule because my body has been so accustomed to eating at certain times . i normally have breakfast between am , lunch between pm , and dinner between pm .","297619":"lately it s been navy blue , but i also like dark red , purple , forest green , and black .","297620":"yeah , i have a patch of non pigmented skin on my chest . it s been there since i was a child .","297621":"i d like to believe that i m very open minded , yes . i always try to view things from different perspectives to gain a wider understanding of a topic or person .","297622":"i dislike when the media narrates a story to insinuate that a person is was dangerous because of their mental illness , not because of their pre existing traits which determined their violent behavior . it s statistically more common for those with mental illness to be victims of violent crimes , not the perpetrator themselves . however , there s still a lot of stigma that exists in news stories regarding violent criminals if they happen to have an existing mental health problem they blame it entirely on the illness and give off the impression that everyone with that illness is dangerous when that s simply not true .","297623":"no , i don t have any games on my phone . i used to play candy crush and bejeweled , but it took up too much room on my phone and drained my battery .","297624":"last night . i went out with my friend and had a margarita .","297625":"i don t like pulling pranks on people , nor do i enjoy when pranks are pulled on me . i find most of them to be extremely childish and immature .","297626":"music brings people together ! ! i ve always been an advocate for musical expression because music is a big passion of mine . it not only serves as a coping mechanism , but it also brings people together in harmony .","297627":"taking the anonymous feature away wouldn t bother or affect me at all because i don t send things to people anonymously . regardless , i m sure those who want to stay anonymous would just make blank accounts to send things to people instead of just remaining anonymous . it s easy to make an account and not fill anything in besides the username while still hiding your identity .","297628":"no , i wouldn t take that option . i would be far too anxious and paranoid for the rest of my days , because all i would think about would be that date .","297629":"plot twist i ve never seen a single star wars movie .","297630":"yes , i m an extremely fast typer . which is unsurprising , considering i ve been using the computer since i was a child .","297631":"hello do you have a question ? ?","297632":"it s more concerning that y all are suddenly fixated on a stranger s genitalia , but go off i guess .","297633":"i don t give money to homeless people , on the rare chances that i do run into a homeless person . usually they re looking for cash , and i don t carry cash on me .","297634":"every body is a beach body you don t have to look a certain way in order to truly enjoy having a beach outing with friends or family . nevertheless , i do want to lose weight before i go on the cruise next year , lol . i would feel a lot more comfortable with myself .","297635":"just fyi , this is a pretty insensitive question to ask someone especially if you just happen to be talking to a person with an eating disorder or disordered eating habits . to answer your question , the longest i ve gone without eating has been a few days . i don t remember how many days exactly because it was years ago , but i did have a period of time in my life where i did purposely restrict .","297636":"yeah , i shoplifted in the past when i was a teenager .","297637":"i don t generally have a firm control over my anger , especially within the past few months . my impulse control has been so poor lately that every time i feel a rush of a strong emotion , i have no idea how to handle it . normally i resort to chain smoking or drinking alcohol , but i ve been trying hard to resist those urges .","297638":"it s been a while since i even had an opportunity to make friends with someone . i don t know if i would consider my coworkers to be my friends , since they re my coworkers first and foremost . minus work relationships , the last time i actually went out of my way to try to make friends was when i was still attending college .","297639":"i didn t before getting this question , but now i m aware of who she is .","297640":"i had a turkey sandwich for lunch around pm five hours ago . but right now i m drinking iced coffee .","297641":"lol . i mean , i know my boyfriend is attractive , so it doesn t bother me if i notice people checking him out if we re in public together . but if my friend did it blatantly with me standing right there , i d be like . . . bruh . . . ? !","297642":"uh , it s tuesday . but my crush will always be winona ryder .","297643":"i probably wouldn t get anywhere close to the same amount of questions because a large majority of my questions are from anons .","297644":"i only saw the first avengers movie , and it was good but i wasn t obsessed with it or anything , lol . i haven t seen any of the subsequent films .","297645":"no , i ve only been to a spa once a few years ago and i didn t like it .","297646":"no , i have no interest in seeing that movie .","297647":"i conserve energy by recycling , not running the water all the time , and using the water dispenser on my fridge instead of buying bottles of water . other methods by which to help the planet is by reducing meat intake and using public transportation .","297648":"i stood up for my friend a few months ago when we went out to the bar . some guy was trying to talk to her he was being a real creep about it , so i told him that neither of us were interested in a conversation with him and he would be better off leaving us alone . needless to say , he walked away . lmao .","297649":"i believe people should practice compassion for others more often . everyone is going through some struggle or hardship , and it s easy to forget that people have their own lives apart from what we see on social media or in real life . it s often the case that people who are struggling don t portray those feelings to others , and it would be helpful if we re all more compassionate and understanding towards others on a regular basis .","297650":"cont i feel he won t leave her though and it s been getting to me . i also found out he s slept with two other girls at the job which has been bothering me . do i tell him how i feel ? ? can i change him ? ? i just feel there is a reason why he cheats on her and he isn t happy . help ? if he s cheated on his girlfriend with not only you , but also two other people , then i m sorry to break this to you but you re likely not much different than those other women in his eyes . if he was truly unhappy with his girlfriend , he would break up with her the fact that he stays with her and continues to cheat just means that he s taking advantage of her naivety and doing what he can to get laid . you may have feelings for him , but you have to learn to set those feelings aside . he s not going to change for you if he hasn t taken the steps toward breaking up with his girlfriend or changing his behavior . this sounds like patterned behavior to him , and he s probably going to do the same exact thing to other women until he matures .","297651":"no , i m not a high maintenance person at all . i m normally pretty down to earth and i deal with things as they happen .","297652":"success is being happy with the goals you have set and accomplished for yourself . these goals don t necessarily have to be professional goals , either they can be personal goals .","297653":"for the most part , yes . occasionally , i ll splurge on something i really want , but it isn t very often .","297654":"why don t you actually study for the tests , and then you won t feel compelled to cheat .","297655":"it depends on the kind of struggle that i m having . there are some things that are easy to discuss , but others are harder , especially if it deals with svicidal ideation .","297656":"i m going to therapy to discuss it .","297657":"not really , but give me a few days and i ll be fine .","297658":"i don t know anything about them at all , so i don t have an opinion .","297659":"i already answered this question minutes ago .","297660":"it s a naturally occurring hormone in the human body . what opinion am i supposed to have ? ? rofl .","297661":"my favorite disney movies are atlantis the lost empire and treasure planet . my favorite disney song is how far i ll go from moana .","297662":"no , the earth is definitely not flat , lmao . i don t know anyone who believes that either .","297663":"i absolutely hate when people make sound effects when they re eating to indicate that something is good . i know someone who constantly smacks their lips when they re tasting something and comments on the food while it s still in their mouth , and it s so disgusting .","297664":"my day was fine . i m still not feeling well , and all i want to do is sleep . i don t even want to go to therapy anymore . it s taking everything in me not to text my therapist and tell her i can t make it .","297665":"depending on how bright the lamp is , it could disrupt your sleep patterns .","297666":"no , i don t like coldplay .","297667":"no , i don t . my days vary for the most part depending on what i have to work on , and i don t keep a planner or checklist with a list of my goals because i just have them inside my mind .","297668":"yeah , although i only order maybe two or three things from there . i prefer dunkin lately .","297669":"i have quite a bit of patience , which i ve learned through dealing with insufferable people throughout most of my adult life .","297670":"no , i don t have any plans for the summer . my summer schedule isn t much different from the rest of the year .","297671":"yes , global warming is very real and very serious . the climate has been changing rapidly for a few years now .","297672":"lol , no . i ve been in a monogamous relationship throughout my entire work history .","297673":"yeah , i found a few coworkers to be good looking in the past .","297674":"no , not generally . there are only a select few people who annoy me , everything else just rolls off my back .","297675":"unstable , as of the moment . my mood swings were all over the place yesterday and now i m exhausted .","297676":"a life sized cardboard cutout of ron burgundy from anchorman .","297677":"you must be years old if you genuinely believe this stereotype .","297678":"yeah , but it s a private anonymous blog . i don t give my username away to people unless you re a friend of mine .","297679":"thank you , friend . i appreciate it","297680":"i m all right . i m not feeling the greatest right now and i wish i had something to distract me .","297681":"i never heard his music before .","297682":"when i exercise , i mainly do cardio . although strength training would be helpful too , and i did a lot of strength training when i went to the gym last year .","297683":"sounds good in theory .","297684":"considering i never watched wrestling , it isn t too surprising .","297685":"lol . yes , i have heard of john cena before . i m assuming these are all wrestlers , so you can save your breath because he s the only one i know .","297686":"i don t know anyone who goes by that name , no .","297687":"no , i don t look forward to monday mornings at all . i go back to work on monday , so it isn t something i m overly enthusiastic about .","297688":"obviously not if i m questioning who he is .","297689":"it s been about a year or so . i believe i visited the cemetery last spring with my boyfriend .","297690":"yes , i know a few people who are like that . it s become useless for me to try to talk to them about their health and feelings at this point , because they re not going to admit that they need to make changes in their lives .","297691":"the only routines i have are waking up early to go to work in the morning and taking my medication , lol . i usually wake up at am every morning . however , generally i m good at routines . it s helpful for my mental health to have a routine every day .","297692":"i just recreated a few small playlists on spotify , so y all should follow me there https open . spotify . com user bhvvxlhqu qghxb fdiv ofuw ? si qmrekcqctgipffnjxzkzkg","297693":"am i supposed to know what that is ? ? lmao .","297694":"i never even knew that existed for television shows ! ! that sounds super interesting i ll have to check bandersnatch out . when i was a child , i read a lot of the interactive goosebumps books , where you could pick and choose which choices you want to make it would change the outcome of the story . i always loved them .","297695":"wasteland , baby ! by hozier and that day that we watch the death of the sun , that the cloud and the cold and those jeans you have on , and you gaze unafraid as they sob from the city ruins . . . https www . youtube . com watch ? v n rkn qw du","297696":"this is actually really difficult for me , considering my taste in music is so diverse and eclectic . however , if i had to narrow it down to five musicians to summarize my taste , it would be korn grandson city and colour watsky hozier","297697":"i m a full blooded scorpio even though i don t believe much in astrology , i am a scorpio . music is my passion and a large part of my life . you can always find me listening to music , regardless of the time of day . lately i ve been listening to hozier , matt maeson , grandson , and two feet . i have seven tattoos all over my body , and i currently have plans for at least two more . i also used to have my nose and labret pierced . i have a bachelor s degree in communications professional writing with a minor in english literature . i graduated magna cum laude . i m greatly interested in true crime , i . e . serial killers , spur killings , acts of passion , etc etc . i follow a lot of true crime blogs and accounts of crime scene photography , and i ve seen practically every true crime documentary docu series on netflix .","297698":"lol . that s literally amazing .","297699":"lol , exactly . also your typo just made my morning . whatever floats your goat , oh my god i m dying . lmao .","297700":"lol . that works too ! ! i can see how the fidget spinner definitely helps with anxious habits then . i ve never used a spinner , only the cube , and the cube has definitely helped me a lot . i used it a lot during my last job when i was stressed .","297701":"i m not afraid to try new things , but sometimes breaking free from my daily routine gives me anxiety . at the same time , however , most of the plans i do make with friends are rather spontaneous , and that becomes part of my routine in itself . the last time i tried something new was last sunday my boyfriend and i tried a new restaurant which was about minutes away from his house , and it had really delicious food and drinks ! ! i would definitely go back .","297702":"my routines are fairly predictable , since i do the same typical things every day . however , i believe that certain parts of myself are fairly unpredictable , especially when it comes to my feelings and mood swings .","297703":"january , so three months ago . i wrote my boyfriend a letter in a greeting card to express to him how much i loved him and valued his existence in my life .","297704":"yes , i am hopelessly addicted to coffee well , technically caffeine . i have at least cups of coffee every day .","297705":"i don t think the fidget spinner is supposed to help with anxiety , but the fidget cube was actually designed for people with anxious traits and habits . focusing on the cube and all of its nodules and whatnot helps you to think and focus on the task at hand , and it also prevents people from engaging in body focused anxious habits , i . e . skin picking .","297706":"i would much rather live in an eternal winter . i don t like the summertime because it s normally extremely hot , humid , and busy . although i dislike driving in the snow during the winter , i do genuinely enjoy the chilly weather .","297707":"i don t watch anime , so nothing .","297708":"no , i don t read any webcomics at all . i don t know if you would consider this to be a webcomic , but i do like sarah scribbles one shot comics that she posts online every few days ! ! as well as catana comics and jude devir .","297709":"my interest in true crime , most likely . i watch documentaries and television shows on true crime almost constantly , i follow true crime blogs , and i also like looking at crime scene photography .","297710":"aahh , i m glad you asked ! ! some of my favorites are forensic files ! ! ! women behind bars the staircase the keepers the disappearance of madeleine mccann the innocent man evil genius i am a killer","297711":"i watched my boyfriend go through drug withdrawals first hand , which was terrifying . he wanted to recover from drug addiction , so he quit cold turkey and dealt with the after effects of withdrawal for about a week or so .","297712":"unfortunately , no . snapchat has definitely improved on their facial recognition , though , because it certainly does look real .","297713":"yeah , i prefer that over the narrators simply telling the story . i like having the visual representation of the crime .","297714":"how understanding and supportive he is when i m exhibiting symptoms of my mental illnesses . he s never made me feel misunderstood or invalidated when i m having a difficult time , and if there is something he doesn t really understand , he asks me to know more information instead of blindly judging .","297715":"i ve been emotionally attached to linkin park chester bennington since i was years old .","297716":"depends on who they are , lol . if it s someone i know , then i ll just leave it alone until they give it back to me . if it s a total stranger , i don t know what i would do since that s not something that would happen to me .","297717":"yeah , i believe in spirits and ghosts .","297718":"thank you","297719":"ask me questions , y all","297720":"yes , i have both a fidget spinner and a fidget cube . it helps with my anxiety sometimes , especially at work .","297721":"yes , i ve been discriminated against due to both my sexual orientation and my gender . people don t seem to like being confronted with things that don t make them personally comfortable , so my existence has nevertheless made people angry .","297722":"lol . i m not too well versed in the whole cancelled culture , but regardless , if someone makes a homophobic remark , then they should be educated on why they re wrong and being discriminatory . if they refuse to acknowledge their mistake , then there unfortunately isn t much else you can do for them besides refuse to associate with them and cut them out of your life .","297723":"homophobia is disgusting , and if someone actually embraces their homophobic beliefs and willingly disregards and discriminates against people in the lgbtq community , then i have absolutely no desire to put up with that nonsense .","297724":"i literally just answered this same exact question minutes ago .","297725":"i m doing all right . today has been a rather unproductive day i woke up super late at am , only wrote four freelance assignments usually i write six , and basically spent the entire day on my laptop while drinking coffee . i took a thicc nap before , as well . now i m just waiting for my boyfriend to get out of work to see if he s up to hanging out tonight , and if not , then i ll probably just go to bed early .","297726":"no , i m not single .","297727":"what s your opinion on something that some people prefer when finding a partner that has no effect on your life whatsoever .","297728":"i don t think i would necessarily enjoy living in a time period other than the one we re living in now , especially considering how destitute the middle class was in previous eras and how women were silenced . however , i always found the victorian era and the french revolution to be interesting periods of time . it would be remarkable to witness the events that happened during those years .","297729":"when i play video games , i normally restrict my playing to one save file that i invest all of my energy into , and if i do something wrong , then i go back into the last save and restart the mission . i don t accept anything less than perfection in my gaming , which makes it arduous for me to complete a game . if my life was akin to a video game , then i would likely still only have one save file , but a lot of rewrites involved . if i made a hazardous mistake , i would immediately go back in time to fix it , even down to the little things like if i said something wrong in a conversation . my achievements would be small victories related to mental health , i . e . got out of bed ! , took a shower and brushed your teeth ! , drove to work without having an anxiety attack ! etc etc . i ve always loved getting achievements on xbox , so i would probably find a lot of little ones everywhere that were worth points , lmao .","297730":"quite often , actually . it normally happens when i m under immense stress and my mind is racing with everything i m trying to accomplish or take control .","297731":"one of the facets of borderline personality disorder that i deal with has to do with identity disturbance meaning an unclear sense of identity or void of a sense of self . it s something i ve dealt with for my entire life , from what i remember , but i never knew there was an actual word for it until i was diagnosed a few years ago . my interests change frequently and are often the reflection of the interests of whoever i m attached to at that current moment . if someone i m attached to is into photography , then i pick up the hobby . if they re enthusiastic about going out and drinking , then i go out and drink with them . i have a few hobbies that i found i genuinely enjoyed , such as writing and video games , but even then , they re primarily influenced by someone else . my early childhood undoubtedly had a huge factor in why i developed bpd . studies have shown that bpd arises out of a combination of environmental and genetic factors , and because of my past history of trauma , it s suspected that my environment caused my development of bpd . my episodes are still in existence , despite being in routine treatment , because i m still in the environment where i was raised . i don t believe i ll be able to recover until i m out of my parents house , because at that point i can start my own life on my own terms .","297732":"if i m feeling a particular craving that day , then i ll suggest that restaurant and see how my boyfriend or friend feels about it . there s a handful of regular places we frequent , and it s mostly because they re local to us and had good reviews . whenever my boyfriend and i go out to eat , we ll either go to a diner or a steakhouse . my friends normally prefer mexican food places .","297733":"there s a client that i dealt with once a few months ago who got struck by lightning and believed that he got a power from god as a result , which is a bit far fetched in my opinion . i also dealt with ridiculous customers on a daily basis when i worked in retail , as well . there were so many people who would get so hot headed and irrational if you told them that you couldn t fulfill their wishes , whether that was using a coupon , getting a sales price , etc etc . they would get angry if their coupon was expired or if they were looking at the wrong sales tag , and they blamed it on the workers instead of themselves .","297734":"i m nicer than him in general , but it all depends on our separate moods that particular moment . he has no problem saying exactly what he thinks with no filter whatsoever , and it doesn t matter who s talking to him he ll tell them to go f ck themselves , even if it s his boss or a customer , if the situation warrants it .","297735":"you meant hypothetically , lol . i don t believe i would date someone who has a child , no . i m not at a stage in my life where i would feel comfortable being responsible , even partially , for a child . i don t know if i even want children in the future to begin with .","297736":"it depends on my mood , but i would only allow him one small sip if anything . but that s assuming he would actually ask me , because like i stated in my previous answer , he knows better than to ask for a sip of my coffee .","297737":"he knows not to touch my coffee , so he s never asked . lmao . i don t care if you think it s greedy . coffee is sacred to me .","297738":"i have absolutely zero talents , so no .","297739":"i suppose i would be a wolf , because i ve always felt a close connection to wolves from a young age . i even have a wolf tattooed on my body .","297740":"coffee , lol . if i have a cup of coffee in front of me , i will fight you tooth and nail if you want a small portion of it . i don t care if i have a large cup this coffee is mine , and if you want coffee too , then make yourself your own cup . i m never sharing .","297741":"no , i never learned how to ride a bicycle .","297742":"i have very pin straight hair , unfortunately . i wish it was wavier or curlier , but even when it was very short , it was still straight .","297743":"no , i don t bother painting my toenails . further questions regarding toes and feet will be deleted .","297744":"i m a very heavy sleeper . almost nothing can wake me up except for my alarm clock in the morning , and sometimes that doesn t work either .","297745":"you re not standing for the lives of innocent children you re clearly unhappy with how littlesha conducts her life and will do everything in your power to prevent her from doing what she wants to do . you couldn t care less about the children . pro tip nothing you say , to anyone , is going to change the fact that morgan is going to do what she wants . you can vent and complain and whine to your heart s content , but it isn t going to change a thing . you re wasting your breath .","297746":"i don t know much information about anonymous donors to have a really informed opinion however , my concern with anonymity is that you don t know the donor s medical history , and therefore , you don t know what potential the child has of developing certain illnesses , whether that occurs in their childhood or adulthood . if a donor has family history of diabetes or heart disease , then that s something i would want to know about so that i can take the proper precautions early on in that child s life to prevent them from developing heart disease and diabetes . it s also useful to know if alcoholism runs in the donor s family , if there s a history of mental illness , etc etc . i would want what s best for my child and that includes full awareness of the medical dilemmas that may occur as they get older .","297747":"technically i have both saturday and sunday off from my regular office job , but i do pick up freelance assignments that i complete on the weekends too . i don t have any plans for tomorrow , even though it s easter sunday . i might have dinner with my family it s currently planned , but who knows what will happen between today tomorrow . otherwise , it s just a normal sunday to me .","297748":"probably about a week or so during one of my severe depressive episodes . it was hard enough to even get out of bed and use the bathroom , let alone take a shower and wash my hair .","297749":"thoroughbred refers to a pure blooded horse .","297750":"uh , no ? ? lmao . i would be fired if i fell asleep at work .","297751":"i agree there s absolutely no reason to be so emotionally invested in another person s life like this unless you hold some deep , intimate feelings towards them , whether that s a love for them or such a hatred towards yourself that you release that frustration on others .","297752":"it depends entirely on the company . it isn t a new york based thing at all , it just varies wildly depending on the company you work for .","297753":"i don t believe you qualify for routine raises at my job unless you ve been there for a certain number of years . i just got my first raise a few weeks ago i ve been there for . years , and i m also scheduled for another employment review in an additional three months . i don t know what a normal raise consists of , considering i assume it s different depending on that particular person s aptitude and salary . i don t discuss finances with my coworkers , though .","297754":"i guess teenagers who babysit for extra cash shouldn t be allowed to do so either , considering they also don t have professionals degrees or experience in childhood courses . in all seriousness , though your obsession with morgan is a bit concerning . you come into my inbox every once in a while when morgan puts you in your rightful place , complaining about something occurring in her life that doesn t please you . perhaps instead of worrying about what someone else does with their life , you should focus more on improving your own life instead .","297755":"i don t normally ask for the price of things because prices are normally always listed wherever i go . i do try to order inexpensive food items , though , unless i want a particular food item a lot . i don t really know if it s a new yorker thing to do , lmao . i don t pay much attention to stereotypes like that .","297756":"it isn t something that has ever crossed my mind . nearly everyone i know says halal food around here . i don t care enough to determine whether or not it s linguistically correct .","297757":"i prefer gritty action films over horror films . i ve noticed that as i ve gotten older , horror movie scare me more more , and it interrupts my sleeping patterns because i get far too paranoid .","297758":"i ve only ever ordered street food in new york city on a few occasions , and it was pretty good . i normally would just grab a hot dog or some halal food .","297759":"i didn t have to pay for tuition while i was attending college you only begin paying back on your student loans after a year of graduating so i began paying my loans in . the only things i had to pay for during college were my textbooks , and i paid for those myself because i was working a part time and sometimes full time job .","297760":"i took out loans from the bank . i ll probably be paying them off until my s , lmao .","297761":"in my opinion , the most rewarding experience of my life has been having the opportunity to attend college . my freshman year , i dormed in a liberal arts college in massachusetts , and then for the remaining . years , i commuted to a local university near my home . both schools gave me tons of experience and education , and i value the knowledge i received during my time in school .","297762":"for any of my followers who are looking for some encouragement .","297763":"this is a great initiative , but you re also anonymous .","297764":"i don t eat candy or chocolate . sometimes i ll have one bite of chocolate if someone offers it to me , but otherwise i don t generally eat it . even small amounts of candy or chocolate give me a stomach ache .","297765":"yes , i work better when i m faced with a deadline actually . i ve spent the majority of my life in situations where i was forced to work under immense pressure and had no option but to give optimal results . it s something i eventually got used to as i got older .","297766":"i consider myself to be somewhat intelligent , but i m not mechanically minded enough to invent something on my own . my intelligence is mainly in the form of analytical thinking and understanding complex ideas , not so much constructing something . my boyfriend , on the other hand , is extremely mechanically inclined . he s intelligent in his own right and can construct things from blueprints to reality with ease . it s something i ve always admired .","297767":"underestimate myself . i used to underestimate myself in the past because i had little to no faith in my own potential , but as i ve gotten older , i ve come to realize how strong i truly am and how motivated i can be to accomplish my own goals .","297768":"i used to wholeheartedly believe in reincarnation when i was younger like a teenager , but now i m not so sure that i believe in it anymore . it s an interesting perspective and it would give me further hope for traversing life in itself , but it doesn t seem realistic enough to me , and i don t have enough faith in religious spiritual things like that to hold that belief anymore .","297769":"probably sting frodo s sword from the lord of the rings trilogy . the lotr films are among my favorite movies , and i ve always had a great interest in swords and knives .","297770":"i would love to own a house somewhere in west virginia or north carolina , deep within the woods on the outskirts of a town . alternatively , my best friend recently moved to new hampshire and the surrounding area where she lives is absolutely beautiful , and she loves it there .","297771":"i don t feel desperation very often at all , so i m not entirely sure . the only thing i can think of would probably be feeling desperate to have a cigarette after a particularly stressful day .","297772":"i prefer cold weather over hot weather , if i had to choose between the two . i can t tolerate the heat and humidity .","297773":"i don t generally shop for new clothing during the change of seasons , although i did buy two tank tops a few weeks ago off of amazon . as for cleaning , i try to clean well every week so that isn t a seasonal thing for me either .","297774":"neither , i prefer it to be comfortable .","297775":"no , it wouldn t be possible for me to watch television while working because it would ruin my concentration . i m also pretty certain that i would get in trouble at work if they discovered i was watching a show while working , lol .","297776":"it would be harder for me to tell someone that i do not love them in return . i ve never had an issue expressing my feelings of love or gratitude toward my friends or partner , but it would be much more difficult for me to confide in someone that their feelings aren t reciprocated .","297777":"i judge people by their character how they treat others in social situations , how they view strangers , how they treat their friends and significant others , and how they work whether or not they have a hard work ethic .","297778":"i think it s usually valid to concern ourselves with things that normally cannot be explained . just because we cannot explain them doesn t mean it isn t worthwhile to discuss them and come to possible conclusions .","297779":"spirited away ! ! it s one of my favorite animated movies . when i think about that movie , the first scene that always comes to mind is the scene where the girls are feeding no face in the bath house , and he s absolutely gorging himself on food . it s one of the most iconic moments of that movie .","297780":"because of my job , it s impossible for me to give into writer s block because i write assignments for programs on a daily basis . i can t afford to have writer s block because the features need to be written one way or another , and i always try my best to give the client my best effort in making their feature interesting and concise . at the same time , though , i also haven t written anything creatively in a long time . all of my efforts go toward writing at work , so when i m home , i feel absolutely burnt out .","297781":"no , i don t post those sorts of pictures .","297782":"i like the satisfaction of finding the right words to use to portray the feeling i m trying to describe , especially when i weave those words into a sentence that sounds particularly strong or appealing . i ve thankfully always had a way with my words written down , at least , so it s cathartic for me to get things down on paper .","297783":"does beginning a new project at work count towards this ? ? haha . when i took on this program after the previous administrator left on maternity leave , it was something i didn t really know how to do , so i had to teach myself along the way . it was daunting at first but now it s been three weeks since i ve been running the program by myself , and i m finally comfortable doing it .","297784":"a cup of coffee from starbucks . my mother wanted a large iced latte , and the price for one of those is at least , which is ridiculous . especially considering it s mostly milk .","297785":"yes , i believe that self love can be difficult for some people . especially people who have been raised in environments where they were never taught how to love themselves . it s such a radical departure from the way we ve been raised , so it can be hard to navigate how exactly to love yourself and where to even begin .","297786":"probably any of the s xual questions that get sent to my inbox , which i wind up deleting . i don t generally entertain those anons anymore .","297787":"i use too face s born this way foundation concealer . it provides me with the best coverage , in my opinion , and it s also very light and doesn t feel as if i m wearing a lot of product on my skin .","297788":"billie eilish , matt maeson , hozier , grandson , ariana grande , watsky , grieves , colter wall , two feet , and rainbow kitten surprise .","297789":"i m active . you can also follow courrtana , shehitsback , and littlesha .","297790":"it doesn t bother me , but i do delete them immediately . i have no interest in checking out someone else s music project etc etc . however , i do think it can also deter people from checking out their content because they re doing it in such a forceful manner . if they posted it on their own page every now and again and promoted it to their own followers , they might have a better chance of their content being seen .","297791":"lol . like i said , i ll take your word for it .","297792":"graduating from college it was something i didn t think i would be able to do given my mental health issues and how i was also working basically full time while attending school . but regardless , i did graduate with latin honors , and that s something i m very proud of .","297793":"i ll take your word for it then . i don t answer the door for delivery people generally , so the chance is this happening is slim to none . but perhaps it did happen and i simply don t remember it .","297794":"that s literally never happened to me . lmfao .","297795":"i honestly don t remember . i don t get embarrassed easily .","297796":"i just woke up , so i m having a cigarette and i m going to make a cup of coffee soon .","297797":"yes , he did . or a regular suit i don t really remember .","297798":"a short , silver dress .","297799":"probably , i m sure it played at my prom .","297800":"yes , perhaps too many times . it used to play on the radio constantly .","297801":"i haven t played video games in a while tbh . there s nothing that i m excited for these days , unless i want to go back and try to grind more on destiny or restart fallout again . while i liked fallout , it didn t captivate my interest very much at all . i do like playing with friends though ! ! me and a few of my friends were playing ultimate chicken horse a few weeks ago , and i was just chatting with heartofstitches on his stream while he was playing jackbox .","297802":"yes and no . . . while i ve been feeling more stable with respect to my mood swings , i ve also been incredibly impulsive and reckless when it comes to my drinking habits , which i ve been trying hard to cut back on which isn t working well , considering i m drinking rn . i don t know there must be some psychological reason behind why i want to drink so often , but i don t really know why it is . it s something i ll have to discuss in therapy .","297803":"if i m being honest here , i m not entirely sure . lmao . i just got a promotion less than a month ago , so for now i m okay . however , i would like to be given more responsibility in the future and get another raise . perhaps administrating more programs other than the two i m in control of now , since they re both relatively slow at the moment .","297804":"i m up for anything . if i had a preference , i would like to answer more questions related to mental health , my relationship , my career education , my hobbies video games , writing , photography , and art , and perhaps some controversial opinions .","297805":"i first suspected that i had a mental illness when i was years old , because i had been struggling with depression for about a year at that point and figured that something was wrong with me . i developed svicidal thoughts early on , but i wasn t really aware at that time that what i was feeling wasn t healthy or normal . i was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety when i was years old , and i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder a year later at years old .","297806":"i m really digging the blue tbh . however , before this , i had purple hair with streaks of lighter lavender and magenta , which was really nice .","297807":"lol . as long as you take care of it from the very beginning , they should last a long time . and you can always touch it up if necessary too ! ! my boyfriend just got two tattoos with fine lines in them , so i ll see how they age over time .","297808":"ah , that s terrible . i would hope so too , but there s a lot of friction and homophobia within the gay community as well .","297809":"i have absolutely zero gang tattoos , considering i ve never been in a gang .","297810":"i think it s faded a little bit , but that s pretty much it . however , my oldest tattoo is on my back , so i can t really see it . lmao .","297811":"hello ! ! anyone have any questions ? ? i ll be awake for the next hour or two , so i ll answer nearly anything . xx","297812":"unfortunately , there isn t much you can do in such a situation . if someone doesn t understand that they re mentally ill or in need of help , then they won t accept any help or acknowledge that they have a problem to begin with . you can tell them to infinity that their behavior or feelings are abnormal , but if they insist that there s nothing wrong , there isn t much you can do to help them .","297813":"sorta , yeah . however , it s more along the lines of gay people discriminating against other gay people or exhibiting homophobic thoughts , even though they re gay themselves . i . e . , feminine gay men discriminating against masculine gay men because they don t fit the stereotype of being a gay man .","297814":"probably , but to be fair , i normally cry over things for no reason whatsoever so it isn t unusual for me .","297815":"no , i never have before . it makes me uncomfortable even getting blood drawn at the lab .","297816":"roller coasters actually are a major source of anxiety for me , lol . i was always afraid to go on them in fear that i would get hurt , and i was also uncomfortable with the adrenaline rush i would feel when i was on them because i felt too out of control of myself .","297817":"quit drinking alcohol , lose pounds , move into an apartment or house with my boyfriend , adopt animals , get promoted at my job again , and travel more often .","297818":"girl interrupted by susanna kaysen . it was the first book that introduced me to mental health and how it was acceptable to raise awareness of your own mental health and seek help when necessary . i didn t know much about my own mental state beforehand , i just knew that my feelings were severe and abnormal , but the book introduced me to new concepts and i was able to relate to the main character s feelings a lot .","297819":"i truly value my internal drive and motivation . regardless of what has happened to me , i ve always possessed a desire to do more and do better than how i previously was . i ve never allowed anything to strike me down for longer than it was necessary , and i ve always reinvented myself with each hardship to create a better version of myself .","297820":"i can be a control freak at times , but only when it concerns projects that i work on myself , where my name is attached to whatever the project is . i was terrible at group projects when i was in high school college because i always double checked everyone else s work to make sure it was up to par . i didn t want to risk my grade because someone else didn t do their part .","297821":"yeah , i believe so . my high school only had a certain amount to spend when it came to their budget , which was terrible , but the teachers i had did the best with what they were given . they even went the extra mile and utilized things from their own homes and pockets to make it a more immersive learning experience for us .","297822":"oh , hell yes . let us live eternally and feast on the blood of mortals .","297823":"definitely not . i can t even gain control over my own life , let alone an entire country . lmao .","297824":"educate the homophobic person , if possible . if they re still resistant to being educated about the lgbtq community , then the best thing you can do is simply ignore them .","297825":"i should definitely watch it some day . i heard amazing reviews on it , but i hardly ever watch movies to begin with .","297826":"no , i never saw it . i think it s on netflix , though .","297827":"i don t know about my coworkers , but i mostly arrive to work on time . i m only late perhaps twice a month at the most .","297828":"i don t normally do anything for easter , it isn t a holiday that my family celebrates . occasionally we ll have a family dinner , but it s rare .","297829":"the number haunts me , lmao .","297830":"alt . although you won t be able to listen to this station unless you live in the new york area .","297831":"my boyfriend is the ideal man . he s taller than me , has dark hair and a beard , has tattoos all over his torso , has high cheekbones and a penetrating gaze , and has dimples when he smiles .","297832":"it s always a long day without coffee . however , that rarely happens . even if i know i m going to be late for work , i stop for coffee anyway , lmao .","297833":"i think he s the perfect actor to play thor , lol . i ve only seen the movie thor and the avengers , but his role made me laugh .","297834":"i m doing well . i had a productive day at work wrote a lot of content for the program i m administrating , which made me feel better since we were a bit behind on content we were three months behind , but now we re only less than two months . i ran errands after work treated myself to an iced coffee , and now i m listening to studio ghibli piano music while going through my inbox .","297835":"no , but i do know someone who complains about everything they can t do , which is perhaps just as aggravating .","297836":"i don t remember most of my dreams , so i honestly don t know . sometimes i do remember dreaming about work , and the only reason why i remember them is because i sometimes confuse my dream work with my real life work , lmao .","297837":"my favorite movies are sweeney todd , i am not a serial killer , the crow , the number , girl interrupted , queen of the damned , american psycho , and the shining . my favorite songs currently are almost sweet music by hozier , apologize by grandson , beggar s song by matt maeson , sleeping on the blacktop by colter wall , bury a friend by billie eilish , and devil like me by rainbow kitten surprise .","297838":"he s simply not good looking , in my opinion . it doesn t really go much deeper than that . his looks aren t appealing to my taste , i prefer men with darker hair and features and are a bit older , like robert downey jr . and hugh jackman . i can t really think of anyone else who s attractive to me , besides johnny depp on certain occasions depending on how his hair is . i also find angelina jolie , natalie portman , and ruby rose to be attractive .","297839":"practice lots of self care and spend time looking after your own needs happiness . it s also helpful to spend time with friends , who will remind you that you re a separate individual away from a relationship and don t necessarily need to be involved with someone in order to be happy .","297840":"how would finding a celebrity make it personal ? ? lol . no , i just don t find him attractive .","297841":"he s conventionally attractive , but i don t look at him and go ooh , he s hot ! or anything , lol .","297842":"nourishment , shelter , clothing , oxygen , and companionship .","297843":"i suppose i would be considered an expert in grammar and creative professional writing , considering i have a bachelor s degree in the subjects . however , there are still things i don t know or remember , and i do have to look things up to remind myself every now and again .","297844":"no , i don t believe social media will die off at least not anytime soon . it s an excellent way to connect with other people from around the globe , share news on current affairs , and educate yourself and others about things . i think the only way social media will be on the decline would be if something else took its place .","297845":"no , my car doesn t have personalized or specialty plates . i m not interested in cars or anything , so it doesn t matter to me what my car looks like as long as it drives well , it doesn t make a difference .","297846":"i do watch game of thrones , and i hope either jon snow or daenerys targarean end up on the iron throne , especially considering jon is the rightful heir to the throne .","297847":"i don t mind doing the laundry or washing the dishes . i find both to be therapeutic , and i especially love the smell of clean laundry because of the products i use on them .","297848":"i ve only seen him in the hunger games movies , but i think he was a good actor in them . i don t remember much about his role , though .","297849":"i ve never tried it before , but it looks delicious ."}}
