But like he was my first crush and he was kind of stuck up a little bit kind of like what you're saying and it always sticks with you because that's your first person that you love. That you enjoy being around. That you just love. So of course you're going to miss them, always. It's probably not going to go away. But you do have to move forward and forget people. Especially if they were toxic. You don't need those kinds of people in your life at all. Just think that things happen for the right reason. If you got rid of a toxic person. Whether you think it wasn't the right thing, it was. I would consider yourself lucky, honestly. Think that way.\n  \n  Sometimes your body can want things that it shouldn't. Sometimes you got to take a step back minute a minute... that you don't need it.... Sometimes you got to go with a gut feeling. If you feel that someone's toxic than that's a gut feeling. If you're having to ask me this question then you need to stay away from them.\n  \n  You want to end up with a person that you can stand. Not someone that's going to bring you down in the end. You want someone supportive on every levels. You should be serious about every relationship that you go into. Not think... Oh I miss them... You need to be serious. Because one day you could end up having kids with them and sometimes things happen on accident and you don't want that to be the person that you make an accident with. You want to make a family with someone that is trustworthy. That's going to be there for you. That's going to be faithful. Trustworthy. Honest. Hard-working.

Everybody so wound up and wondering what everyone else is doing they're not focusing on themselves and what they should be doing. It's simple... It doesn't affect you..

It's that person's choosing to do what they want? They already know what your telling them?? So.. mind your own business? And you don't have to worrie about the tattoo.. Cause it's not on you.

So that means if he was to break his leg or developed sort of a disease where he literally became a stick or he got some kind of skin issue you're still supposed to love him, regularless. Abs or not. ? lol.. It shouldn't matter what he looks like?! You should still love him regardless! He's supposed to be your best friend! That's like you getting pregnant.. and he say that you're getting fat? And that he's losing attraction towards you?? That wouldn't be right because you can't help the fact that you get big when you're pregnant because that's how it works. Surprising enough? ...there's men that literally get angry and leave their woman because of that! even though that's how it works! LOL makes no absolute sense!\n  \n  But you're doing it all wrong.

Bad for animals even. Can cause cancer & more. If sometimes you drink out of a water bottle & it has a horrible taste that usually means that the water is bad! Throw it away! It is been stored in a warehouse in the wrong way and it's probably been exposed to the heat too long.\n  \n  But like water.
