Jealously comes from a place of insecurity

   Dead mf asx . Like there's a world of difference between someone ENDANGERING their child then someone piercing a babys ears , formula feeding, or even choosing to circumcise.

  ","
  Tell me about it ; it’s sad . Unless the child is being harmed then yeah step in and educate before you start bashing them on a social media platform .

   Jealous of what? Of getting engaged after 7 or 8 years of relationship? Just because others dont post their public life doesnt mean they dont have or want or need or be jealous of what others have. Is good for you but is ridiculous that you keep making a big thing of it be happy for you we dont care
  ","
  You don’t care . That’s okay if you don’t care . But guess what? I’m not on ask for all of you guys to care. Idc if you care. You’re obviously bitter cause I’m happy for my own engagement. Cause if you weren’t bitter you would’ve have said anything PERIOD! .
  
  Now move along . Get over yourself.
  "
742350,"
   Again telling someone something they dont like to hear doesnt make anyone a hater. Be happy and thats good but changing your name and making a big thing about it. You already announced your engagement so there we all know. Moronic

   If you say ""mhm"" it means yes to the vast majority of people. Common sense just ain't so common to you I guess

   The reason it is easier to group all Blacks together unlike Whites is because you get so many subcultures of Whites such as Mods, Emos, Goths, Metalheads, Punks, Skinheads, Indieboys, Teddy Boys, Bikers, Chavs, Ravers, skaters etc whereas almost all Blacks follow that hip hop gang culture thing.
