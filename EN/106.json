entitled to talk me up . like white men in my country . but white men in my country aren t on this website as much so what i literally get , all the time , are middle eastern dudes . treating me like i m obligated to give them time because they like the way i look . you really need to sit down and educate yourself on power structures and what that means and where it intersects . on a global scale . i m not saying middle eastern men in other countries , like america , where they are oppressed , are included in this . i m talking about literally dudes from like pakistan , with all of their

cider that s quite dry actually and listening to my favorite tunes and enjoying my new haircut and wishing people would send more questions","98347":"for sure . i think with all this weed money
