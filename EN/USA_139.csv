   You can use it to plan a pregnancy as well but if you know when you're ovulating you can also avoid having unprotected s.ex on that date. There's also an app you can use that tracks your period and shows your most and least fertile days. Just a suggestion but it's entirely your business

   It can take up to a full 9mo after one stops bc before her body allows impregnation to occur...takes longer than that for some women. You gain weight with some of them, as your body potentially believes you're already pregnant, etc. It's actually bad for your body, those used for numerous reasons.

   do you think someone should be embarrassed for having a low body count
  ","
  Nobody should be ashamed of how many partners they have. This world judges people and put labels on them. Who cares how many people a person slept with . But apparently the whole world does

   I also have a friend who's 19 and has only been with 2 dudes, including her current bf and they've been together like 3 years and have a baby. It's sad cause from what you're saying i know it probably won't last and he'll cheat. She should've not been afraid to have more experience

  Same reason why people judge girls with a high body count lmao.
  "
748506,"
   How is that fantasy world? Again it's funny how you think girls who don't sleep around can't please their partner, and boring and will get cheated on but you don't like getting called a wh.ore. Stop tryna shame people for having a lower body count
  ","
  Lmaoo trust me I’ve seen this all unfold so many times with other people’s relationships even long term lol
  "
748507,"
   It's a shame people don't sleep around or actually have to love someone to have s.ex are boring and will probably get cheated on
  ","
  What? Lmao.
  
  Anyone can get cheated on but sex plays a role in healthy relationship LOL.
  "
748508,"
   So everyone with a lower body count is boring and has unfulfilling s.ex lives. But you don't like to be called a wh.ore. Gotcha
  ","
  It’s a shame how a women can’t sleep with whoever tf she wants when not in a relationship . But men sleep around lol.

  "
748517,"
   How is that different? Thats worse than having 2 partners cause they have 0 experience whatsoever.
  ","
  Because they’re saving themselves for marriage .
  
  She only had 2 sexual partners as she “claims” . So obviously she wasn’t saving herself for anyone .
  
  That’s the difference

   How open are you about your life? Do you have no issue telling people things or are you closed off?

  I’m pretty open to a certain extent. I’m pretty much only open with my bf . My bff too . But I don’t tell her every little detail about what’s going on.
  "
748519,"
   You're so right. Marissa thinks it's shameful to have multiple partners but I think it's shameful to only have 2 as an adult. It's boring. So are the ""virtuous"" girls who wait till marriage or whatever. Don't you agree ?

  Well if you wait till marriage that’s different imo.

   Your partner can still teach you what they like and dislike and y'all can spice things up too plus some people only like having s.ex with someone they love and having casual partners is damaging for their mental health

  ","
  That’s why a lot of people get cheated on for a boring sex life . I’m not saying oh you have to sleep around . But having some more experience more than 2 partners will teach you some things .
