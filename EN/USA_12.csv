  We’ll considering that I haven’t seen my last actual last ex in roughly 4 years, I would say I would be happy. I can say that I’d be as excited as I was a few years ago, as she blocked me from every Single social media there is. Who knows why. And it’ sucked because even though we dated for almost 8 years, she was my best friend. So it’d be nice to at least see her. And to know how she’s doing. Why wouldn’t I want to know how she’s been in life.
  
  I know she’s at least getting married or she’s at least engaged, so I’d wish her the best for the future. Then probably see if she wanted to grab something to eat and catch up on the lost years. So much time had passed It’d be interesting to see how much had changed between us. But I’m sure it’d be fine. And I’ve always enjoyed her company. So it’d be nice to catch up. And of course Id ask to see how Puka(her dog) is doing.

64405,"
   are you strong person mentally?
  ","
  Yes. There are certain times or moments where it may seem like that’s not the case, and I can see how one would think that. But rest assured I can, have, will, do, and ALWAYS find a way to get through something.
  
  Growing up, I’ve had to deal with so much more than I could’ve/should’ve been able to handle; and in much shorter amounts of time. I couldn’t just go to someone like a friend or family member with my issues or problems and just ask for help. And it’s not because I didn’t want to, it’s just they were never there when I actually needed them.
  
  Especially now and days....
  
  So due to that fact,
  
  I forced myself to learn a particular mindset. And rewrite my mentality to be able to handle anything thrown my way.
  
  I had to learn how to take in the situation(grasp the reality of it), feel the situation(let whatever emotions out and let them run their course), that way, I could be clear headed to think and reassess the situation(plan my steps), and finally handle the situation.(take care of business)
  
  Doing that for so many years, you tend to get good at it.

   if someone ur usually mean to told u they were in love with u which is why the bugged you, how would u feel and what would u say
  ","
  M initial thoughts- I would be taking back for sure. Because I would never have expected that and what does that mean?
  
  1) I would be thinking what have I done to deserve that Love.
  
  2) To them, why? If I’m always mean to them, why the hell would they be in love with me?
  
  There has to be a reason.
  
  3) Why am I usually mean to them? Is it because I to@eo could in-fact be in love with them?
  
  Then given some time, I would’ve reassessed those feelings. What is it, that they could be seeing in me, that makes them want to love me.
  
  I’d probably feel there’s possibly something inside me worth loving. Maybe it’s something or a certain side of me from within; which I’m unable, yet anyways, to see or understand.
  
  Perhaps the reason I don’t see that happiness inside myself, is because their happiness comes from my happiness. And their happiness is what also make me happy. So essentially they both want the other person to be happy, and they know they need each other to achieve it.
  
  Or maybe it’s like how they would said back in Elementary school that if a girl or boy was mean to you, It was because they like you.
  
  Who knows... just an idea.
  
  So- if I do have feelings or also loved them back. I would tell them how I felt, Face to face.
  
  I’d make sure I meant it first because I told them so. And Lying and saying it to just say it, will be terrible because then they would be let on to believe something that isn’t true and that’ll hurt them even more when I find out the truth.

   Is love complicated? Why?
  ","
  Of course it is.
  
  •If it was easy, then it wouldn’t be worth fighting/sticking around for.
  
  Love is something that can change someone. There are sometimes it can be a change for the worst, but I can say this- most times it’s a good change.
  
  •It can also be complicated if there’s “walls” put up by one or both sides.
  
  1) The only way to rescind the walls, is to be able to open up. As difficult as it can be sometimes, the s/o should always be there for them.
  
  2) It takes time. Depending on the person anyways.
  
  3) They can only be taken down once there’s be a solidified Trust between the two.
  
  100% Transparency is an absolute must in order for this to happen.
  
  •It can be complicated because love can hurt. It can be from a past relationship or a recent one. And the trust and dependability that one is hopeful for as well as desires in a relationship is difficult to obtain.

   What do you think about parents who presents their childrens on the Internet (Facebook, Instagram, ...)?
  ","
  There should be a limit, I think so, for a couple of reasons.
  
  First and foremost, that’s a decision for the parent to decide how many similar pictures where the baby is literally doing the same fucking thing for.... about.... 20 images, just for it, yes “it”, moves its arm up and they post another 10-15 images of that. That- that shit is annoying. My family does the same shit and I’ll give them shit it too. Because they would always complain about how people always post 300 pictures of their kids like anyone wants to see them. But as soon as they have a baby/grandchild they end up posting 500 images.
  
  It’s like “what the fuck.”
  
  Not only do they do that on social media, I gotta deal with it in the group text messages. Every-goddamn-day. I mean, I’m all for seeing pictures of them little shits, but at the same Time, getting the same 40 pictures AND videos sent all at once is of them doing the same shit tends to eat up all my fucking phone storage.

  The person has to allow themselves the chance to be.
  
  You can WANT to be happy as much as you want, but if you don’t allow yourself the chance to open up, let people in you’re dwindling your chances of ever being so.
  
  It’s simple, if you’re unable to open up to the one thing or person that CAN make you happy, well then- a person can never TRULY be happy.
  
  The person had to stop trying to control stuff that’s beyond their control. It’s not just about accepting things as they are, it’s about how you’re willing to adapt to said thing or change rather than fighting it because it’s not happening the way they would like it to.

  Worry about the little things.
  
  For instance, me being a perfectionist about my work; I worry about the tiny details in the edit that most people wouldn’t even notice or be looking for. Because when that small little edit choice I make, goes by without taking someone out of the moment or when it catches their eye because perhaps it was so abrupt that’s when I get nervous. So when I’m screening a cut for the director or an agency, I get super excited my work goes by silently and super nervous when it doesn’t. When in reality, everything is going to be fine and I have to always be confident in my work.
  
  If that makes sense.
  
  Other stuff that makes me nervous is when I’m talking to someone I like. I’m about nervous about how much too say, or if I’m saying enough. And that whole shabang.

I’m just going to keep writing to waste your time. What do you think I should write in the meantime while you continue to still read this completely irrelevant/bullshit response? I SHOULD write about wasting yours and whoever else reads this response because, to be honest, I’m doing that now. I’m not entirely sure why I kept on with writing this? It could be because I’m stoned and zoned the fuck out, it could be that the birds are back, and they’re out for revenge. I’m not even sure what that mean. I was thinking about Alfred Hitchcock’s movie The Birds. And how the trailer for that film would been. At the very last moment of the trailer, when the voice over says the name of the film and even adds the tag line, it’d be like that. But for like a shitty B movie sequel or low budget ass film, and that’s be the tag line or just some dumbass shit that’s said while the trailer is going. Speaking of going, Im not entirely sure where is it going.

   Is it possible to fall in love with someone you just met online?
  ","
  Yes. I do believe so.
  
  People have been doing it for some time now. Isn’t that what eHarmony started, then MySpace, followed by Facebook/Instagram, then Match.com, and now every form of social media from Tinder to Tumblr.
  
  Just because you met someone online doesn’t mean you can’t expand it further than just that.
  
  For instance the obvious; meeting that someone in person.
  
  After that, meeting up with them another time; then another, then another. You may not know it at the time, or had any sort of intention besides just being friends.
  
  After some time of getting to know said person, you start to become closer and what from that emerges, could be/is love.
  
  I think it when it comes to falling in love, even with someone online; it all matters on how much time and effort your willing to put in to push it further than that to.
  
  I say it like that because of course you can say, “oh I love them!”
  
  (referring to the person you met online) and that could be based solely off of looks; but I don’t think that’s love.
  
  Love is a lot deeper than that.
  
  Which is why I believe it is possible to fall in love with someone you just met. People believe in love at first time sight, I do too. But like I said, it all depends on what you’re willing to put in to push it further than that to make it more than just seeing them through a computer/phone screen or just seeing them from afar. And from doing that, introducing yourself to them and talking to them more, to hanging out with them, and then getting to know someone on a deeper level from all that combined, you can and will find love. Now whether or not that feeling is reciprocative is a whole other story. Haha.
  
  So put it simple, haha, Yes.
  
  Yes you can fall in love with someone you just met.

  I’ve had multiple moments where they were the best days and so many more I can write or tell. But here’s a few memorable ones

  1) Text from early college years. Good times.
  
  2) Back when things were great with those people.
  
  3) My birthday that year, me trying to hail a cab was a little difficult. Desperate times call for fun measures.
  
  3-4) Editing Beyoncé - Lemonade film as well as the content for her world tour. Then go to see my work the opening night of the tour with 0 hours of sleep and 3 days straight working.
  
  5)My first time going to EDC. Not only did The Acid boost my senses  when these fireworks went off 2-3ft in front of my and my friend and scared out of us. Lol. It made that shit look like actual fire in the sky. It was breathtaking.

  Also if it’s said to have the highest rise buildings in Australia, I’d love to see them. I’m a sucker for Skyscrapers.

For all I know, you could’ve in fact STARTED to defend yourself from bullying; BUT that doesn’t mean you stopped there. Shit... how do I know that you didn’t go further with your “defense?”
  
  Perhaps you got such a rush from it, it became your new drug.
  
  From there you would terrorize that person who started the initial bullying. Maybe there’s several occasions where you would see them walking down the street minding their own business, then you would come out of nowhere and throw cheese slices at them while screaming hysterically and dump and bucket of goose nuts and gopher blood all over them? All while having music blasting at full leaving playing “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun” on repeat.
  
  How do I know you didn’t just continue with your craziness and in the middle of the night, put a massive speaker next to their bedroom window, blast that song, throw an boulder throw their window, having disco lights and car horns blaring  while still screaming hysterically. Only to distract them so you can spray them with a hose filled with Tabasco flavored banana pudding, then you’d throw bags filled with of feathers. And you’d starting laughing at them and act like a chicken poking fun at them?!

  Depending on what kind type of love you’re referring to.

  Love- in the sense of having feelings for someone?
  
  Yea I’m sure they can. There are some who can’t let go, and there are some that do.
  
  And for the ones that do let go, I’m sure they still do in fact love that other person even after a splitting. As in the sense for caring what happens to them, and not in the having feelings for.
  
  This can actually have several types of answers. Just FYI, I May give certain answers in this spectrum, but that doesn’t mean that’s how I feel about love per say.

  *^Thinking as them**
  
  Perhaps people cling onto the persona or pseudonym of the character they created. People can force themselves to adapt as another persona when they’ themselves are unable to. If that makes sense.  Like how people have stage names, or you see Musicians or actors who can kill it on screen or in music, and are open and reach to others, and they’re relatable etc etc(in their art form, just to be clear), but as soon as you interview them- they’re shy & uncomfortable.

But if I knew that person was in some possible danger or harm, I’d find a way to at least reach out to someone THEY know, and perhaps inform them of any possibilities. I don’t know them, but I think they’d deserve to know what they’re getting into, and it’d be up to them to decide.  So it’s a little tough to say.

  It’s choice and free will that allows us to make the decisions and mold and shape our destiny fate.

  I mean, if I fucking see a cheeseburger doing yoga, I’m obviously out of my mind on my own free will. Fuck it, I’d go watch it do yoga. Shit. Maybe even ask it how it’s doing, smoke a joint with it, then get the munchies and eat that sommamabitch.

   how do you not go crazy in a world with so much horror!?
  ","
  I don’t go around pretending that the horror doesn’t exist.
  
  And come to the realization, as much of a downer as this may sound- this world is shit because people are shit. People are the only way to change it. Where does the change start? How does it spread? Who does it reach? It’s the little things, like a seed, that unknowingly become giants. Like a seed to a tree. Then the tree grows ginormous and is vast. The the tree gets old. Then branches fall, and inevitably so does the tree... killing everyone underneath it.
  
  Damn, that got dark fast.

  Or perhaps, instead of banning marriage- we switch some shit around.

And we get custody and child support and all that other bullshit. Eh? eh? Sounds better doesn’t it?

  So what you’re really saying is you’re looking for a new friend. Then once you introduce yourself and you start to lure them in closer, you pull off a series of crimes.

Then you tip off the feds leading them directly to the location of your new “friend,” and you just sail off into the wind...

   Are you a bad mother if, you want to see a band play but the time you can get off of work is the first weekend after your kid’s first week of school? (The dad can likely watch the kid
and it’s been a few years since you’ve been out) is this selfish?
  ","
  No. Just an observation, but here’s a few reasons why.
  
  -The mom has the weekend off, and the schools closed on the weekends.
  
  - Shows are primarily at night, and the kid should already be in bed by that time or close to.
  
  - Since it’s already late and the kid won’t be up for much longer and the mother can just get a babysitter to watch over them.

  Now and days, sure, blind dates are a lot less common than before.
  
  Now it’s all about matching interests first or both swiping right.

   I met someone.. Coz of a family gathering. First day that person was with someone.. Akala ko sila.. Pero the following day di na sila magkasama.. hindi pa pala sila and just bffs.. i stalked that person a bit, and found out that there's someone in her heart.. Parang naghihintay lang
  ","
  I'm sorry, but I'm having a little trouble understanding the situation.
  
  You're saying that you met someone at a family gathering, (yours or theirs). When you say you met someone- are you saying like a thing where the feeling were mutual?
  
  And did you even bother to ask before assuming? Not judging-entirely... but why'd you stalk that person? What does this person mean to you, and why was your first question according to Google Translate
  
  ""Can I Love You?""
  
  Is that what the translation means?
  
  And why ask me that? I'm just slightly confused and Sorry for all the questions.
  
  This is just a very interesting topic with very little details.

  It was the most thoughtful gift, I even took a picture of it. I got from my post producer May 27, 2013. Of all the people I saw that day, she was the only one who could see my day took a turn for the worst.
  
  She brought this to me while I sat in my bay in a bad mindset. She said, ""...you look like you needed a pick me up."" I just looked at the smile on the cupcake and smiled back at her. That's all I needed.

Try getting dudes sending you messages about hooking up or showing off their ""manhood"" every day, because that's what happens on other websites.

   وهي حاصلة على الدكتوراة في التربية، ومديرة المدرسة الإسلامية The leaders academy بمدينة فيلادلفيا.
   
   كم نفع وينفع الله بجهودها أبناء وبنات ونساء وبيوت الجالية المسلمة هنا ..
   
   تعلمون أن تربية الأبناء هي أخطر التحديات التي نحياها في بلاد الغرب!
   

   أن يمنّ الله علينا بمن يستقبلون أطفالنا من سنين أعمارهم الأولى وحتى المرحلة الثانوية .. فيدرسونهم اللغة العربية والقرآن وآداب الإسلام والفقه والسيرة بالإضافة للمواد الأكاديمية المعتادة، لتخرّج المدرسة سنويا نماذج تسعد القلب لأبنائنا الذين يحجزون أماكنهم في أرقى الجامعات الأمريكية = نعمة كبيرة تستحق الشكر والتشجيع، والشد علي أيدي القائمين عليها بالامتنان والدعاء بخير.
   
   للدكتورة جهد مبارك في الدعوة النسائية، حيث تعقد لقاء أسبوعيا خاصا بالأخوات في تدبر موفق لسور من القرآن الكريم، تتخلله محاضرات عن مواضيع تمس واقع المرأة المسلمة في الشرق والغرب تحت عنوان:  كوني قوية.
   
   لذا فأنا أدلكم بكل الحب والصدق والرغبة فيما ينفعكم على متابعتها والاستفادة من كريم جهودها .. وأؤكد على الأخوات خاصة أن يحرصن على هذه الصحبة الصالحة، في زمن قلّ فيه المعين على الخير.
   
   هذا الإعلان ليس مجاملة ولا تجملا .. هذا الإعلان مجرد قيام بحق واجب تجاه ما أراه بعيني وأحياه بروحي كل يوم من خير وعلم ودعوة .. أجد بركته في حياتي، وأرجوه بعد مماتي!
   
   والله يتم ويديم علينا وعليكم ما أحيانا نعمه .. ظاهرة وباطنة.

   اريد ان اخبرك لتسمع اخبار جيدة وليس كلام شكوى فقط
كان معي بالمدرسة شاب خلوق ثم الان في الجامعة كنت اغض بصري ولا افكر بالامر قدر المستطاع كما تقول انت مع اني معجبة به واتأمل ان يخطبني يوما
ثم قرأت اجابتك عن خطبة من بنفس السن وما يواجهها
شعرت ان قلبي ارتاح وصرفت النظر عن الفكرة
حقيقي ربنا يجزيك الخير

عذراً للتدخل يا شيخنا ؛ ولكنها بتقول كان زميليها في الجامعة يعني بانية عنه فكرة بردو ...

   هو بصرف النظر عن إنها صيدلة وهو تجارة!

   شيخي .. مخطوبة من تلات أشهر خطيبي شخص محترم وخلوق جدًا وعمره ما زعلني بس مش عارفة اتغاضى عن فكرة أنه مش ملتزم الالتزام اللي كنت عايزاه.. ممكن يأخر الصلاة، مش بيصلي الفجر، مفيش ورد من القرآن تقريبًا .. مش في باله يتعلم عن دينه مثلًا رغم محاولتي معاه بلطف كتير .. دُلني بالله
  ","

   1) صلاة الفروض الخمس في وقتها (ولو أخر الفجر لعذر النوم مع نية الاستيقاظ لها وبيصلي الصبح أول ما يصحى فلا بأس، مع المجاهدة في الانتظام).
   
   2) حب الله ورسوله وتعظيم أحكام الشرع، ولو كان مقصرا.
   
   3) السلامة النفسية في حسن الخلق وكف الأذى عن الناس وحب الخير لهم.
   
   4) الكرم في العاطفة والمادة .. والرجولة في تحمل المسؤولية.
   
   5) فهم مساحات الحقوق والواجبات .. وعدم الخلط بين بر والديه وأهله، وبين حقوقك وحقوق أهلك .. وإعطاء الكل ما يتوجب له بإنصاف.
   
   اللي عنده الخمسة دول = نعمة تحمدوا ربنا عليها كل صلاة .. وهو خير أنواع الأزواج .. ولو كان لا يحفظ إلا قصار السور، ولا لحية له، ولا صورة التزام نمطية تعرفونها وفقط.

   ليه ديما حضرتك بتحط من رُؤيه البنت في شخص معين  ، وان كانت تتوسم فيه الصلاح والخير ، وايه المعايير الي اقول بعدها أن الشخص داه كويس جدا من رأي حضرتك ، وشكرا جدا
  ","

   مش بحط!
   
   الفكرة إن تقييماتكن غالبا عاطفية مندفعة .. تفتقد للخبرة والواقعية.
   
   يعني أنا عشان أحكم على حد إنه محترم (جدا) لازم أكون عاشرته واتعاملت وسافرت ورحت وجيت معاه!
   
   ده ازاي يتوفر لبنت بتقيم واحد يا دوب متقدم لها؟!
   
   أنتم بتحكموا بالقبول المبدئي فقط .. وفترة الخطوبة بعد كده والمواقف بتبين القبول ده كان في مكانه ولا لأ.

   متقدملي شخص كان زميلي ف الجامعة انا صيدلانية وهو محاسب اهلي بيقولوا هبقى بظلم نفسي،هو شخص كويس جداً لكن اهلي شايغين انه اقل عشان هو مش دكتور،ضغطوا عليه ف كذا حاجة منهم القايمة والدي عايز يكتب٥اضعاف الدهب اللي هييجي ووالده رفض وقال القايمة هنكتب فيها كل حاجة هتيجي لكن مش هنكتب حاجة زيادة،مين الصح ؟!
  ","

   تقييم الناس ليس بشهاداتهم .. فلو أهلك مش موافقين عليه يبقى ما يحملوش عليه ما لا يقبل من طلبات غير منطقية، يرفضوا باحترام وبس.
   
   بصرف النظر عن حكاية إنه مش مناسب عشان مش دكتور دي، مش عارف ليه .. وبصرف النظر عن إنك بتأكدي إنه كويس جدا، مش عارف بناء على إيه.

   صباح الخير 😌
  ","

   شوية حاجات .. عالماشي!
   
   بصرف النظر عن موضوع الكورة نفسه، وإن أكيد فيه حاجات في حياتنا أهم من كده بكتير، وإن الموضوع لو تجاوز مساحته يبقى لازم تراجع نفسك فيه ..
   
   لكن لفت نظري اليومين دول ملاحظات .. أحب تدوينها لنفسي (هاه، لنفسي وعلى صفحتي .. فلو وافقتني فيها = حيّاك .. ما وافقتني = اعتبر نفسك ما شفتها .. هتوجعك أيا كان انتماؤك وتدخل تقل ذوقك = معذرة، هبلّكك بدون نقاش).
   
   1) الأصل في كل الأمور هو السعي للنجاح، أخذ خطوات على طريق الإنجاز، المحاولة الدائمة التي يكفيك شرفها .. حتى وإن لم تصل لما ترجو!
   
   قيمتك في الطريق الذي تسلكه والهدف الذي تسعى إليه ..
   
   بالتالي لا تلتفت ساعتها لمن لا يتقنون إلا السخرية منك .. تسوءهم حسنتك، وتفرحهم سيئتك.
   
   يخدرون حرقة فشلهم بتتبع زللك وتمنيه .. ستلقاهم وتراهم، فإياك وإياهم.
   
   هذه قاعدة ينبغي أن نستفيدها .. وما نراه هذه الأيام مثال عملي لها!
   
   مثال: فريق الأهلي اليوم سطّر ويسطر تاريخا تذكره الأجيال!
   
   أيا كانت نتيجة اليوم، ولو بهزيمة ثقيلة .. فهو صنع لنفسه مجد ملاقاة بطل أوروبا الذي تخشاه فرق العالم، كبطل أفريقيا على قبل نهائي كأس العالم للأندية!
   
   ولن يذكر التاريخ بالطبع أصحاب الكنبة، الذين يواسون خيبات أملهم المتكررة بتمني فضيحة .. زعموا.
   
   2) المعاني العظيمة ينبغي أن تظل بمعزل عما لا يليق بها .. الدين والحب والانتماء والموت والحياة .. وغيرها ..
   
   نحن كمسلمين لنا سعي عظيم، لا نقبل المساومة عليه .. ولا نصل بروحنا لنوع من فراغ النشوة وضياع الهوية حتى نستمدهما مما لا يرقى ولا ينبغي أن يرقى لهذه المنزلة!
   
   مثال: احنا بنعيش لله ونموت لله .. مش بنعيش عشان حد ولا حاجة، ولا بنموت عشان فريق وكيان .. حياتنا وموتنا أغلى من كده بكتير.
   
   مش لائق أبدا تكتب "" وما رميت إذ رميت ولكن الله رمى ""، لتستخدم هذا المعنى العظيم عشان طمعان الأهلي يكسب وكده .. ربنا يقوي إيمانك، لكن خليه بعيد عن السياق ده كله .. لأن الخوف إن مروان محسن مثلا يضيع إيمانك، وإيمان جيرانك كمان!
   
   3) لو كان الزمالك هو اللي هيلعب اليوم كنت شجعته وفرحت إن فريق مصري بيصنع تاريخ باسمه واسم مصر وأفريقيا .. وما أظنش مشجع دورتموند مثلا بيتمنى البايرن يرجع اليوم بفضيحة، بصرف النظر عن صعوبة أو استحالة ده يعني 😁
   
   فحبوا بعض يا ولاد .. حبوا بعض وخدوه وقت لطيف يخدّر الهموم ويلهي عن المظالم .. للأسف!

   ظلمت نفسي جدا طبعا ومعترفة ب دة وربنا يهديني ويغفرلي بس اقصد هل هو هيحاسب على دة!

   كل واحد سيحاسب على ذنبه وظلمه طبعا .. ومن تاب تاب الله عليه!
   
   المهم في الحالات دي إننا نتحمل مسؤولية نفسنا وننشغل بصلاح حالنا ..

   طريقتك في السؤال تشكك في درجة نضجك للأسف!

   كتبت هذا منذ زمن، ولعله يشرح لك:
   
   لما قال النبي -صلى الله عليه وسلم- في الرؤية الشرعية (اللي هي من حق الطرفين على فكرة) : ""فإنه أحرى أن يؤدم بينكما"" = لم يكن ناطقا عن الهوى .. بأبي هو وأمي ..
   
   الملامح والانفعالات .. الروح والدم = مهمة جدا في الحكم، واستدراج القلب لحمى الحب !
   
   ولذا كثيرا تحدث الصدمة في التباين بين الأسلوب الكتابي أو حتى نغمة الصوت .. وبين الشكل ..
   
   أكرر دوما: لابد أن يختبر الحب على أرض الواقع ..
   
   (في حله طبعا .. عشان محدش يقول دي دعوة لـ dates :D)
   
   الحب خلف الشاشات وعبر الصور = غير مكتمل الأركان .. ولا يعول عليه كثيرا ..
   
   نعم .. مؤهل لأن يصير قصة قوية جميلة .. وبداية لحياة طويلة ..
   
   لكنه يحتمل بنسبة كبيرة أيضا أن يتحول لأكبر صدمات العمر !

   كما أنك لن تترك الصدقة لمجرد أنك أخطأت يوما بالصدقة على نصاب ..
   
   أجرك ثابت ونيتك صادقة .. وعلى الله الحساب.
   
   2) ابتلاء الله للعبد له أدب .. أدب يقتضي التفكر والاتعاظ، والافتقار للطف الله ورحمته.
   
   نبرة التحدي والحرب وأنت أقوى وأنت هتنتصر = أراها مستوردة، باردة .. باهتة!
   
   ليس معنى هذا أن تكون ضعيفا مستسلما واهنا أمام ابتلاءاتك .. بل كن متفائلا مستبشرا راضيا، طامعا في رحمة الله متعظا، متبرئا من حولك وقوتك إلا به وحده سبحانه.
   
   احنا مش أقوى من أي حاجة .. احنا ضعفاء للغاية .. مرضى أو أصحاء، فقراء أو أغنياء .. أيا ما نكون .. ضعفاء!
   
   مصدر قوتنا الوحيد في الاستعانة بالله والرضا بأقداره .. والتوكل عليه في الأخذ بالأسباب ..
   
   فلما نتكلم لازم نكون مستحضرين هذه المعاني .. ما نفتحش صدرنا من باب الدعم والقوة وكده ..
   
   لأن مع أول غدر في الأسباب الأرضية بيحصل انتكاس تام على كافة المستويات!
   
   وينجو الموصولون بحبل يقين .. للسماء.
   
   الابتلاء يا يكون رسالة ترجعك لطريق الله وتدلك على مراجعة حساباتك .. يا يكون اصطفاء من الله يرفع به درجاتك ويزكي أعمالك ..
   
   وفي كلا الحالتين ليس لائقا أن تتعامل معه بمعايير السوشيال ميديا وشعارات التنمية البشرية!
   
   3) ما زال الوعي الجمعي للجماهير غير صالح للتقييم .. عاطفيون مندفعون .. فإياك والاغترار بهم، سلبا أو إيجابا!
   
   كانت الإشارات واضحة إن فيه حاجة غلط .. وإن اللي زاد عن حده بيتقلب لضده .. وإن الدعم ونشر الطاقة الإيجابية يختلف كثيرا عن الأفورة والمبالغة والتمثيل ..
   
   وأهو درس.
   
   4) مرض الأرواح والنفوس أخطر كثيرا من مرض الأبدان .. والصحة الحقيقية هي صحة القلب والإيمان.
   
   5) أعظم ما تقدمه البيوت للمجتمع والأمة = أجيال سوية، مستقرة .. لا تعاني الجوع العاطفي الذي تسعى لسده بأي ثمن!
   
   لكن كيف إن كان كثير من المربّين بحاجة للتربية أصلا؟!
   
   6) الكذب ملوش رجلين!
   
   ومهما استطاع أحدهم الخداع .. يؤتى من حيث لا يحتسب.
   
   فسل الله الصدق .. واحرص عليه.
   
   7) لازم أؤكد تاني .. لا تسمح للكدابين يخلوك تشك في الصادقين!
   
   اتعلم واستفد من الدروس .. لكن ما تتغيرش وما تقساش وما تندمش على أي خير عملته؛ ربك عالم بالنفوس.

   برايك كيف نبطل نتعلق زيادة ب الاشخاص ؟
  ","

   معلش لو شفتوه كلام قاسي شوية .. وهو لا يتنافى مع مسألة أن الحب في أوله لا يُملك!
   
   لكن المنشور ده شفته عند الشيخ محمد عبد الواحد الحنبلي، وعجبني جدا ..
   
   اقرؤوه كويس وبهدوء:
   
   نفيسة جدا:
   
   ([العشق مرض] يعتري النفوس العاطلة، والقلوب الفارغة، والمتلمحة للصور لدواع من النفس، ويساعدها إدمان المخالطة، فتتأكد الألفة، ويتمكن الأنس، فيصير بالإدمان شغفا.
   
   [وما عشق قط إلا فارغ]!
   
   فهو من علل البطالين، وأمراض الفارغين من النظر في دلائل العبر وطلب الحقائق المستدل بها على عظم الخالق، ولهذا قَل ما تراه إلا في الرعن البطرى وأرباب الخلاعة النوكى.
   
   [وما عشق حكيم قط]!!
   
   [لأن قلوب الحكماء أشد تمنعا عن أن تقفها صورة من صور الكون مع شدة تطلبها، فهي أبدًا تلحظ وتخطف، ولا تقف]،
   
   وقَل أن يحصل عشق من لمحة،
   
   [وقَل أن يضيف حكيم إلى لمحة نظرة؛ فإنه مارٌّ في طلب المعاني، ومن كان طالبًا لمعرفة الله: لا تقفه صورة عن الطلب؛ لأنها تحجبه عن المصوِّر]،
   
   وحوشيت قلوب الحكماء الطالبين، فضلًا عن الواصلين العارفين= من أن تحبسهم الصور، أو تفتنهم الأشكال عن الترقي في معارج مقاصدهم، أو تحطهم عن مراكزهم إلى محل الأثقال الراسية، بل هم أبدًا في الترقي، هاتكون للحجب والأستار بقوة النظر).
   
   الإمام أبو الوفاء ابن عقيل الحنبلي -رحمه الله-
   
   قلت:
   
   الكلام هنا لمن يتمادى ويترك نفسه لتعلق يفسد عليه حياته!
   
   لا لمن يطلب الحلال .. أو يمضي في حياته بالصبر والثبات راضيا بالمآل.

   33مطلقه وعندي ولد وبنت مش قادره استوعب فكره الانفصال لاني كنت بحبه جدا ومش قادره ارتبط بحد جديد بحس اني بخونه مع انه خلاص مبقاش زوجي..
الطلاق كان سببه خيانته ومن بعديها حياتنا اتلخبطت كتير..
مش قادره اسامحه وارجع ومش قادره اعيش حياتي وارتبط بغيره..حاسه اني اتحشرت ف نقطه سوده ف حياتي..

   شعور طبيعي في مرحلتك دي .. وهتتجاوزيه بإذن الله.
   
   وعموما في مثل هذا الوضع المفروض بتاخدي قرار الانفصال وأنت مفترضة تماما احتمالية إنك هتكملي كده .. بس مقتنعة تماما إن ده حال أفضل لك وأرحم لروحك من الوضع السابق.

   أروع عشان فكرة مبتكرة فعلا .. وبتحسسك بالتحكم التام في الفريق.
   
   أخبث لأن لها بُعد نفسي عميق يؤصل في نظري لمبادئ الرأسمالية!
   
   الرغبة المستمرة في التجديد سيما مع الكروت اللي بتبوظ مع الوقت، الشعور بالعجز مع قلة الكوينز بالتالي دايما تقارن نفسك بالفرق اللي بتقابلها فتلعب أكتر عشان تشتري فلان، الاسكربتنج اللي بيتدخل في سير المباريات بحيث لا تمل من الفوز المستمر ولا تيأس من الخسارة!
   
   المود المزاجي اللي بتدخل فيه اللعبة مدمنيها .. عافانا الله.

   معناه راحت بكل بساطة تقوله: بحبك .. بلاش بحبك، معجبة بك وأتمناك في الحلال.
   
   بصرف النظر عن اعتراضي على المبدأ نفسه فحضرتها معندهاش حكمة ولا تقييم عشان تفرق حتى بين اللي يقدر يفتح بيت وبين اللي ما يقدرش!
   
   بالتالي يا يطلع هو مجرم فيتسلى عليها .. فرصة، حد يلاقي وقيعة زي دي وما يستغلش!
   
   يا يكون حد كويس ويقولها مقدرش ويبعد.
   
   طبعا حضرتها هتقول:  واو .. محترم وصادق وبيحافظ علي .. بالتالي هتقرر تعيش الدور وترفض اللي بيتقدموا .. مهما كانوا كويسين أو مناسبين.
   
   ولو اضغط عليها واتخطبت هتيجي توجع دماغنا طبعا بإن خطيبها حد كويس جدا بس حضرتها مش حاسة ومش قادرة ومش عارفة!
   
   والسبب معروف.
   
   البعيد دايما بنشوفه مفيش منه .. والشيطان ينفخ في الوهم ليسخطكم على المتاح بين أيديكم!
   
   المصيبة بأه إن بعد كل ده .. يعني على فرض إنها انتظرت واتحملت وكده .. وعلى فرض إنه صدق يعني وجه يتقدم لها ..
   
   فاللي بيحصل (في أغلب الحالات) إنه ما يعجبش أهلها لأن ظروفه مش مناسبة أو هي ما تعجبش أمه لأنها ناوياله على بنت أختها، اللي هي بنت خالته يعني!
   
   وهيحاول صاحبنا يفلفص شوية لكن في النهاية هيستسلم .. وهيضعف طبعا أدام كلمة: لو خدتها لا أنت ابني ولا أعرفك.
   
   ويروح يشوف حاله مع بنت خالته أو غيرها (وممكن ييجي يقول برضه خطيبتي كويسة وبتسمع كلامي بس مش حاسسها ولا مجذوب لها) .. وهي طبعا بعد ما ضيعت أفضل فرصها = هتلعن غدر والكذب اللي في جنس الرجالة وهتقضيها مياتم سوداء على الفيس وكافة وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي.
   
   ولفي بينا يا دنيا!
   
   يبقى بالله عليكم مش لو البنات غلّوا أنفسهن، والشباب كانوا رجالا؛ من أول لحظة أو نظرة أو نبضة حب متوهم أو حتى حقيقي .. تركوا كل حاجة لوقتها، ولم يقولوا الكلمة إلا بحقها وفي موضعها اللائق بها هيرتاحوا ويريحونا .. ولا لأ؟!

   ثم ليت شعري كيف هي تلك الحياة التي صورتيها بمخزن شكوى!

   طب مش هو المفروض نحسن الظن بالله ونكون موقنين بالاجابه ومتأكدين انه ربنا هيستجيب
  ","

   كرّرت هذا المعنى كثيرا !
   
   ويجدر بنا جميعا الانتباه له ..
   
   فارق بين (اليقين) و (حسن الظن) وبين الوصول لمرحلة من المعاندة كأنكم تجبرون ربكم -حاشاه- على شيء.
   
   فارق بين الدعاء بالخير، وتفويض الأمر لله والرضا بقدره حيث كان، مهما بدا أليما في البداية أو على عكس مرادنا .. وبين: لا هو ده الخير .. ولو مش خير فأنت قادر تخلّيه خير !
   
   هذا في الحقيقة نوع من السخط والاعتراض المغلّف بحسن الظن واليقين؛ وسواسا من الشياطين !
   
   نعم .. ربنا على كل قدير .. ويغيّر في طرفة عين من حال إلى حال ..
   
   لكنه -سبحانه- ربط الدنيا بأسباب، وابتلانا فيها بسكون القلب تحت مجريات القدر، ولو بشيء من العذاب !
   
   علام تدخلون الجنة إذن وتستحقون الخلود في النعيم -على ضعف العبادات واختلاط النيات- إن لم تحققوا لربكم التفويض بمراده وحسن الظن به -على الحقيقة- في التسليم لقضائه، ما دمتم بذلتم الوسع وأخذتم من الأسباب بما تطيقون ؟!
   
   أقول هذا المعنى وأؤكد عليه كيلا تستطيل بكم الأماني فكم تركت بسببها قلبا يعاني !
   
   والمصيبة أنكم تعودون بعد ذلك باللوم على ربكم والتسخط على قدره -عياذا به سبحانه-، وكأن رفعكم للدعوات -مهما كانت مخلصة- إلزام له بالاستجابة !
   
   وإنما الاستجابة بصور كثيرة جدا، لعل منها ما لا يكون إلا يوم القيامة وخلف باب الجنة ..
   
   دعاؤكم لن يضيع -حتما- لكن ليس بالضرورة أن يحقق على الصورة التي تريدون أنتم.
   
   مادامت الأسباب مستحيلة والأبواب مغلقة والوسع قد بذل صدق سعي وحسن نية = فاليقين في التسليم لرب العالمين، وما دون ذلك فمجرد تزيين.
   
   هذه ليست دعوة للضعف والاستسلام .. بل هذا بيان لحقيقة الدنيا، ونجدة لقلوبكم المعلقة بالأوهام .. ليس في العمر متسع لكل هذا؛ هي شوية أيام.

   تمام يا غالي.
   
   أنت إذن بحاجة لفكرتين ..
   
   فكرة عقلية .. تثير مروءتك.
   
   وفكرة قلبية .. تجدد إيمانك.
   
   أما الفكرة العقلية فهي أن تلك الصالحة الطيبة القائمة على راحتك، الساعية لإسعادك .. التي تأمنها على عرضك ومالك وبيتك = لا تستحق منك إلا معاملة بالنبل والكرم .. وهذا حاصل ولله الحمد، زادك الله مروءة.
   
   وأما الفكرة القلبية فهي أن سر النجاة في هذه الحياة يكمن في رضانا عما معنا وسعدنا به .. وغض طرف أبصارنا وآمالنا عما ليس لنا.
   
   وهذا هو مدخل الشيطان الذي يُهلك به فئاما من الناس .. فيعمون عن نعم الله، ويسخطون على حلاله، ويهلكون في حرامه.
   
   أنا لا أهاجم مشاعرك ولا أعرف ملابساتها ولا أتفه حتى من حقيقتها .. لكن صدقني يا صاحبي ما كنت والله تضمن أبدا سعادتك ولا راحة بالك ولا ذوق النعم التي أنت غارق فيها الآن (ولعلك لا تنتبه لتفاصيلها لتعودك عليها مع زوجتك .. أدامها الله عليك) أقول ما كنت تضمن أبدا كل ذلك مع من تحمل لها هذه المشاعر؛ فليس المرعى بتلك الخضرة التي نراه عليها من بعيد بالضرورة .. بل لعل الأمر على العكس تماما .. والواقع يشهد بملايين السيناريوهات المصدومة بتغير المشاعر وتحطم الحب بعد غلق باب واحد على كليهما.
   
   العين تزين البعيد دوما .. وينفخ الشيطان بالوساوس على هذا التزيين؛ ليحزن الذين آمنوا!
   
   والذين آمنوا يوقنون أن اختيار الله لهم خير من اختيارهم لأنفسهم .. وأن رزق الله هو الخير والأنسب والأفضل .. فيرضون به ويشكرون الله عليه.
   
   التقاء هاتين الفكرتين بداخلك يجعلانك بإذن الله تحمد الله على زوجتك وتشكره عليها بطاعته فيها .. وتقتنع ساعتها قناعة عقلية تامة بأنها أنسب امرأة لك في الدنيا!
   
   فتحمد ميزاتها .. وتتغافل عن قصورها .. وتسعد بها وتسعدها.
   
   هذه القناعة العقلية ستولد بداخلك لها مع مرور الأيام وجميل العشرة أجمل وأرقى وأصدق وأثبت مشاعر (وما تستعجلش).
   
   وسيصير ما مضى مجرد أثر ذقت به شيئا مما كنت تحسبه حبا .. وإنما الحب كله بين يديك.
   
   تدبر كلامي حرفا حرفا فإني لك ناصح .. محب من الخير لك ما أحب لنفسي ..
   
   وفقك الله وأسعدك .. وأقر عينك وأرضاك .. وبارك لك ولنا وللمسلمين في أرزاقنا.

   وأنتم من أول الناس الذين يجب علي شكرهم!
   
   نعم، أنتم يا صحبة الجنة.
   
   كل المرحلة الفائتة في حياتي لا أدري كيف كانت تمر دون وجودكم معي وحولي ..
   
   سعدكم بإجاباتي وانتظاركم لدخولي .. كل هذا كنت أشعره أنا مضاعفا .. كم آنس بوجودي بينكم، كم تسندني حروفي لكم، كما تفعل معكم وزيادة ..
   
   لذا .. أحمد الله عليكم، وأشكره إليكم، وأشكره عليكم .. وأشكركم.
   
   كلامي هنا معكم ليس كأي مكان آخر .. أنتم عائلتي الكبيرة، كنتم وتظلون ..
   
   وكثير منكم مرّ معي بتقلب مراحلي وأحوالي .. وكم وصلني دعاؤكم الصادق، وكم نفعني الله به.
   
   لو بحثتم في الأرشيف عن كلمة (الأمان) لوجدتموها أقصى مناي المتكرر في كل الإجابات عن أسئلة من نوع: نفسك في إيه؟!
   
   وأرجو الله أني قد وجدته .. وأرجو أن أعيش ما تبقى وأن أموت .. في صحبته.
   
   إن كان من كلمة لي ولكم: فإياكم والعجلة .. وإياكم وسوء الظن.
   
   ياما دعوت أنا بدعوات في جوف الكعبة .. ياما تحريت أرجى أوقات الإجابة ..
   
   ومع ذلك رأيت فيما سبق أسوأ ما كان يمكن أن يمر في كوابيسي من سيناريوهات لحياتي!
   
   لكني لم أفقد قط حسن الظن بالله، ويقيني به .. مثقال ذرة.
   
   وأحسب أنه أراني من حسن تدبيره ولطف أقداره عجبا .. يُروى في الحكايات!
   
   مهما حزنتم أو طال بكم أمد انتظار أو ضاقت كأن لم يعد لها مخرجا (وقد رأيتُ من هذا كله فوق ما تتخيلون) = اوعوا تيأسوا من رحمة الله وإياكم تشكوا في لطفه بكم.
   
   أنا وعزته أغار عليه (وأكيد كنتم بتلاحظوا ده في إجابات كتير برد فيها بنوع من القسوة حتى وأنا كنت في عز ألمي الشخصي) لما ألاقي حد بيشكو ربنا للناس .. بيشكوه عشان شوية ابتلاءات (مهما اشتدت) .. بيشكوه وناسي إنه أرحم الراحمين، وأكرم الأكرمين .. ربنا جميل ولطيف وودود .. بس نصبر.
   
   ستبقى دنيا، ليست جنة .. مفطورة على النقص والكدر ..
   
   لكن شعورك فيها أنك راض بالله، راض عنه، عاجز عن شكره في كل تدبيره، ممتن لكل شيء قدّره عليك، أضحكك أو أبكاك؛ فلولاه ما بلغت هنا = هذه هي جنة الدنيا.
   
   وهذه دعوتي منذ زمن، والتي أرجو الله قبولها؛ وله المنّة:
   
   اللهم الجنة .. اللهم جنة قبل الجنة.

   طيب اللى بيختاروا غلط مش هما اختاروا المكتوب بردو رد عليتا ارجوك مش فاهمة بجد
  ","

   واللي عصا ربنا أو عمل مصيبة من قتل وزنا وفساد في الأرض = ينفع يقول ده المكتوب؟!
   
   يا ناس يا عالم .. أنا بتكلم عربي .. واحفظوا القاعدة دي واعملوا بها عشان ترتاحوا، وهي خلاصة مسألة القدر:
   
   أنت عبد ما تعرفش إيه المكتوب .. وبتختار اختيار حر تماما، لا يجبرك فيه أحد على شيء!
   
   بالتالي ما دمت ما تعرفش المكتوب، وما دمت مش مجبر على حاجة .. فأنت بتاخد بالأسباب كلها لصلاح اختيارك في الدنيا والدين .. محسنا الظن برب العالمين.
   
   من وجد خيرا = فليحمد الله.
   
   ومن وجد غير ذلك = فلا يلومن إلا نفسه.
   
   وعند وقوع المصيبة تقدر تصبر نفسك بالقدر .. لكن لا تلم القدر ولا تتسخط عليه؛ لأن ده اختيارك أنت وسعيك أنت وتقصيرك أنت .. محدش أجبرك على حاجة!
   
   من آمن بهذا واستقر هذا اليقين في قلبه = عاش راضيا، ومات مرضيا.
   
   هذا آخر كلامي هنا .. وبلاش جدل فارغ لن يوصلكم لشيء.

   أظن غالب من يسأل أو يطرح هذا الأمر في الزواج بالذات إما قبل الزواج ومش قادر ياخد قرار فيلجأ للحيلة النفسية دي، أو تزوج وكانت تجربة سلبية فيلجأ للهروب بمسألة القدر وأنه مسير، إما للاستسلام للوضع الحالي، او التهرب من مسئولية سوء الاختيار

   ليه حضرتك بتقول كلام الشيخ الفوزان ليس صحيحا ؟
  ","

   لأن الرجل لو معندوش درجة معينة من القبول لشكل المرأة = هيظلمها ويظلم نفسه، مهما كانت ديّنة!
   
   وهذا الكلام لا يتنافى مع المقصود من قول سيدنا النبي:  ""فاظفر بذات الدين"".
   
   فهو قال أيضا:
   
   ""انظر إليها؛ فإنه أحرى أن يؤدم بينكما"".
   
   صلى الله على نبينا وسلم.

   دكتور من فضلك إزاي نعرف الراجل النسونجي من اللي طيب و لطيف و بيحب يساعد بس ؟
  ","

   الطيب واللطف وحب المساعدة = كل ده مقيد بقيود الشرع وحدوده!
   
   الطيب واللطف وحب المساعدة = يكون مبذول للأهل والمحارم بصورة أولية وأساسية!
   
   الطيب واللطف وحب المساعدة = لمن طرق بابه باضطرار، فيسقي ثم يأوي إلى الظل بأمان!
   
   الطيب واللطف وحب المساعدة = في غلق أبواب الفتنة من البداية.
   
   الطيب واللطف وحب المساعدة = في غض البصر، وكف فضول الكلام، وترك الشبهات خوفا من الحرام.

   لا .. لم يسبق لها.
   
   بصرف النظر عن النقطة الشخصية في السؤال .. لكن فعلا في مجتمعاتنا الجميلة مش المرأة المطلّقة بس اللي بتعاني، كذلك الرجل!
   
   وكلاهما يحاسب بما قد لا يكون له فيه يد كثيرا ..
   
   أصابع الاتهام موجهة مسبقا .. والتبرير والدفاع يكون غالبا إجباريا مقدما.
   
   وده الفارق بيننا وبين مجتمعات صدر الإسلام .. بين تعقيداتنا وظلمنا وعاداتنا، وبين بساطتهم وعدلهم وقوة دينهم!
   
   عشان كده ما ينفعش نسحب قواعد مجتزأة من طبيعة مجتمعهم (كالتعدد مثلا) ونسقطها على مجتمعنا اللي قواعده مضروبة بالنار أصلا.
   
   عموما .. اسألوا كويس .. وافهموا .. ولو الرجل فعلا صالح وصادق وعارف يوزن أموره بوضع واضح في الموازنة بين البيت الجديد وبين التزاماته ومسؤوليته ناحية أولاده = مش شايف أي مانع أبدا.
   
   وكلمة للأهالي ..
   
   مقدر خوفكم على بناتكم .. وحرصكم دايما على الأفضل فيما يبدو لكم ..
   
   لكن:
   
   هل فيه حد مضمون بيقين من الأول؟!
   
   هل فيه موضوع يخلو من مغامرة؟!
   
   ياما ارتباط لأول مرة .. ومركز وفلوس وناس بتحسد .. وفي الآخر فشل وعيشة هم!
   
   تخيروا لبناتكم الصالحين، ولشبابكم الصالحات .. وبلاش تعقيدات.

   ايه الاسس المتينة الا لازم نوضحها ونمشى عليها من البداية يا شيخ
  ","

   ليه بنتزوج .. وهنبني بيتنا على إيه .. بتحب إيه وإيه لأ (من الطباع والأخلاق وحتى الأكل) .. طب لو اختلفنا هنتصرف ازاي .. مساحات علاقاتنا بأهالينا وأصحابنا .. الأمور المادية والصرف هتبقى ازاي .. وقت فراغنا هنحب نعمل فيه إيه .. طب نقرأ حاجة سوا ونتناقش فيها ..
   
   وغيره .. وغيره ..
   
   100 ألف حاجة محتاجين تتكلموا فيها وتفهموا بعض أكتر من خلالها!

   طيب ولو خطيبي يا شيخنا بيطلب كدة باستمرار وشايف انه شيء عادي بس انا مش قادره ألبي طلباته غير بعد كتب الكتاب وهو موافق يعقد دلوقتي، وفي نفس الوقت لسه مدرستش شخصيته كويس فا مش هينفع نعجّل بكتب الكتاب دلوقتي، يبقي ايه الحل؟

   الشخصية الضعيفة في هذه الزاوية من أولها، المعظمة لها بمبالغة على حساب التقييم والبناء للعلاقة على أسس متينة منطقية، شرعيا وعقليا وعاطفيا = ينذر بخطر في عشرته أصلا.

   طبعا هنفرض إنها حلالك .. يعني عاقد عليها؛ لأن دي الحالة الوحيدة المسموحة.
