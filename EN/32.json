That would be really cool especially considering a lot of my family and friends live all over the world.\n  ","34512":"\n  We do but it's like shared with one other person. Like we have a roommate with us that we let stay here and they help with bills. We don't mind them staying but once they leave of course it is ours. So yes we own a house. Sometimes I just wish it was just us in it, if you know what I mean.\n  ","34513":"\n  There are a few sheets and pillowcases in there. And then there's a few new sheets that I found that I want to get worked on. And then I found some really cute baby blanket fabrics that I thought were adorable. So I held onto them because they were literally a couple cents. Ain't nothing wrong with thinking ahead of time for children and their blankets and stuff.\n  \n  We have a tradition in my family where we make each child a quilt or two and we consider it their baby blanket and it stays in their life that's theirs.\n  \n  When I moved here from Louisiana there's a few boxes in there with some of my stuff from Louisiana that I still haven't been able to take out. Like I said we still have a roommate and I don't want to take out things that mean a lot to me just in case if they get lost or broken of any kind.\n  \n  There's a few other things but I can't exactly remember. But this is a few things that are in our closet.\n  ","34514":"\n  Well of course like you said besides our clothes that are hanging in there. We have a few things that are for the kitchen, they are things that were given as presents that we either already have and they are backups, just in case, ya know.. if the other ones break or it's just things that we haven't gotten to to open just yet. Not many of them there's only a few things in there like that.\n  \n  Some things that were handed down from my grandparents. It's a special box of belongings from them that mean a lot to me. That they gave to me. Like some army stuff from my grandfather. And some really beautiful trinkets and more from both.\n  \n  Some of our shoes are at the bottom. Some more kitchen stuff is down at the bottom. When my grandparents passed away I inherited a lot of their kitchen stuff. A bunch of other things too I was inherited but I put the kitchen stuff in there to keep it protected. We still have a roommate so I don't really want to put everything in the kitchen just in case if they accidentally take something or break something. That would make me really upset.\n  \n  Then there is a bag of clothes that we don't want any more of that just in case if someone needs clothes we will give to them if not soon I will probably just donate them to a shelter. I really need to get rid of that because it's taking up room.\n  \n  I think there are a few persons in there of mine. A bag or two of his and maybe one that's mine I'm not sure can't remember.\n  \n  There are a few board games in there. I actually want to put them in the living room cause I want to make a really cute and gaming area display some when people come in and visit if they want to play a board game with us they can. Makes the house look really homie I think. Lol.\n  \n  There are a few quilts of my grandparents and my mom mom in there because they have been kind of worn down and I need to get them worked on so I keep them in there to keep them from getting any damage.\n  \n  This will be continued to another question\/answer...\n  ","34515":"\n  Yeah.

Just up to you.\n  \n  But be careful and keep an eye out on your wallet. You don't wanna lose all your coins. Give what you can and try to answer other people's questions well so they will reward you in the end. You are not always going to get rewarded for your answers so be aware of that.\n  \n  Also be aware that alot of stuff takes awhile to load and update on here. Your wallet may not immediately show the deduction that you gave to someone. This app has alot of glitches too. So yeah..\n  ","35073":"\n  The paranormal.\n  ","35074":"\n  Your followed.\n  \n  The only thing about the following system on here, on Ask.fm, is it doesn't show who followed you or who follows you. Your notification will let you know that someone followed you but it won't tell you who is following you. And it will also keep track of how many followers you have.\n  \n  But to me, this site isn't really about followers. It's more or less just about answering and asking questions and the quality of your answers and your questions. This site is about being active. Since you can't see who follows you, then really it's not even about follows. Right? At the end of the day at least in my eyes I feel that.\n  \n  I love my followers for sure, but I'm not focused on the number's. I could have 10 followers for 5,000, I don't really care about the number as like a ? trophy or something... I'm just happy that you guys are following me. I appreciate you guys's company. I appreciate y'all in general. And thanks for that for anyone who reads and sees this.\n  \n  Another thing that I will tell you is there are leaderboards. Every country. The more active you are and the better quality questions that you ask and answer, people will reward you wil ? fire\/coins and there are numbers that will start to appear at the top of your profile. Rank in your country on your leader board. There are daily coins and week. (When people give you\/reward you) Everyday records stack and then stack for the week. Like say someone gives you 50 today and then 50 more later. You got 100 coins for the day. Okay.. Tomorrow they give you another 25, then maybe 50 the next day. At the end of the week it will all add up together but then restart at the end of the week. The coins go in your wallet. But the records will go away after that week. Start over.\n  \n  Also you have a daily coin limit. It varys for all. Just depends. All complicated. Lol alot but yeah.

I have been hearing that a few people that have been having those problems also. Everybody has a fire wallet.

I have to have confidence and even when I(we) think I(we) don't have it I(we) have it and you have to convince yourself that you do have it and then you have to work at it. Work at yourself. You can't keep constantly looking in the mirror and breaking yourself down. You have to believe in yourself and have self faith. You have to get out there and experience and believe... You can't do it. Nothing is impossible regardless to how many excuses you put up. Stop making them. Stop procrastinating.

And then maybe every three months go on a little 3 or 4 day trip with your partner and try to see if the kids, they can stay at a friend's house or a family member's house. But only with someone you trust. That's pretty understandable if you're just trying to spend some alone time with your partner. Just make sure you keep them with someone that will take care of them. It's good to go on trips with the whole family and sometimes it's nice just to go the two of you, to rekindle.\n  \n  And then every time you go to bed at home, as long as you don't have really really young children, maybe close your door. Don't lock it... just close it or lock it ? and just tell them to knock when they come to the door. And if you have older kids just tell them to keep an eye on their siblings for the next hour or so. You don't have to tell them what you're going to do. Just let them know if they need you to come knock on the door but only if you really need me and don't be hours... like the two of you. Don't be ours because you don't want to lose track of your kids because sometimes even teenagers can lose track of kids. You want to periodically check on everybody. That's how you should always be 100% of the time. Maybe check on them every 30 minutes or so.\n  \n  And then if sometimes you want to go on a date, get you a babysitter and make sure it's someone you trust. Or get the older children to watch the younger but make sure they're the right age. You don't want to leave 8 year old watching little young kids. You want your kids to at least be the age of 14 or 15 or something to watch younger kids and don't be gone for too long and make sure they have a back up & a trusted neighbor maybe to know that they're home alone and your number on speed dial and make sure you keep an eye on your phone.

As I was growing up that's what I was always taught to do, one to respect. It's a respect thing and then just to avoid conflict and starting so much unnecessary drama. When you could just let it be. Also knowing how to socialize with any kind of person is nice and respectful and just looks good on you. I guess more or less it's just how you look. You don't want to seem like an ashhole. You want to seem like someone nice to talk to you. And it's not that you're sugar-coating anything or just being a sissy about it all it's more or less a respect thing. To get respect you must give it. A big lesson in life that we must all learn. Plus if they're not hurting anyone with their beliefs then I don't really understand what's the point of taking the energy out to be ugly or violent or just not accept them if they're not doing anything wrong to you. Something life-changing or threatening. I let them do them and I'll let me do what I want to.\n  \n  Even if you don't accept them just keep quiet about it and keep your words to yourself. Just treat them like a normal person and until they start shoving their beliefs on you then that's when you have every right to defend yourself. Especially if they start touching you. Your personal space is yours and no one else's. People are not always going to be accepted. And those types of people are going to have to understand that. This is the kind of world we live in.\n  ","35199":"\n  Me? One time I was bartending or I was talking about bartending or I was in a bar and someone was like you look like you're 10.

I just thought that was hilarious and it was a funny experience. Just great.\n  ","35322":"\n  I wake up the same time I'm always have before of quarantine. Nothing really has changed much for me during this quarantine. I live out in the countryside so we're kind of just used to being quarantine and away from people but we still have people out here and people that come and visit but we're just used to being out here in nature and relaxing all the time. Lol\n  ","35323":"\n  I love dark chocolate.\n  \n  And absolutely. Dark chocolate is so good for you of course in portions.\n  ","35324":"\n  I don't mind drinking water, even TAP sometimes.. but you need to be careful on what you drink. I took a class on this in school. How water is process, purified(cleaned) and then where it comes from. What they do to get that water. And in the process that it takes from the sky, to the ground, in humans and then of course... the cycle goes on and on. We really need to be careful with what we drink because honestly there's different types of bacteria, toxins, pesticides and even acid that can be in the water at times. Some are more rare than others found in water but especially in your TAP. TAP water is completely unexpected. One day you can have a ton of bacteria in it and the next day it could be near to clean. That's why it is usually better just to make sure that you try to boil the water ot maybe checking the news on what's in the water that day. Being from cities and towns, this is what we had to do growing up because sometimes our water... would be contaminated and it wasn't drinkable and you had to boil your water at times. Or you had to go to the store and buy some distilled water or order big old gallons of water that you could drink out of. Eventually that water will catch up to you that contaminated water and it can make you sick. Sometimes immediately and sometimes it takes a couple days and it can get to you. It's not all mostly a huge deal but at the same time you don't want to be drinking some kind of bacteria to water that's going to make you have some sort of a disease or make you sick. I've always been aware of what I'm drinking in the water or at least try. Try to boil my water. I do that even today. Have always followed this. You should take some time to research this yourself. It's quite intriguing actually. You think water is just water until you really find out what the process it goes through.\n  ","35325":"\n  Idk who wrote this. But this is so true. I 100% agree with this because some of my really good friends have found themselves a girl and every now and then I get one... like one of their girls don't want them to hang out with nobody. I was just talking about this with another friend. I think it's funny that some of these girls don't want their men hanging out with other men or other women, NOBODY. You should want them to hang out with other people and be good to them, especially other women, because they have to treat you good at the end of the day and if they're treating other women bad and they're not going to treat you bad at the end of the day? And you want them to be good with other people. You can land really good jobs and make really good friendships with people that way. That's how life works. You supposed to build each other up not break each other down. Especially if you're the same sex. Girl should bring girls up and men should bring men up not break one another down. I totally agree with this. Sorry for your frustration to whoever is causing your rant. But I feel you 100% on this tho. Real statement for sure.

Try to find something that covers your eyes when you go to sleep and get comfortable. Maybe change your sheets. Maybe I just the temperature in the room maybe you're too cold or hot when you go to sleep. Try to work socks. Try not to wear socks.
