otherwise be the same, just less stressful, lol.\n  ","381679":"\n  i would approach them and tell them that they're acting a bit too loudly and it's making me uncomfortable, and for the sake of everyone else (if there are other people around as well), they should lessen the volume of their voice or actions. especially if it's after 10:00pm -- i would want to be considerate of my neighbors.\n

no, i haven't.\n  ","381684":"\n  i would much rather adopt a pet from a shelter -- there's no excuse for not adopting animals, they deserve a home.\n  ","381685":"\n  i usually try to ignore them as

retail or customer service environment, and for some reason they think \"the customer is always right\" even when it comes to things that cashiers\/etc. have no control over, such as pricing, stock, expiration dates, etc etc.\n  \n  honestly, the people who understand these struggles the most are those who are my age and younger because we are the ones who have had to work in long term retail environments and deal with the public on an average basis. there are some older people who understand as well, but i found that most of the complaints came from middle aged to elderly customers.\n

goal.\n  ","381750":"\n  i honestly just re-watch the same movies and television shows over & over again instead of watching new ones, so i have no idea. rofl.\n  ","381751":"\n  boldness -- someone

will not have any children in the future.\n  ","381761":"\n  yes, i used to write a lot of poetry\/stories about the people with whom i was in relationships, as well as other people i liked at the time. most of the time, i never outright told them it was about them, though.\n  ","381762":"\n  money, unfortunately. money can make people do \"evil\" things, but money is also a necessity in today's society.\n  ","381763":"\n  hopefully in the future, i'll be a bit more mentally stable and grow professionally in my career.\n  ","381764":"\n  no. what's in the past is in the past, and

married to a 6 with an amazing personality. when a relationship is as serious as marriage, then it doesn't matter so much how attractive a person is physically as much as they're attractive to you

still dating.\n  ","381814":"\n  all of the random flashbacks i've been having before i go to bed for this past week, ugh. they've literally been coming out of nowhere & there's no connection between any of them, and it's causing me to lose sleep and enter stages of hypervigilance and fear.\n  ","381815":"\n  i don't have any plans for 2021. if the year 2020 has taught me anything, it taught me that the unexpected can always happen and to just go with the flow.\n  ","381816":"\n  abandonment and enclosed spaces.\n  ","381817":"\n  most likely at home in the comfort of my own bed.\n  ","381818":"\n  purple and\/or dark red. they don't necessarily remind me of anything, they're just my favorite colors and they bring me peace.\n  ","381819":"\n  i'm anything but classy, LOL. when i think of classy people, i normally envision others who are dressed nicely, always prim and proper, people who seldom curse or do anything inappropriate, etc etc.\n  ","381820":"\n  eh, mostly downs, tbh. i've gone through a few depressive episodes that lasted anywhere between a few days to a few weeks, and then a few hypomanic episodes in between.\n  \n  2020 has been rough on everyone's mental health, so i wasn't really surprised when my mood swings started acting up again.\n  ","381821":"\n  yeah, i get a lot of shout outs that just say \"hi\" or are self-promotions of their answers or anything else. i just delete them at this point.\n  ","381822":"\n  i used to use tinder, but i never actually met someone and went on a date with a person from tinder (or any other dating site).\n

","381831":"\n  i honestly have zero idea. probably leggings, a sweater, and boots since it's supposed to be cold outside.\n  ","381832":"\n  there's one or two people whom i hate, but the reasons differ for each person. it isn't something i really want to delve into.\n  ","381833":"\n  mental health, such as education on various disorders and awareness in general of the stigma associated with such disorders and mental health as a whole.\n  ","381834":"\n  uh, genetics? rofl.\n  ","381835":"\n  i used to, but not really these days.\n  ","381836":"\n  a memory came up for me on facebook from 7 years ago where i was published for the very first time !!\n  ","381837":"\n  it matters to a certain extent, although it isn't so much money itself as it is that person having the drive to be financially independent (if that makes sense).\n  \n  i'm at a stage of my life where i'd potentially want someone who is financially independent, has a job, and is basically working towards supporting themselves. if a person has no motivation to find a job and support themselves at my age, then that isn't something i'm interested in.\n  ","381838":"\n  i totally do. that doesn't mean i refuse to buy gifts for people this time of year, though. half of the fun is watching others open their gifts and find them to be amusing\/awesome\/etc. i'm excited for my roommate to open his gifts \u2014 his cousin, girlfriend, and i chipped in to get him a nintendo switch and a few games, so i can't wait to see his reaction.\n  ","381839":"\n  i'm not lying. i don't think i'm an attractive person.\n  ","381840":"\n  some random dude on tinder messaged me and was like, \"how about you and me raw dog it with some blunts while forensic files plays in the background?\"\n  \n  i was like, \"uh... no thanks?\" that was definitely the weirdest message i had ever received, rofl. then there was another guy who kept sending me his poetry that legit sounded like emo teenage poetry from the 2000s.\n  ","381841":"\n  writing, playing video games, watching television, painting\/drawing, photography, and reading (sometimes).\n  ","381842":"\n  i have friends with disabilities, but i'm not friends with them *because* they're disabled. i'm friends with them because they're terrific human beings.\n  ","381843":"\n  because my parents asked me what i wanted & those are the only things i could think of that i haven't already bought myself, rofl.\n  \n  christmas is most definitely a capitalist\/commercialized holiday, without a doubt, but it's become normalized at this point.\n  ","381844":"\n  yes, my supervisor is a blessing and she's always been there for me whenever i'm confused, overwhelmed, or have a question. she definitely makes my job easier when i can't figure out how to move forward.\n  ","381845":"\n  when i enter a manic episode, lmaoo.\n  \n  other than that, when i'm drunk and\/or high.\n  ","381846":"\n  the only things i asked for were the set of the

not really.\n  ","381852":"\n  the most relaxing place i've ever been has either been in upstate new york, amid the trees and mountains, or northern pennsylvania, which is where i went when i went camping a few months ago. anywhere in nature is relaxing to me.\n  \n  i don't really have a happy place outside of my comfort zone, because well... it's outside of my comfort zone, lol.\n

they're mentally ill, lol.\n  ","381861":"\n  that isn't a good therapist if they insist that you should continue seeing them against your own wishes. in that case, i'd honestly be stern with them and tell them flat out \"our sessions are done. i'm seeking someone else,\" and then don't return.\n  \n  likewise, if they're employed through an agency like a counseling center instead of privately, you can also call the agency and tell them you'd like to stop seeing that therapist.\n  ","381862":"\n  both, although in that circumstance askfm probably deleted it themselves. askfm tracks posts that use inappropriate \"buzzwords\" and they take them down within a matter of minutes to hours.\n  ","381863":"\n  i've been working since 9:00am, lol. my day has been relatively busy & productive, but

chop sticks, although i mostly use them to eat sushi. as for advice, i'd say just practice !! start with larger items and then slowly move onto smaller items.\n  ","381876":"\n  the only online games
