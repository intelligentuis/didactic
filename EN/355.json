inside of me . sorry , i had to .","329258":"i don t think so . i m assuming you mean cutting ties with a friend after confronting them about it . whatever the reason be .","329259":"i used a spanish translator and it gave me how quickly do you fall in love ? i don t know the answer to that question , i think i fall in love quickly , but that s also based on my experiences where there a ton of interaction and so that probably speed the process up . talking about when there s mutual romantic interest feelings and you are seeing them . i think if i took things slow , i would fall in love at a more average rate . then again , i don t know what the average rate is .","329260":"a journey .","329261":"i don t think i had a hero or idolized anyone in my childhood . same for today . there are people i admire , several that i do and don t know . maybe that s why i don t have a lot of direction in life , i don t have someone or one person that i want to be like and follow in the steps of . not that i m complaining , i feel like that would be restricting . maybe it doesn t feel that way from he inside though .","329262":"the furthest i ve gone is about miles geographic distance , in terms of actions , i can go pretty far , but if i can t sense that it is mutual then i ll shut down . if i just simply don t sense whether it is or isn t mutual , unsure , then i won t go nearly as far either . i m not sure how i feel about the concept of love though , i m almost a different person when i m in love . by that i don t mean my personality , just certain things change in terms of what i want and i take a lot more risks . i guess depending on whether you look at it in a good or bad light you could say passionate or unreasonable . it s probably the same for everyone , i m just not sure how i feel about it . it feels good , but on the other hand there are certain things in my mind that change that when i m not in love i see differently and feel is the right way to see it .","329263":"a festival centered around the holiday of halloween i guess ? spooky scary skeletons and all .","329264":"i don t know that one is more important or reaps more benefits than the other . i suppose loving someone feels better , but not as much when they don t care about you , right ?","329265":"i don t have a single favorite song same for genre . i ve been loving billie eilish stuff like lonely and bad guy . guilty pleasure or one of them being ava max , so am i and salt as examples . i love her hair too .","329266":"no , i wish . i m trying to get to such a place .","329267":"in terms of it being on purpose and not assumed i would say it is because they felt they were not in the wrong , because they disagree that it was wrong , or they just don t want to admit they were in the wrong as it would hurt their pride or make them feel less significant shorter . there s also a chance they think it is just assumed depending on the circumstances . i ll sometimes not say it , but also say it indirectly and express it . there s also times i just forget or don t think to say it .","329268":"i don t know , at least more assuming i make it to an elderly age .","329269":"that s a tough one , the pros and cons are about even . i ll say doritos , but cheese puffs i would say has both of them beat .","329270":"i don t know , i don t have places i go to in order to meet friends . if i did do such things , it would probably be places like games enchantments or conventions where the subject is an interest i have . i do go to such places , just not for that reason .","329271":"happiness isn t a goal , happiness is a treat on the journey . you can t predict it and the more you expect it , the less you get of it . i would be happy in life not stressing about where i should be when , and not thinking i want need stuff that i want just because i don t have it . how would i be happy ? the most reliable answer is by putting my all in and seeking to make others happy .","329272":"my computer , my phone , my bed , my fridge , and my car . in terms of possessions , i can do the most with those . i don t have a lifetime supply of good food in my possession or anything of that sort . i also assumed the setting would be modern day and nothing else has changed as well as my placement geographically . access to the internet , phone service , electricity , gas , and so on are not possessions , so i couldn t list them anyway .","329273":"maybe sight , because i love aesthetics , colors , patterns , and to create such things . also because my hearing isn t what it used to be , i would rate hearing as my number two , especially with music and other pleasant or enjoyable sounds , taste is somewhere after and smell might be in last place it is also my worst sense as far as i know . i m not sure where i would put touch , i know it increases the release of oxytocin and prolongs life as well as functioning life . well , when between humans anyway , or other similar beings . then there s also that i would rate touch as my number one love language or at least at the top . however , it doesn t do anything for me artistically or creatively . it could inspire creativity , but it s not as much an expression of creativity i mean not that it isn t or can t be , just not to as high an extent for me . i know it would be above smell for sure , i d say above taste as well . when it comes to auditory and visual stimulus nothing can top the visual part . i might tie it with the sense of hearing or put it a bit above it . yes , i can still imagine sounds and sights after losing those senses , but imagining isn t the same because you will never hear or see anything new and you ll forget details of things you have seen and heard as time goes by at least for most things . plus for sight it would mean i couldn t really draw or design visuals and create digital art anymore , not in the way i enjoy doing such things anyway . it would also make a lot of things impossible that i enjoy doing as well , not just robbing my of aesthetics and things i would enjoy seeing alone . i d say the sense of touch provides the realest experience to me , i don t know how to express why that is the case at least not yet , i ve never thought about it . part of it is that i don t really experience touch in dreams , not like i do with the other senses .","329274":"sleeping relaxing in my own bed , using things that i didn t bring with me , loved ones , and that s about it .","329275":"taz . i say things for my own amusement .","329276":"i appreciate the positive feelings , i don t really have any specific thoughts on groups of people that i don t know though . i mean , in not great at reading when someone has a crush , partly because i reallt don t like to assume i imagine . reason why i don t like to assume is because i imagine it from the other side if it was a bad assumption . someone thinks you like them or want to talk to them for such reasons , things of that nature . this is why i rarely approach women , because heterosexual attraction is the norm and it is often seen as interest or flirting when someone of the opposite sex initiatiates interaction , especially if they seem interested in talking . this doesn t mean i never initiate conversation or interaction with the opposite sex , but only when it s automatic or seems a natural occurrence or follow up to something that happened . also of course if it is someone i am already acquainted with .","329277":"i don t believe in such a thing as a real man just as i don t for the term a real woman . people crying in general tends to make me uncomfortable because i feel bad for them and more so if i don t know how to effort them or am not close enough to possibly know . that doesn t mean i think anyone should hold it back . i resent that i don t know how not to hold it back because it s become an ingrained habit i guess . can t remember how to let go i m sure i did when i was a baby and up to kindergarten possibly . happy crying doesn t make me uncomfortable of course .","329278":"to jump off a skyscraper yes i technically could do this , but i don t want the end result , just the experience , to live as long as i want without aging , to be able to easily switch between bodies of each binary sex , to be able to both spend almost all of my time by myself and also spend almost all of my time with loved ones , friends , and love interests . the list goes on . . .","329279":"i can follow directions and i can cook well what i have cooked at least a few times .","329280":"make someone s day better . it might sound like a simple answer , but it makes sense if you think about it . ideally it would in turn also make you feel better and it would likely lead to both of you doing more good things after feeling better in a sense .","329281":"to immerse yourself in it , go where they speak and write it if possible . otherwise try to communicate with others that know it . of course in addition to some traditional learning to help you along , like memorizing terms and learning grammar . learning patterns in things really helps you remember things too .","329282":"visited my brothers in cali , steam summer sale , and coming up is a convention .","329283":"either thinking up creations or direction for creations , things i need to do , or thinking things through what would lead to what , what would be a good idea or bad idea .","329284":"i haven t spent any money today , should probably buy gas soon . yesterday i bought dark souls iii on steam because it was off .","329285":"whichever it would be . neither because i don t care for carbonated drinks , but if i had to choose , fanta . by land if it s close enough . mind or beauty in what sense ? someone can have a beautiful mind and mindful beauty . house , you can rent houses too . black ! banana ! dolphins for their intelligence . am i an angel or a demon or which do i prefer in some sense ? i m probably closer to the former by most people s opinion , but my preference is demon creatively artistically . why can t i choose snowy ? sunny and cloudy are about even in my mind with pros , cons , and aesthetic . i ll pass on that , the only two i m following right now are two old friends that haven t been on here in ages plus i m not into copypastas . i debated whether to even answer and did because it means someone follows me assuming they followed the rule .","329286":"there s a victoria s secret show ? i was unaware .","329287":"i don t know , only had a brief visit to my hometown several years ago . chillicothe isn t my hometown . i have memories here , but my formative years were in columbus . was there from my toddler days into my very early teenage years .","329288":"i d say best bet is to get a professional service . exterminators , basically . i ve never had them , but that s what i know a friend did in the past .","329289":"i don t know . copycat by billie ?","329290":"i don t have any pets . probably fish , lizards , or arthropods . cats are cool .","329291":"being outside in this weather , my god .","329292":"we had a swingset in our backyard in columbus . so many memories there .","329293":"pain , arthropods , and gender bending .","329294":"no , not really .","329295":"people , so it isn t deserted , or at least someone . if that isn t allowed , then tools to help me create . if survival is a problem then a machete , fire starter , and a large pot for boiling .","329296":"more quiet i guess .","329297":"by stopping time so i stop aging . too wishful ? then with loved ones .","329298":"no idea at all . i like the holidays , but not for the decorations .","329299":"i m not much of a collector , at least in terms of physical things . probably because i don t have tons of physical space to store things . there probably is something and it s not coming to mind , i imagine . i collect games on steam and champions in league of legends i own them all now though and have for a while ."}}
