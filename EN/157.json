I learned to apply it from some old-fashioned books geared towards young ladies in the 60s that an old neighbor of mine gave me. They taught basic application and hair styles and grooming and date etiquette and all sorts of weird, sexist, but occasionally useful things. From there, it's just years of practice. These past few years are the first years in my life it's ever been popular to fill in eyebrows like it is now, so I had to learn how to use an eyebrow kit recently and I did so by trial and error.\n  ","168724":"\n  I made myself get up and exercise for 20 min which wasn't a lot but it at least eased the feeling of hopelessness a bit.

She does not trust new people and will even try to bite some people if she deems them too aggressive. She jumped on my friend Kate's shoulder once and gave her kisses but we think that's because Kate was wearing a scarf I knitted because normally she won't even tolerate Kate's hand for a treat of millet. I am trying to socialize her more to my husband and guests but she's really just a very antisocial baby when it comes to humans. Now cats, she likes. She wants to get closer to any cat she sees.\n  ","168726":"\n  none, it's a regular day for me.

My husband took me to the aquarium in Oregon a few birthdays ago, that was nice.

I don't really have a goal in mind. I gained about 15 lbs beginning two years ago when I had my appendix removed because since that point I've had medical issues after medical issues and haven't been able to exercise. I have plenty more to lose after that should I continue with it but I'm not pushing weight loss so much as just being healthy again.

The Summer will be more active for me for sure I like to go on hikes and long walks in the sun\n  ","168745":"\n  I don't know.

It doesn't seem like a thing that happens but I guess it does.\n  ","168746":"\n  I prefer to talk through it if I care enough.

I would assume that there are different reasons for things of an evil nature just like there are different reasons for actions otherwise. I would rather not believe that shitty behaviour started because someone thought it was the right thing to do\n  ","168749":"\n  I couldn't say what I like most, I like everything. I like the pretty colored water, and the transformation of the water as the bomb is first dropped; I like the perfumes and skin moisturizers and I like just relaxing listening to the fizzing sound and smelling the pretty smells.\n  ","168750":"\n  I'd say I'm the same, I have a pretty strong personality so it's hard to mask it or even dilute it sometimes. The only difference is probably how anxious I am in real life. I mean, I'm anxious all the time and online as well but it's major in person.\n  ","168751":"\n  I couldn't say.

Seems like everyone I talk to of any gender has similar dream types- flying, for instance, or being in school again, or various types of anxiety dreams- and those are for anyone of any gender.

I'm going to shame any kink that gets in my face and I don't feel bad about that at all. Someone has something gross and forward to say about my feet on insta or whatever they are getting shamed.

I just haven't kept up on it on my own. I know what my friends are doing and I have a few artists I like here and there but I don't have as much as a book knowledge about art anymore.\n  \n  My favorite period in art was in Europe between the two world wars- expressionism, dada, surrealism, cubism, all of these flourished during that time\n  ","168769":"\n  I'm sure I'll be depressed about it but I doubt I'll take it out on those around me.

It has really clear instructions and diagrams for beginners as well as some cool beginner patterns.

My personal opinion is that he's having a mid-life crisis (his 40th birthday was recently) and is taking it out on me a little (a lot). I've done everything in my power to improve on the things he complained of but it's just not enough and I'm not really sure what his deal is. I had no complaints about us before he asked for couples counseling.\n  ","168773":"\n  I've taught drawing privately, and in college I taught a printmaking class focussed on acid bite etching so I guess either of those things could be taught by me again. Maybe art history as long as it's not dealing with contemporary artists. I can teach someone how to knit but it's not easy because I'm left-handed and everyone who's come to me to learn how has been a rightie. How to cook- I'm teaching my husband to cook and he's doing pretty well. I don't think I've taught anything else, at least not that I can think of now. I could teach people about the birds in my area. How to load a bong for best results. how to make big poofy bows out of ribbon. How to do eye makeup. How to use Procreate as an art tool on an iPad.

He even made a life-sized DOLL of her later in his life. Total weirdo.\n  ","168777":"\n  I guess if it's against family or society's wishes, I dunno.

It became something that we were kinda known for there and the regulars would yell \"sex!\" with us after a while. I still think about that everytime I get an opportunity to play Mrs. Pacman.

Friendships just sort of happen organically- you meet someone, you click, you keep making plans to talk to that person again because their company is fun and not stressful. People can be my friend by talking to me and seeing where it goes- if I warm up eventually then I'm finding you to be a friend. It takes me a long time to be comfortable with someone and I don't always click with people so maybe it is hard to earn with me, I don't know.\n  ","168915":"\n  I lived in Massachusetts for a while in college, in an apartment building in an area that had originally been part of Salem which as most know has a long and spooky history. Many of the houses around us were built in the late 1600s or roundabouts. One holiday weekend when everyone was out of the building (except for me, one RA and a handful of other students who couldn't or didn't travel home for long weekends) shit got weird.\n  \n  It started with me sitting in my living room on a winter day, windows closed and heat on as one does. I was chain smoking and listening to music while doing homework. After getting up to get a soda, I noticed a smell. a strong, dangerous smell- linseed oil. Across the apartment somehow my roommate's oil painting supplies had upturned on their own and soaked half of the floor. The fumes were unbearable and as I ran to the window to open it, all four burners of our gas stove came on by themselves. There could have been an explosion if I hadn't acted so fast I'm sure of it or at least a fire.\n  \n  I got things as clean and operational as possible, sat down on the sofa to rest, and noticed that the curtains in my bedroom were waving wildly, standing almost straight out- with a closed window. As I went down the short hallway to investigate, the door slammed in my face and I decided that this was enough I wasn't playing with ghosts anymore. I started yelling that I wasn't scared (I was) and that this was MY home and they needed to leave. As a response, every light in the house turned off.\n  \n  I walked around, terrified, turning each light back on one by one while talking a big game about being not scared and demanding I be left alone. The last lamp refused to turn on. I felt like every hair on my body was standing up, I didn't feel safe, so I went downstairs to ask my RA to come up and tell me I was imagining things.\n  \n  When he got there, the bedroom doors were open and the windows were closed and all of the lights were on. However, as he walked towards the hallway, the curtains did the thing again and the door closed again and he noped out and took me back to his place for the night until he could get his friend who was a witch to come over and cleanse the place the next day.\n  \n  We didn't have any other problems past that other than one of my roommates swearing she could hear voices in the walls.\n  ","168916":"\n  thank you :) I was snowed in most of my birthday so I sat at home until late afternoon when my husband kindly dug out the car and scraped the driveway so we could at least get out for dinner.

It's postponed until next weekend now.\n  ","168917":"\n  it really does taste like chicken.\n  ","168918":"\n  the part that gets so hurt so easily. Yesterday was my birthday and only 7% of the people on my facebook bothered to say anything despite having had to clear a notification stating it was my birthday and I feel so hurt by it and it's so silly but I really truly feel wounded. I was really popular in high school and college and it's been hard as an adult to watch those people dwindle away. I don't think I'm a bad friend but maybe I am.

The artist sets the price but the default setting and what most people keep it around is 20% so you have to sell a substantial amount to see real profit but for me it's just been great watching stickers get bought\/knowing people wanted a little piece of my art the 20 cents doesn't matter as much as the good feels\n  ","168925":"\n  moto x\n  ","168926":"\n  I don't feel American with this orange asshole as Pres-elect I can't answer this question\n  ","168927":"\n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x2Kwos_oWSc\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","168928":"\n  squishing down my unpleasant feelings\n  ","168929":"\n  I want to create a larger body of art.

We're expecting some snow this afternoon so we can be like the rest of the country. The most snow I have personally experienced was a 2-foot blizzard in MA in 1998.

That led to the flu, which led to appendicitis and surgery. While in there, a surgeon saw something suspicious in my colon, so there was a big cancer scare and a colonoscopy to find out it was just cysts. After that I had a couple of months worry-free but not long after I took a trip across the country to see my family and had my own mother flip out and refuse to see me. From there I had foot surgery twice over, and that resulted in several blood clots forming in my leg and making their way to my lungs so I was hospitalized for pulmonary emboli. After an ultrasound, two more large clots were found in my leg so I have to take awful blood thinner medicine for like, 6 months now.

I tried to ask for help from friends and family but at the time everyone thought he was so fucking charming. I tried to ask for help from the police but they turned me away because his father was a police officer. The only way I got out was by attempting suicide. He knew he did that to me.

I am famous for either coming into a conversation way hard and heavy or else never progressing.\n  ","169488":"\n  Where do white guys get their water?\n  ","169489":"\n  this poem by Gregory Corso has always stuck with me, because it's simple but profound. Everything is relative depending on your own perspective.\n  ","169490":"\n  It has not gone as expected for sure. I thought things would be easier to deal with by now. I started so much healing and moving forward this year but I still have so many setbacks and problems.\n  ","169491":"\n  merchandising asst. manager for Tamarack:The Best of West Virginia, which is this HUUUUGE state-run artisan showcase for West VA craftspeople and artisans in Beckley, WV. Basically, I ran around making beautiful displays of product all day everyday. It was HARD WORK and extremely taxing on my body but when I was able to do that, it was what I was meant to do. Previous to this job, I had done window dressing in Beverly, MA and the two jobs together were probably the most happy I've ever been while employed.\n  ","169492":"\n  Here it is. Need dirt. We'll have tomatoes cucumber pumpkin and watermelon\n  ","169493":"\n  Some people value what they produce more than what they contain\n  ","169494":"\n  death before I'm ready\n  ","169495":"\n  I don't  have good dreams. I have weird recurring dreams about the same settings over and over with similar plots. Usually I'm just trying to get through the dream without causing any problems but sometimes there are scientists who chase me to try to take me to their underground labs.\n  ","169496":"\n  ask for psychological help\n  ","169497":"\n  feeling healthy\n  ","169498":"\n  Truthfully and quickly before things progress. However, it makes me angry that I still have to do so with anyone because I've been married for over 12 years and it's ridiculous how many white boys still try to chat me up. I'm 36 and not very friendly so it's just not welcome. So I don't always go the \"best\" way. Sometimes I go with the \"leave me the fuck alone who do you even think you are\" way.\n  ","169499":"\n  I've had the most nightmares\/paranoia after watching the Shining, the first Paranormal activity, and the original Exorcist than any other horror movies. I saw the Shining and Exorcist as a small child though, so they seemed so much worse to me then than they do now.\n  ","169500":"\n  I remember watching Soul Train as a kid and dancing along\n  ","169501":"\n  I'd just change my name to Miss Andrea Plenty. Would also work for roller derby.\n  ","169502":"\n  (psst I dunno if you're aware or not but this isn't a question)\n  ","169503":"\n  Siddhartha taught me to go my own way, but to keep in mind that no destination will \"fix\" me until I can accept everything as it is, truly.\n  \n  Things Fall Apart taught me that White Christians and the Western World are destructive and gave me a different viewpoint on the world.\n  \n  The Velveteen Rabbit taught me that being loved and being loving are what makes life meaningful\n  \n  The Idiot taught me about the limits of willpower and faith\n  \n  Nine Stories taught me about desperation\n  \n  I can't think of any other books right now I'm wicked high.\n  ","169504":"\n  it would be really nice to take a tropical (or any sort, really) cruise again but this time with my husband instead of my family\n  ","169505":"\n  what is the @ thing I am confused and old\n  \n  thank you for following Leigh I appreciate your warm-heartedness and intelligence\n  ","169506":"\n  it's hard to describe, it's just a gut feeling. When I meet someone, I get a wave of energy from them and generally my interpretation of that energy seems fairly accurate despite what happens in the first few meetings. There have been times I've suppressed my initial feelings and become close to someone anyway and it's been really bad in all cases.\n  \n  Sometimes I feel warned by someone, but still feel like they're a good person. Then I have to decide if their strengths and weaknesses that they show on getting to know them farther outweigh the warning.\n  ","169507":"\n  I tend to grey area, for sure. Most alignment quizzes I've taken set me as either true neutral or neutral good.\n  ","169508":"\n  pooping\n  ","169509":"\n  As long as someone is clean and happy with their scent- natural or perfumed- I'm good with that. When I'm attracted to someone I'm interested in hat scents they choose but I tend to like their personal, natural scent just fine. For myself, I like to use a perfume or scented products often but lightly.\n  ","169510":"\n  I don't go out of my way to destroy the planet but past recycling cans I'm not being super pro-active either.\n  ","169511":"\n  it would be nice to know a little about lots of things for social reasons I guess but I'm not a white dude and I have no need to mansplain a billion topics to others so I'd rather learn one thing really well I think. I'm good at art, maybe I would like to instead master it.\n  ","169512":"\n  I wouldn't make anyone accept anything. Too many times have I tried to change people's opinions in my favor only to have it blow up on me. If it was someone who wanted my affection and reciprocated caring and affection but just didn't have the self-esteem to accept that they were worthy of care, then I'd just be patient. Over time, with my steady caring and support, they will maybe see that they are indeed worthy of my love.\n  ","169513":"\n  Sincerity. Remorse. I do but it depends on the offense. Some things are too big to forget, and maybe they can be forgiven some day but they take more time than smaller things.\n  ","169514":"\n  Honestly it's an instinctual thing for me. Some people just put off a try-hard or faker vibe, some people put off an energy that lets you know they're smarter than they're letting on. I just let everyone sort themselves out without worrying about it too much, people's true colors always show eventually.\n  ","169515":"\n  \"I'm Han Solo\" from Star Wars Kinect and it was so ridiculous that I only got 3 stars because I kept laughing instead of dancing.\n  ","169516":"\n  I don't think this is a normal trait. The only people I've known in my life to idolize others have personality disorders. I used to love that feeling- being idolized- but the heartache from the fall from my pedestal each time was enough to make me wary of it. I've had too many abusive \"friends\" do this.\n  ","169517":"\n  I answer just about everything unless it's a private message, isn't a question, is spam, or is really offensive (in that case I usually report)\n  ","169518":"\n  1. Mad Max: Fury Road\n  \n  2. being in my highchair at my paternal grandmother's house before she passed asking for breakfast while she cooked and being told \"Hold yer horses!\" and thinking that was the funniest and best thing I'd ever heard.\n  \n  3. Great horned owl\n  \n  4. well-restedness\n  \n  5. that my husband and I could find a way to afford a nice house so I can get out of these gross noisy apartments\n  \n  6. survival\n  \n  7. continue surviving\n  \n  8. Demian by Hesse\n  \n  9. overall, probably The Pixies\n  \n  10. cheeseburgers\n  ","169519":"\n  I didn't clean out the wild bird feeders this month like I should have oops\n  ","169520":"\n  Isn't that just reading comprehension and interpretation basically? Isn't it already taught? It was when I was in school, we certainly broke down lots of books in this way, everything from the bible to Shakespeare to modern novels.\n  ","169521":"\n  I've never heard of opsins but I suspect I'm a tetrachromat because I seem to have colors I don't have words for that I can see between green and blue and between red and purple.\n  ","169522":"\n  how to respond\n  ","169523":"\n  if this is song lyrics it's kinda weird\n  \n  what if I don't like almond milk or sugary cereal\n  ","169524":"\n  Answering my own question:\n  \n  I feel like Tina Belcher a lot, but in reality I'm more like her mother Linda and aunt Gayle combined together.\n  ","169525":"\n  Where my maternal grandparents grew up in the Appalachian mountains, a \"holler\" is a valley so there were neighborhoods with names like \"Hoo Hoo Holla\"\n  ","169526":"\n  I am many things, but Asian isn't any of those things\n  ","169527":"\n  *poof* you've been pnished. You are now a Pnish.\n  ","169528":"\n  did you know I'm a 36 year old who is not a parent? I don't care about homework, or child punishment methods, or any of the typical \"mommy\" questions. There are plenty of others who'll care more about these topics than I.\n  ","169529":"\n  I have low tolerance for human interaction, period.\n  \n  but yeah, I don't take disrespect lightly, and have a bit of a temper\n  ","169530":"\n  nope\n  ","169531":"\n  as punishment to a child, yes\n  ","169532":"\n  I could be better, but I could be worse.\n  ","169533":"\n  I realllllly want to see the aurora borealis but the very few times that there were storms big enough to be seen where I live, it's been overcast or raining. I hope to travel North to see them easier one day.\n  "}}
