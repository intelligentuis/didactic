mitt romney is under that list . . youre here right now , are the government agents going to track me next ?","222975":"come off educated you came off a complete fool who thinks the feds are on him for posting a mitt romney picture on youtube . nothing you said made me rethink anything on any of these topics . . sounds like half of it you did some vague research on biased outlets and the other half you believe the news","222976":"well it doesn t seem like you re too informed on global politics to understand why he hasn t brought the troops back . . the real topics been brought up very vaguely and the ones who do bring it up are silenced or fired . but he has brought some back and is pulling out of afghanistan finally .","222977":"thats great you ruined a presidential candidates career , that doesn t really solidify anything for the government hating your family . . if anything just republicans . . all the big industries favor dems anyways . the real people doing the real work exposing things fled the country or are in prison . .","222978":"you re trying to come off as some huge whistle blower . you aren t it seems . you keep citing youtube even though its heavily

point is , what significance does that hold ?","222980":"how am i avoiding the issue ? you re bringing up hillary and romney to brag it seems like","222981":"if youre a man of god . this lgbtq thing is out of hand and quite frankly bizarre .","222982":"yeah for epstein not trump .","222983":"what does that have to do with anything . you didn t leak anything on the emails . the person who did is still in prison . . just do your research on this stuff","222984":"you exposed nothing on them . you repeated what the news told you . watching youtube conspiracies that hold no concrete evidence doesn t make you a pro","222985":"yeah i m sure your family is , i m calling your bluff on that based off what youre saying in this thread alone . stop speaking for your family and just showthe evidence behind your claims if you want me to believe you","222986":"like i said there s only a party picture of him and his wife because they did property deals . epsteins cover was real estate so its only natural he works with big names to ensure his cover . . and no it doesn t make it top three or even top , how old are you if i may ask ?","222987":"history will lie and tell you democrats didn t start the kkk also . . but they did that . .","222988":"what connection other than a picture from the early s does trump have to epstein ? dont say flight logs because that s not true either .","222989":"they weren t debunked they where covered up by whatever media you refer to for answers because their is video of it . . do you do any research for your initial research ? in response to bidens kkk friend","222990":"i wish you where right but china is still getting away with it so it doesn t matter about social media , if awareness is brought and no action is done its pointless then . biden called trump racist for closing china s flights during a pandemic , during a time we didnt know the sereveness of it","222991":"the picture of trump his wife and epstein are at a party because he had a business deal for some property . . didnt biden say rape victims deserve to be believed ? then he gets called out and there is little coverage for some days","222992":"spanish flu killed an estimated million . .","222993":"well your step dad should look harder because he would find that joe biden has ties to actual kkk members in s . thats factual he spoke at ones funeral . .","222994":"thats besides the point though . we have facts in our faces , doctors being covered up and silenced , with gag orders , think about that for a second . . we have been scared into thinking it is a plague","222995":"and wrong . . biden passed a bill he helped right in fact . . to make it so that african americans are more likely to be arrested and he made tons of money off of it with private prisons , even kamala , his running mate called him out for this in previous debates . now theyre best friends . and i m the fool","222996":"oh and who told you this was the worst thing next to the plague , its far from the plague . . the news did its job in scaring you . this is a flu and it was altered in a lab . proven by hong kong scientists . . research it . .","222997":"also his disinfectant thing was a joke . the cdc says you have a percent recovery rate from the virus . its time to open up . this is a trial run for socialism . look at history","222998":"joe biden has rape allegations too . whats your point ?","222999":"obama made those cages at the border and used them more than he did , trump used them because a caravan traveling for months on end was trying to enter america illegally and they where processed there . i agree some of it is a mess with the missing children its terrible , and ices fault . not trumps","223000":"you re right because when joe was in office he passed bills to make african americans more likely to be arrested than any other race , also the evidence of his business deals in ukraine are damning and speak for themselves but you won t find any of that on traditional news because they favor biden","223001":"well he didn t avoid every question he s asked","223002":"shoutout to sleepy joe dodging all the allegations and questions once
