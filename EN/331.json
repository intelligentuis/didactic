and dark maroon .","306216":"my wardrobe tends to be filled with black , grey , army green , maroon , and brown .","306217":"anyone have any questions ? ? my inbox is empty","306218":"i never really understood that . there are environmentally safe deodorants and natural ones that are great to use and prevent you from smelling .","306219":"i have one friend who either doesn t wear it or it just isn t strong enough for her , but she smells all the time . i ve gotten used to it at this point , but i m surprised she doesn t smell herself because i can always smell if my armpits are even remotely smelly .","306220":"if they don t smell , then i don t really see the big deal . however , if they do have body odor , then they probably should start wearing some sort of deodorant .","306221":"i m always concerned about my own hygiene , rofl . i m terrified of smelling badly , it s one of my worst fears .","306222":"i m fairly certain that s something people don t consciously

eight years .","306230":"idk what kind of lasagna you re making , but there s plenty of cheese in my lasagna .","306231":"there s not much to elaborate on . i ve never felt like a girl nor have i ever felt like a boy . my gender doesn t match my physical appearance , and i constantly experience body dysphoria as a result . i ve always strived to be androgynous , looking like neither a full boy or a full girl but somewhere in between .","306232":"yes , i celebrate all of those holidays .","306233":"genderfluid basically means your gender changes some days you re more comfortable referring yourself and presenting as a girl , while other days you re more comfortable presenting as a boy or somewhere in between . non binary simply means you re not one of the gender binaries , boy or girl . for me personally , i consider myself to be neither because i ve never been a girl nor have i ever been a boy .","306234":"yeah , it was because i developed early when it came to sex characteristics . unfortunately , i do still look feminine in some cases , which is why i still experience body dysphoria . ideally , i would like to be androgynous .","306235":"that has nothing to do with what i m currently talking about . i used to identify as genderfluid until i discovered what non binary meant .","306236":"i m not insecure at all . you just have a blatantly obvious agenda to ridicule or discredit trans non binary people , and i never understood the point of that because people will be their gender regardless of what the opposition believes .","306237":"exactly . even when i was a child , i never considered myself to be a girl because of the horrible body dysphoria i experienced . i still experience it to a degree , but it s moreso something i deal with than anything else .","306238":"i know what a tomboy is . i just don t really see why you re wasting your time posting this because it doesn t change my gender .","306239":"i don t really know what you re trying to achieve here , but regardless , i m still non binary contrary to your views .","306240":"there were probably a few people , but i explained it pretty thoroughly so that there was little room for confusion .","306241":"no . i ve cut people out of my life for a reason , and i have no regrets about any of them .","306242":"yeah , to a certain degree . if a person has toxic traits then it s acceptable to let that person know what they re doing wrong so they can change , but if your partner is trying to change aspects of your personality that aren t problematic , then that may be a red flag .","306243":"my school days are a blur tbh .","306244":"he would be the exception , considering i m already in love with him .","306245":"absolutely . i love him regardless of his gender or how he presents himself .","306246":"yeah , especially when it s my boyfriend and his friends . they re hilarious .","306247":"yeah , i don t generally have an emotional reaction to bad news until hours or days later .","306248":"my day was all right . i worked all day and i ve only been home for two hours . i had a good dinner , though , and now i m watching my boyfriend stream some pubg .","306249":"i ve never tried . i don t have much experience cooking .","306250":"i don t care enough to do something like that .","306251":"eating dinner waiting for my boyfriend to sign onto xbox . i was just checking out the xbox sales .","306252":"i d rather not inflict pain on anyone .","306253":"i ve done it in the past , so no doubt i ll be able to do it again .","306254":"somewhat my job has forced me to become a little bit of a morning person because i have to wake up early for work and focus on assignments early in the morning . i need to be alert , otherwise i ll make mistakes .","306255":"my boyfriend is going to find a way to stream pubg with his friends tonight , so i ll be able to watch them ! ! i hope he can figure it out , since i m pretty sure xbox has that mixer thing that allows you to stream with your friends . i haven t seen him play with his friends in a long time they re always hilarious together .","306256":"i ve only ended one relationship , and it was on okay terms we didn t stay friends or anything afterwards , but we also didn t hold any animosity toward each other .","306257":"it s completely normal for you to want closure . however , i don t think it s a good idea to call him because you might hurt yourself more by doing that if he doesn t answer and ends up completely ignoring you . i m sorry you re going through this , situations like these definitely suck . just try to focus on yourself during these times , do a lot of self care , see your friends , etc etc . you existed before him and you can continue to exist after him .","306258":"yeah , i pretty much like anything that s covered in cheese . lmao .","306259":"yes , of course . my friends problems affect me because i don t like seeing them upset , troubled , angry , etc etc . i try to do what i can to help them .","306260":"hold it together mike shinoda https youtu . be zr bveevsk","306261":"i can understand someone s pronouns changing if they re still traversing the complexities of gender and they don t quite know what gender they are yet , it s experimental and a way to see what they re most comfortable using . but if someone is constantly changing their pronouns with no real reason behind it or to be trendy then i think that s disrespectful to people who are actually trans .","306262":"my baby corycat ! !","306263":"yes , a person s word means everything . if someone says that they ll do something and they don t stick by it , then i start to trust them less and less .","306264":"only when it comes to my boyfriend s attention . i feel uncomfortable when it comes to pretty much everyone else .","306265":"it depends on my mood . sometimes i try different things while other times i m afraid to leave my comfort zone .","306266":"yeah , i was bullied mostly in middle school .","306267":"i went to work , and then i went to dunkin donuts after work . i just got home now .","306268":"what is this even supposed to mean .","306269":"the last time i cried was saturday night . i had a serious talk with my boyfriend regarding certain things going on in my life .","306270":"it s been a good influence on me . i ve learned a lot about various subjects over the years and it helped me realize my passion for mental health awareness .","306271":"i mean . . . i wouldn t consider it to be great , lol . it s a good app if you have some spare time to waste , though .","306272":"no , i m against hunting as a sport .","306273":"no , not really . my routine for getting ready for work in the morning is basically the same every day , but i wouldn t consider it a ritual , lol .","306274":"you re right in that it might give mixed signals . i suppose it all depends on whether or not you want to stay friends with that person . by checking in on them , you might be leading them to think you re still interested , which will hurt them in the long run . i understand the desire to want to see how they re doing , but whether or not it s a good idea really depends on your individual circumstance . i personally wouldn t check up on them , but that s just me .","306275":"i suppose the highlight would be right now i m finally relaxing after a long day at work with some video games a cup of coffee .","306276":"both sound pretty terrible .","306277":"depends on who you choose to follow . some people are more active than others , and if you re active yourself , you re apt to get more questions .","306278":"i work for a publishing company .","306279":"i don t deal with rats considering i don t live in the city .","306280":"my day isn t over yet , considering its only pm . it s been productive so far , though . i ve been at work for the past nearly seven hours so i ve done nothing but write .","306281":"nothing comes to mind . i generally don t experience feelings of desperation .","306282":"i m usually patient unless it s something i really want , lol . but it usually takes less than a week most of the time , so it isn t too terrible . thankfully i ve never had any major issues with ordering online ! !","306283":"it s overcast and around degrees fahrenheit . i definitely didn t dress warm enough for this weather , lol .","306284":"i ve never found the appeal of playing practical jokes on people , even when i was younger .","306285":"i know some people do , but that isn t representative of all americans . both my boyfriend and i own kettles .","306286":"i wouldn t really know , i ve never been in a situation where i had to give someone a pep talk .","306287":"nah , i m not a big fan of chocolate . i have it so rarely that it makes my stomach upset .","306288":"one of my exes is actually my best friend , and i m not sure about my other ex . i haven t spoken to him in years .","306289":"aaaahhh , i didn t know that ! ! it might be easier for me to watch it on hulu , actually . lol .","306290":"well now i m watching something else , but i really love this song . love is a b tch two feet https youtu . be dje gbivzk","306291":"it s a channel on youtube that s hosted by two guys , shane and ryan , and they do everything from discussing conspiracy theories to investigating haunted locations . it s really interesting , as well as hilarious one of the guys is a big skeptic so he doubts everything , and his reactions are so funny .","306292":"i was watching buzzfeed unsolved , and now i m just scrolling through various music videos and listening to music that catches my ear .","306293":"his name is shadow .","306294":"i just have a corycat at the moment . i ve had him for about two years ! !","306295":"i slept over my boyfriend s house last night , so we spent the day just hanging out , watching youtube videos , drinking coffee , talking , and sleeping . he had to go to work in the late afternoon , so i ended up going to the drug store liquor store , as well as starbucks . i helped my mother cook dinner , i did a water change on my fish tank , and then i took a shower . now i m watching various youtube videos and drinking .","306296":"as long as that dream involves me having a bonfire with my boyfriend while drinking some amaretto , sure .","306297":"absolutely . i d rather have a king sized bed than a full sized bed .","306298":"ask them what their ambitions or passions are , if it isn t too personal of course . you can really get to know someone by hearing about their dreams and goals .","306299":"idk why i haven t seen buzzfeed unsolved yet , but i m obsessed with these two now , omggg . y all should ask me some questions","306300":"sounds fine to me .","306301":"of course not , and the best thing to do in any scenario is to politely ask questions . if you re unsure of something when it comes to any sort of issue , whether it s gender or sexuality or whatever , then the best thing you can do is ask so that you know better for the future .","306302":"i can certainly try , depending on what you need help with .","306303":"yeah , some people have the aptitude to change . however , it does certainly take a lot of critical thinking with yourself and coming down to the source of your discrimination .","306304":"depends on whether or not its causing a problem with your work environment . if it s negatively impeding upon your ability to work , then you have the option to bring it up to hr . if it doesn t cause any issues , then i would personally just ignore it . you re at your job to work , not to make friends .","306305":"no doubt there are some people who think they re transgender because of the rampant use of obscure genders on tumblr , but i ve been this way prior to that even becoming a trend . but you can believe whatever you want to believe , it doesn t change who i am .","306306":"if you re disrespecting someone for refusing to acknowledge their pronouns , then congrats , you re transphobic .","306307":"that s basically the same thing as a racist person saying i m not racist because i have a black friend .","306308":"to me personally , art is self expression and a method by which to tell the world your most intimate thoughts and opinions . it s anything from painting , drawing , photography , writing , music , sculpture , etc etc . sometimes art has a meaning , while sometimes it doesn t . sometimes the meaning comes after the artist has purged themselves of the art .","306309":"no , i never have . i m not really big into movies .","306310":"i don t appreciate the ridicule in this message and it makes a mockery out of non binary and trans individuals . regardless , he calls me his girlfriend because i m comfortable with him referring to me as such , especially since i just recently as in , like , last week came out publicly as non binary .","306311":"that s exactly my point , lol . my boyfriend s hair is thinning , so no doubt he ll start balding within the next years .","306312":"i never studied law or criminal justice , so i don t have an answer to this question .","306313":"somewhat , sure . people start balding as they get older , it s just a natural aspect of life and doesn t at all determine the type of person someone is . if you re going to enter a long term relationship , you re going to have to accept the fact that people will get older and start showing signs of age .","306314":"no ? ? i want to spend the rest of my life with him , so obviously i don t care about him going bald . he s already told me that he s shaving his head the second he starts balding anyway .","306315":"perhaps i m just hella reminiscing about my myspace days , but it would be rad if we could feature a song on our profile for our followers to listen to if they wanted .","306316":"no , i don t have any food allergies .","306317":"i have no clue . i don t use them much anymore for that reason , rofl . my family just bought a toaster oven for the first time since we just remodeled the kitchen , so i m hoping this one changes my outlook on them ! !","306318":"there s a stereotype that new yorkers are always loud , rude , and obnoxious . and while that may be true in certain cases , it certainly doesn t define all people who have been born and raised in new york .","306319":"i ve never used one before , so i really have no idea . i ve actually never been in a house that had a garbage disposal .","306320":"interesting ! ! there s one i use at work for toasting bagels and it takes such a long time . my boyfriend also has one of those microwaves that doubles as a toaster oven , and that takes even longer .","306321":"not really at least nothing significant comes to mind . i used to get embarrassed when i was out with my mother and she would make a fuss with cashiers , but since she doesn t go out anymore , i haven t experienced that .","306322":"a toaster oven . idk if it s just the ones i ve personally used , but they take literally forever to bake or toast something . i d much rather use a real toaster or a real oven .","306323":"like most things , it could be genetic but it also could definitely be influenced by your environment and how you grew up . it goes on an individualized basis .","306324":"i honestly have no idea . i have no recollection of my childhood and i ve never thought to ask what kind of baby i was .","306325":"not generally it all depends on who s giving me the compliment and the general vibe i get from them . most compliments make me uncomfortable .","306326":"we re similar , but we re also different . for example , we like the same music and general interests but our personalities are pretty different . i m very introverted , while he knows how to talk to people quite well .","306327":"i had a conversation with the barista at starbucks about hair dye , lol . he complimented my hair and was telling me how his was bright pink , but it faded out within a week .","306328":"? ? ? i don t have opinions on my friends relationships . if they re happy , that s all that matters . cc manicmartyrdom","306329":"i m not a big fan of candy tbh . i like the chilly weather , the changing colors of the leaves , the seasonal drinks , being bundled up in warm clothing , etc etc .","306330":"it wasn t made from an app , it s actually the xbox avatar creator ! ! they updated it for the xbox one a few weeks ago .","306331":"? ? ? that wasn t my argument , but all right . if you read earlier in the thread , i said that poly relationships were more taboo than monogamous relationships and that s why people don t understand them . i said nothing about jealousy in that respect .","306332":"no , she was referring to the anon on her page who was playing the blame game and who was annoying her . idk why y all are making a big stint out of this , all i said was that poly relationships are taboo in today s society . that doesn t mean there s anything wrong with monogamous relationships , especially considering i m monogamous .","306333":"i got into an argument with my mother this morning and ended up walking away , otherwise i would have just gotten more upset .","306334":"lol yes . when i was younger , i used to spell nearly everything out . now i don t really care and use a lot of acronyms .","306335":"street racing . there are a lot of roads around here that people race on , and it s incredibly dangerous .","306336":"it s a pretty even split between clear , sunny skies and rain . it s been overcast a lot lately , though .","306337":"no , i don t like my own answers . idk why i have so many , i guess people like what i have to say ? ?","306338":"i don t pay attention to sports , so i really have no idea . if i had to venture a guess , i would say probably football .","306339":"i m not sure if you go under contact us in the menu , though , they have resources such as an faq and other ways to contact support .","306340":"i can t remember the last time i actually swam , regardless of whether it was in the pool or ocean .","306341":"rofl . i ve always been a trembling , anxious mess the only difference between now and then is that i used to be drunk or high percent of the time .","306342":"in most scenarios , most people wouldn t get violent or angry . but that isn t really a chance i m willing to take these days .","306343":"in that particular situation , i would rather fake laugh and get the interaction over with rather than give no reaction whatsoever and deal with the possibility of a stranger getting angry or violent with me .","306344":"when the delivery drivers were loading packages into my garage , one of them said something about my shirt but i couldn t hear what he said , and he laughed so i awkwardly laughed with him because i didn t want to make the situation even more awkward by not responding to what he said . i have literally zero idea of how to act around people anymore .","306345":"occasionally , yeah however , it s more along the lines that i drink after a stressful day period , as my job doesn t really stress me out very much . my personal life gives me more stress than my job does .","306346":"no , i ve never been a fan of whiskey or anything similar to it , i . e . scotch . my boyfriend drinks johnny walker occasionally , and i can t stand the taste of it .","306347":"nah , that phased out quite a few years ago and especially after we started going through hardship together . obviously no relationships are all sunshine and roses , but he still gives me butterflies and his small tokens of appreciation and affection make me really happy .","306348":"i ve had pimples obviously , but i said i ve never had acne .","306349":"depends on my mood . i usually drink beer , but every now and again i ll have amaretto on the rocks , especially in the colder months .","306350":"his smile ! ! he has literally the most beautiful smile and it melts me every time .","306351":"i ve never had acne so i ve never really gone out of my way to avoid getting pimples . i just wash my face with warm water times per day to keep it from getting oily .","306352":"uh , is this supposed to say alcohol ? ? lmao , yes . i do drink .","306353":"i probably have at one point , but that was way too long ago to really remember specifically .","306354":"i do , actually . we had mutual friends and we ended up meeting each other during an outing to an amusement park when we were in , like , th grade . we spent the entire night talking .","306355":"not really , which is why i wanted questions to distract me . the day started out fine but quickly deteriorated after i got home . i just finished up with the delivery my family was supposed to get they were . hours late , ugh and now i m sitting down , trying to calm down and relax .","306356":"anyone have any questions ? ?","306357":"no , i think they re beautiful and majestic creatures .","306358":"i don t text very often , so it doesn t really have the same effect .","306359":"i have a brother already . we don t really have a close relationship or anything , though .","306360":"sometimes , yeah . i don t watch most scary movies or shows alone anymore because they make me way too paranoid . my best friend recommended that new netflix series , the house on haunted hill , but i m terrified to watch it alone , rofl .","306361":"i agree to a certain extent . however , that doesn t mean that people should openly put themselves at risk of being hurt if they have the suspicion that a conversation can lead down that road . we need to protect ourselves first and foremost .","306362":"this is true , but i also don t believe the paranoia is unwarranted . there are plenty of valid reasons to refrain from talking to people online , especially if they re coming from a position where opening up to someone in the past has left them vulnerable . but the bottom line is that people are allowed to ignore whoever they want regardless of their reasons for feeling uncomfortable . no one is obligated to talk to someone else simply because they exist , regardless of gender .","306363":"it depends on the individual . some people simply don t want to converse with strangers and aren t willing to entertain the idea , while others fear for their safety and privacy .","306364":"not wanting to talk to someone is a perfectly valid reason to not talk to someone . like i said , no one is obligated to talk to a person simply because that person exists . if they feel uncomfortable in that position , anyone has the right to cease conversation .","306365":"as long as they re not being racist or classist , then there s nothing wrong with refusing to talk to a person . no one should be forced to communicate with a person they don t want to speak to , especially if the person trying to talk to them is making them uncomfortable . women in particular shouldn t feel obligated to talk to men solely because the man reached out to them . if that woman feels uncomfortable with that interaction , then she has every right to cease communication , ignore the message , or block the person attempting to talk to her .","306366":"that seems pretty irrelevant to what you were discussing with me before . unless you have an actual question to ask , i m not going to respond to these messages anymore .","306367":"they re supposed to , but sometimes they don t . lately our deliveries haven t been telling us when they re on their way , they just gave us a four hour window as to when they would be here .","306368":"i don t really believe gender has anything to do with that if you want respect , then show respect in the first place . if you re going to message a stranger randomly without respecting their decisions , then don t be surprised if that person tells you to leave them alone or ignores you .","306369":"my weekend hasn t really been going so well . i m not in a great mood because of things that happened earlier this morning , and i m also experiencing anxiety because i m supposed to be getting a delivery in sometime this afternoon and i have no idea when it s going to come . i have to help the workers take items off the truck and mark them off on the invoice , and i m really not feeling social today . however . . . i have coffee and i m probably going to play video games after the delivery is done , so i guess i have that to look forward to .","306370":"if someone is doing something that s making you feel uncomfortable , you have every right to call out that behavior and ignore the person making the unwanted advances . if you want to talk about respect , then the person who is the one messaging other people should respect that some people don t want to take part in those antics and leave them alone .","306371":"neither . i don t really like the way my face looks most of the time .","306372":"we can t find an apartment around here that s cheap enough yet . if there were affordable options , then i would have moved out a long time ago .","306373":"i get into conflicts with my mother on a weekly basis because she s an extremely difficult person to live with , and she s also the only person who gets under my skin . however , that s basically the extent of it . i rarely get into conflicts with friends or my boyfriend , and i honestly can t remember the last time i had debate with someone who wasn t my mother .","306374":"no , i wish i did ! ! thank you it s actually the new avatar creator from xbox . they updated it about a week ago and gave a lot more options and it looks so much like me .","306375":"i don t see anything wrong with that , personally . some people just aren t ready to date someone if that person has a child , and i would be in the same position if i was dating someone who had a child as well . no one is forcing you to settle down . if you re not happy then you have the freedom to break things off and find someone who s more suited to you .","306376":"? ? ? better in what context ? ? people don t have to do anything they re not comfortable doing . if a stranger direct messages me on social media , then there s a percent change they re being ignored . there s nothing wrong with that .","306377":"this generally doesn t happen to me , but the few times it did , i just ignored the message .","306378":"i prefer having a small group of friends over larger groups of friends . i ve always had a small inner circle , and i only really talk to perhaps people regularly these days . i m not generally comfortable around strangers , so i usually try to do things in the public when the least amount of people are around like running errands super early in the morning or late at night .","306379":"no , i m blatantly white . lol .","306380":"i ve been replaying fallout a lot lately , actually , in preparation for fallout that comes out next month . i also just recently finished the first episode of life is strange , and i m debating on purchasing the new destiny dlc , forsaken . i have the rest of the dlcs but i need to see how much money this one is first . i ve also been meaning to buy the new tomb raider game , but i m waiting for it to go on sale .","306381":"i m not at a point in my life where i want to be involved in a child s life like that , so i don t think i would feel comfortable dating a person who has a child . i don t even know if i want children in the future .","306382":"i m not really shy , but i do have social anxiety especially when it comes to talking on the phone . i dread making phone calls when it comes to scheduling appointments , but obviously i have to do it anyway . my boyfriend is also horrible at texting lol so it s much easier for us to catch up by talking on the phone rather than texting .","306383":"it isn t my friend , it was my mother who was saying those things . it s difficult to ignore her considering i live with her .","306384":"i think we re all selfish to a certain degree , but that isn t necessarily a bad thing . it s perfectly okay to be selfish because our needs are just as important as anyone else s needs , and its healthy to recognize that we should do things for ourselves and put ourselves first at times .","306385":"i absolutely hate my voice with a passion , lol so in that respect , i would agree . i don t know how other people feel about their voices , though .","306386":"the only person i talk to on the phone is my boyfriend . everyone else , i text .","306387":"my mother has been a tyrannical mess ever since i got home this morning and has been yelling at me for every small thing i ve done for the past hour . this morning , she wanted me to go to a particular bagel store and buy her a bunch of food and spend money we don t have , even though we have more than enough food at the house and i wasn t feeling well enough to make the stop on the way home . she got angry with me , and when i got home , she told me she called in the order anyway so that i had no choice but to go back out and pick her food up . when i got home from that , she started yelling about how my father and i are useless because we couldn t find a particular set of dishes for the kitchen and basically went off on how we re both lazy and not good for anything .","306388":"for example , if i m not feeling up to doing something but i know it would make him happy , i ll get over my own feelings and do it for him . usually that translates to little things , like picking up food for him on my way over to his house , etc etc .","306389":"they re equally as important although i would sacrifice my happiness for my boyfriend s happiness , realistically both partner s happiness are equally as important and no one should make you choose between one or the other .","306390":"can y all ask me questions to distract me ? ? i m having a shit day i m in such a horrid fuckin mood .","306391":"i am ! ! i probably won t buy it for a while because i m more focused on other games , but the first game was legendary .","306392":"some people feel jealousy , hurt , and pain which is why polyamory wouldn t work for them . however , there are some people who thrive in polyamorous relationships . everyone experiences love differently .","306393":"a lot of people don t understand polyamory because they re so used to the idea of monogamy , and polyamory is pretty much taboo in today s society for that reason .","306394":"being in a polyamorous relationship isn t cheating because both partners have agreed and consented to each other also seeing other people alongside their current relationship . however , cheating can happen in polyamorous relationships if one person goes behind their partner s back to see someone , lies about it , etc etc . even though they re free to see who they want , there s an underlying understanding of communication and honesty when it comes to polyamory .","306395":"well i did say that we have discussed it from time to time , so yeah .","306396":"weak by ajr https youtu . be txccybmkdb","306397":"my boyfriend and i have discussed it from time to time , but we don t think it would serve our relationship for the better . i still have issues with jealousy that i m constantly working on , and being in a polyamorous relationship while having jealousy issues wouldn t be constructive to our relationship .","306398":"yes , i m very much a fighter for the things people i care about . i ll bend over backwards if it meant making a loved one happy and i ll never stop fighting toward the causes i m passionate about .","306399":"love isn t meant to be all sunshine and roses , and you will go through hardship with your partner . what defines your relationship is how well you undergo conflicts together and communicate with each other during struggles . if someone is giving off the impression that their relationship is all good times , then they re either hiding the bad parts of the relationship or they simply haven t experienced hardship yet . you can still be in love with someone , and vice versa , and experience struggle with them it s a natural part of being human .","306400":"i would be enthralled with it , considering my last kiss was with my boyfriend , lol .","306401":"i wouldn t go so far as to say i hate people , but i m definitely not a people person and i prefer having a small , intimate circle as opposed to a large one .","306402":"i have a tendency to be a jealous person , but it s something i m always working on because jealousy is a toxic emotion and doesn t serve anyone . a large part of jealousy is that you have to remember your worth . just because someone is experiencing something doesn t automatically mean you don t deserve to have the same experiences . it also doesn t mean that person deserves it more than you do . sometimes life is unfair and we have to deal with that .","306403":"i honestly don t even remember what our first argument was about or how i dealt with it , haha . but one thing you have to remember it isn t you against your partner , it s you and your partner against the problem . work together to solve disputes .","306404":"well , that happened back in the day when i worked in retail . i worked as the photo lab supervisor and then i also worked as a pharmacy technician , so i dealt with the public on a daily basis .","306405":"sleepy baby .","306406":"i ve been in quite a few situations where the language barrier posed an issue , but it wasn t funny or awkward . it was just overwhelming because my job was to help the customer , and it was difficult to help them when i wasn t sure what it was that they wanted .","306407":"technically i already do , haha . my boyfriend adopted a bearded dragon , and we take care of her together . obviously they re not real dragons but they re the closest thing to one . especially considering they have absolutely no depth perception and like to think they can fling themselves off of furniture .","306408":"yeah , plenty of times . thankfully it hasn t happened with my new job at all , but there were a few coworkers in my old jobs who were really irritating and angered me a lot .","306409":"according to astrology , my astrological sign scorpio is also a water sign .","306410":"yes , i have seven tattoos .","306411":"wait . . . was this your attempt at fucking with me ? ? rofl . regardless , if you want to continue asking me questions , feel free . i just don t answer anything inappropriate , especially with respect to sex .","306412":"not so much anymore . i enjoy the feeling of being buzzed tipsy more than actually being drunk .","306413":"if it was a joke , then you wouldn t be so offended rn , rofl .","306414":"i always found threats for physical violence via the internet to be amusing also what exactly are you going to do , transport to a different era in the future and slap me on the back of the head via virtual reality ? ?","306415":"lol , intimidation is the wrong word in this context . amusing might be better suited for this scenario .","306416":"that s a bit frightening that you re curious about a stranger s sex life . although i assume you must be new to my page , since i ve never answered any questions that even remotely relate to sex .","306417":"lmao the no offense . that s not going to negate the fact that you asked what s usually a very personal question to a random stranger without preface .","306418":"probably an right now ! ! i m sitting down with a cup of coffee checking up on social media , so i m fairly content rn . i ran all of my errands already so i don t have to do anything over the weekend .","306419":"things to speed up harry potter the cursed child ! ! not so silent night concert ! ! work holiday party ! ! things to slow down the weekend in general , lol . how fast i drink my coffee . how fast i go through packs of cigarettes although this should lessen because i just bought a new vape liquid .","306420":"the world has always had turmoil . it just depends on which issues you want to focus on .","306421":"no , i ve never wanted to move to canada .","306422":"i don t get headaches regularly anymore unless i m withdrawing from caffeine or i m hungover . but i usually just treat them with a good meal , a few ibuprofen , and a lot of water .","306423":"i wasn t going to answer this at first because i m generally reserved about my vices and seldom talk about them . . . but yeah , i smoke like times per week , lol .","306424":"i m very much a worrier , lol . my anxiety gets the best of me sometimes and my head is reeling most of the time when i m awake .","306425":"yessssss . i m so excited ! !","306426":"i m not addicted to music , if that s even a possibility , but i do enjoy music a lot . i actually just bought tickets to a concert that s happening in december .","306427":"no , i haven t used a planner since i went to college .","306428":"no , i don t normally have plans on the weekends because everyone i know works on the weekend , lol . i might see my boyfriend sunday morning , though ! !","306429":"i m feeling much better today , although my stomach is still a little off . i m just looking forward to going home and laying down . other than my stomach issues , my day has been okay . i ve been having trouble focusing at work , but that s normal these days .","306430":"i honestly have no idea , lol . i don t really do anything illegal or dangerous these days .","306431":"i don t really eat seafood often , but i usually get crab or salmon in my sushi .","306432":"i doubt it . i m feeling much better today , it was probably just one of those hour bugs that has been going around .","306433":"yeah , i ve had break ups with friends before . they were mostly toxic for me so i didn t have any negative feelings towards the break up .","306434":"is it just me or is askfm dead tonight ? ? ask me questions , as long as they re appropriate","306435":"oh shit , that s horrible . i just talked to my boyfriend he said his dad had the same thing , but it definitely didn t last two weeks . whatever it is , i hope you feel better soon ! !","306436":"physically , i ve been having nothing but problems with my stomach the past two days . i m just in constant pain and i think it s some sort of stomach bug . when i m feeling terrible physically , it also affects my mood so i haven t been motivated to do anything at all today . i slept pretty much the entire day .","306437":"i didn t get questions all day , so that s why i was seldom on today . i also took like three naps because i feel like garbage .","306438":"i don t remember what they were about at this point . when i woke up , i remember them being strange and vivid , but i can t recall any details .","306439":"occasionally . i ve been having nothing but vivid dreams in the past hours .","306440":"thank you very much","306441":"my boyfriend worries me the most . he pushes himself too hard sometimes and i m always afraid he s going to hurt himself because of how hard he works . he never takes a break and he gets so invested into his job .","306442":"walmart is cheaper , but i seldom go there . i like target s variety of clothing and they re okay if you re only stopping for a few items .","306443":"i enjoy using makeup , but i seldom use it . i honestly can t remember the last time i wore makeup , it s been months .","306444":"no , i can t say that i have .","306445":"i don t really do much cooking , but my eggs are pretty good .","306446":"hm , interesting .","306447":"i don t personally think so , although idk why makeup really plays a factor in all of it . you ll find someone eventually .","306448":"i always forget appointments , so i write them down on my calender as soon as i get back into my car .","306449":"i don t know much about it , but it sounds tragic .","306450":"why did you send this as a mass message ? ? the fuuuck .","306451":"i don t involve myself in drama , so it doesn t affect me .","306452":"i e mailed askfm and asked if they could verify me . they asked me to email them a picture of myself holding up a paper with my username on it to verify it was really me .","306453":"yeah , that s normal and very common . as long as you don t act on your thoughts then it isn t a big deal .","306454":"i just woke up from a nap so i don t even know what s real and not real .","306455":"i m just as mature as other people my age .","306456":"no , not that i m aware of .","306457":"i m not sure . i don t try to be mature or immature , i just act like myself .","306458":"no , i never have . i ve always wanted to try wire wrapping , though .","306459":"honestly , lately my coping mechanisms have been sleeping and playing video games . at least it takes my mind off of things .","306460":"i frequently receive gift cards for my birthday and xmas since it s easier than trying to think of a gift . they re usually pre paid visa cards or cards to places like dunkin donuts and starbucks .","306461":"i feel that i m on a heavy cocktail of psych meds too to control my mood swings , and even though they help for the most part , i still get swayed by the simplest of things . my episodes aren t nearly as bad as they used to be , but they re still somewhat there .","306462":"do you have access to a therapist or psychiatrist who would be able to help with your mood swings ? ?","306463":"it makes complete sense . i get those feelings occasionally myself .","306464":"any sort of customer service position i have social anxiety , which makes it extremely difficult to talk to people , especially over the phone . i would be an awful sales representative and would make zero commission because i wouldn t be able to convince anyone to buy anything .","306465":"work my personal life , primarily . i ve also been feeling unmotivated and burnt out , which hasn t been helping . it s been making my anxiety skyrocket at random points during the day .","306466":"love is a b tch two feet https youtu . be dje gbivzk","306467":"yeah , it happened often when i ran stock when i worked in retail . they were normally heavy totes of assorted products or big bags of items .","306468":"i wouldn t say a lot , but the people in my life who matter understand me , and that s all that really counts .","306469":"it wasn t so great . i don t know if i ate something bad , but i ve had such pain in my stomach all day and i m nauseous and dizzy . which doesn t help my mental health because it brings out my depressive episodes , so now i m also mentally feeling like shit .","306470":"depends on the individual animal , lol . there are some dogs i ve met that i ve preferred over cats , and then there are some cats that i preferred over dogs . it entirely depends on their personality .","306471":"i ve honestly just been scrolling past all of it because drama is pointless to me . luckily i haven t been on askfm much since yesterday , so i still found answers i haven t seen yet tonight . my inbox is empty , though , so i probably won t bother to stay online unless someone sends me questions .","306472":"probably not in the long run . the money would run out eventually , unless i miraculously get a raise or find a job that pays me more than my current job .","306473":"a lot more money than i can afford rn .","306474":"it would depend on a lot of factors , such as the cost of living , violence in the surrounding areas , etc etc . i don t like big cities , but i also probably wouldn t feel comfortable in a small town either because i don t want people knowing who i am .","306475":"i m guessing you ve lived there ? ? rofl .","306476":"no , i ve never talked about moving to canada .","306477":"i just said anywhere within the united states , so no .","306478":"anywhere within the united states massachusetts , west virginia , north carolina , oregon , etc etc .","306479":"in a heartbeat . the only things stopping me are financial obligations .","306480":"that s true , i never thought about it that way . i would be so angry if my phone didn t think i was me because i was wasn t wearing makeup , lmao .","306481":"when i went to rtx four years ago , i saw some amazing cosplays ! ! obviously they weren t halloween costumes , but they still require a lot of hard work and creativity , and the results were outstanding . i think my favorites were the halo spartan soldiers or people who dressed up as the characters from rwby .","306482":"i d probably carve something fallout or destiny related , since those are the two video games i ve been playing the most lately .","306483":"i haven t needed to look for a new partner in a number of years , so i honestly have no clue what i would look for . however , my boyfriend is compassionate , artistic , a gamer , a hard worker , wants children , loves animals more than he loves people , has strong political opinions , has tattoos , and is left leaning but loves playing devil s advocate .","306484":"i don t remember most of my childhood , so i honestly don t know . i just remember being a witch or a devil .","306485":"i don t listen to any podcasts , no . there are some on spotify that i tried listening to while at work , but i honestly can t write edit documents and listen to something with spoken words at the same time because i get way too confused , lol .","306486":"my phone unlocks via fingerprint , and tbh i think it s a lot more reliable than entering a passcode or password . don t some phones also have facial recognition , where the phone unlocks after you snap a picture of your face with the front camera ? ? idk if i m making this up or not , lmao .","306487":"i m doing fine . i just got home from my therapy appointment , and now i m relaxing with a cup of coffee and catching up on my questions . i m also feeling a bit unmotivated , as i have a basket full of clean laundry that has to be folded but i haven t done it yet .","306488":"i m usually not home by the time most trick or treaters come around due to my work schedule .","306489":"i d probably choose babycadiex . her opinions are fact based and she relies on statistical scientific evidence to prove her points , especially with respect to parenting .","306490":"not at all periods are a natural aspect of being female , and there s nothing inherently wrong with people discussing their menstrual cycle with others . it shouldn t be a taboo topic .","306491":"i don t really consider any of my interests to be childish . my first thought was video games , but then i realized we should erase the misconception that video games are only for children because the process of creating playing a video game can be considered an art form .","306492":"that would require me to have been in a fight with a girl , which i have not .","306493":"i m sure i do , but i seldom remember my dreams .","306494":"it isn t right to laugh at people s triggers , regardless of context people have made such light out of triggers in recent years and it s become so harmful toward people who actually struggle with triggers because they feel as if their triggers aren t valid anymore . there have been recent studies indicating that patients are not acknowledging their triggers because of the social stigma attached to having them , as society today has turned a trigger into a joke . it s perfectly common and normal for a person to become triggered if they see someone who looks like their abvser , and it s no one s fault that it occurs . having a trigger is a physiological and psychological response , and a lot of people don t have control over that .","306495":"i prefer being cold i feel miserable when i m too hot , especially if there s only so much clothing i can take off and i m still dying of heat . i also hate sweating because it makes me feel self conscious . at least when i m cold , i can layer up . and i m usually much more comfortable in hoodies .","306496":"i wear jeans more often , mostly because i have more pairs of jeans than i do of leggings . leggings are more comfortable , in my opinion , but i just like the look of jeans better , especially my ripped skinny jeans .","306497":"i prefer self checkouts as opposed to going to a cashier , tbh . as long as the items are easily scanned , then i ll normally go to self checkout . sometimes i experience anxiety when stepping up in front of a cashier , so self checkout eliminates that anxiety completely .","306498":"tbh it concerns me how obsessed some people are with sex to the point where they ll go out of their way to anonymously ask a stranger details about their sex life just to get their own rocks off . my sex life isn t anyone s concern , and if you re honestly this obsessed with sex , then you need to seek treatment .","306499":"i couldn t care less about what photos someone uses as their profile picture . as long as they re not pretending to be the model celebrity etc . , then it doesn t much matter .","306500":"i prefer to make decisions for myself normally i don t trust anyone else to make decisions for me , and i feel much more comfortable when i m in a position where the full responsibility lays on me .","306501":"people have children for a variety of reasons , it s really impossible to give one concrete explanation that s supposed to cover all parents . everyone has a different reason behind why they decided to have kids .","306502":"i have work therapy after work . i don t have any plans subsequent to that , though .","306503":"i honestly don t even know who they are , lol i ll have to look them up . i m going percent for mike shinoda , percent for ajr , five percent for muse , and five percent for florence . idc about the rest of them .","306504":"i never needed to see a show so badly oh my god .","306505":"even though they re probably the most unhealthy thing in existence , checkers loaded fries are amazing .","306506":"no , abvse is something that shouldn t be tolerated regardless of gender .","306507":"i d rather not discuss it on askfm .","306508":"i honestly don t remember what my last mistake was . it probably had something to do with work , tbh . i m generally a cautious person and i try to avoid making mistakes .","306509":"i miss my best friend because we seldom see each other due to our work schedules . hopefully we ll be able to plan a date soon .","306510":"it s probably the most prevalent fetish on askfm and its absolutely disgusting . people are entitled to their fetishes up until they start harassing other people , then it s completely unacceptable .","306511":"i sometimes listen to music stations on my way to work , but usually i just put on spotify .","306512":"i ve sold plenty of things that i owned , i . e . clothing , books , toys , etc etc . they were usually at yard sales my parents used to have when i was younger .","306513":"look how cute the new xbox avatars are ! !","306514":"my day has been fine . i slept over my boyfriend s house last night and we woke up made breakfast together . i picked up coffee on the way home , helped out around the house , and i ve been playing fallout for the past hour or so .","306515":"no , i m not looking for a house . i ve been looking at apartments for rent .","306516":"i m pretty sure i read somewhere that the beads are bad for you , but i honestly don t remember why or where i read it , haha .","306517":"i like them sort of thick , i feel like they work a little better that way , rofl . i have this one mud mask that i love , but it s a pain because i usually leave it on for minutes so i m stumbling around my house blind because i can t see without my glasses .","306518":"at this point in the year , i d probably use some of it for xmas shopping and the rest to pay off my bills .","306519":"i ve always wanted to visit australia and new zealand . they both look like such beautiful countries .","306520":"how can i look like a grandmother when i don t even have children ? ? rofl .","306521":"i already posted this yesterday , but it was a picture i took of my hair because the color is fading .","306522":"wasn t she just recently hospitalized again too ? ?","306523":"you re not the real selena .","306524":"at this point , i d rather live in a fantasy . give me middle earth any day of the week . i ll eat and drink merrily like a damn hobbit .","306525":"idk if there have been any studies on it , so i can t say for certain whether or not its more or less prevalent in this age .","306526":"way down we go kaleo https youtu . be uzxuqbcp yc","306527":"it s so beautiful today . low s fahrenheit , sunny , and so so breezy . i live for this weather .","306528":"you can definitely do that ! ! as long as you have a stylist who knows what they re doing , lol . watch the anons say we re copying each other again after it happens .","306529":"i support the metoo movement . and i m glad survivors have been given a platform to tell their stories because rvpe is so prevalent in today s age and it s not okay .","306530":"i m definitely pro choice . people should have the option to have an abortion because it s their body , and they have bodily autonomy .","306531":"probably ! ! although my hair has faded so much since last month .","306532":"yeah , my boyfriend . rofl .","306533":"lol . who hurt you ? ? you re legit salty for no reason . lmao . news flash sometimes , people do care . just because you probably don t have anyone who gives a sh t about you doesn t mean other people have the same experience .","306534":"interesting , sounds as if you care considering how you re somehow offended by something that has no affect on your life .","306535":"so i just publicly came out as non binary on fb in light of nationalcomingoutday and everyone has been so supportive so far i m gonna cry .","306536":"it would depend on their personality . i m not going to willingly date someone if they re an as hole , regardless of how much money they have .","306537":"lol , no . i m content with life in some aspects , but unhappy in other aspects . and while life is something to be grateful for , i ve never been infatuated with it .","306538":"i ll have to try it one day . i also heard of other cultures putting butter in coffee , but idk if i would be down for that . the thought sort of grosses me out , haha .","306539":"i haven t , actually ! ! i don t know if i would enjoy that because i don t really like the taste of honey .","306540":"i don t really have an all time favorite food , but i m always in the mood for sushi .","306541":"obviously women should be allowed to drive . i think i recently saw an article online that said women could drive in saudi arabia now ? ? don t quote me on that , though . i m not really well versed in the politics in that region .","306542":"lol . i m glad you enjoy the songs i post ! ! here s another band song i ve been into lately . burn the house down ajr https youtu . be imyefvhj a","306543":"i m in a quiet , contemplative mood right now because it s been dark and stormy all day . i d want to listen to something mellow , perhaps a bit dark , and atmospheric . i feel like i m drowning two feet https youtu . be wkvvg qto m","306544":"parents can do whatever they want as long as they re obviously not harming the child , and this doesn t hurt a child in any form , so i don t really see the fuss about it . personally , i don t really believe in a lot of astrological beliefs when it comes to star signs and other charts , but to each their own .","306545":"i haven t seen the documentary , although i ve seen a lot of people talking about it from my understanding , it appears that he somewhat demonizes people with aspd and other stigmatized mental illnesses ? ? either way , sociopaths and psychopaths have mental illness , and most of them are deserving of understanding and patience much like anyone with any other sort of disorder . aspd is especially misunderstood and demonized in the media because they re often portrayed as murderers and criminals . i don t have sociopathy or psychopathy , so i can t really give a more in depth opinion . i know one or two people with aspd , though , and they don t fit the stereotype at all .","306546":"i own a little bit of jewelry , mostly things my boyfriend has bought me for birthdays and holidays . right now , my favorite is a mystic topaz necklace he bought me a few years ago . i wear it every day .","306547":"it was all right . i m tired so i want to go to bed early , but at the same time , i want to see my boyfriend when he gets out of work , so i might just lay down until he gets home and then see him , lmao .","306548":"i m usually good with that when it comes to other stores , like the drug store or the grocery store , but definitely not . it s my guilty pleasure .","306549":"got coffee this morning , went to work , stared at a computer screen until my eyes bled , went to , and then went home .","306550":"no , not anymore . i took hormonal birth control for several years before i realized it was having an adverse effect on me , so i stopped .","306551":"i ve never had anyone copy me before , to my knowledge . i would probably be a little irritated , though .","306552":"i agree i hope everyone down in florida stays safe this week . hurricane michael is supposed to be absolutely devastating .","306553":"i ll try to think of some different people than i normally list theonlyems perfectionistgirl kittiemeowsie lillehjort mamuschu","306554":"i kinda want a margarita , but i m not looking to get wasted so i ll probably just stick to a beer or two tonight .","306555":"pretty sure no one has asked me this before , so kudos .","306556":"my boyfriend is my inspiration . he s the hardest working and most passionate person i know , and he never lets anything get in his path of success . i ve seen him rise through the corporate ranks of two different companies based on his work ethic and ability to lead , and it s inspirational .","306557":"i can t really distinguish the difference between love and attachment because they re one in the same to me . but i know i love someone when i would make sacrifices if it meant making the other person happy , if they re constantly on my mind , if i go out of my way to do things that will show them how much i care , if they inspire me , etc etc .","306558":"wake up , coffee , breakfast , washed laundry , errands , more coffee , dinner , hung laundry , netflix .","306559":"possibly , but it would also depend on his reaction to the question why . if he gets defensive , then that s cause for suspicion .","306560":"her username is from a song from what i remember , lol .","306561":"my family doesn t , but i definitely will once i get my own house .","306562":"yes ! ! i m not really a festive person , but i love halloween season .","306563":"i donate them to thrift stores or the salvation army .","306564":"apparently they re still living in the s , lol . also hello ! !","306565":"technically they re adults but it depends on their maturity level because that s a bit on the borderline .","306566":"well , not if they re actually children . if they re an adult and you re calling them a kid then that can be construed as demeaning .","306567":"everyone is damaged we ve all has things happen to us that have altered our perspective on life in general , on relationships , on ideas and concepts , etc etc . no one is perfect and everyone has their own story to tell . so to claim a person is damaged is a bit of an elitist thing to say .","306568":"i feel unwanted by my friends because sometimes i m left out of plans , especially when it comes to friends i thought considered me a friend in the same manner . but i ve never felt unwanted in my relationship .","306569":"yeah , i used to be great at research when i was in college and worked at the law firm . however , i don t have those academic sources anymore , nor do i have a reason to do research on social or legal topics .","306570":"my ratio of water to coffee is absolutely terrible , and realistically i should be drinking a lot more water than i am because i m constantly dehydrated .","306571":"i prefer things with flavor , so usually flavored seltzer water or iced tea . however , i prefer coffee among all else .","306572":"i m planning on going to work , getting home , possibly taking a nap , and playing video games . it s shaping up to be a good day so far since i was able to see my boyfriend last night . let s hope it stays that way .","306573":"honestly , i ve never really referred to them as crushes unless i was like years old . i ve always just said i liked someone .","306574":"lmao . . . the fuck sort of question is this . there are a few people i d love to meet , but it s based on our friendship . having a crush is a bit childish and immature .","306575":"i personally believe so . it s super cheap and you have access to thousands of titles ranging from tv shows to movies to documentaries . i use netflix most nights of the week .","306576":"yeah , i love spinach actually .","306577":"you asked me this yesterday yesterday , i went out to dinner with my best friend , and we got tacos and chips guac . i also had two margaritas the size of my face . lmao .","306578":"my day has been a bit chaotic , but overall , fine . i got home from work a little while ago now i m just sitting down and trying to catch up on my questions since i haven t answered anything since before i went out to dinner last night . i m so happy tomorrow is friday , though . i feel so burnt out .","306579":"no , i ve never asked my parents for advice before . i ve never been close to them so i never felt comfortable sharing or discussing my feelings with them .","306580":"my parents underestimate me , and i do admit , it does annoy me at times . even though i m turning next month , they still insist on treating me as if i m not actually an adult or can t make independent decisions . i mostly let their comments roll off my back , but sometimes it does aggravate me . if something is bothering you enough about it , though , then perhaps you should say something .","306581":"i used to be , but i haven t played in a really long time .","306582":"i agree . just in the past week alone , the things he s said regarding this event and similar events has been atrocious . he has no human decency or basic respect for anyone except those who agree with him .","306583":"my boyfriend cheated on me once many years ago , but it was a weird situation because we weren t exactly together at the time . i ve never cheated on anyone , though .","306584":"absolutely disgusting . his attitude toward survivors of sxxual assault is atrocious and inhumane .","306585":"i m excited to get tacos margaritas with my best friend after work tonight ! !","306586":"yeah thankfully nothing about me actually comes up .","306587":"nah , i m not ashamed of any of the music i listen to .","306588":"i have terrible coping mechanisms so i usually go out and get drunk or high .","306589":"lately i ve been listening to tk the architect , which puts me in a good mood because his music is so damn good . celinem , i think you would dig this dude ! ! https youtu . be nws s chy","306590":"yeah , i have a tendency toward self isolation when i m in a depressive episode and won t even see my boyfriend when i m feeling that way . it s gotten better over the years because i ve learned how to reach out more often , but it s still something i struggle with .","306591":"? ? ? it means they re good at spelling .","306592":"no , that seems a bit extreme . giving a presentation is standard in most classrooms and prepares students for jobs where they may have to host a meeting , train new employees , etc etc . if a student has severe social anxiety and won t be able to give a presentation without having a panic attack , then i think they should be given the option to perform the presentation in front of the teacher . but other than that , i see no reason to prevent students from giving presentations in general .","306593":"i d rather not get into the specific reasons why , they re a bit personal and i don t feel comfortable discussing them publicly . i just want to go out and do something fuckin stupid and reckless but i have no means to do so right now so i guess i ll just sit here and seeth .","306594":"pumpkin beer a bonfire from a few weeks ago .","306595":"i m trying to understand how my mother wants me to wash these dishes outside when there s no outside light and its pitch dark out now . i also don t own any lanterns or anything that i could bring outside with me . she s expecting me to wash these dishes completely blind and expect them to be clean . sometimes her requests are absolutely absurd . if i washed them in the bathroom , she won t even know the difference .","306596":"yeah , i can be . no one tries to get on my bad side because they ll know something bad would come of it if they do .","306597":"sociopath is generally an outdated and harmful term used to describe people with antisocial personality disorder , so it s generally advised not to use that word . i only know of one or two people with aspd , though . i m sure there are more , it s just seldom discussed because of the large stigma attached to the disorder .","306598":"i generally try not to tune people out at all because it s rude , but there are a select few people that i do because their words are often harmful .","306599":"falling asleep under warm covers with the window wide open and a breeze coming in , sleeping next to your partner , having a fulfilling and interesting conversation with friends , and being in a clean living area after cleaning it and organizing everything .","306600":"that would be petty of you to bring it up now , they re both adults now and i m sure they couldn t care less about what someone else thinks about their relationship from more than years ago . just leave it alone and mind your own business .","306601":"i usually update my insta story every day or every other day , and the content depends on what i m doing that day . last night , for example , i saw live music so i posted a few videos on my story . usually my stories consist of video games , writing , coffee , or my daily thoughts related to current events or my life . sometimes i also post memes .","306602":"i wasn t even aware they were making a new movie .","306603":"no , a lot of my friends have different views than me .","306604":"anyone have any questions ? ? my inbox is empty","306605":"i love the string lights in my room and my tapestries . it s really peaceful looking .","306606":"i don t like to pick favorites , but i m the closest to country peach , courrtana , and littlesha .","306607":"abandonment from my loved ones .","306608":"this is strange , i wasn t aware that i had a child .","306609":"because it could contain explicit content that s inappropriate for younger users .","306610":"they re buzzwords , askfm has the tendency to delete questions answers if those words are uncensored .","306611":"have bonfires outside if it isn t terribly cold .","306612":"i hate massages .","306613":"lmao . thicc usually means curvy , but in a more sexually explicit way .","306614":"i always have coffee in the mornings , otherwise i ll crumble . i get it from a few places and it varies between hot or iced coffee , but it s always coffee . every day .","306615":"i bought a medium coffee while on lunch a few hours ago .","306616":"yeah , as long as it isn t overly spicey . i like medium hot sauce on things , but nothing more than that .","306617":"idk , probably a or . i m not afraid of the dark at all , but i do prefer to keep some sort of light on while i sleep so that in the case that i wake up , i can see what s in front of me .","306618":"writing , painting , and playing video games .","306619":"wow , thank you for this enlightening statement . i had no idea that tobacco usage was harmful .","306620":"i don t really care enough about myself to worry about things like that . if i was concerned , then i wouldn t have started smoking in the first place .","306621":"bbqing outside for dinner with some drinks , then having a bonfire in the backyard with music playing in the background .","306622":"comfortable , haha . these days , all i ve been wearing are jeans and hoodies .","306623":"i don t remember anything from when i was a child .","306624":"i think i m old enough to prevent myself from drowning in a bath , lol . there s always the risk of slipping and cracking your skull in the shower too , though .","306625":"i prefer showers , but baths are nice too when i actually have an hour or so to spare without any interruption .","306626":"i have no issue telling a person no if i can t or aren t up to doing something . it isn t often that i m not up to doing certain things , but i also have no qualms with turning people down when i m not mentally or physically able to do something .","306627":"it depends on who the person is if they ve done something horrible that warrants them as a bad or toxic person , then the couple should talk to one another about this person regarding why they both shouldn t associate with them . for the most part , if your partner dislikes a person for a very real and valid reason not because they simply don t get along then you should respect your partner by not associating with them either .","306628":"from the brief glimpse of the list , i ve read to kill a mockingbird by harper lee looking for alaska by john green the curious incident of the dog in the night time by mark haddon the perks of being a wallflower by stephen chbosky the hunger games by suzanne collins crank by ellen hopkins the catcher in the rye by j . d . salinger and a few others , but i only went down to like or something .","306629":"having bonfires is my favorite part of this time of year","306630":"major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder are mood disorders , while bpd is a personality disorder . the difference between major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder is that in order to meet the diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder , you have to experience episodes of mania or hypomania .","306631":"idk where you are , but there are no social justice warriors here . there are a plethora of disabled people who are out about in public facilities . granted , i don t use public bathrooms as it is , but if i needed to go , then i wouldn t use the disabled stall . you don t know when someone who needs it will walk in .","306632":"lmao . why did you send this to multiple people ? ? it isn t silly , it s common courtesy . it doesn t take people long to pee so i would wait the seconds for another stall .","306633":"mental health awareness reform .","306634":"i m the one everyone goes to when they have issues because they re comfortable confiding in me . honestly , most of the times i go out , my friends end up venting to me over shit happening in their lives and i m usually able to comfort them or give them advice .","306635":"watch something funny ! ! i always wind up getting creeped out paranoid if i watch something scary too close to bedtime , so i usually try to find a funny show or youtube video .","306636":"he works in management for a retail company .","306637":"i actually cope better with some sort of routine and keeping busy . having a routine job is good for my mental health because it forces me to wake up at the same time every day .","306638":"i originally was thinking about it , but uh that s probably not a good idea anymore .","306639":"if it makes people happy then i see no issue with it at all . everyone has a different concept of what a relationship is , and some people are monogamous while others are polyamorous .","306640":"i m from new york there are a hell of a lot of stereotypes , especially when it comes to accents and angry driving lol . new yorkers are generally aggressive drivers and have no issue yelling at you or flipping you off . i think one of the false stereotypes is that people are mostly italian , which couldn t be further from the truth . new york is extremely diverse .","306641":"hey there ! ! i already answered a similar question below , but overall , i m okay . i m also debating on playing assassins creed origins because i downloaded it last night my supervisor said it was an amazing game .","306642":"never i don t have a reason to lie . if i m uncomfortable with a question , then i ll just delete it .","306643":"honestly , no . even when i was a kid and took religion classes , i was never really convinced and questioned the entire concept of religion in general .","306644":"go on dates with both find out which one is more compatible with you .","306645":"lol i honestly don t even know the name of it . my friend courtney , who used to frequent askfm , gave me a bunch of makeup before she moved and one of the mascaras she gave me works really well , so i ve been using it ever since .","306646":"fun fact i originally went to college for creative writing . but then when i transferred schools , i picked the closest program which happened to be professional writing communications .","306647":"y all should ask me some questions while i drink copious amounts of coffee so i can stay awake late enough to finish two loads of laundry before bed","306648":"this is true , but once you get into a serious relationship with someone , you become responsible for the welfare of that child just as much as the parent and i don t feel comfortable with that at this stage of my life .","306649":"no . i only grow to dislike a person after getting to know them . sometimes i do get bad vibes off of people , though , and i try to give them the benefit of the doubt but my intuitions are usually correct .","306650":"i probably wouldn t be open to dating someone who has children because i m not yet at a point in my life where i would feel comfortable being responsible for a child .","306651":"i m pretty damn good at consecutive precision shots on destiny .","306652":"i think way too quickly for my body to comprehend it , which results in me tripping over my own words or mixing them up in different ways . sometimes i can think something but it won t translate into words at all .","306653":"i wholeheartedly agree .","306654":"i m not entirely sure . i don t talk to anyone from high school much anymore so i don t really see a point in going .","306655":"maybe check recent guidelines according to gender definitions and the ap stylebook , because they them pronouns can be used in a singular format .","306656":"i have an old school typewriter , but i don t think that s considered rare .","306657":"yeah , all the time . i used to be a huge eminem fan before i realized he was a sexist pig .","306658":"no . i ve listened to songs that have comforted me in times of struggle , but never in the application of love or relationships .","306659":"he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man . samuel johnson","306660":"no , not at all . hair is natural and there s nothing wrong with having naturally hairy arms or legs . hell , i don t even shave . i can t be bothered to when it makes zero difference in my life .","306661":"i ve simply never felt like a girl or felt like a boy , even when i was young . it s something that has never really resonated with me and i ve always been most comfortable with masculine compliments and dressing androgynously .","306662":"my favorite horror thriller movie is the original texas chainsaw massacre . however , i also like the hills have eyes , saw , hostel , and house of corpses . they scare me sometimes , but the only ones which have really freaked me out have been the grudge and the ring including the originals . i was too young to actually see them , though , so that was probably why they scared me so much .","306663":"i believe that they re wrong on a scientific level because multiple studies have shown that gender exists in multiple forms . there are two sexes , not two genders .","306664":"i suppose i would be a mixture of john , brian , and allison . when i was attending school , i was incredibly academic and pursued education every day . however , at the same time , i also have done a lot of shady and rebellious things especially during that time in my life . as for allison , i ve always related to her because i also have had a dysfunctional home life and have been seen as that strange , quirky person .","306665":"everyone s perception of love is different , so i believe that we love each other the same amount but in different ways . it s also hard to distinguish how much someone loves you because it s impossible to have much insight into someone s mind or heart .","306666":"somewhat . i like traveling and exploring the wilderness , but i seldom get to do it .","306667":"no , i don t expect him to side with anyone except himself . he s a strong willed individual and has his own theories and opinions , and he s not afraid to voice them if there s a conflict . there has also never been an instance where it was me vs his family , we all get along exceptionally well .","306668":"i don t believe trans kids should go on puberty blockers , because it stunts their natural development and there isn t enough research done yet on the detrimental effects it can have on someone s body as an adult .","306669":"i ve never been innocent , but i have always questioned everything and continue to do so in the present day .","306670":"self sabotage , lmao .","306671":"ahh , thank you ! !","306672":"i prefer being androgynous .","306673":"thank you , that actually makes me happy .","306674":"i guess technically he would be considered pansexual because he doesn t care about sex or gender . he likes who he likes and doesn t feel the need to put a label on it .","306675":"i can t tell if this is sarcasm or not .","306676":"he s bisexual . but he was bi before he met me , lol .","306677":"i had certain privileges , but my home life was incredibly dysfunctional . i mostly had to raise myself .","306678":"i m not a girl , so i wouldn t be able to be a girlfriend . either way , i m already in a relationship and have no interest in seeing anyone else .","306679":"well i ve been playing skyrim on and off for the past six years , so i suppose that s the best example ! ! lol .","306680":"my twitter is public , but my instagram and fb are private only to friends .","306681":"aw , thank you ! !","306682":"no . i just said i was in a relationship . being married is different .","306683":"i m all right . i ve just been working a lot and watching netflix while i m home . my moods have been a bit erratic lately , but i m trying to ignore it .","306684":"sure , just minus the kfc .","306685":"yeah , absolutely . perhaps not anytime soon , though .","306686":"waking up and having coffee with my boyfriend , going out to a small caf for brunch , and relaxing at home for the rest of the day while having a bonfire and some beer at dusk .","306687":"i used to use a charcoal face wash in the shower but i ran out a few months ago and haven t used it since . i ve always been fortunate in that i ve had clear skin since i was a teenager .","306688":"me saying that i disagree is standing up for what i believe in too , though . however , i also know that if such an event were to take place , i realistically wouldn t even entertain the notion or get into a conversation about it because i would have to be somewhere else . i would honestly just tell the person no and that i disagreed , and i would be on my way .","306689":"telling them that i disagree with their opinion is basically the same thing as saying they re wrong , lol . either way , if some random person approached me and asked me to sign a petition that said that , i wouldn t care enough to make a big deal out of it . i would just brush them off and continue on my way .","306690":"i am leigh a writer and a person who sees passion in the smallest of places . i want nothing more than to be happy in this wretched world within my small circle of influence , to make good memories with loved ones while pursuing my aspirations . i m living just to merely survive at the moment , but looking toward the future , i want to live for great experiences .","306691":"not gonna lie , the internet . there are so many terrible influences on the internet that they could fall into and i would be so nervous to allow them to access it , especially now with the prevalence of sxx trafficking . it s terrifying .","306692":"i suppose my inquisitive nature . it helped me a lot in college because i always strived to learn more than simply what the professor taught us , which helped me a lot in regards to papers and exams . if it wasn t for my high marks in college and my degree , i wouldn t have obtained the jobs i had have .","306693":"my week has been cold and rainy , i m loving it . i prefer this weather over sunny days so i ve been in a fairly good mood when i m not acting over emotional about random events in my life lol . today wasn t a bad day either . i just got home from work and i m debating on either watching the new season of wentworth or playing destiny .","306694":"probably not . i don t want to know my future because it would probably turn into a self fulfilling prophecy or i would focus on it all the time .","306695":"i don t believe you understand how difficult it is for people to actually get an insanity plea . it s extremely rare because they have to prove that the person had no self awareness or control over their actions during the time of the crime .","306696":"as long as it s consensual , there s absolutely nothing wrong with it . let people live their lives the way they want to live them .","306697":"i have one neighbor who s an asshole , and my parents have talked to him about his behavior but he still insists on being an asshole . during the summer , he was yelling and screaming at the landscapers on my property who were literally just doing their job . it was ridiculous .","306698":"if you can t sort your problems out or if you re not seeing eye on eye on important things even after discussing them thoroughly , then there may not be a friendship to salvage . yeah , it s difficult to go through , but there s also no point in holding onto the memories of a friendship when that friendship can t be fixed no matter what you do to try . you ll only hurt yourself in the long run .","306699":"depends on the nature of the relationship . if your issues can t be fixed through communicating about those issues , then perhaps you re better off going your separate ways .","306700":"i d probably have a serious conversation with them regarding the ramifications of bullying and how it leads people to svicide . bullying is a serious matter and should be handled properly .","306701":"yeah , i was bullied a lot in middle school in particular .","306702":"obviously bullying is a terrible thing to do and endure , and it leads to increased risk and rate of svicide in young adults , teenagers , and children . as for how to deal with it , it depends on the scenario and what the safest option may be . sometimes it s standing up for yourself while other times its ignoring the bully completely . other forms of bullying can warrant intervention from authority .","306703":"i find that i m always in a better mood when it s raining and grey outside . especially if i m near a window with a cup of coffee in my hands . y all should ask me questions , i ll be bored tonight","306704":"i don t think it s something you can tell in the current moment rather , it s something you realize in retrospect due to a variety of factors , whether it s your opinions changing on things , your patience and tolerance growing , or you re even finding yourself more content with yourself or your life in small ways . i never knew i grew as a person until i ve looked back at who i was and compared myself then to now . it takes a bit of critical thinking and the ability to be honest with yourself , but people are constantly evolving .","306705":"yeah , of course . it places a certain expectation on people , especially younger people , and it makes them feel inadequate if they don t fit into that ideal of what a person is supposed to look like .","306706":"i don t think there were any at all . like dovbts said , jk rowling just said it after the fact probably to be inclusive and remain relevant .","306707":"yeah , i was tired of being in the legal industry and i wanted to get more into writing and editing . so i looked for jobs in the publishing field .","306708":"a healthy relationship is one where everyone involved in the relationship understands one another or seeks to understand each other without judgment or anger . it s being supportive of your partner s through their goals and aspirations and having a willingness to help . it s the ability to make certain sacrifices and compromises for the betterment of the relationship and sharing responsibility . it s being able to apologize for mistakes and going through with making sure those mistakes don t happen again .","306709":"i can be a leader and have been in many cases in the past , but sometimes i simply don t have the tolerance or energy to lead , so in those instances , it s better for me to be a follower .","306710":"this is going to make me sound like an as hole , but no . this is something i do every day as a job , and i m not going to do it for an anon for free on the internet . especially given the amount of time it would take for me to do so . i wish you luck with your essays , though .","306711":"this isn t an appropriate question to ask someone anonymously on the internet . it s a highly sensitive topic for most people .","306712":"i usually have the right words to say because i ve known them for plenty of years , which means i know them well enough to know what to say and not say depending on the mood they re in . there have been miscommunications sometimes , yeah , but we cleared it up right away so there was never any harsh feelings afterwards .","306713":"somewhat i m looking forward to the storms we re supposed to be having on monday , but i don t really want to wake up early to go into work .","306714":"my next tattoo is going to be a black white quill on my right forearm .","306715":"the stupidity and ignorance of other humans .","306716":"sometimes it can be , because it can be difficult for me to adjust to change . however , i ve always had good time management skills so investing time into something in a healthy manner has always been relatively easy for me to do .","306717":"i look forward to the mornings where i can drink coffee with my boyfriend while sitting outside and enjoying the weather together .","306718":"my name is leigh , but okay .","306719":"aw , feel better ! ! i can t remember the last time i was actually sick . i get stomach bugs every so often , but i can usually manage them and it doesn t normally impede my daily life . i did have the flu once like two years ago and that was dreadful , though .","306720":"omg , i can t choose just one , lol . skyrim , fallout , fallout , halo reach , halo , assassins creed syndicate , life is strange , the wolf among us , and the bioshock series are a few of my favorites .","306721":"i think it s disgusting and ignorant . mac miller struggled with mental illness drug addiction long before he dated her , and their breakup was amicable and she constantly was offering him help for his issues and trying to give him the resources he needed . people who disregard or blatantly insult those who are addicts or mentally ill obviously have never been around addicts and its exhausting to hear about them being considered inferior to the rest of the population . drug addiction is a mental health issue above all else .","306722":"no ? ? where a person lives doesn t exactly dictate their intelligence or education level . some of the best colleges are in the south .","306723":"people who don t understand or don t have mental illness sometimes glorify the struggles mentally ill people go through because they think it s relatable or trendy . calling someone a fine mess insinuates that their struggles are somehow attractive , which is detrimental to mental health . people aren t taken as seriously .","306724":"sounds like a glorification of mental illness to me .","306725":"somewhat only if it s a slow and painful death . if not , then they should rot in solitary confinement for the rest of their lives .","306726":"bork bork , bitch .","306727":"perhaps ! ! the thing with reincarnation is that it makes the most sense to me given my current beliefs , but it s also a bit too far fetched for me to actually believe in it . i m a very science driven person , so sometimes my thoughts conflict with my need for things to be proven on a scientific level .","306728":"i don t know what i believe in , honestly . i do believe that our souls are energy and cannot be destroyed , merely transferred to a different medium after our bodies perish . however , i ve never really been able to come to an idea as to where we go or what happens after our body dies .","306729":"crime documentaries inside the criminal mind mindhunter the people vs oj simpson the keepers evil genius tv series wentworth orange is the new black parks and recreation criminal minds ncis","306730":"i m basically a coffee addict but i m not overbearing about my coffee orders .","306731":"i can be sometimes , especially if i m exhausted or stressed .","306732":"i m doing well ! ! i m at my boyfriend s house and we re going to have a poker night and a fire .","306733":"too faced born this way concealer with setting powder has worked best for me .","306734":"my household doesn t really have any concrete rules just common sense expectations , like putting things back where you found them cleaning up after yourself .","306735":"lol . i m just happy that i m being entertained during this blackout . makes the time go by faster .","306736":"lol . no , it doesn t bother me at all . i dislike how the word is flung around so carelessly , though . it s used by mental health professionals to describe triggers that send people into exacerbations of their mental illness .","306737":"no ? ? you guys are acting like i claimed that all white dudes who are cis straight are assholes , lmao . i clearly didn t say that .","306738":"because it s true ? ? most of the cis , heterosexual white people i know are ignorant and entitled .","306739":"not as a whole , but most of them are sh tty people with a sense of entitlement .","306740":"if that bothered me , then i wouldn t be dating my boyfriend in the first place .","306741":"most mental illnesses range in severity , so some people s illnesses have more severe symptoms than other people . it also depends on treatment modalities , whether or not someone is on medication or in therapy and how well it works for them .","306742":"i don t have the patience for children and every time i m around them , i just get annoyed and awkward . i don t know how to act around kids .","306743":"i don t know . i don t know if i want children later in life .","306744":"i use an xbox one .","306745":"no , i m not interested in playing the new spiderman game . i m more interested in life is strange , fallout , and the new tomb raider game .","306746":"right now i m drinking a pineapple coconut seagrams , and i have a peach fuzzy naval one in the fridge ! !","306747":"ask me questions while i drink this wine cooler wait for my hair to dry","306748":"i would find a new shop to work in . your tattoo artist s tattoos are their form of art , and they re a reflection of their skill and interests . most shops these days tattoo with discretion , though . i m fairly certain a tattoo artist can turn down a tattoo idea if they re uncomfortable doing that tattoo , especially if it s rooted in some form of oppression racism , sexism , homophobia , etc etc .","306749":"sometimes , actually . i have earphones at work , but i ve been thinking about investing in headphones because they seem more comfortable .","306750":"the political system is corrupt a joke at this point . the economy is terrible and money is being spent in all the wrong places . the top percent obtain all of the wealth , leaving middle and lower classes to struggle immensely . the health care system is horribly expensive and a lot of people in critical need of care don t get proper medical treatment .","306751":"i love them so much . she s incredibly talented ! !","306752":"yeah , all the time . i frequently experience writers block and haven t written anything creatively in quite a while with the exception of one small piece i wrote two weeks ago , but i hate it . sometimes i get bursts of inspiration , but i m mostly just struggling with getting the words out or finding a subject to focus on .","306753":"you re good . however , i won t be following you . i m not interested in your answers , i normally follow people whose answers are in depth .","306754":"i don t generally follow people on command . nevertheless , you re anonymous .","306755":"uh . . . i m not going to tell her something she doesn t want to do . if you respect her , then you ll respect her decision to leave .","306756":"this always happens to me sometimes words come out of my mouth in the wrong order or it sounds differently than what i mean , so i always have to try to backtrack or explain myself whenever that happens . i don t remember the last time it happened specifically but i can guarantee it s been within the last week , lol .","306757":"if it still smells , looks , and or feels fresh still , then i ll still consume it . expiration dates aren t always accurate the only one i m extra cautious of is milk because tbh it always smells terrible to me .","306758":"i miss courtney steph ! ! i mean . . . i still talk to them regularly , but i always enjoyed reading their askfm answers because they re both such interesting intelligent people .","306759":"i m usually quite open about my life , so i post everything from my daily thoughts to current events to my opinions about certain subjects . however , i usually don t post much when i m not in a great mindset , or when i do , i don t express my current feelings so people seldom know how horrible i feel at that time . i talk about mental health a lot because i m an advocate for awareness , but i also don t really talk very often about my daily struggles .","306760":"lol , no . there s a lot wrong with the united states and other people are justified in their opinions .","306761":"it depends entirely on the perspective of the parent because every parent is going to have a different view when it comes to their children dating . i don t personally have an opinion because i m not a parent . i obviously think it s inappropriate for children to date , but as for which age in particular , it would probably have to depend on the personality of the child . i d say anywhere between and years old .","306762":"my mind is basically reeling over everything that s going on in my life , which tends to stress me out .","306763":"same ! ! i need to constantly be drinking something , whether it s coffee or water or iced tea or alcohol lol . i always have something within reach .","306764":"i m happily in a relationship .","306765":"yeah , i have work tomorrow morning hopefully i ll be able to fall asleep around midnight since it s only pm now , lol . i legit have no self control . my father came home from the doctor with a box of coffee from dunkin and i couldn t help myself .","306766":"so i guess i m not sleeping tonight because i just drank two cups of coffee , so y all should ask me questions in the meantime","306767":"enemy is a strong word and it doesn t relate to my life at all .","306768":"i ve never asked myself anonymous questions besides sending myself symbols whenever i want to talk about something . i probably sent one or two anons years upon years ago when i was younger and more immature , but i can t recall any examples .","306769":"no , i don t ask myself questions . depending on how active i am that day , i usually get more questions since people see that i m online . i usually wake up to questions every morning , not counting the ones i get throughout the day .","306770":"uh , yeah . svicide is never something to be taken lightly regardless of how obnoxious a person is being . you re not acting any better than they are by literally telling someone to end their life .","306771":"depends on the situation . some events call for a complete disregard of the person ignoring them while other events call for you to stand up for yourself .","306772":"my current one ? ? i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","306773":"i only have one job .","306774":"okay apparently they re both terrible people , so i would be fine with disowning both of them . lmao . i honestly don t like either of their music anyway .","306775":"pluto . idc what they say , it s still a planet to me .","306776":"some people deal with their issues better when they re alone . try not to take it personally , it isn t a reflection of your friendship at all .","306777":"just scrolling through social media while i wait for my boyfriend to wake up from his nap .","306778":"the best question was the one that asked what music i ve been listening to lately . i always love talking about music . the worst was the anon who claimed that shehitsback was somehow copying me because she s interested in the dna test . some anons reach way too far , their arms must be killing them .","306779":"i never understood it either . it probably stems from the idea that women were and still partially are considered dumber than men so a dumb women would have been more attractive to men in the past . the tradition has probably been ingrained for generations . personally i prefer people with whom i can have intelligent conversations .","306780":"this is adorable thank you so much ! !","306781":"i don t make small talk and people don t generally try to talk to me while i m out . other people are normally too busy with their own errands to stop and talk to a complete stranger .","306782":"can we talk about this fuckin sweetheart of a puppy , omggg .","306783":"? ? ? allison isn t copying me , she s waiting for my results from andme to see if it s worth it . i don t blame her , the test was a bit expensive and it wouldn t be worth it to buy if the results weren t in depth and interesting . cc shehitsback","306784":"only when it concerns my boyfriend , lol . i dislike being the center of attention when it comes to other people , but i crave attention from my boyfriend not that he doesn t give it to me at all , it s just a bpd thing .","306785":"there s evidence that puberty blockers are detrimental to the natural development of children from adolescent through the teen years , so it would be harmful to stunt their puberty .","306786":"if they can afford it , then i see no reason for the parents not to contribute . however , the price of tuition is absolutely ridiculous so i can never expect a family to pay for the entire thing . there are also options such as scholarships and grants that the student can look into while applying to colleges . or they can take out a loan pay it back after they ve graduated .","306787":"what country do you live in ? ? that sounds ideal .","306788":"lol , hell no . i live in the united states and education is very expensive . the only way people get through college for free is if they get in on full ride scholarships .","306789":"our last disagreement was over politics , haha . it was a long time ago , though , so i don t remember the details of the disagreement but we ended up agreeing to disagree and left it at that .","306790":"no , it isn t his decision to make . regardless , he s never had an issue with any of my hair colors because he knows it s my decision alone .","306791":"needing space is normal in any kind of relationship , especially if a person requires more alone time or works through their issues better when they re alone . my boyfriend and i take space from each other occasionally , since he s the type of person who needs alone time to really think and get his sh t together . the silent treatment , on the other hand , is borderline abvsive . you re purposely withholding contact from someone to hurt them , and that isn t healthy by any means .","306792":"yeah , that isn t fair to you relationships should be about compromise , which means that if something doesn t work out then you come to a mutual agreement that benefits both of you . it ideally shouldn t be one way or the other . you re worth more than that , and you shouldn t have to rearrange your life to fit around his schedule and needs . you re just as important .","306793":"occasionally , yeah . however , it s also a bit destructive to think about ideas like that because you realistically should be focusing on the present moment with your partner and making the best out of the moments in front of you . the thought crosses my mind since i m always terrified of him breaking up with me , but being mindful of the present and the things he does every day to prove his love helps .","306794":"well technically there are a few shades of purple in there . but i didn t really decide on a color , i just told my stylist that i wanted a magenta to lavender to purple gradient and i gave her the creative freedom to do what she felt looked best .","306795":"i have a lot of apps on my phone , so it depends on which ones you re talking about . i use various social media apps like fb , instagram , snapchat , tumblr , and twitter . i also have a few photo editing apps , such as vsco afterlight . i also have apps for banking , shopping , music , and food .","306796":"i went to a comedy show last night for the first time , and i was nearly crying from laughing so hard . stand up comedy has always amused me , especially when the comedian talks about really dark material and makes light of their life and struggles . it s always been more relatable to me .","306797":"i personally don t believe it should be legal for the drinking age to be lower than in the united states . honestly , i even think is a bit young for people to be able to legally drink because there are still a lot of issues regarding young adults and drinking , especially when it comes to driving . i can t imagine the drinking age being any lower than it is now because that would only increase the risk of drunk driving .","306798":"yeah , but it s a few years old . i don t necessarily need a new one , but my boyfriend definitely does so i would buy him a car .","306799":"if i magically woke up with million in my bank account , lmao .","306800":"i feel as if i ve been losing control of my life and i m so close to hitting rock bottom again . idk how to fix what i ve done and i have absolutely no self control , my impulsivity is skyrocketing and i don t even care about the consequences of my actions . i put on a good front but in reality , i m a fucking wreck .","306801":"my boyfriend and i were playing with his dog , his dog ended up tripping over himself because he s so clumsy .","306802":"i never understood why people post pictures or videos of themselves crying on social media . idk about you guys , but i have an ugly af crying face . i definitely wouldn t want that on display .","306803":"i buy cost effective products . most off brand products generally have the same active ingredients as their brand counterparts , so most of the time , you re just paying for the brand name .","306804":"writing , editing , painting , time management , and drinking copious amounts of coffee in one sitting .","306805":"just be upfront and honest with them they deserve to know the truth , as difficult as it will be . explain your feelings to them as well as you can and answer any questions they have .","306806":"no , not that i can recall .","306807":"people who sacrifice themselves for the betterment of their families , like parents who have to work long hours to bring food to the table for their children and others who put their own lives at risk to help other people on a daily basis .","306808":"when i traveled to austin , texas , for a gaming convention , i experienced quite a culture shock . as i m originally from new york , i m not used to people actually being nice to me on the street or in facilities , so it was a dramatic change to actually be in a place where people were friendly and courteous and had hospitality .","306809":"ideally , i d like for everything of mine to be deleted . however , i can barely remember the passwords to most of my accounts , so that seems a bit unrealistic haha .","306810":"my fish died . i m so heartbroken .","306811":"there s so such thing as being too old for success . many people reach the peak of their careers after they ve turned , , and even . however , if you re under the mentality that you re too old already then you re already setting yourself up for failure . success is attained when you believe in yourself and work hard to achieve your goals regardless of the obstacles in front of you .","306812":"i m sorry you have to endure that , ugh . but you re right just put in the work until you have what you need to move forward then you can put it all behind you .","306813":"arrogance , where that person thinks that they know better than anyone else regardless of credentials or knowledge . they usually need to have the last word in of every argument and think that everyone else is wrong except themselves . i know one or two people with that trait , and it s terrible .","306814":"my day was fine exhausting , but fine . there was a lot of police activity in the area because they unearthed a dead body close to where i work , so it took me much longer to get home than usual . there were helicopters everywhere . i m just looking forward to sitting down and drinking some coffee because my mind has been a wreck today .","306815":"i never really understood the purpose of anonymously telling a person to quit doing whatever vice they re doing , as if that person is actually going to heed their words . i m going to live my life regardless of how you think of it , and when i deem it s time to quit , i will quit . you re wasting your breath by trying to convince me otherwise .","306816":"i ve been weaning myself off of cigarettes slowly , but i don t really have any intentions on quitting completely yet .","306817":"because i smoke cigarettes , among other life threatening and risky behavior .","306818":"i don t even expect myself to see tbh , that s pushing it a wee bit .","306819":"people gain by trust through earning it close friendships , loyalty , chemistry , etc etc . i don t trust most people and i don t willingly give out my trust to people whom i don t know well , and it does take a while for me to warm up to someone .","306820":"you re right , i should just ingest every unhealthy food i see because not caring about one facet of my health means i shouldn t care about any facets of my health at all .","306821":"my boyfriend and i accidentally took a three hour nap when we went on vacation last weekend , if that counts . we passed out so hard that we didn t get up until pm .","306822":"i just know i want to be happy , and i kinda know how to get there , but it s going to be a long and continuous process .","306823":"i ve come to realize that if you have high expectations in life then you re going to ultimately be disappointed . as a result , i try not to have any expectations in general .","306824":"life versus death typically , the notion that some people think they have the moral high ground to take the life of another person if they re deemed too much of a danger to society , much like the whole for the greater good mentality . it s interesting to think about because mostly everyone has a different notion of what morality really means .","306825":"i have a lot heathers , queen of the damned , the crow , american psycho , the lord of the rings , the punisher , girl interrupted , and sweeney todd , just to name a few .","306826":"hello i m fine , just drinking alcohol after what turned out to be a terrible end to my evening in an attempt to feel better . the last two days have been beautiful because my boyfriend and i took a spontaneous mini vacation , but i walked into a shitshow when i got home . i m so done .","306827":"talking shit about me behind my back trying to turn my friends against me simply because they didn t agree with my perspectives on things . obviously i cut them out of my life , as well as the people who believed them .","306828":"depends on the circumstance , since some people are negative for realistic reasons and others are negative because they re willfully ignorant of the brighter side of things . sometimes my boyfriend can have a negative outlook on things , especially if he s going through a rough patch , but i usually try to remind him of the things that are going well in his life and that he s strong and can survive everything that s thrown his way .","306829":"i wish it was cold outside . i ve been craving cold , late nights with bonfires and brews .","306830":"yes , if there s one thing i ve learned in life , it s to take responsibility for my own actions and mistakes . i have no issue with owning up to the wrong things i ve done because i always know there s room for improvement .","306831":"i think it s both , but mankind certainly is making the severe progression of global warming even worse due to our actions , especially when it comes to agriculture .","306832":"i remember those days , ugh . getting back to college was always the worst but eventually you ll get into the groove of it . i kinda miss attending classes and learning .","306833":"usually landscapes , or things with trees within them . this is one of the paintings i ve done .","306834":"experiences ! ! there s nothing better than spending money on going on a vacation because you make so many memories in the meantime .","306835":"i used to dabble in photography , but lately i ve been writing and painting . it s always been a good form of emotional release for me .","306836":"curly fries are the bomb .","306837":"i m absolutely against animal hunting , unless it s for survival purposes . as a sport , there s no reason for it .","306838":"you ve never seen them before tbh .","306839":"somewhat , yeah or at least severely reduced in price . the cost of tuition these days is absolutely ridiculous and should be more affordable for people with low income .","306840":"i don t really know my neighbors besides the old man who lives next door . he s an asshole and yells at the landscapers who cut my lawn .","306841":"heathers is one of my favorite movies ! ! i ve never seen the show or the musical , but i ve watched the movie countless times . winona ryder christian slater . . . oh my god . i love dark films like that .","306842":"the last time my card was about to expire , they automatically sent me a new one in the mail .","306843":"if i killed someone accidentally , i don t think i would be able to forgive myself because it was likely preventable , and i have a tendency to hold onto certain things that i ve done and wish that i could have done them a different way . if it was in self defense , then i don t think i would feel as strongly about it because there s justification for my actions , especially considering i would think my life was in extreme danger .","306844":"it isn t normal , but it s definitely a side effect of your bpd because we constantly need reassurance and validation , and if our loved ones aren t in contact with us , we feel as if they re purposely harming us by withholding contact . i don t think you should cut ties at all . you have to try to rationalize to yourself that this person is living their own life and may not have time to text you back as often as they would like , and it isn t being done in a malicious manner . they have no reason to purposely ignore you , and you have to remind yourself of that . idk if this helps or not , but i do understand exactly how you feel because i ve lashed out for the same reasons regarding certain people in my life when i ve felt ignored too . it s shitty but you have to be mindful of everything and take into consideration things that are going on in their lives as well .","306845":"it doesn t annoy me , but it makes me wonder why people even say those things to begin with , especially considering i don t post any photos of my body on the internet .","306846":"i honestly don t remember , lol . it s probably been a few months . i do all of my banking online and via my banking apps .","306847":"you perish into the earth .","306848":"obviously unless you die .","306849":"my life has been chaotic , confusing , yet joyful all at the same time .","306850":"i would probably break up with him , especially if he tried to hide it from me and act as if nothing was wrong . i won t stand for being disrespected in such a way and it s one of the worst forms of betrayal .","306851":"i don t concern myself with other people s opinions . people have the right to believe what they desire , obviously as long as they re not a threat to themselves or to others in the process .","306852":"no , i m usually grateful that he shares his thoughts and feelings with me when he s going through a difficult time . he s generally a very closed off person , so the fact that he s revealing himself to me in such an emotional way shows how comfortable he is . if i m in a bad place too , i m somewhat able to compartmentalize my feelings so that i can help him the best way i can .","306853":"the fact alone that they re insulting a person simply because they disagree with them says a lot about who they are as a person . you can disagree with someone without making it personal and insulting a person , whether it s due to their looks or their personality .","306854":"my boyfriend and i are taking a mini spontaneous vacation tomorrow .","306855":"i ve always dreamed of traveling across the country via car and visiting the grand canyon . i haven t done it yet because i don t have the time or the spare money to make such a trip .","306856":"does anyone have any questions ? ? i ll answer everything as long as they re not inappropriate","306857":"my boyfriend and i went to rtx , which is a video game convention hosted by rooster teeth . we had weekend passes , and then in our free time , we visited a few restaurants and went bar hopping in austin .","306858":"i haven t gone at all this year , no .","306859":"no , i haven t even worn a bathing suit at all this season .","306860":"years ago , yeah . not recently .","306861":"i definitely don t , lol . you don t even know what my body looks like .","306862":"no , i m not a pushy person at all at least to my knowledge . i m always afraid that i m being pushy in fear of being manipulative , so i m not really sure if i actually am or not . i know quite a few pushy people , though , and i would hate to become like them .","306863":"no , you re totally justified in your feelings ! ! i would be bothered if i came home and there was a house full of people and i felt as if i didn t have anywhere to relax , especially after a long day at work . it s common courtesy to ask your partner if they re comfortable with having people over it s your living space too .","306864":"you won t be helping her by consoling her because it s only going to make her miss the relationship that much more and harder for her to move on from you . you re better off letting it pass with time , as hard as it might be .","306865":"it depends on the context and how discreet the innuendos are . if it s something that a kid of that particular age group won t pick up on , then i suppose it s fine . adults watch childrens tv shows with their kids so a joke every now and again would be entertaining for the adults at least .","306866":"thank you ! !","306867":"perhaps three at most .","306868":"my boyfriend and close friends .","306869":"aw , thank you ! ! that means a lot to me .","306870":"i ve been on small vacations , but not anything overseas . i ve been to upstate new york and texas , among other places .","306871":"abandonment .","306872":"obstacles by syd matters https youtu . be nqwcpez gy","306873":"i m a loyal person if i say i m by your side , then i ll back you up percent . the only exception to this is if a friend is exhibiting abvsive or toxic behavior , then i ll distance myself from them because i don t need that in my life .","306874":"i think it s disgusting . i don t know why you would pretend to have a mental illness when people around the world struggle with real mental health problems on a daily basis . it s an insult to survivors .","306875":"i ve never believed in god , so this question doesn t really apply to me .","306876":"i m bored does anyone have any questions ? ?","306877":"i get emotionally invested into everything that comes into my life , which can be both a blessing and a curse . on the one hand , it makes me passionate about the things i care about . however , it does set me up for a lot of disappointment and hurt at times","306878":"good morning texts , listening to great music with friends , having no traffic on the way to work , the moments when your pet gives you extra attention , laughing with no inhibitions , being immersed in nature .","306879":"it isn t my all time favorite song , but watsky s new song welcome to the family is my jam rn . well how d you like to split this l and tell me what you ve witnessed . if the price of life is hell , well no one ever had to sell me on how nice a fire smells .","306880":"honesty loyalty . i have no room in my life for people who will be dishonest to my face or pretend to be my friend due to some ulterior motive .","306881":"the same way other people decide to own houses when they have the money to put down .","306882":"in the next years , i m planning on getting married and owning a house . i also want to be published perhaps , but i don t have a strict deadline for that because i know a lot of luck is involved . . . and i need to actually write something first .","306883":"thank you ! ! my day was fine . i woke up a bit later than planned , but i managed to get to work on time . after work , i ran a few errands and i ve been sitting outside with an iced coffee for the past minutes because it s so nice out rn .","306884":"i honestly don t know . i held the door open for a person who was carrying a lot of heavy items into the building , but that s not so much a good deed as it is common sense .","306885":"mental health advocacy , environmental conservation , lgbt rights .","306886":"not always . sometimes i don t even have a plan a because i can be rather impulsive and spontaneous , haha .","306887":"i like getting anonymous questions pertaining my to my life experiences , and its always humbling to see people thanking me for being open about mental health because it helps them . the pros outweigh the cons , in my eyes . i get a lot of anon hate , but i also get a few people who thank me which makes everything worth it .","306888":"i wasn t popular in school at all . basically nobody knew me except my small circle of friends , which i preferred .","306889":"the law firm i used to work for had really ridiculous commercials , lmao .","306890":"i haven t watched mtv in at least ten years , lol .","306891":"having a beer next to a warm fire when it s chilly enough outside to wear

skin tone color ? ? none of that avatar looking shit .","306897":"my boyfriend and i have been trying to schedule a camping trip , actually . we might go mid september when the weather is a little cooler .","306898":"poetalunam is a username i ve used for around two years now . i got the words from latin , although apparently my latin is wrong . it s supposed to roughly translate to poetry of the moon . leigh is a name i ve always gone by .","306899":"i think it s plausible , but i never read into it enough to develop a coherent theory on it myself .","306900":"well , yeah . by saying there are only two genders , you re insinuating that other trans people don t exist or don t count if they don t fit that binary . there are thousands of trans people who aren t a man or a woman , so it is transphobic to say otherwise .","306901":"if you ignore a problem , the problem isn t going to simply go away in fact , it might become worse . i try to address problems as they arise because i used to try to ignore problems in the past and it never worked out in my favor .","306902":"i don t watch south park .","306903":"no , no , and yes .","306904":"i think there should be some monitoring involved , but nothing as strict as demanding your child s phone and reading their text messages . however , i also don t believe children should even have phones until they re a teenager , perhaps around years old . as for diary reading , i m strictly against reading a child s diary unless the parent has reasonable cause to believe that the child is involved in drugs or something else like that .","306905":"i understand . i ve always wanted to write a book as well , but i wouldn t know where to begin .","306906":"i ve never wanted to go to space , but space does fascinate me . there s so much we still don t know about the universe .","306907":"thank you ! ! idk if i m going to post it anywhere because it s basically bullsh t stream of consciousness stuff , and it somehow took a really dark turn midway through , lol . i started describing thunderstorms and now i m talking about the devil s embrace . hm .","306908":"i m terrified of haunted houses , so i ve never been in one before .

something . ya gotta start somewhere .","306910":"i believe in facets of intersectional feminism in that i believe in equal rights , but i don t adhere to the label of feminist due to the fact that neo feminism isn t taken seriously in today s age and a lot of self proclaimed feminists focus on insignificant issues as opposed to real life problems . this current wave of feminism seems more of a trend than anything else , and i don t want to associate myself with that .","306911":"i don t really think there s a situation , it s just her being exposed for who she truly is after people ignoring her for all of these years , lol . i m glad babycadiex has spoken up about it , though , otherwise i would have never known about all of the things she s done . at least now i know not to answer her questions anymore .","306912":"i m drunkenly watching a documentary on netflix .","306913":"isn t that where people believe that they re partially not human , i . e . they re also part animal or mythical creature ? ? i have to admit i don t have a full understanding of what otherkin is , but if that s the case , then i think that s a bit ridiculous .","306914":"i m not entirely sure tbh i ve just always liked creepy , dark things ever since i was a teenager . there s probably some underlying psychological meaning behind it , but i don t care enough to delve into it rn

either .","306920":"we re remodeling the kitchen ! ! it s a lot of work , but i m excited because the kitchen hasn t been remodeled since prior to when i was born , which was nearly years ago .","306921":"a resort is a popular destination for people who are on vacation that s an all in one establishment meaning it has a hotel , restaurants , bars , shopping quarters , entertainment , etc etc . instead of staying in a cheap hotel in a city near their ideal destination , people may instead choose to stay at resorts because it s more convenient and inclusive .","306922":"my weekend has been fine , but busy . i ve been working on and off all day because i want to get all of my freelance work done by tonight , since i may be spending the entire day with my boyfriend tomorrow if he s off from work . i woke up from a nap about an hour ago , as well . when i m done with my freelance work , i have to clean out and organize a hallway in the upstairs of my house so that we can move boxes into it from the kitchen . i m hoping to get everything done by pm .","306923":"i ve never been to a five star hotel before . usually my boyfriend and i will stay in cheap motels although we did stay in a beautiful hotel room with an eat in kitchen and a balcony overlooking the ocean once a few years ago ! !","306924":"i ve never stayed at a resort before , at least not the kind of resort that you re likely thinking of . i ve been to an all inclusive dude ranch with the exception of some activities and alcohol , and those trips were always a lot of fun .","306925":"no , i disagree . while the prospect of having a child might be hurtful to some relationships , it s usually because the relationship itself is flawed in some significant way to the point where neither person can handle a big change , which causes the relationship to crumble . sometimes having children can enrich existing relationships too , though . it can cause you to develop stronger feelings for your partner , seeing them in a parental role . i know plenty of relationships which have strengthened after the couple had children .","306926":"i received the warning one or two times on my old accounts , but i haven t received any warnings on this account .","306927":"no , i m not a prejudiced or hateful person by any means .","306928":"no , i ve been fortunate in that no one has ever tried to

highly recommend this book ! ! i watched the movie before reading the book , but the book was wonderful as well . it really gave you concise insight into the protagonist s mind moreso than the movie was able to convey .","306945":"no . hate is a very strong word , and there s only one or two people whom i can say that i genuinely hate . most of my coworkers are pretty chill , either way . i get along with them all and i have no issues with anyone . we all mind our own business and work on our respective assignments .","306946":"eventually , no generally if a person keeps repeating their mistakes over again , even after being talked to about the problem and how to remedy the problem , then that shows that they don t care enough about your relationship to work actively to improve themselves . i m assuming this means a big mistake , though . not something insignificant like leaving a dirty dish in the sink , lol .","306947":"it depends entirely on the situation . however , just because you have problems trusting others doesn t necessarily mean that you have a problem per say lacking trust in others is usually an outcome of an environmental cause , you re given a strong reason not to trust other people because you ve been betrayed so often in the past . that doesn t imply that not trusting others is wrong since it s a normal reaction to being betrayed , manipulated , or abvsed . for example , i have problems trusting people but i don t really consider it a personal fault because it s an effect of what has happened to me , and those people who are worthy of being trusted will understand why it takes you a long time to trust them .","306948":"yes , i occasionally get caught up in the middle of disputes that have nothing to do with me , unfortunately . i have two friends who absolutely cannot stand each other , and they always seem to bring the other person up whenever we re hanging out , which gets awkward since i m still friends with both people .","306949":"i want a new brain . i m getting tired of my moods being so unpredictable , my depression being only somewhat manageable , my anxiety skyrocketing over the most insignificant things , and my thought processes behavior being so erratic and impulsive . if someone has a mentally healthy brain on the black market , hit your boy up","306950":"my days normally consist of work , unfortunately . i wake up around am and i don t get home until pm , unless i have errands or appointments , which means i ll get home later than that . my weekends are usually more liberal , but i do try to work on the weekends as well .","306951":"depends on who i m talking to . i usually prefer texting people , but i always talk on the phone with my boyfriend because it s simply easier than texting . we call each other every night when we get home from work and before bed if i m not seeing him that night .","306952":"i want a cup of coffee rn . i m probably going to stop by on my way home from work and pick up coffee cigarettes .","306953":"i was relatively unknown when i was in high school , so i m not sure if i had a good or bad reputation , if i even had one at all . i m sure people spread rumors about me but i don t personally remember anything . high school was a long time ago for me .","306954":"rofl , no . people are allowed to use askfm at any age as long as they abide by the terms conditions , which allison does . there s no age limit to social media . cc shehitsback","306955":"i ve always admired stephen king , anne rice , and francesca lia block .","306956":"i started writing poetry when i was years old because it was the only healthy outlet i had to cope with the things that were going on in my life .","306957":"i think people can use askfm at any age , as long as they re not wasting their lives answering pointless questions letting other aspects of their life slide . tbh i didn t think i was going to still be on askfm at this age , lol . when i was younger , i would have sworn that i wouldn t be using social media after the age of . . . yet i m turning years old in three months .","306958":"breaking the habit by linkin park https www . youtube . com watch ? v v h

russian , german , and irish .","306962":"i never have before , but it s definitely on my bucket list . i ve always wanted to go ziplining through a rain forest .","306963":"yes , it s happened to me quite a few times . most recently , it was the news that someone who frequently posted in a fb group i m in had passed away she had been posting in the group not even a week before she passed . it was extremely upsetting . i ve also learned things about old friends while i was friends with them that were so shocking and unsettling that i had to cut them out of my life for my own well being .","306964":"not at all your gender doesn t determine which products you should or should not use . it s unfortunate that most beauty products are geared toward women , but that doesn t make it wrong if men and others want to use them too . self care is important .","306965":"drink coffee smoke cigarettes .","306966":"just because tattoos are painful doesn t mean i won t get them , lol . the personal value of a tattoo means so much more to me than the pain i ll endure . most of my tattoos haven t been in painful spots , regardless . the most painful one was my ribs , and i was on the verge of tears for that one .","306967":"probably about a week or so ago . the weather around here has been pretty unpredictable , with severe thunderstorms and sun showers and tornado warnings , etc etc .","306968":"coffee , whether it s hot or iced . i ve literally never said no to coffee before unless i was severely sick .","306969":"happiness is waking up with the love of your life and having the entire day off to do whatever you want at your own pace , with no expectations . for me personally , it means spending the morning outside with my loved one with endless cups of coffee and good conversation .","306970":"i immediately think of my partying days , where i would basically go party all weekend long in between working and going to school . it was a hazy time of my life , but every time someone brings up the old days , that s usually what they mean .","306971":"those are undergarments worn by human beings . congratulations on having a basic education on clothing .","306972":"aahh , i have so many ! ! i guess i ll narrow it down to two , though draco malfoy chloe price . i ve always found draco to be a fascinating character because he s essentially a victim of abvse , and throughout the series , you can see him trying to break free from the reins of his family s expectations but nevertheless still being held back against his will . you realize as the series goes on that he has genuinely been brainwashed into believing what he does by his father , and he doesn t want to live that lifestyle at all . chloe price , on the other hand , has always been a relatable character to me because of her strength , impulsivity , reckless need to escape , and passion for her friends . she s one of the most unpredictable and entertaining fictional characters i ve witnessed and the depth of her personality knows no bounds .","306973":"i would invent a one time pill that would permanently eradicate all of my mental health struggles , including my depressive episodes , anxiety and panic attacks , svicidal and intrusive thoughts , and triggers , among others . it would make me life easier because having a life without mental illness would make me feel so much more confident in myself , so much more stable in my self image , and ordinary tasks won t seem daunting anymore .","306974":"a supportive , encouraging family who bears no judgment toward the

boyfriend how i ve had the inspiration to write lately but i have no idea what to write about . he told me to do sorta a stream of consciousness thing and write what comes to mind with no judgement , and build upon those paragraphs when i m done , whether it s by deleting some parts , expanding on others , etc etc . he said eventually i ll find my way around what it is i want to say .","306980":"i

me personally if i knew the language . i would also be able to converse more easily with my boyfriend s family .","306986":"no ? ? being friends with someone doesn t mean you admire them . liking someone and admiring someone are two completely different things . i find admiration to be strange because i ve done nothing admirable , so it wouldn t make sense for someone else to admire me . my friends don t admire me , they treat me like a human being like anyone else on this earth .","306987":"unfortunately , yeah . i try to interact with them as little as possible .","306988":"for the most part , yes . although there are basic standard moral codes that are universally accepted , it doesn t necessarily mean that all people agree with them or abide by them . they re dependent upon your own personal experiences , so everyone is going to have a slightly different moral code compared to everyone else .","306989":"i think it depends entirely on what the con is how much of an impact you believe it can potentially have on you your relationship . everyone has different standards . however , if this person has everything else you re looking for with the exception of that one con , then i would personally attempt to pursue it anyway . open dialogue with them and express that it may be an issue but you want to explore this first and see if you can t work around it . in my experience , it s always been better for me to experience things and learn from those experiences , even if they eventually ended badly . you honestly never know what may happen and sometimes opportunities present themselves in strange ways .","306990":"i just went to check your answers realized you deleted everything , lol . but regardless , idk why some anons make such a big deal over things like this . people can use their pages to answer questions in however way they want . if that s something that bothers you , then don t . . . follow . . . them . . . ? ? it s that simple .","306991":"lol , this is true . these days , i ve just been deleting percent of questions or other crap people have sent me . i ve noticed an alarming increase in the amount of anons complaining about their lives rather than sending actual questions . i understand needing to vent , but like . . . do so on your own account . i can guarantee you that most people you send these statements to don t actually care about your issues .","306992":"why does this sound more to me like a thinly veiled excuse to complain about littlesha than an actual question ? ? if you re going to ask a question , then ask it . if you want to complain about another askfm user , then do so on your own page . my account isn t a dumping ground for other people s thoughts concerns .","306993":"i m fairly good at keeping people s secrets . i believe that if someone trusts in you enough to confide a secret in you , then you should live up to that promise by keeping it to yourself . i don t believe i ve ever

talking about outofthewhoredinary , though . in that case , then i m assuming she s real . it isn t exactly something that s a concern to me .","306998":"my day went well , thanks for asking i ended up going out with a friend last night , so i didn t feel too great when i woke up because i got home later than expected . but i had a good breakfast , drank coffee , and took advil , so it wasn t too terrible at all . i got home about an hour ago , and i just booted up my laptop to catch up on the questions i ve missed since last night . i m also listening to some chill , lo fi hip hop beats on youtube , which is really relaxing .","306999":"like i stated previously over the past few days , i don t wear perfume . sometimes i ll spritz some body spray , but i usually just rely on deodorant .","307000":"no , i m always really cautious when it comes to who i send texts to because i m terrified of that happening , lol . i always double check the message and recipient before i send .","307001":"it s a personal matter so i d rather not get into it . there are some things in my life i do keep private , especially regarding my personal friendships relationships .","307002":"i wear

.","307004":"the year is more than halfway over , lol . there isn t much for me to look forward to besides the fall i am excited for the cooler weather , so that i can have more bonfires with my boyfriend and friends . i don t have anything special planned , though .","307005":"i don t really get attacks of paranoia . my paranoia is just longstanding consistent throughout the days weeks . there will be some circumstances where my paranoia is greater than usual , but it isn t debilitating .","307006":"wow , i m totally the grandpa friend .","307007":"sometimes i wonder what goes through the minds of these anons for them to even come close to thinking that this is an acceptable statement to tell someone . what on earth makes you think that i would do such a thing for the public to see ? ?","307008":"i ve been on askfm for . . . omg , it has to be upwards of years at this point .","307009":"bad could mean a lot of different things , so it depends entirely on what you mean by that . i ve never lived in jersey , though .","307010":"is that even a thing ? ? i never understood the desire to actually buy followers on social media .","307011":"it s unfortunate that people will continue to talk about others even when they re not on askfm anymore although brittany recently returned . i stay out of useless drama as much as i can , but liam is my friend so i felt the need to put in my two cents . he would appreciate it if everyone stopped talking about him .","307012":"i don t normally comment on other people s posts on askfm , but i never had the impression that liam is fake . i have him added on other social media where he posts consistently , and i ve seen photos of his children . he s reserved on social media because of his occupation . it s a high risk job and i m fairly certain he does undercover work , so a low social media profile is integral .","307013":", .","307014":"? ? ? i m insecure myself so i fail to see how any of my answers promote some unrealistic notion of perfection .","307015":"i think self love is extremely important in order to be truly happy with yourself , you have to get to the point where you love and accept yourself for who you are . if you don t like who you are , then try to change it . otherwise you ll be stuck in the same mindsets and routines and never progress forward .","307016":"they re both pretty frowned upon in the lgbt community . just call them gay people or simply people .","307017":"? ? ? other people s friendships relationships aren t my concern . this isn t high school .","307018":"i never understood the point of blasting music in public , either . it s a universal understanding that its obnoxious and unnecessary .","307019":"living a good life means that you re living according to your own standards and in pursuit of your own happiness . you re doing things that are rewarding and fulfilling and living your life to its fullest extent . this is subjective and it varies depending on the person , though . good can mean different things to different people .","307020":"i don t really believe there s a correlation between strength and the amount of friends a person has . however , having no friends can be a lonesome existence and in some circumstances can make life harder because it means you don t have a support system .","307021":"lmfao , no . mariah wouldn t be anonymous on my page she deactivated . like i said earlier , we re all adults here . there s literally no reason to try to cause drama based off of something so stupid .","307022":"it s fine to cry regardless of who you are . crying is a natural human reaction to stimuli .","307023":"i ve had my identity stolen , if that counts for anything . it was a pain in the ass . i basically had to reset all of my bank and credit cards , get a new social security card , sign up for fraud alerts , get a new drivers license , etc etc .","307024":"i may seem like i have my shit together and that i m following a plan , but in reality , things are falling apart and i m losing control . i have no idea what i m doing or how to get to where i need to be , and that scares the shit out of me .","307025":"i never disagreed with that part of it if it s posing a sanitary hazard , then yeah that s obviously gross if the glass wasn t clean . when people used to come to my house , i would clean and tidy things up to look presentable . but to have the house pristine is a bit uncommon . it s an ideal setting but a lot of people don t have the opportunity to deep cleanse as often as you do .","307026":"i never said you were too young to have kids . i was insinuating that when you have children , it ll be harder to keep the house clean all the time like it is now . either way , perhaps i m coming from a different perspective because my family has never had a pristine home even though i do routinely clean .","307027":"if you re worried about gossip and have the time to keep your house pristine , then i m assuming you re very young and don t have children . i don t have children either , but i m realistic and know that you can t keep a house clean . it s unreasonable .","307028":"yeah , that s incredibly rude . no one s house is perfect and they re probably even more aware of the state of their house than you are , you don t need to be rude about it . if it s causing a sanitary issue , that s a different problem . but if there are a few dishes in the sink and the cabinets are a bit dusty , then that s not a big deal at all because everyone s house is like that .","307029":"yeah , it s a pain in the ass . that s mostly the reason why i m cautious when making new friends or getting to know other people i don t want them to take advantage of my kindness or think that i m someone who s easily vulnerable .","307030":"mondays are the hardest days for me to experience because it s difficult for me to go back to work after having two days off in a row . i like my job , but my commute is long and stressful . it takes a lot out of me to drive to and from work , and i never look forward to it .","307031":"i don t have obsessive compulsive disorder , so no . you also shouldn t use mental illnesses as adjectives to mean something that has no correlation to mental illness . it s demeaning to those who actually struggle with disorders like ocd .","307032":"it depends on the question , but go ahead . if i don t answer it , it means i was uncomfortable posting it .","307033":"by supporting , i mean using your knowledge to educate others not ridicule strangers whom you assume eat meat without a care in the world . you d get your message across more precisely if you took the time to educate people who are unaware of veganism , instead of making snide remarks anonymously .","307034":"? ? ? this has nothing to do with me , but okay . if you re so concerned about what people eat , then advocate for animal rights as opposed to sending anonymous messages on the internet .","307035":"i used to identify as an intersectional feminist for about a year or two . however , within the past year , i ve distanced myself from the neo feminism movement because a lot of it advocates for things that don t make much of a difference in the world . i still hold many of the same beliefs , though , such as civil rights , mental health advocacy , lgbt rights , race , religion , etc etc .","307036":"no , i never studied old english .","307037":"i m actually in a fairly good mood today , although i attribute that mainly to the fact that i ve had three cups of coffee , lmao . as i already explained in a previous answer , i ve been trying to write something creatively today but i haven t gotten the words down on paper yet . it s frustrating but i don t want to give up just yet .","307038":"eh , sometimes . i know how to weave my words together in person , but they also come out fragmented and not as eloquent because my mind often races too fast for my mouth to keep up . it s easier for me to keep up with my mind while typing on a computer .","307039":"no , i don t find that attractive at all . it s extremely relentless and forceful , and it means that person cannot take no for an answer . if a person asks another one out and they initially say no , the ideal thing for that person to do is accept their response and move on . by repeating the question , it places unnecessary pressure on the other individual to the point where they eventually date the other out of pity , fear , or frustration . that isn t a good basis upon which to establish a relationship .","307040":"aw , thank you ! ! of course . i enjoy the answers of these pages because they put a lot of thought into their answers country peach urlsareshittbh perfectionistgirl livibates

up as four on saturday four on sunday . they take me about minutes each , so it isn t too bad .","307044":"is it just me or is askfm dead today ? ? i guess people actually have things to do . if anyone is online , y all should ask me questions keep me occupied .","307045":"buy a house a new car for my boyfriend , then place the rest into savings .","307046":"sometimes , but usually i have it laying out somewhere . i don t bring it with me everywhere i go .","307047":"besides writing freelance for my job , not really . i just finished an iced coffee , so i may make another cup of coffee since that s the only thing that motivates me to finish my work on the weekends , lol . i also just placed an order for a myle , which is a nicotine vape with a few different flavors . i m hoping it helps me cut down on smoking cigarettes .","307048":"i prefer friends who are down to earth , honest sometimes blunt , intelligent , and funny . i don t think i would get along with someone if they didn t have a similar sense of humor . my friends range in personality types , though , so it all depends on whether or not we have chemistry among meeting each other for the first few times . most of the people i associate with , such as friends and coworkers , meet the above traits .","307049":"not generally our lives are always changing we experience new things every day , so there s usually always something to discuss . in addition , politics and music and video games and our other interests are constantly evolving , so that adds further discussion to our chats .","307050":"it s interesting you ask this because i was discussing the dark web with an anon on my page a few days ago . it s something that has always intrigued me , but i would absolutely never delve into the dark web myself for fear of my own safety and the safety of my loved ones . there are a lot of horrors that take place in the dark web , including the black market , sxx trafficking , arms trading , etc etc .","307051":"interesting ! ! thank you , i wasn t aware that existed . i usually don t bother putting labels on myself anymore , but it s good to know that such a term exists .","307052":"i ve read that bi refers to two or more , but not all . it s why i ve always referred to myself as bisexual . however , if there s a more accurate term , feel free to tell me .","307053":"i m bisexual , so i m attracted to multiple genders of people .","307054":"i m not entirely sure , but i ve been using this site for the greater part of years , so kudos to askfm for keeping their audience .","307055":"lmao . if you re talking about what i m assuming you re talking about , then it only happened within the last two hours .","307056":"we had discussions about sex in middle school they touched upon sex and stds during health class in high school . it was so long ago , though . i honestly don t remember anything about them .","307057":"yes , i genuinely do like my job . it isn t stressful like any of my old jobs were , my managers are incredibly understanding of my mental health issues , and i like the actual work that i do .","307058":"i love true crime documentaries and tv shows . murder investigations have always intrigued me since i was young so i m immediately hooked if something i m watching revolves around crime . i really enjoyed the netflix original regarding oj simpson s trial . it s extremely informative and accurate .","307059":"so i received a bunch of questions regarding gender they all disappeared before i could answer them . i m assuming that anon got banned . however , they asked how many genders there are there isn t a number associated with gender because it exists on a spectrum . the anon also inquired as to why there are so many genders now compared to years ago , when there was just male and female male and female are sexes , not genders , so they still exist . for a long time , people thought that you could only be a man or a woman , but as we learn more about gender , we become open to the idea that gender isn t limited to just a man or a woman and it occurs in a spectrum format . the anon also called trans people transxxual and indicated that those who were trans weren t normal people this is also false , as the term transxxual is extremely outdated and doesn t reflect what transgender actually is . in addition , to refer to cis people as normal insinuates that being cis is almost a default , which shouldn t be encouraged .","307060":"i can still offer advice and lend an ear to those who need to vent . because i struggle , i understand what it s like for other people to also struggle and it provides comfort to people , knowing they re not alone .","307061":"unfortunately , yes . it s something i ve dealt with first hand with someone in my life for basically as far as i can remember .","307062":"i ve never had a surprise party before , and tbh i don t know if i would ever want one . i usually have to prepare myself for big outings and it would probably catch me off guard .","307063":"my boyfriend frequently tells me how much i mean to him and how i m a saving grace in his life . coming from a person who means a lot to me , it feels good to hear those words . i also occasionally get anons here on askfm who have told me that i ve helped them a lot with mental health , and it makes me feel good about myself knowing that i ve helped someone else .","307064":"i love sushi ! ! i suggest a cucumber roll or california roll since they don t have raw fish in them .","307065":"this is true i worked for a

that made me laugh . he s one of the few people who actually do make me genuinely laugh .","307075":"when i worked in retail , people would harass me because they believed retail workers were lesser people than others , as if working in a retail store wasn t a real job . i was treated as if i wasn t even human by some customers , because they didn t see me as a human being . i was just a cashier

i mainly use hulu to watch the x files and how i met your mother .","307087":"nah , but i ve always suggested the idea to my boyfriend and his friends . they play a lot of multiplayer games and are absolutely hilarious when they play , so they would likely garner a large audience on twitch .","307088":"i don t know what the requirements are . i also don t live independently and i don t make nearly enough money to take care of a child to begin with , so at this point in time , i wouldn t want to foster a child .","307089":"obviously i can t change your mind , so we ll simply have to agree
