what happened ?","1765":"reaper puts his arm down and overall looks shocked to hear what geno said . . what . . ?","1766":"i wouldn t mind that either . . reaper then holds his arm out for genos but first i m reaping the ones who put us all here to begin with . .","1767":". . heh , you still are a nervous wreck . . reaper chuckled a bit love . . it ll be okay , from what i can tell . . everyone is still in one piece . . but as soon as i get out of here i m reaping whoever hurt our kiddos . . and reaping that purple squirrel for landing me here in the first place . . . . . . . . i m . . i m still sorry i . . i ended up here and couldn t even go check on you . . you were knocked out just as long as i was . .","1768":". . i m always doing better with you here . . but are you okay ?","1769":"i did . . ? sorry about that love . . reaper just gives geno a faint smile","1770":"heh . .","1771":"huh ? ? w what happened to geno . . ! ? reaper was now worried","1772":"aw . . reaper unfortunately doesn t seem to hear geno , he s still out cold beside his tsun","1773":"they were real princes in dreamtale ? ! but that means they should of ruled over their dreamtale not the whole multiverse . . right ?","1774":"dream is a prince ? ? reaper looks genuinely shocked about that","1775":"it was actually easy to do , his grasp was that weak his arms just fell when geno moved , that normally isn t the case , it would usually be a pain for him to get away from reaper","1776":"geno can hear muttering that sounds a awful lot like . . b bikini . . . geno . . yep that was definitely reaper , dreaming about geno in a bikini , some things never change","1777":"aw . . when he wakes up he will find his yanderes arms wrapped around his skull , reaper had hugged him when they both fell asleep","1778":"nurse i think i ve changed my mind then . . dr that sounds a lot worse than just dying . . ahem we will try to help him then ! i m really shocked . . you made him somehow not sound evil . .","1779":"dr wait what ? they actually look shocked , i don t think very many people know that s what the grim reapers job is","1780":"nurse but your dying ! ! ! look at your head ! ! your bleeding ! ! we cant just sit here ! ! you need help ! more than he does ! dr would . . . would it be a bad thing if we let death die ? i don t agree with kiiiing of any kind but . . this is the grim reaper we re talking about . . wouldn t we be saving lives if he s gone ? nurse worry about that later harold we need to help him ! dr oh him ? that s geno , he s a special case . . those injuries are actually permanent . . there really is nothing we can do sadly . . i have tried . . but we could pull the plug on death . . talking about kiiiing genos husband in front of him . . nice","1781":"geno will probably not want to leave reapers side when he sees how horrific he looks , he had magic ivs hooked to his soul , a oxygen mask along with several wires leading to a monitor that kept track of his soulbeat , he looks like a absolute train wreck and it doesn t help raven is seen laying right beside him in another bed in the same condition the doctors after they ve calmed down a tad , turn their attention to geno dr are you okay ! ? ! ? a nurse then proceeds to pick up geno and place him on a stretcher to wheel him out of the room","1782":"dr what was that about being unconscious ! ? do you need help ? ? the doctor sounds pretty concerned death touch . . ? reaper ! ? is he the literal grim reaper ! ? we have been helping death ! ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaa manic screaming and mass panic from several nurses and doctors are heard , mod just facepalms were all gonna die","1783":"dr oh , your his husband ? he s been here about a week , we had someone drop him off and warned us that his magic would kiii us if we touched him , but we aren t sure exactly what happened , they didn t give us any other information ooof geno will probably realize he s been out cold a while now you should also know he isn t the only one here , we also have your son , a child by the name of raven ? he s been here just as long but don t worry , we ve been doing all we can to treat their injuries cue massive freak out","1784":"oof reaper sadly isn t the one who answers the phone which will probably freak geno out even more , a doctor hears the gods phone ringing and answers it dr hello ? this is the hospital , who might be calling ?","1785":"oof , maybe it s best geno doesn t know about this . . although he s going to be wondering where his entire family went and why the house is completely empty . . .","1786":"oof that won t make geno have a heart attack when he finds his husband hospitalized , though doctors would have to be careful with him since his death touch can kiii them all , they would probably need metal gloves","1787":"the life flower glows and vanishes , turning into white sparkles that heal his wounds but he s still unconscious","1788":"reaper would be beyond shocked if he knew allura had shown up to help him but he s been currently k . o d by fangedsniper","1789":"oof the chains that were wrapped around fang disappeared as soon as the death god gets hurled through a wall and crashes into the ground , he s out cold and unable to further move , this doesn t seem to be going in reapers favor at all","1790":". . . reapers lone eye starts to glow a ghostly blue color and several magic imbued chains spring from his hand and wrap around fang , dragging the weasel down to the ground , though this leaves the god unable to speak as he s entirely out of breath from that move","1791":". . damn it . . i can t go . . s see him . . right now . . reaper is currently being pinned down by a giant robot , he really can t go see if geno is okay or not even though he desperately wants to h he better be okay . .","1792":"reaper looks worried now , maybe geno took his advice and got off the phone to get some rest ? though he never responded back to him when he asked him to send someone to pick him up . . maybe he was that exhausted he just fell asleep ? or did something else happen ? all of this now has the god paranoid . . . d did ganz kidnap him . . ! ?","1793":"reaper looks completely helpless as he squirms around in the robots arms , his death touch takes a while to eat away at metal and he s exhausted all of his magic , his soul has just enough left to keep him functioning , fang really threw him off by giving the monster he was sent to reap high tech guns and a hover board which reaper has never had to deal with before , modern technology puts him at a disadvantage since he s from ancient greece , he s used to fighting others with magic or old style weapons like swords or spears , not with machine guns , flying bikes and explosives d damn it . . . . geno . .","1794":"i . . i thought . . so . . not sure how he s here . .","1795":"reaper honestly looks afraid right now , he s in no shape to fight fang and he s worried about what will happen if geno received news that reaper had dusted during one of his reaping jobs , how would he even react to that ? . . . . the god just silently sits there , staring up at the weasel","1796":"reaper would so turn fang into a fur rug right now if he weren t so exhausted , as of now , he was struggling just to catch his breath , fang royally screwed things up for him . . y you said it yourself . . i m literal death . . and you don t mess with something l like death . . when i get up . . your . . going . . to b beg me to k kiii you . . huff . .","1797":". . reaper was shocked to suddenly hear the weasel speaking behind him and he immediately hurls his scythe at him although the death god is entirely worn out . . y you . . ! your responsible . . for this . . ! ?

huff and . . sorry about t that love . . didn t think i d be o out that long . . but something came up . . reaper then sits himself on the ground as he caught his breath y you think . . you could . . a ask someone . . to come . . pick m me up . . ? i m . . in the . . alpha timeline . . outside . . grillbys . .","1802":"aw the poor tsun out . . w why do you sound off ? a are you h hurt . . ! ? reaper sounds out of breath while talking on the phone with his tsun , what was he out doing ?","1803":"aw reaper does eventually hear the message but it was the day after it was sent , geno is probably going to freak out when he finally gets a call back from his yandere who as we speak , is calling him back . . heh , he s too cute","1804":"either that or did something come up ? maybe he got into trouble ? but let s not jump to conclusions quite yet though that might not stop geno from worrying","1805":"aw theyre so cute oof when geno looks around the room this was the first time reaper didn t leave some sort of note or message explaining why he took off or saying he would be back soon , that was odd for him not to , he always makes sure to say where he s run off to and how long he ll be gone","1806":"reaper had left once he saw geno were out snoozing and placed a plush of himself in his tsuns arms so geno won t notice he left , where the heii is he going ? you think by now he would figure out going somewhere alone more likely to get ambushed bring someone with you less likely to get ambushed i know he s afraid for genos safety but i think he s shown he can handle it","1807":"he s my adorable bad and don t you forget it he s cute , hot and all mine","1808":"pfft . . reaper just smiles and nuzzles his tsundere you should of stayed with me then love , i ll protect you from any storm","1809":"h huh ? ? reaper looks really surprised he was caught and put on their bed geno ? thanks love . . but are you okay ? you vanished on me . .","1810":"reaper sees his tsun is missing and he teleports to their room to check for him though his teleport was a bit off and he ends up falling from their ceiling ah ! ! sh t ! !","1811":". . g geno . . ?
