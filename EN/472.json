I feel drained. Good workout today. Yesterday i had 10k steps so tired from that too. The booty is feeling it. Did a pr tonight.\n  \n  uh, I've pretty much been to the gym all week. Taking walks. Wednesday and Thursday i ended up dancing to get more steps in (9k and 10k)  I usually do 5-7k so it was nice to meet my actual goal (9) and then excell the next day. I've also gone in the pool a few of those days.\n  \n  but ya, everything has been good. No complaints. Ordered stuff from Sephora and I should get it tomorrow. At first they said there was a delay then a few hours later that day, i got the shipping information.\n  \n  I picked a new coach for the 1stphorm 8 week challenge. My old one just had a baby and rather not add to the stress of that. It's been a good fit so far! She even made a story about my protein mug cake i made today  (her recipe + few optional steps i did) so that was cool. I feel like I'll learn a lot from her in general. She's also doing the 75hard challenge right now too.\n  \n  uh.. not sure what else to comment.\n  ","507504":"\n  am excited for my package tomorrow.\n  ","507505":"\n  I'm not his keeper, why ask me?\n  ","507506":"\n  True.\n  \n  I was going to eat better today but don't really have much to pick from besides salad and rather not have just that before going to the gym. Should do a \"i ate vegan for a day \" challenge sometime. Most things i have are usually vegan approved though.  I hate how America has such processed foods too. Like California is definitely more easy to live that way with all the restaurants etc AZ doesn't have much like that. Barely any keto restaurants too.\n  \n  oh.. guess its not the person i was thinking of.\n  ","507507":"\n  Both\n  ","507508":"\n  Yes.\n  \n  i also lost some booty lol\n  \n  but its def growing again\n  ","507509":"\n  3rd\n  ","507510":"\n  25\n  \n  you didn't need to ask this twice, pal.\n  ","507511":"\n  Yes, it has been. 27 down while on it and 48 down total since June.\n  \n  13 more and I'll be out of the 200s\n  \n  I have a mini goal of 191 for the 8 week challenge and 21 left for that. Will then be considered \"overweight \" for my height.\n  \n  Also gained 2 pounds of skeletal mass. I took the inbody scan on April 25th. I waited 10 weeks to do the last one so another 10 will be in July :)\n  ","507512":"\n  2 ham slices\n  \n  2 turkey\n  \n  dill pickle\n  \n  mozzarella cheese cubes that we cut up and prepackaged\n  \n  a couple of those cheese chips things\n  ","507513":"\n  :)\n  ","507514":"\n  in which way?\n  \n  I had a video game question earlier.\n  ","507515":"\n  all good\n  ","507516":"\n  tea tree oil shampoo\n  \n  b&bw Japanese cherry blossom bodywash.

One of the rules. Today is day 65 which seems super crazy to me.\n  \n  If you meant alcohol, I rarely drink. It wouldn't be an everyday occurrence either. The last time was thanksgiving. If I do drink it's usually 2-3 depending on what it is - usually more cocktail like.\n  ","507522":"\n  I don't like g-strings.\n  \n  I know there's a couple lingerie pieces on there still.\n  \n  I didn't add thongs since thought that would be odd o,o\n  ","507523":"\n  I wear bikini style ones more often.\n  ","507524":"\n  \"in again\" sounds dirty.\n  \n  Copy machine?\n  ","507525":"\n  yes:)\n  ","507526":"\n  The fruit sounds good XD\n  \n  They also reminded me to fill up my mason jar.\n  \n  Yes, seltzer would be a good way too. I don't think I've had Polar Ice. We do have some of those Ice drinks but I've kept away from those since a bit sweeter than I'd like.\n  \n  Personally, I started drinking tea and then more water. Haven't had pepsi in 11 years. Was definitely addicted to it without really noticing. The only \"soda\" I'd have would be ginger ale if I was sick.\n  \n  pretty much only drink water these days which is surprising lol Maybe a Zevia once a week or every other week depending on how i felt.\n  ","507527":"\n  Lately that King dude has. I mentioned a bruise and other things and they just happen to have the same stuff going on etc lol\n  \n  My friend is that way in relationships. Like we were both dating someone and would treat it like ___ was better than ___ type thing. Like no. Both can be good, stop! Everybody's relationships are different. Chill. She's also someone that when they go shopping, both of you need to spend around the certain amount. Which is ridiculous because she is tiny and I wasn't so obviously I'm not going to spend the same amount lol\n  ","507528":"\n  I haven't had lunch yet but breakfast was yummy.\n  "}}
