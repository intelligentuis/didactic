Hold the fuck on, a man could never be able to handle and go through anything women go through. Did you know giving birth to a child feels like every bone in your body is breaking at once, or it's the closest a human will ever get to death without dying, or maybe women have a way higher pain tolerance, or the fact every month blood pours out of our vagina creating a temporary inconvenience, or how about all the pain assholes like you give to women because of rape ect..... So no women should be paid more than men for having to deal with men like you and all that pain, sweat, & tears.\n  ","671546":"\n  Why not 5?\n  ","671547":"\n  I look down at insects if that counts\n  ","671548":"\n  Why am I always so fucking hungry after midnight?\n  ","671549":"\n  So I took Xanax for two days and I came on today reading answers I completely forgot I answered ?\n  ","671550":"\n  \"& we will float like angles together\"\n  ","671551":"\n  OMG NO WAY GUESS HOW MUCH I DONT CARE\n  ","671552":"\n  Hello\n  ","671553":"\n  Nobody was suffering, titanic already sank ?\n  ","671554":"\n  Do you hate yourself?\n  ","671555":"\n  I already have a dad, I don't need another one.\n  ","671556":"\n  This is the only way you'll ever get in touch with me feet\n  ","671557":"\n  Yes, yes I do\n  ","671558":"\n  Uh no\n  ","671559":"\n  I would be falling over like the leaning tower\n  ","671560":"\n  I've decided black and white makes my body look more elegant\n  ","671561":"\n  Hey lovely darling\u2764\ufe0f? how are you doing\n  ","671562":"\n  For a cheeseburger\n  ","671563":"\n  I can't imagine a real celebrity to have time for this shit lol\n  ","671564":"\n  I'm obsessed there so good\n  ","671565":"\n  Omfg!
