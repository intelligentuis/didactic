modern feminist movements have somewhat backfired on themselves because it's seen more as a fashion trend as opposed to what it should be, which is a radical movement towards equality. people like to brand themselves with feminist ideology without putting the work in to actually make a difference in other people's lives, as if throwing the word \"feminist\" in your twitter bio makes you a better person than everyone else.\n  \n  this isn't to say that there aren't wonderful feminists in the world, though. there are dozens of people who follow feminist movements and are genuinely doing good for themselves and for other oppressed groups, but often their voices are silenced in favor of people who would rather make a lot of noise as opposed to moving forward.\n  ","423944":"\n  considering

of other people. everyone walks their own path on this earth, and we all hit milestones at different points - not because some people are 'better' than others, but simply because our lives are unique

combination of medication and talk therapy. while a lot of components of therapy do take into account that those who are depressed have low self esteem, it's often difficult to reverse what's been ingrained into someone's brain for what is usually years upon years of self hatred.\n  ","424064":"\n  my pronouns are they\/them. i've also included this information in my bio for anyone

relationship and i don't know the nature of it, so i can't tell you what to do. however, it isn't healthy for a relationship to be one-sided like that. you should ideally be able to come to compromises with your partner and act as a team, not being in fear and feeling like you're the one who has to apologize even if you're not in the wrong. it could potentially be a red flag, but i don't know what his behavior is like so i don't want to give absolutes.\n  ","424072":"\n  i haven't got a clue, to be perfectly honest with you. sometimes i question why my boyfriend is attracted to me because i have a tendency to dwell on the negative aspects of my personality; i often think of myself as selfish, needy, jealous, manipulative, and over-bearing. but - for some reason unbeknownst to me - he stays by my side and i'm forever grateful.\n  ","424073":"\n  i used to go to the library often when i was in high school and college, but i honestly haven't been to the library since i

a pass at being an abvsive person simply because you have a mental illness that predisposes you to certain behavioral trends. a major component of mental health recovery and awareness is becoming

close to my family for a variety of reasons i'd rather not get into, so it's always left me yearning for familial bonding and closeness. i never felt that i was ever able to confide in my family when

deleting this because i normally hate talking about my family, but my mother is the worst person to talk to when you need advice\/need to vent about something. she has the terrible tendency to turn every situation against herself, making herself out to be the victim regardless of the circumstance, until you're not talking about your own struggles anymore, you're talking about her problems.\n  \n  i understand that her need to constantly talk about herself is rooted in some psychological fear of failure and lack of self worth, but she won't ever acknowledge that she has a problem and, instead, gaslights everyone around her to make themselves out to seem \"crazy,\" meanwhile she's the \"normal\" one who has to deal with our problems. it can be incredibly frustrating and self-defeating, which is why i've never talked to her about any of my personal issues over the years (besides the fact that, above most other reasons, she was the reason for my problems).\n  ","424077":"\n  this depends

it's because in some spiritual sense, i'm meant to help others when they're lost or broken. i'm meant to be a beacon of support when others are in need and can't be support for themselves. i've had to

more in depth response than questions do. you only have a certain number of characters with questions.\n  ","424135":"\n  sometimes i get questions that are too invasive, so i can't tell the whole truth or else it would be an invasion of my personal privacy. in those instances, i'll either skirt around the issue or i'll delete the question entirely.\n  \n  however, i'm open and honest for the most part. askfm is a place for me to vent so there would be no purpose in me lying about my life.\n  ","424136":"\n  i'm really sorry that you feel that way. there was a time in my life where i had

relatively strange to me, because for the past 26 years, every day was a downward struggle.\n  \n  i sincerely hope that you're able to find the help you deserve - i really do. i was in your position once, and what i can tell you is to never give up hope. it may be incredibly difficult given your position, but i know you're stronger than that, and one day, you'll be in a position where you can say that things are looking up for the better.\n  ","424137":"\n  dear ex-boyfriend,\n  \n  thank you for teaching me that i deserve better in my life than what you were offering me. you took advantage of my innocence, and for that, i'll never be able to forgive you. however, my experiences with you taught me that i deserved someone in my life who cared about my feelings and wouldn't take advantage of

them find a house to rent, so i may be moving out of my parents' house a lot sooner than anticipated (hopefully before august). my relationship with my boyfriend is more rewarding than ever and i've been a lot more open with him regarding my feelings, which has been for the better lately. and while my current job has its certain pitfalls, i realize that they've very accommodating to my mental illnesses, and i don't think i'll be able to find that elsewhere.\n  \n  as such, i want to make the effort to develop healthier coping mechanisms, healthier eating habits, and perhaps get back into

has internal monologues regarding wanting to feel empathy for other people but ultimately viewing people as objects. he wants to study human bodies and he's fixated by how the human body works. he's the textbook definition of a young person who will grow into antisocial personality disorder, and i find his thoughts regarding death and murder to be intriguing.\n  ","424216":"\n  aw, welcome back

the beliefs i currently hold.\n  \n  however, as time progressed, i feel as if feminism itself took its own course and delved into often restrictive and hypocritical forms of thought, especially on social media sites such as twitter and tumblr. what used to be a respectable mode of thinking turned into something laughable because of the great masses of neo-feminists who spoke on topics they obviously had no idea about and used feminism as a means of advancing their own popularity.\n  \n  i still believe in many typical 'feminist' beliefs and ways of thinking, and if you had to consider

ALWAYS recommend therapy - there's no such thing as \"not depressed enough\" for any kind of mental health treatment, because the fact that you still had bad days is enough to warrant treatment of some kind, whether it's through therapy or medication or a combination of the two.\n  \n  your therapist isn't going to invalidate your experiences, and if anything, they're going to say the same things i'm telling you with respect to your depression: depression comes and goes in waves, you'll have good days and bad days, and what's important is the progress you will make. therapy is honestly a wonderful thing, it's healthy to gain an outside perspective on your problems and be taught productive means of coping with your feelings, regardless of what those feelings are.\n  ","424284":"\n

their spouse\/partner, their children, their friends, their employers, etc etc. it's impossible to develop an addiction to an illegal drug and not have it affect a personal relationship in some way. you're not only hurting yourself by enforcing that addiction, but you're also putting your friends and family at risk because of your actions. i've known too many people lose their friends, lose their family, and lose their own lives due to their addictions, and it affects nearly every aspect of someone's life.\n  \n  drug use is not a victim-less crime, not unless that person is somehow a hermit

opposites of one another, and we also have different family obligations to attend to that reduces the chances of us seeing one another. i'd say we see each other 3-4 times per week.\n  \n  however, we talk on the phone at least twice per day, send each other snapchats, and text each other occasionally. it actually works out in our favor at times because we're given the space that we need on the days we can't see one another, so that on the days we CAN see each other, we take full advantage of the time given to us.\n  \n  we're hoping to move into a house together sometime within the next year, so hopefully we'll be able to see each other more often on a regular basis.\n  ","424333":"\n  everybody is different, so there's really no objective way to answer this question. if you're in a relationship with a person and they need space or if you need space, that's something you'll have to discuss with your partner.\n  \n  personally speaking, however, i need a lot of space. it's tiring for me to be around people 24\/7, and often at the end of the day, i'm content with just being left alone. i do enjoy the company of my partner, and thankfully he is understanding of when i need space versus when i just need his comfort. but the reason why we work so well together is because we're open and honest about our needs to one another. we know when to leave each other alone and we don't

and there. however, if you feel happy and content for weeks and months at a time, it could simply mean that your depression is in remission.\n  \n  as for your second question, I think it is possible to unconsciously feign symptoms of mental illness without actually having the illness itself. it's like a placebo effect. if you read enough about a disorder, you could unintentionally display

yourself, regardless of whether or not it physically leaves a mark or a scar. the mindset behind self harm is what's unhealthy and is what needs to be remedied; it doesn't matter how severe the self harm is, the fact that a person is still engaging in it is bad enough to where they require psychological attention.\n  \n  i can hurt myself and the wound will disappear the next day. that doesn't leave any lasting physical impact on my body, but it's still considered regression, it's still considered relapse. when you resort to unhealthy patterns of thinking in order to deal with emotional pain, that's when it becomes a problem.\n  ","424354":"\n  OH hahah.\n  \n  well if that was the case, i would wait for them to come to me if they needed help with something such as dealing with

audience of the implications of being mentally ill and how trauma can affect someone.\n  \n  i also really dislike how everyone on social media is suddenly 'woke' and 'spreading awareness' for svicide prevention and trauma because of a tv show that romanticizes mental illness. neurotypical people are trying to speak up over trauma survivors over what's 'acceptable' and 'unacceptable,' and it's only silencing survivors, not giving them a voice.\n  ","424503":"\n  i make a lot of random sound effects in my speech - my boyfriend likes to compare me to a bunny or a chinchilla. if i'm feeling

","424505":"\n  it's certainly an interesting idea, but i feel as if it would be hard to implement because a lot of cyber-bullying is based on anonymity. while there are ways to find out someone's IP address, it isn't always guaranteed because you don't know if someone is using a public server (like at a library).\n  \n  however, i do agree that cyber-bullying should be considered a criminal offense. it's led to too many victims falling through the cracks and getting seriously hurt as a result.\n  ","424506":"\n  i've already written 5 letters in the 1.5 hours i've been here, and i only

stomach flu or something. :\/\/\n  \n  like, they know i have issues with my anxiety and they've been accommodating with that, but i don't tell them the extent of my symptoms because i don't want to

necessarily disagree with.\n  ","424511":"\n  my boyfriend and i met when we were 16 years old through a mutual friend who ended up changing schools from my public school to his private school, thus becoming friends with both of us. i always had a shy interest in him because he was extremely outgoing, charismatic, and funny. eventually, we exchanged phone numbers when i was 17 years old and began talking through text, and he asked me out on a date.\n  \n  our first date was actually dinner and a movie; we ate at johnny rockets, which is a 50s-styled diner, and we saw one of the wolverine movies afterwards (lol). after that, things just eventually fell into place and we started dating regularly, even when i later traveled 300 miles away to college. our relationship has been tumultuous

\n  as an additional matter, addiction is considered a mental health issue. treatment for addiction is similar to treatment for other mental illnesses, which includes rehabilitation and outpatient (or

feeling of swaying back and forth in the wind combined with the crashing of the waves on the shore and seasalt in your hair and on your skin.\n  \n  as for the other questions, i prefer winter over the summer, but while the snow is beautiful, i'm also more anxious during the winter because i hate having to drive in the snow. additionally, i prefer walking barefoot through the grass because i like the feeling of being intimately connected with nature. during the spring and summer, you can usually find me barefoot and walking around my backyard most days !!\n  ","424583":"\n  i absolutely love the feeling of sliding into bed after a hot, relaxing shower. your muscles loosen up and you feel completely at ease during this time, and it usually takes everything in me not to fall asleep

not comfortable with the way i look - often, i look in the mirror and am confused at what i see, because what i see in the mirror isn't an accurate reflection of who i feel like i actually am 50% of the time. the other 50% of the time, i can't read myself well enough to know what i feel i should look like, so i'm usually very unhappy and confused when it comes to my physical appearance.\n  \n

mental illness and it needs to be eradicated so that people can obtain the help they deserve.\n  ","424586":"\n  why is sparkling water bad for your health ?! :o i never knew that, for a while it was the only water i drank.\n  \n  i don't drink much water per day, though - perhaps 500 ml per day, if even that much. most of what i drink throughout the day is either coffee or tea; my job can be very

","424588":"\n  sex doesn't matter much to me. if my partner and i had a solid relationship but we didn't have sex at all, then i would still be completely happy with the arrangement. sex is an added bonus, not necessarily a necessity for me.\n  ","424589":"\n  thank you !!\n  \n  we don't have any set plans right now, it's just an idea at the moment until everyone gets on the same page and gathers enough money for a deposit. we're looking at june, though - that'll be when my best friend is promoted into her own store, it gives everyone more time to collect money, and opportunities for us to talk about what we're expecting and how to coordinate household chores.\n  \n  even if my boyfriend can't move in right away, i'm definitely looking to move out of my house either way. staying here has become a chore in itself, especially because these days i've become somewhat of a caretaker to my mother in addition to all of the other roles i play in my life, and it's been preventing me from being my complete self.\n  ","424590":"\n  i brush my teeth once per day, wash my hair 2-3 times per week, and go outside multiple times per day.\n  \n  ever since i started using vegan hair products, my hair has been consistent and hasn't needed to be washed more than 2-3 times per week, which saves me a lot of time and money in the long run. my hair also feels a hundred times healthier now than it did when i was using regular drug store products, and it's going to feel even better once i chop it all off again.\n  ","424591":"\n  lately i've been eating all light meals - i'll normally have a slice of pound cake or a banana for breakfast with a big cup of coffee, a small sandwich for lunch, and dinner varies depending on the day.\n  \n  lately i haven't been having the best relationship with food, so it doesn't matter to me whether a meal is hot or cold. as long as it works in giving me the proper nutrients, the temperature doesn't much matter. lately i've been eating as a necessity rather than a desire, i don't derive pleasure from eating like i used to.\n  ","424592":"\n  i love relaxing, weekend breakfasts with my partner - where we sleep in late, get up lazily, make a fresh pot of coffee, drink our coffee outside where the weather is nice and sunny, etc.\n  \n  it's been a while since we've had a breakfast like that, unfortunately. but i always look forward to spending lazy mornings with my love, it's like a breath of fresh air.\n  ","424593":"\n  aw, good luck on your move !!\n  \n  i'm not happy with my living situation at all - i still live with my parents and i desperately need to move out and find my own place. i'm currently looking into renting a house with my best friend and her husband and a few other people, so i'm crossing my fingers and hoping it works out for the best because staying at home with my parents has been a deterrent to my mental health.\n  ","424594":"\n  to me, old fashioned means to be antiquated in thought processes, following a set of moral codes that aren't necessarily relevant to today's modern age. for example, having an 'old fashioned' mindset would include the conglomeration of church and state, reinforcement of gender stereotypes, etc.\n  \n  i'm definitely not old fashioned in the way i think and behave, especially because i'm considered to be a millennial and constantly at the forefront of new technology and patterns of thinking. i can see social trends and behaviors and adjust myself accordingly.\n  ","424595":"\n  pets !! i can't imagine owning my own house, with either my best friend or my significant other, without pets being involved in some form or another. having animals in the house makes it feel more like a home.\n  ","424596":"\n  it depends entirely upon what you're using that intelligence for, in my opinion. it can be a leader-like trait if you have a natural disposition for being a leader, in that you can use your intelligence to group together masses of people and guide them towards a common goal.\n  \n  however, you can also use intelligence 'behind the scenes,' so to speak. many people with higher IQs are more prone to being socially-isolative as they would rather be with themselves inside their own head as opposed to being around people 24\/7.\n  ","424597":"\n  i'm pretty wary of my body's needs - i've has this body for 25 years now, so i've become accustomed to its desires and how to give it what it wants, even if the requests are a bit bizarre. sometimes i'm not so great at giving it what it wants on a conscious level (i.e., i'll refuse myself things as punishment), but i've been getting better at that over time.\n  ","424598":"\n  yes - who honestly wouldn't get annoyed at that behavior ?? if there's one pet peeve of mine, it would actually be this sort of behavior. it gets under my skin when people don't show their gratitude for other people's actions if it aids them in some respect. you have to be fairly self-centered in order

kurt cobain's death has led to conspiracy theories about whether or not it was self-inflicted.\n  \n  i think the most ridiculous conspiracy theory is the 'reptilian elite' - aka, a group of prominent

people don't agree with my perspective because islam is predominant in areas of the middle east where terrorism is prevalent; it's more of a geographic phenomenon than a religious one. however, ever

relationship works so well because we've been through hell and back together. we've been through situations that have made regular arguments seem petty and meaningless, we've been through crises that have forced us to question our own mortality, we've endured death and addiction and heartache and survival. we've lasted for as long as we have because we've put our faith in one another during dark struggles and have re-surfaced stronger than ever before.\n  ","424668":"\n  love can be considered an act of defiance if it's against a cultural or familial norm - for example, couples with religious

with someone from one of those groups, their very love itself can be misconstrued as an act of defiance against their family or their cultural norms.\n  ","424669":"\n  so today, i went dress shopping

my life, otherwise i'll feel as if my life is a whirlwind of chaos.\n  \n  lately, however, i've been leaning towards loosening up my inhibitions. i've been wanting to be out of character, out of

past, i used to be incredibly rigid.\n  ","424672":"\n  i think it's moreso travelers from other countries who believe that america is a land of opportunity - most americans i know are actually very

connections or a financial safety net.\n  \n  that being said, i'm also aware that there are a whole handful of countries who offer even less opportunities than america, so by comparison, america is

deserves someone who WILL.\n  \n  as an additional matter - it's meaningless to compare your own personal milestones with the milestones of others. your friends who are buying homes and having

amaretto on the rocks or wine.\n  \n  non alcoholic - coffee or tea.\n  ","424845":"\n  this is actually a really cute idea, omg. i would love to meet a therapy llama or alpaca, that would definitely make my day !!\n  \n  i know that llamas have a reputation for spitting on people, but i can only assume these particular llamas are trained specifically to not do that since they're around people 24\/7 - so in that vein, i would probably be comfortable sharing a carrot kiss with them haha aw.\n  ","424846":"\n  i'm honestly not doing too well... i've been going through serotonin withdrawal due to my psych doctor taking me off of one of my meds, so it's been hard for me to return to an even baseline. the last few days, i've basically done nothing except sleep and somehow go to work. i'm hoping the effects subside soon.\n  ","424847":"\n  i'd definitely love to visit\n  \n   @astrofluxx\n  \n  and\n  \n   @princess_tal\n  \n  !! they're two people with whom i've become close over the years and it would be so much fun to hang out with them. ?\n  \n  i'd also love to visit hobbiton\/the shire because i'm a huge nerd, lol.\n  ","424848":"\n  tbh i think things need to be done on an individual scale in order to promote change, since nothing will get done on a universal scale if we can't change our modems of thinking first.\n  \n  research has always been a huge part of any sort of social activism, and these days, people simply don't do their research like they used to. people would rather piggyback off of each other's opinions rather than form their own opinion based upon clinical data. this leads to a lot of misinformation to be spread, promoting false ideas and reinforcing often oppressive ideology.\n  \n  to change others, we must first change ourselves. but it's going to be hard because often people don't want to admit they are wrong.\n  ","424849":"\n  paying bills, things on her shopping list, how to overthrow the republican party... you know, things like that.\n  ","424850":"\n  i'm not really close with mariah like that, but she comes back when she has time to kill occasionally for a few hours every week or so. i don't blame her for leaving, askfm has gotten pretty dull and there are more important things to worry about in life besides askfm.\n  ","424851":"\n  partners should discuss things like... taking out loans, getting an apartment, getting a pet, or coordinating dates for a vacation.\n  \n  if your partner gets mad at you because you didn't inform them first before coloring or cutting your hair, then you need to get the hell out of there. that's hella controlling.\n  ","424852":"\n  ziplining sounds like it would be a ton of fun !!\n  ","424853":"\n  feminism is good in theory, but flawed in practice. while i agree with a lot of feminist ideologies, i don't identify with the movement anymore because of the plethora of over-the-top feminists who give a bad name to the movement overall. i think that its good that feminism has gained a lot of popularity and garnered attention to a lot of issues that needed attention, but the ways most feminists go about speaking on those issues can be somewhat exclusive or self-fulfilling (which ironically is everything standard feminism teaches against).\n  ","424854":"\n  more terrorists acts are performed by US citizens than have ever been performed by refugees or tourists - in that regard, i think that the immigration ban is counterproductive and will result in harsher feelings towards the US and destabilize relationships with many foreign countries.\n  ","424855":"\n  no.\n  \n  also - this isn't something you randomly ask someone out of the blue, it's pretty rude and invasive.\n  ","424856":"\n  are you talking about\n  \n   @LAKocis\n  \n  ? ?\n  \n  imagine being so butthurt you have to resort to complaining on other people's pages because you're not satisfied with the response you're getting.\n  ","424857":"\n  dogs in general are cute.\n  ","424858":"\n  well it's a darn good thing the world doesn't particularly care for your opinion on women. ?\n  ","424859":"\n  i'm not exactly a girl, and you can't base your opinion of one person off of a preconceived notion of many. i have my days where i prefer femininity, but lately i've been presenting as more masculine.\n  ","424860":"\n  how is masculine a compliment? because i like being masculine.\n  ","424861":"\n  you realize this is actually a compliment, right?\n  ","424862":"\n  i think so, unless i'm given a reason otherwise. ? the past few weeks have been a bit wild, so i've been laying low in the meantime for my own sake of mind. i can't guarantee i won't disappear every now and again, but i'm far too addicted to askfm to ever leave for good, unfortunately.\n  ","424863":"\n  lol i have two fish, a betta fish and a cory catfish. :) the corycat is really evasive so it's hard to get a good photo of him.\n  ","424864":"\n  no. that's not an adequate basis upon which to fire a teacher unless they're purposely and maliciously misgendering a student because they don't agree with them being transgender, or some nonsense like that.\n  ","424865":"\n  i've never been an iphone user.\n  ","424866":"\n  i'm honestly doing really shitty today but what else is new lol.\n  ","424867":"\n  so i'm going to leave this up for ~24 hours or so, but since i've been deactivated from askfm, i've had a lot of time for myself and i like that.\n  \n  so if you guys want my other social media, it's:\n  \n  instagram:\n  \n   @poetalunam\n  \n\n  twitter:\n  \n   @poetalunam\n  \n\n  and i also have facebook and snapchat. so if you guys want those, ask me off anon and i'll give them to those i trust.\n  \n  love you guys. ?\n  ","424868":"\n  we destroy everything we touch.\n  ","424869":"\n  sunsets after storms are always beautiful.\n  ","424870":"\n  my best friend growing up was an online friend who was 4 years older than me and she influenced my life in a number of different ways.\n  \n  besides, just because you don't think it's normal doesn't mean that their friendship suddenly loses value and feeling. they're going to remain close friends regardless of what you think, so what is this trying to even achieve?\n  ","424871":"\n  probably a couple thousand dollars - that's what happens when you work in retail, though, and your manager trusts you enough to go to the bank by yourself.\n  ","424872":"\n  sorry it took me so long to respond to this !! tbh i think it's common, but i wouldn't necessarily say 'normal' if that makes sense. as in, it happens to a lot of people from all walks of life but you shouldn't allow it to get you down because it's incredibly hard to compare yourself to other people when we come from all different environments and have our own set of strengths.\n  \n  even if someone is more knowledgeable than you, that doesn't mean you're NOT knowledgeable with what you already know - it's just in different areas. and you should take pride in what you know because guaranteed you know something the other person does not, and they likely feel the same way towards you !!\n  \n  i understand 100% where you're coming from though - i often get down on myself because other people are smarter than me, but then i'm also reminded that i have my own set of unique skills that others do not have, so that reassures me.\n  ","424873":"\n  tbh i still love bernie sanders' speeches and debates. he's incredibly charasmatic and blunt and isn't afraid to speak the truth.\n  \n  even mother nature approved of him.\n  ","424874":"\n  is this supposed to mean something ??\n  ","424875":"\n  well that accummulated fast.\n  ","424876":"\n  mystic fire topaz or opal !!\n  ","424877":"\n  nah i'm basically the exact same way.\n  ","424878":"\n  anyone with the surname trump can't hold political power or be in office.\u2122\n  ","424879":"\n  i have a hard time making eye contact with people when i talk to them - it's nothing personal, it's just something i've always had a difficult time doing. it makes me feel as if they're wrongly judging me, tbh.\n  \n  but overall i do think eye contact is important. it shows confidence. but i also don't think people should be shamed if they can't make eye contact for their own personal reasons.\n  ","424880":"\n  i have a brother who's 12 years my senior. we don't have much of a relationship, but we get along just fine when we do see each other during family events.\n  ","424881":"\n  i'm not important enough for there to even be 'popular' opinions about my existence.\n  ","424882":"\n  they don't benefit nor disadvantage me. i simply receive questions, and i answer the ones i want while deleting the ones i don't want.\n  ","424883":"\n  no? it's not exactly something that concerns me, lol.\n  ","424884":"\n  i'm fiercely protective of my loved ones - i care about them more than i care about myself at times, and i'd risk anything i own to ensure their own happiness.\n  ","424885":"\n  i'm hoping to lose 30 pounds.\n  ","424886":"\n  i've been eating somewhat healthier, but i'm not trying to go overboard with it because i have tendencies towards disordered eating and an obsession with numbers. going to a vegetarian or vegan diet would be too restrictive for me.\n  ","424887":"\n  thank you. \u2661\n  ","424888":"\n  i'd hate to disappoint you, but i don't smoke that much.\n  ","424889":"\n  i literally just said i only smoke 4-5 cigs per day lol.\n  ","424890":"\n  i totally understand how that feels, trust me. idk man most of the time i just go to bed until i have to wake up and go to work, because at least it keeps my mind off of things. which probably isn't the healthiest thing to do but it's at least much better than my previous coping mechanisms, lol.\n  ","424891":"\n  my life is completely different now compared to when i was 20, haha. when i was 20, i partied all the time, i was going to school, and i had a part time job. my life was hectic and chaotic and irresponsible and i preferred it that way.\n  \n  now at 25, i have a full time job with a degree and adult responsibilities. i feel like i've grown up a lot in the past five years, and i know for sure that i'll continue growing by the time i'm 30. hopefully by that time, i'll be living independently in a different state with a family of my own.\n  ","424892":"\n  i've always been left-aligned in my political beliefs, i just never really associated them with feminism until i became more active on askfm\/twitter. joining this website introduced me to intersectional feminism originally, and although i don't necessarily align myself with feminism anymore, i'm grateful for being introduced to this community because it's made me more aware of things going on in the world.\n  ","424893":"\n  thankfully those are two topics that seldom come up during family gatherings - my father's side of the family is fairly conservative, so i feel as if i would accidentally get into an argument with somebody, lmao.\n  ","424894":"\n  i don't know myself well enough to know how i look from a third person perspective. i'd like to think that i'm confident on the outside because it's simply a defense mechanism for how utterly chaotic everything is for me, lol.\n  ","424895":"\n  i clash with people who have arrogant\/selfish personalities - people who don't think about anyone other then themselves or have nothing productive to add to conversations that don't somehow revolve around them.\n  \n  i've also clashed with people who would prefer to talk about drama and people as opposed to things like music, art, politics, education, etc etc. i've always found that those people lacked substance and i could never find a common ground with them.\n  ","424896":"\n  any time i'm in the wilderness is a time of happiness for me. i feel the most like myself when i'm surrounded by nature.\n  ","424897":"\n  i don't think i'm in a place to give healthy advice on this topic because my parents' method of discipline was unorthodox, to put it lightly, and i have no clue how teenagers are treated these days.\n  ","424898":"\n  i've been driving since i was 19 years old. initially i was terrified of driving, but it was something i needed to do so i had to force myself to do it. i still don't like driving to this day, but i tolerate it.\n  ","424899":"\n  i do like chocolate truffles occasionally, but i'm not really a big dessert person. i love rainbow cookies with coffee though, haha.\n  ","424900":"\n  ask has gotten really lifeless and lately i haven't been finding any reason to stay here.\n  ","424901":"\n  let's not go there lol. lately my sleep has been plagued by nightmares and abstract imagery, and its been somewhat distressing. i've been sleeping 9+ hours per night but waking up exhausted because my nightmares have been so vivid.\n  ","424902":"\n  bones, criminal minds, supernatural, how i met your mother, parks and rec, ncis, orange is the new black, and stranger things.\n  ","424903":"\n  i would assume so, yes - you're bound together legally through marriage, so the responsibility of commitment is a lot more bearing than if you were in a relationship alone. to separate would mean to get a divorce, which costs a lot of time and money. so people are essentially taking a risk, and a leap of faith, when they get married - which makes it even more important to ensure that you are 100% certain, without a shadow of a doubt, that you are to remain committed to your partner.\n  ","424904":"\n  hey there !! not too much, just waiting to clock into work. i'm going to the gym tonight (and strangely looking forward to it) and then seeing my boyfriend afterwards, so i'm expecting it to be a good day !! as long as work is kind to me, lol.\n  ","424905":"\n  coffee and a cigarette, every morning. i can't function otherwise.\n  ","424906":"\n  no but i'm going to be the maid of honor in my best friend's wedding !!\n  ","424907":"\n  not necessarily. honeymoon phases are when you first enter a relationship and haven't established a history with your partner - you're living off of the fumes of new love, new experiences, new everything.\n  \n  when you're in a seasoned relationship, however, it's not as if those feelings disappear - they just take on a new form. the level of intimacy you have with your partner can take your breath away, they begin to know you better than you know yourself, and you feel as if you have the strongest support system because of your strong foundations. there's an unmatched feeling of comfort when you're around your partner and it's liberating.\n  "}}
