I\u2019ll have my dog with me for protection and companionship plus any other domestic animal I choose to adopt bc there are now millions of homeless pets wandering around. Plus I\u2019d also have unlimited access to automobiles, gasoline, health products...you name it.

A male horse that\u2019s not neutered is a stallion.\n  ","226492":"\n  After being around horses for more than like, a day, you just get used to it. They\u2019re animals so they don\u2019t really know what constitutes a bad time haha. I can\u2019t really think of a situation where the horse has farted and it was considered inappropriate or anything. Funny maybe, but not embarrassing or bad lol\n  ","226493":"\n  Not if you\u2019re sitting correctly. It\u2019s only after a few hours of riding that you\u2019ll feel sore but I think that\u2019s mostly just being stiff from sitting in the same position for so long. Like how you\u2019re a bit sore after a long car trip, ya know?\n  ","226494":"\n  Unlike dogs who are mostly concerned about pleasing their owner in order to receive food and love (and therefore a place in the pack), horses are only concerned with feeling like you can provide safety from predators and that you\u2019ll protect them as a good friend. Food is pretty much everywhere for them, so your relationship has to be based more on trust and friendship rather than being \u201cthe food and pets person\u201d.\n  \n  It\u2019s that fact that gives people the opportunity to learn about themselves in ways that lots of other animals can\u2019t help you with. In order to work with horses effectively, get them to do what you want, and be a good horseman, you need to be able to center yourself and control your emotions. Horses can only react to stimulus that we give them. They don\u2019t understand anything else other than what we show them through our subtle body language and tone of voice. They\u2019re really really good at picking up the vibe somebody gives off and picking up on their mood. Horses can help us realize what sort of vibes were putting out and how our actions, thoughts, and words affect others around us. They can help us learn to be more calm, confident, compassionate, and centered.\n  ","226495":"\n  Nope. I\u2019ve never owned my own horses, only leased or worked with other people\u2019s.

They don\u2019t even need to stop moving to poo. They can literally gallop and poo at the same time, no problem \ud83d\ude02\n  \n  Going pee is different though. They have to stand still to do that.\n  \n  The way you tell if they need to go pee is male horses will take a wide stance with all 4 legs and \u201cdrop\u201d (if you know what I mean) before they go. Female horses will lift their tail to the side and take a slightly wider stance with only their back legs before they go\n  ","226502":"\n  Lol ja das braune Pony ist Max und die graue Nase ist Chance.

He\u2019s not as dopey or as friendly as Nugget is. Especially with new people and dogs.

I assume he\u2019s been kicked or accidentally stepped on before bc he won\u2019t get too close. Sandy\u2019s family dog Nugget loves to try to get the horses to play though. He\u2019ll bark at them and run around and jump up on his two back feet and try to paw them.

I really like Oreo ice cream cake the best though\n  ","227423":"\n  To answer that I\u2019ll have to start off by explaining what causes an animal to be either albino or pure black. What makes an animal albino is a recessive and somewhat rare gene called the \u201camelanistic\u201c gene. Aka  the gene that causes a lack of melanin (the thing that pigments your skin and hair). You see, albino animals aren\u2019t white, they have no pigment, no color at all, and it shows up as white. What makes an animal pure black is also a recessive and somewhat rare gene called the \u201cmelanistic\u201d gene, a gene that causes an animal to have really ramped up melanin production resulting in black hair and skin.\n  \n  There really isn\u2019t one answer to this question, but the most likely result would probably be a \u201cnormal\u201d looking offspring that was neither melanistic nor albino. The most common colors that horses are born with are chestnut and bay. My bet is that the resulting offspring would be some shade of brown like chestnut or bay since those are the most dominant genes.\n  ","227424":"\n  Ooh gotcha!

This is like the 4th time someone has asked me this. Do y\u2019all think I live in a bubble or something??\n  ","227440":"\n  Yeah totally. Albino horses coat color is legit just called \u201cwhite\u201d and it\u2019s pretty rare. You can tell a white horse from a gray horse by the color of their skin under their firm. White horses are born white and stay white throughout their entire lives and have pink skin everywhere on their body, unlike gray horses who are typically born a darker coat color and gray out as they age. Gray horses also have gray skin instead of pink.

I think I saw a news article on that. Such a shame that his people treated him\/her so poorly. It\u2019s outrageous to force animals to work so hard they nearly die! Just despicable and cruel.\n  \n  People like that who are only interested in using animals to make money should never have animals to start with. I hope that horse\u2019s owners are barred from ever owning another animal again and that the horse goes to a loving and caring home where it\u2019ll be treated with the respect it deserves\n  ","227443":"\n  Every animal has a limit to the amount of weight they can safely carry, including donkeys. As long as your animal is healthy, it can carry you if your body weight + the weight of the riding equipment falls under that specific carrying capacity. Assuming it\u2019s a healthy and well-cared-for animal, its carrying capacity depends on how much the animal weighs and how much you and the equipment combined weigh.\n  \n  Typically, equines are safely capable of carrying 20% of their healthy body weight. An average donkey weighs about 1000 pounds, so they can safely carry a load of up to 200 pounds.\n  ","227444":"\n  Also in California, Colorado, Washington DC, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, Vermont, and Washington State\n  ","227445":"\n  No. Dwarf breeds like the Falabella and Shetland aren\u2019t meant for riding and to force them to carry a fully grown person would be cruel. Small\/dwarf breeds were created as companion animals or, in the Shetland Pony\u2019s case, to pull mining carts in small tunnels.\n  \n  That being said, small breeds like the Shetland Pony are suitable mounts for children because kids are small and light. Lots of people introduce their very little kids to horseback riding using a Shetland pony or other small breed like a miniature horse or welsh pony\n  ","227446":"\n  It\u2019s already legal\n  ","227447":"\n  Right, you can\u2019t ride a foal because they\u2019re too small and their bones aren\u2019t fully fused yet. It\u2019s best to just handle a foal and get it used to daily care activities like walking on a lead rope, brushing, and blanketing.\n  \n  Horse\u2019s vertebrae aren\u2019t fused enough to safely carry the weight of a rider until they\u2019re 3 or 4. Doing so before that time could permanently injure your horse and nobody wants that!\n  ","227448":"\n  First I look for a relaxed body position, relaxed facial expression, and relaxed or forward ear position. All that indicates a calm horse. Resting their weight off of one leg, falling asleep, and showing calm interest in others are also signs that they\u2019re happy and just chilling.\n  \n  If a horse is bothered\/frightened\/upset they look tense. They hold their head up high, have tight muscles and look kinda stiff, show the whites of their eyes, have tightly closed lips, and tip their ears back. Not like flattened ears, that\u2019s a sign of anger, but just facing backwards. They also tend to blow and snort and won\u2019t keep still if they\u2019re frightened or upset.\n  ","227449":"\n  Chemistry homework\n  ","227450":"\n  Yeah some horses paw or stomp at the ground as a sign of anxiety, frustration, boredom, or loneliness. Sometimes it\u2019s also just cause they\u2019re shooing away bugs. V situational\n  ","227451":"\n  That sucks\n  ","227452":"\n  Shower and lotion. That\u2019s it lol\n  ","227453":"\n  Idk dude.

Knowing how to admit defeat and learn from your mistakes is how you grow\n  ","227462":"\n  Probably.
