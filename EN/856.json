these sad voicemails if i ever went anywhere fun without her . she used to clean my room and i d let her keep all the change she found around my room haha . she was so happy that i let her help . we have been through so much . so many ups and downs . i ve changed her diapers , she s thrown up on me as a baby , i ve taken care of her when she was sick , i ve literally carried her around on my hip , and gone from all of that to seeing her grow into a young woman who is not only an adult but also taller than me . so strange to see her from newborn to now having to look up at her . i am blessed
