To the dauren shippers - I appreciate those who understand its just a sister thing. For those who are commenting rude things like \"laurens crying in the corner\" and other stuff just stop right now and please go somewhere. I think you guys have forgotten about the video Dani posted awhile back. The one were she was crying and just so broken. The one were she said she couldn't even log onto social media anymore wirhout seeing the hurtful comments and messages about her. I think we tend to forget that any one who is in a position like we are, are still human. We still had the same life as everyone, we all have feelings. I grew up as a sister to her, for 19 years Danielle has been in my life. I seen her at her at her lowest points, the worst times and through so much. I think we forgot Danielle is one of the most precious souls to walk on this earth. We grew up in the spotlight so we couldn't be actually kids and say whatever and do whatever without getting hate for it. She's not a kid anymore, but a 19 year old who is legal, can make her own choices and decide what benefits her. Four years ago, she was with a member of a \"man band\" she really cared about him, he hurt her pretty badly she broke down in tears while performing before octobers gone. Same thing happened two years later with a different guy but in the same way. Then the hate from everyone who always says she's annoying, to skinny, etc. Got to her. Emmyn came into her life at a period where she needed him the most. And I can tell that is true love. She has helped him just as much as he has helped her. And I never have seen happier and glowing. So sorry I haven't  said anything on any posts or whatever. Right now there's just so much hate and that going on that is not needed. Spread love and positivity. Be kind to those whom you do not know and let them be happy. #weloveyoudanicimorelli\n  ","928374":"\n  I gave it my best fish \ud83d\ude02\n  ","928375":"\n  I do.
