traveling . . . . but i m a bit confused tho tbh . when they run , all it feels like to them is that everyone around them is frozen , right ? but nothing else changes for them ? bc if i were to run the distances they did , would it still feel like i was just running normally , or would i actually barely even realize it bc i m going so fast that i can hardly see tell ? i guess for example , if i were to run home from work one day bc i forgot my work vest , would i be running like how i normally run but just not losing as much breath or tiredness , feeling the same as i normally would but everyone would be frozen around me so by the time i got back time hardly passed , or would i feel faster and feel like i m running in the time that everyone sees me as a blur streak and just somehow be able to take things in faster like stuff i read and my whereabouts , etc . . . . ? bc if it s the former , i think i would use it a lot less just bc shit would take a long time for me , even if it was only really like seconds in real time and it was fast for everyone else . . . but if it s the latter , then my answer stays the same . this is smth i ve never understood bc when the flash does important shit really fast , then the show slows down everyone else so we see barry moving around and thinking in our time as if things aren t going on really fast for him , it just seems that way for everyone else . . . but then they show clips of him doing small things like reading a book or running to work and they just show it as a streak as if it takes no time at all as it does . so i m sitting here like did he really just stand there and read that whole book for what s like hrs for him but seconds for everyone else ? . . . or did his mind really just intake the whole book super fast that it felt like nothing for even him too ?","800855":"yeah","800856":"anonymous . if people weren t so mean on here , maybe i would prefer going public","800857":"not good . . . hbu

enough people know how to accept and show kindness and love towards each other .","800874":"asking excuse me in that context is like asking i m sorry , what ?","800875":"idk , bc i don t know those people . i do know that racism , by definition , can only exist when one group has power and influence over another . therefore , the ones racist to asians latinos are white people . many white people i imagine ofc not all are finding it easier to just ride the wave instead of actually showing care for the situations . they may post smth when smth becomes big on the news for ex , george floyd , but they don t care if it s not on the news and they just post bc everyone else is doing it . after the news dies down which sadly , it always does way too soon , they no longer care . there is not quite as much asian or latino police brutality in us which is the only country i can speak for so they don t make it on the news like that . therefore , some messed up white people may find it more safe or appropriate to be racist towards asians and or latinos . they figure they won t get into as much trouble bc they aren t contributing to an as prevalent controversial issue in us . anyway , that s just a spit ball theory . i don t really know and will never understand . and also , this can apply to discriminative black or indigenous people as well . they just can t be racist . but they can be discriminative or mean . everyone can be that by definition . i do believe on an overall scale , pocs tend to unite more than divide . i had a deep and bonding race conversation with a chinese friend

thankful for family and get together and feast now , so maybe it s alright . . . . i m still determining how i feel . i used to really love christmas bc it was exciting , but now , i don t really think much of the holiday and my fam doesn t really do much . i also am not religious , so it doesn t have the same meanings to me . and my fam doesn t celebrate anything else , so . . . . i don t really have a favorite . i guess i appreciate mlk day and juneteenth . guess my least favorite holiday is probably valentine s day .","800947":"i haven t found that place yet","800948":"lay in bed .

wait listed at my first choice","800961":"yeah , idk what to do yet . i want to do cs , i just don t know if it s achievable for me bc i m not the fastest learner or the best of the best and the field is getting really competitive these days","800962":"idk many models","800963":"winter bc it s dark and rainy and sometimes it snows","800964":"thanks","800965":"i m too tired in the mornings to do

was texas to visit family . i love seeing them , hanging out with them and getting to know them . . . even tho it makes me really nervous to be around them","800978":"i . cant","800979":"i am . . . . but i don t know exactly what","800980":"i would keep talking to them if they are still my friend and i like them and have nothing against them . no friend of mine gets to decide who my friends are and if they think they do , then maybe they aren t really a friend of mine . but , i think in most situations that i can imagine , if a best friend of mine had an explosive fight with another person , there would be a reason i didn t enjoy that person anymore either and so both of us would cut ties with the person and also , it s not always about how that person mistreated me , if i feel they really mistreated my friend , then i will cut ties bc no one messes with my friends then gets excused by me . but if both are in the fault or i believe my best friend is the one who made a mistake this time , then i would not leave another friend for no reason except someone else asking telling me to . in summary , i am not gonna let someone else decide who my friends are , i m gonna stick with people who i appreciate who make me feel happy , aren t mean or rude , and who support me back . if the person is no longer that kind of person , then i will cut ties with them . and while i believe that would more likely be the case if a best friend of mine got into a fight with them bc i would think my best friend and i have more similar beliefs and opinions that s park of what would make us best friends , it s not always like that ik , so i would do what i can to support both friends .","800981":"i don t really have a favorite , but i like to use cetaphil and cereve and to all cetaphil haters , it stays dermatologist approved and there s no evidence that it is actually harmful to the body","800982":"idk , i don t really consider my mean friends , friends . there was this one guy , but we aren t friends anymore . he was just mean , problematic , self entitled . . . and then this girl too , same thing , we aren t friends . she just always blew me off . i don t like the friends who ghost me tho . like not responding immediately i get that . i also understand not replying when once the conversation is over . but just not responding at all when we re in the middle of a conversation . it makes me feel like they don t care for talking with me and that i m just a distraction for them when they re bored or have no one else at the time . . . . two friends in particular i m thinking about here i don t wanna say they are mean . . . . , they just hurt me","800983":"he s not necessarily a celebrity , but i like big will s style of dressing","800984":"yeah","800985":"well , the original reason i joined was to ask a crush of mine and a few other people that i followed from instagram youtube questions . but the reasons i stayed on the app after yrs of not using it is the last two options","800986":"no homework and sometimes more time to myself","800987":"you never said what platform this tag is from","800988":"that one sound greats","800989":"maybe the arboretum near

give you money each week you fill out a claim","801020":"it is difficult and the grading is extremely harsh . i also don t like how competitive the industry is for cs now . it makes it really hard to get good opportunities , which is all employers ever look for really . it makes me wonder if i should aim for a different major and career instead . my favorite field in it rn i think is web development . i ve been doing it for a while and i have a lot of fun with it ! but i wanna start some software development too . hbu ? what have you liked the most with it ? have you been in any
