sometimes namely scorpio necklaces or lil xan ones , as well as rings my hummingbird ring and class ring , and my rabbit bracelet . i usually have earrings in , too . the most common ones you d see me wearing would be the rabbit bracelet and my earrings , which aren t really visible because i wear my hair down lol .","244078":"i have several conflict , abandonment , being misunderstood makes me want to tear my hair out , bugs , germs , needles , fire , heights somewhat , and old submerged animatronics . with the heights thing , it s more that i fear falling in general . i m afraid to ride a bike because i might fall off . and i fear all sources of pain , even having my arm squeezed or something .","244079":"i have a photographic memory i can remember things for hours or days after looking at them , sometimes even years . but i have a terrible short term memory if you tell me to do something , i ll probably forget . i can remember sights and written things well but not things that are said to me vocally , or requests . so my memory is both awful and great , depending on what i have to remember . if a memory is unpleasant , my brain completely censors it most of the time . i can forget entire months of information if i was in a terrible state at the time . if someone asks me to keep a secret , i will , not only because i don t believe in breaking secrets but because i forget what i m told . i have a shitty memory when it comes to what i ve told someone and what i haven t told them , too , so i sometimes repeat myself . any inconsistencies in my statements if you can find any are usually because my memory sucks , too . for instance , i thought i wrote about chapters of a story , but it was instead over , . it was easy to forget just how many , because hey , that s a lot of chapters . not that the numbers are drastically different or anything , but it s things like that which i forget , and you know how people are , they spin any minor inconsistency into some catastrophic travesty . oh well .","244080":"aw , no problem ! you re an amazing person , too , and i hope you find someone who cherishes you and truly loves you for who you are , because you deserve it ! don t settle for less than you deserve you deserve all the kindness and sincerity . i hope you have a fantastic valentine s day , too , jeny !","244081":"hm , i feel like if people want to follow you and like your answers , they will . by asking for them , you are kind of forcing people to like answers they do not care about and follow someone they likely do not want to follow , because sometimes it s hard to turn someone down if they ask you to do something . basically if people want to do it , they will , without you asking . and most of the people who ask for likes are liars they say they will give you some in exchange for giving them some , but they never do . i even go back and remove all the likes i gave them . maybe that sounds petty , but i have every right to , and i get so annoyed .","244082":"https www . npr . org the dark origins of valentines day","244083":"you know , people often tell me that , and i m not sure why . i don t find myself to be very relatable i have pet sea monkeys , i have lucid dreams , i have a big collection of medicine bottles because i want to make a statue out of them , i have a dead animal s teeth in my room , i have various paraphilias , i have an entire mattress covered in nothing but stuffed animals not even a blanket , i casually listen to the sad satan soundtrack , revolution , and everywhere at the end of time , i never cut my nails , i have a strange writing style i have not seen anyone use before , etc . anyway , just rambling lol .","244084":"thanks ! i love astrology , haha . my sun is scorpio , my moon is aries , my mercury is scorpio , my venus is scorpio , my mars is libra , my jupiter is leo , my saturn is gemini , my uranus is aquarius , and my rising is aries , to name a few . if the birth time is correct , that is . my mom seems to always change the time i was born because she can t remember , but this chart makes the most sense to me . otherwise i get something like a pisces moon and libra rising , but i relate to the aries placements . lol i understand that . people call mbti pseudoscience , as well , but this is because they do not read about cognitive functions and see how accurate and reliable it truly is . anything people know little about is automatically called pseudoscience , really . i like reading about those things , though , because they help me understand people better , as well as myself . i relate to this article about my enneagram type quite a bit , for instance https www . psychologyjunkie . com enneagram type nine the peacemaker just not the parts about procrastination i m a workaholic . it should also be noted that i m an unhealthy at the moment , so i m less of a mediator and more of someone who is avoidant of conflict and disagreements altogether . in fact , if people disagree with me , i straight up block them , because they disrupt my sense of personal harmony . the part about being afraid to leave my house is especially true . i get paranoid even just seeing cars pass by me .","244085":"crushes are kind of dumb , at least if they concern people you know nothing about . it s fine to want to know more about someone , but having a crush on someone just because of something like their outer beauty is foolish . in this situation the word infatuation is necessary . infatuation determines what we find beautiful . love is about what is internal appreciating someone and finding them beautiful for what is not on the surface . crushes are automatically based on lust infatuation unless you know the person well and have fallen in love with their actual character .","244086":"oh , i m fine . i ve read a lot about meth , and addicts often feel that something is crawling in their skin like bugs . not that your mom ever did drugs or anything , just that i ve read that sort of description lol . i m only really bothered when people talk about needles and veins , since those things scare me . i ve had fairly good treatment . i refuse to take antidepressants , so i have to deal with my ocd and depressive episodes on my own . too many negative side effects for my taste . my antipsychotic meds are great , though . only side effects are drowsiness , occasional nausea accompanied by hot flashes , and occasional restless feet . i can t stand when meds cause tremors , a low libido , emotional deadness , etc . it took months to get any treatment , but i know it takes years for other people , especially if treatment is expensive where they live .","244087":"that is odd indeed . mine is strange , too , haha . normally when you think of ocd , you think of someone washing their hands many times a day or turning a light on and off , not watching anime episodes a day . hm , i suppose it means you are trying to rid away the source of any anxiety , but ironically ocd just breeds more anxiety . it s hard to break the compulsion obsessive thought cycle . obsessive thoughts are still preferred , though . i hope you know why you feel anxious ? i have an issue with identifying what i feel anxious about and thus why i have compulsive behavior .","244088":"ah , it s harmful to convince your child that they can save you somehow or to say you are the reason they are alive . my mom goes on about how i m the reason she s alive , but it s too much weight to put on someone , that without you they d be unstable or dead . yeah , it makes sense that it took so long , because parents make their kids think magic is a real thing that santa can be in so many places at once , for instance , and that he exists at all . religiosity can lead to those magical delusions .","244089":"some religious people really suck , they think everything unpleasant is the work of demons and if you pray then your illnesses will disappear . i m an atheistic buddhist , myself . no prayers and such for me . my parents are very mentally ill , too . i suspect my mom has bpd , or something of a similar nature . my father is a depressed alcoholic . it s a shame to grow up in an environment of an unhealthy parent or two unhealthy parents . people shouldn t be ostracized for being mentally ill , they should receive care and understanding of course , they should want it for themselves , too .","244090":"thank you , and no problem . yeah , people are quite misinformed about mental illnesses , even the most common ones like depression and anxiety . schizoaffective disorder is more uncommon , so it s important that people know about it . and the distinction between that and bipolar with psychotic features . it s good that you understand ocd from personal experience .","244091":"i know some people online who have it . i do not hallucinate as much on meds and rarely have delusions , but i still get catatonic episodes when upset . i m no longer derealized or depersonalized . i have a trans sibling , he s been taking testosterone for a year or so . our parents aren t accepting of it . yeah , i imagine they think it s bad parenting on your part . people make all sorts of assumptions .","244092":"oh , not at all , it s nice when people ask about my illnesses . i m going to get a degree in clinical psychology , myself . i have cptsd from ongoing online harassment . it was quite unmanageable in the past , but i ve mostly come to terms with it . i used to have an eating disorder , and i had severe entomophobia . most of my hallucinations are of bugs , actually . the entomophobia is minor now , and my mysophobia is kind of improving . my ocd primarily consisted of compulsions in the past , but i struggle more with obsessive and intrusive thoughts nowadays . i ve had many panic attacks before , so i understand your panic disorder .","244093":"no . obviously i cannot speak on behalf of people with conditions i do not have such as autism , but as a schizoaffective person , i do not believe it s bad to call someone schizophrenic or schizoaffective . calling someone psychotic is bad because it s falsely associated with calling them crazy . just like manic bipolar people started being called maniacs . people have a history of using mental illnesses as synonyms for craziness . it s fine to say a person with psychosis , or a schizophrenic person . people with autism have grown comfortable with calling them neurodivergent , but i personally find this foolish , because it gives others the perception that autism is the only neurodivergent condition some other neurodivergent conditions are ocd and tinnitus . so though i have ocd , i would not call myself neurodivergent , since it s come to be associated with autism . calling people neurotypical if they do not have autism or another neurodivergent condition is also foolish , because by default if someone has a mental illness then they aren t neurotypical as in , their brain is not the typical brain . i do not take offense to the word schizo , personally , though i suppose it depends on the connotation someone is using since they could use it as a synonym for psychotic , which they use to mean crazy . it s fine to say someone has a psychotic disorder or is in a psychotic state , though it s important to note that though they can have a psychotic disorder , it doesn t always mean they re in a psychotic state . so really it s all about associations and intent .","244094":"i have experienced some before , mostly by family members . i had low empathy in the past , which is a common symptom of schizoaffective disorder , and i ve been seen as a bad person because of it , but i was just very mentally ill back then . people also misunderstand because it s unusual to have this mental illness at a young age i started showing symptoms of it at i m not anymore , but i still have the symptoms , of course , but it s not surprising , because i had an early puberty and thus developed illnesses earlier , too . there have been bug infestations at my house , and whenever i complained about them , my father insisted that i must have hallucinated the bugs no , they were real . it s either people acting like i am constantly in a psychotic state i rarely hallucinate on meds , and i ve been on meds for years or i am not taken seriously . i used to have an anime watching compulsion from my ocd , in which i had to watch episodes every day on school days i watched around because i had less time , and people did not understand that not meeting my episode quota each day made me anxious . a friend kept telling me to forget about my episodes and come over to her house , but i refused . i have extreme emotional responses to very small things , and i ve been called emotionally immature because of it , but it s not about that , it s because of my mood disorder that i can t manage how i feel . my mood stabilizer meds do not help much , so i become extremely depressed very easily , and for an unreasonably long time . i was depressed for days of february , for example . it s difficult because the schizophrenic part of my disorder gives me reduced feelings such as low empathy while the bipolar part gives me intense feelings . it s either one extreme or the other with me . and people of course misunderstand what these disorders entail . ocd is not about being neat . i get irritated when people are like i m so ocd because they like for colored pencils to be in the right order . when i was at a mental hospital years ago , i couldn t touch a marker after someone else had touched it because i thought it was diseased . that s how my ocd is . simply looking at blood makes me panic and have obsessive thoughts about contracting a disease . i think around of people with ocd have obsessive thoughts about diseases i read a memoir about someone with this type of ocd . if someone accidentally spits on me while talking , i start thinking they gave me hepatitis . it s very annoying . and as for the people who say i m so ocd , their defense is that not all kinds of ocd are the same . but they just have ocpd rather than ocd .","244095":"well , people falsely use psychotic as a synonym for crazy , when instead it means you are afflicted with psychosis . an example of a psychotic disorder is schizophrenia it means you have hallucinations and delusions . when i have a psychotic episode , i start having auditory hallucinations and get head body spasms alongside those , i start repeating random syllables or words palilalia . it s an unpleasant sight , but only one person has seen it happen . the word upset sounds minor , but psychosis is something extreme . i wish people stopped using psychotic to mean crazy now , i m not sure if you used it to mean that , but i m making a social complaint here lol . not all people with psychotic disorders are irrational , which i would say is the definition of crazy . if someone is irrational and delusional then i d consider them to be crazy , but i only know one person who suits that word . it s excessively thrown around . if someone is sad then it doesn t mean they are irrational delusional they could be , of course , but being sad implies more of a lack of motivation , while craziness seems to imply too much motivation .","244096":"hello . well , i am schizoaffective bipolar type , so i have depressive episodes . i had one yesterday , in fact . . . i hate my extreme moods . it took me years to stop self harming , because i was very suicidal for a long time . basically my whole family is depressed . i try to take care of my mental health , but it usually doesn t work . i try to help my friends with theirs .","244097":"i liked them when they first started releasing music . now their songs have become too westernized , if you get what i mean . they appeal to a larger audience , which i m not a fan of . i liked how their songs suited a niche audience in the past . i still listen to their older songs sometimes , but their new songs are bad with all the autotune and such . the singers are funny , but their personalities are fake , like with any other k pop group . artificial people with artificial music . . . .","244098":"i have to make various difficult decisions for my sea monkeys . it s hard to know whether to remove any of their corpses or not , for instance . if they die of natural causes then you shouldn t remove them , but if they die of a disease then you have to remove them or it will spread to the ones that are alive and the whole population will die off . . . you do not know why they died , though , so you do not know what should be done . and should you give them a certain salt or a different one ? try to grow algae in a separate tank or the one they re in ? give them food now or wait a few days ? remove their molted skins or leave them there ? i have so many decisions to make . . . they may seem easy to take care of on the surface , but they aren t .","244099":"to be well , someone needs a good support system healthy habits a healthy lifestyle ambition a stable environment less of an emphasis on wants optional friends","244100":"i have the shortest attention span . it s fine if someone messages me maybe once a month , but conversations always bore annoy me . i m fine with exchanging long messages with someone about their problems , since i love to help , but i have no time for legitimate conversations , you know . send me a long message about your life story and problems and i ll reply with a long message back maybe weeks later sometimes months later , but i have no attention span for a continuous back and forth , especially if i gain nothing from it . this is why it s impossible to be friends with me , i hate normal conversations and who knows when i ll get back to you , if i ever do . so to answer the question , maybe minutes lol . offline i hate talking to people , so even less .","244101":"hm , i think people are more inclined to accept who they are if they feel that other people accept who they are . self perception problems are largely based on someone s environment . for instance , people are usually self loathing when they are used to being insulted by others often by parents , and the solutions are either to detach themselves from external perceptions or surround themselves with people who are kinder toward them . your only responsibility here is to support this person and show them you accept them for who they are . it s not about figuring them out they will do that on their own , if you let them .","244102":"probably not my best , but i like this picture .","244103":"eh , just certificates for getting good grades , really . a couple of my poems were featured in our school s literary magazine , too , so i guess i won that ? i got an honorable mention for a short story i wrote , so it wasn t a prize prize . it was because i didn t write about what the judges wanted to read about . the guy who won wrote about diversity mine was just some fictional short story , without a powerful message . the funniest part , though , is that the short story is actually incestuous , so i cut most of the scenes out and changed names to make it sound normal .","244104":"yeah , i actually did the second one for my mom s birthday card in the past , but it was kind of a failure , lol . maybe it was the wrong paint or the circles were too big . . . does bubblewrap come in different sizes ? i just randomly had some in my room , so i looked up art i could make with it . i once had a blank roll of film and i decided to sew drawings on to it . it was pretty fun . but i suck at sewing , so it was messy .","244105":"there are three kinds painting something directly on to the bubblewrap and then pressing the pattern on to a piece of paper this is difficult to do , drawing on a piece of paper and painting a single color or so on to the bubblewrap and then pressing it in the middle of the pattern such as drawing a tree and then adding bubblewrap circles for leaves , and painting a picture through the design of it being made of bubblewrap similar to making a drawing out of tiny dots . . . there is , in other words , a large pattern made of small things .","244106":"yes ! my favorite is totodile . the first pok mon game i played was pok mon crystal , and i ve always preferred water starters , so i went with totodile . it s very cute and i like its moves . also the evolved name , feraligatr , is funny , because they did not put an o and make it feraligator . the sprite has major booty , too . i tend to like unevolved forms more than evolved ones , so totodile is better .","244107":"here s my tank . most of the shrimp are pretty small lol .","244108":"i read online that you could give aquarium salt to sea monkeys , so my dad got some for me , but apparently it s for sick fish and doesn t evaporate . marine salt dissolves and is for aquatic creatures in general , from what i understand . i guess aquarium salt is for actual fish , and since i have brine shrimp , it doesn t really apply . there is a lot of conflicting information on sea monkey care online , so i ve resorted to asking people on reddit for help , lol .","244109":"hello . i would get vaccinated for covid , but i am not a priority at the moment , so a vaccine is not offered for me . i consider flu vaccines to be useless , but other vaccines are effective . anti vaxxers should go to prison for child neglect it is cruel to not vaccinate your children . as for the pharmaceutical industry , i certainly believe they hide cures from the public , in order to garner more money . i suspect they have truly found the cure for cancer but withhold it from everyone so hospitals get money for ongoing treatments . big pharma s tendency to give painkillers out like candy to create more addicts is pernicious for those who truly need them my mom has a disease , for instance , which she needs painkillers for , and doctors have wrongfully accused her of being a drug addict refused to give them to her .","244110":"i seem to experience d j vu very often . i remember how one time in middle school i was in french class and i had this strong feeling i had seen all these students before , learned what the teacher was teaching before , heard someone say a specific line before , etc . another time was when i was in the car and we passed by a house , and i felt i had been there before .","244111":"that s true . it s important to find someone who shares your values and believes strongly in things such as devotion . i can t say much about men because i have a girlfriend , and this is the only relationship i ve been in . men are more likely to cheat , though . they seem to have less empathy and thus do not care if they hurt others . it s best to walk away from people like that , because cheating is unforgivable they will likely never change .","244112":"eh , you can always say you are busy , because when are people not busy ? or you can change the subject . it s harder to escape in real life than online , in which you can say you have to sleep soon , your eyes hurt from staring at the screen for too long , etc . only say these things if they are true , though . changing the subject is your best bet irl and online . but make it natural , instead of asking if you can change the subject .","244113":"maybe caroline of ansbach ? i know little about queens , but what i am reading of her does not mention religion as it does with other queens . i do not care about religion , so . other places mention her being protestant , though . . . it really is unavoidable . she was a very influential woman , and devoted to her husband , despite his infidelity . she was intelligent and loved art and literature , too .","244114":"i m either seen as intimidating or very welcoming there s rarely an in between . one of my friends said she thought i hated her when she first talked to me , but i didn t . i think people have trouble reading my expressions and think i am mad when i m not . people online have assumed i hate them , too . it s some weird commonality . either that or they think i am someone they can share anything with . it s not surprising , because i am very open , myself . i think this encourages them to be open , too .","244115":"well , that s how feelings work in general . if i say i am sad , you can neither prove it nor disprove it , because you are not the one feeling that way . there are some ways of identifying how someone feels , such as body language , but they are not always reliable . when it comes to love , there are ways of proving you love someone , through sacrifice , defending protecting them , supporting them , etc . i wouldn t say you should always believe someone who says they love you , unless they can prove it .","244116":"i have trouble remembering specific days , so these things may have happened on separate days , but this occurrence is my favorite memory i was on vacation with my lover , and we went kayaking and saw a heron sitting on a log , and one eating a lizard . it was very special to me i developed a great love for herons . we went to the gift shop nearby and got ice cream . we then went to the park and i accidentally got the ice cream all over my face . i chased after a squirrel , too . there was this beautiful patch of grass we looked at . we then went for a walk and sat on a swing , looking at a body of water with ducks . they had colorful feathers , and one of the feathers was on the ground , so i took it . along our walk , we gathered many more feathers . i think the reason why we went back to the cabin was because my feet started to hurt lol .","244117":"getting likes on ask . i usually wake up to like of them , but today . . . i feel like people gave up on my page during after the error in which i couldn t upload background pictures . it made me realize that all i am to people is the backgrounds , and my answers are hardly valued . even the person who traditionally likes all of my answers has seemingly vanished . maybe it s a dumb thing to be upset about , but that s how i feel .","244118":"it s difficult to understand what true happiness would mean for me . i am truly happy with my lover , for instance , but i am still mentally ill , self loathing , etc . i have to work on my self image , how i respond to upsetting things , and so on . i have had episodes in which i felt completely elated and like nothing could puncture my joy but then the episodes were ruined , of course . one of those took place in march or was it april ? of , and it lasted maybe two weeks . but it was more of this fuzzy happiness , the kind that is distracting and overwhelming . i was relatively happy around th grade not especially mentally ill , and just enjoying the simplicity of each day . i tend to say th grade was the happiest time of my life , but that is more of a delusion . my parents started fighting all the time , and sometimes my mom threatened to leave and never return . but school was pleasant , for the most part . i was very passionate about anime , too , but the passion was crushed years later , when watching it became a compulsion . i was rather depressed , but the pleasant memories compensated for the unpleasant ones . i wonder if i was ever truly happy . certainly not in high school , the worst years of my life . i am content right now kind of , but truly happy , eh .","244119":"i would generally say by how open they are , but that is not always the case . rather , if they are consistent throughout the years and do not change their stories , then i would find them honest . of course , people are not always consistent their memory may fail them , or their mood may be different . but information about their life should not change , for instance .","244120":"i assume you mean to say allow i sometimes allow them , but i disable them whenever someone starts interrogating me , harassing me , etc . too many why ? questions make me anxious , and anonymous users tend to ask those questions those who ask why ? often have bad intentions , at least on ask . they are usually only enabled for maybe a day or two before i disable them again . people just disappoint me , in the end .","244121":"hm , an opportunity to improve . . . i know this sounds silly , but try as i might , i ve never been able to understand long division . yes , they teach it in elementary school , but i could never quite grasp it . so here i am , months away from going to university , and i still do not know long division . however , i hope to become a tutor over the summer , and i d like to learn long division before then , so i can explain it to someone if they ask about it . as for something else . . . i would like to improve my mental state , as well . reading classical literature every day is supposed to help my psychosis . essentially with psychosis , your senses are all intensified , to the point where they become dysfunctional . recognizing timeless symbols meanings is supposed to alleviate the sense issue . i ve been reading classical fiction every day , as such .","244122":"taking care of my plants and sea monkeys , watching my sea monkeys swim and eat something about them is precious to me , seeing how the sunlight illuminates my room cloudy days are bland , looking at various things around my room , collecting small toys and other items , listening to birds chirping and wind chimes , learning new words , being complimented on my writing or even just someone showing an interest in it , eating spicy ramen every saturday , seeing a new chapter translation of a manga i like being released . . . .","244123":"good luck . when it happens on my phone , it usually means i have to update the app , so that s a fix . but it started happening despite the app being updated , and they told me that it was because i was using a version of android that is not supported by the app . however , my phone will not update no matter what . it s not a considerably old version , and i ve only had the phone since late , so it should still update , but it does not . . . so , it s more so ask s problem for not supporting that version , since there is nothing i can do about it . the error message typically goes away within a few hours or so , but it s been going on since yesterday or something . as for the desktop version , it will not let me upload pictures . and for some reason they only allow background images on the app the site only allows non background images . they should add background images to the site , as well . but both seem to be broken at the moment .","244124":"i took this picture it s from the rise of insanity game . i was quite impressed by the visuals .","244125":"https

i try to write a bit every day . i used to have an actual schedule for writing . i wrote three pages in a notebook per day , then years later i spent an hour and a half ? writing every day . now even just a punctuation mark is an achievement . i m not sure what could be classified as a habit in my life . i translate every day , but i m not an excellent translator , and not even fluent in the language . i keep the curtains open every day for my plants to have sunlight . i have a bag covered in the dates i watered my plants on , to keep track . i do homework after waking up , and i even do assignments many days before they re due . i have some bad habits , like never cutting my nails , scratching at my face i have a rash , leaning forward in my chair i have bad posture , etc . . .

was younger i took care of my younger brother for my parents , because they were busy with work . my mom often says she could not have done it without me , and she is impressed by how well i took care of him especially given that i was not very old , myself . so based on that i would say i m fairly good with them ? i also assisted some younger kids throughout elementary school .","244129":"oh , i see . well , many people make the mistake of thinking someone is the person in the pictures they choose . they might be , but they could also be catfishing . this is why it s best to do a video call . as for the parents , you can keep the relationship a secret if you have to , or let them get to know the person through video calls , too , then later reveal that that person is more than a friend to you .","244130":"i mean , i don t really see what s scary about them . the person can be with someone irl but they choose you , someone who is likely very far away from them . to me that shows that their feelings are more genuine , so if anything relationships offline are scarier . i met my lover online i fell in love with her before i even saw what she looked like . we ve been together for over three years . but it s not exactly an online relationship because we ve spent a considerable amount of time together in real life , too . i understand if someone is afraid that their partner will leave them for someone who lives nearby , instead , but you also have to remember that the person chose to be with you in the first place , not someone else . if you can t go on without physical contact then i wouldn t recommend it . it s more for people who can handle being apart for long periods of time . and both people have to be that way for it to work out . but it shows that the relationship is strong and sincere if you do not need physical contact all the time . there is more independence , too .","244131":"it depends on the intention of both people , and how well they can handle a lack of physical affection . online relationships can be more meaningful than irl ones because you can handle not being with the person in real life for extended periods of time . however , if the relationship exists because both people are lonely , or if the conversations are superficial , it does not work out . i also do not believe people should actively search for a partner and should instead wait for someone to come to them in other words , things like dating apps make no sense to me .","244132":"yes . many people still see me from the perspective of my past , but i am no longer the same cold , unsympathetic , emotionless , paranoid , and possibly aggressive person i once was . now i am way too emotional and caring , essentially the opposite of the spectrum . that does not mean , however , that i am no longer a sadist , that i am no longer mentally ill , that my attraction is gone , etc . things do not magically disappear . but i have developed traits i did not realize i had . i am quite the nurturing person now . my relationship is great . i will never be with a man sorry , mom . i do not know why , but intellectuals try to analyze me and their analyses are completely wrong . one guy years ago tried very hard to get me to admit to cutting myself , but i never even cut myself , lol . i did not self harm at all at the time and when i did end up self harming in the future , it was through strangulation , not cutting . i have way too low of a pain tolerance for that sort of thing . i have no clue why some people mistake me for a masochist , especially when my username has the word sadist in it , but they are blind and stupid . i am a very open and honest person , but some people strangely think that means i will answer sexual questions and such . no , i will not . i think they try to take advantage of how open i am . also , while i have many unusual fetishes , that does not mean i intend to act upon certain ones , i just like them in porn . the amount of times i have had people ask me if i am attracted to a family member just because i like incest porn which is arguably not even strange , compared to my other fetishes . . . no , i do not like any family members in that way . i do not mind polygamy in porn , but i am a strictly monogamous person , as another example . i like scat porn and worm porn , but i am not interested in acting on either of those things irl . i love drug research , but i have never done any drugs . people have a hard time knowing when i am being serious and when i am joking , so they either take me too seriously or assume i am a troll i am not , for the record . and for some reason they think the fact that i do not like discussing my age equates to me lying about it ? i never lie about it , i just like to keep it a secret , because of past harassment over it and people treating me a certain way because of it . even though it has been years since then , the remnants of the mistreatment stereotypes have stayed with me .","244133":"both . i have a schedule every day , but it is not as strict as it used to be . give sea monkeys oxygen around am , translate at pm , take medicine and give sea monkeys more oxygen at pm , shower at pm , and sleep around am . but really i can translate whenever , just as long as it s every day no missing any days no matter what . other things i do at random times .","244134":"https www . youtube . com watch ? v wozwzrsi w ab channel lofidelityallstars topic","244135":"i told you , when they have to protect themselves or their family members . this mother cat could easily bite the person who is trying to approach her , and thus shed blood . https www . youtube . com watch ? v u phxoi ec ab channel theworldofcats","244136":"here is one of them .","244137":"here is one about posture pain the state of mind that exists when you sit in the right posture is , itself , enlightenment . if you cannot be satisfied with the state of mind you have in zazen , it means your mind is still wandering about . our body and mind should not be wobbling or wandering about . in this posture there is no need to talk about the right state of mind . you already have it . this is the conclusion of buddhism . buddhism is all about finding inner peace through love for everyone everything , including yourself . with love and the relinquishing of the ego , there is no more suffering . here are some about peace and the ego if we hold on to our humility , if we let go of our egos and stop clinging to whatever it is we re clinging to , we ll find the wonderful surprise that behind all that gunk is a natural kindness , a love for everyone and everything that we never thought we had . and if we let ourselves act from that place , we ll discover a kindness without limits and an unutterable peace . we surround all men and all forms of life with infinite love and compassion . particularly do we send forth loving thoughts to those in suffering and sorrow to all those in doubt and ignorance to all who are striving to attain truth , and to those whose feet are standing close to the great change men call death , we send forth oceans of wisdom , mercy , and love . you can search the whole tenfold universe and not find a single being more worthy of love and compassion than the one seated here yourself . self compassion and self forgiveness are not weaknesses , but the roots of our courage and magnanimity . sometimes compassion for ourselves and others seems hard to find . but even if you lose touch with these feelings during your most intense suffering , compassion is an essential part of our true nature . in fact , it is in this self compassion and self love that you find the strength to carry a lamp through your darkest nights . and it is by first practicing self compassion that you find not only a way to hold your own struggles and sorrows in your heart but through them you learn how to connect with the sufferings and sorrows of all those around . a man once told buddha , i want happiness . buddha replied , first , remove i that s ego . then remove want that s desire . and now all you re left with is happiness . the ego says , i shouldn t have to suffer , and that thought makes you suffer so much more . it is a distortion of the truth , which is always paradoxical . the truth is that you need to say yes to suffering before you can transcend it . often people attempt to live their lives backwards they try to have more things , or more money , in order to do more of what they want , so they will be happier . the way it actually works is the reverse . you must first be who you really are , then do what you need to , in order to have what you want .","244138":"i like kitten asmr , like this video https www . youtube . com watch ? v lk br avvxu ab channel mypetsasmr","244139":"no , i feel that way regarding literature . people prefer to read whatever is simple and does not require much thought , so when you write something more meaningful and metaphorical it is seen as pretentious or overly convoluted . people are required to think less , especially with knowledge at everyone s fingertips through search engines , but despite the availability of knowledge , they are still so stupid and mindless .","244140":"it annoys me when people say all bodily cells are replaced every years . they are replaced at different times , which is why the whole your rapist s touch will be gone in years thing is stupid . skin cells are replaced roughly every days . cervical cells are replaced every days . it s not like your rapist is touching your red blood cells , bone cells , etc . so you don t have to wait years . also , braincells cannot be replaced throughout your lifetime , so the all cells thing simply isn t true . i think it s harmful to perpetuate this false information to rape victims because it makes them feel helpless and like they have to wait years to be clean , when in reality it s much shorter .","244141":"my many ambitions . i m by nature a very hardworking person , especially because of my ocd . i get obsessive thoughts about assignments until i finish them . but i have many goals i want to achieve , and when it comes to professions , i want to be a psychologist , author , taxidermist , photographer , and translator , all at once . i m through the novel i m writing , over halfway through a book i m translating , and i have some minor experience with psychology and photography . well , maybe not minor for psychology , but i haven t started officially studying it , so . as for taxidermy , i have an animal s jaw in my room . i had to get rid of the skin that was hanging off of it and the bugs and dirt on it i found it on the ground in the forest . so i have some cleaning experience , but not actual stuffing experience and such . anyway , i am always working toward my goals . another incentive is money i want enough money so that i can travel the world not just for personal enjoyment but photography . my lover is very hardworking , too , so we motivate each other , as well .","244142":"yes , my lover has greatly shaped me as a person . i was going off the deep end before she came along i planned to commit a heinous crime and commit suicide or spend my life in jail . but then i fell in love with her and had a reason to want a normal life to want to get married , have children , be happy , be free . she brought out my nurturing side , which i had formerly shoved into oblivion . i didn t think i was capable of loving someone , and i was never interested in being in a relationship , but after i found someone who truly understood and accepted me , i naturally fell in love . it s strange how i went from an emotionless and homicidal person to someone very emotional , caring , etc . , but that s what happened .","244143":"not my pic","244144":"hm , isn t the difference between daily intermittent fasting and eating once a day the amount of food consumed ? with intermittent fasting you would eat food with enough calories to compensate for the meals you skip , while with eating once a day you would just consume calories or something . so intermittent fasting is only good if you eat enough .","244145":"i have a compulsion to leave conversations because all of them bore me . and i mean absolutely all of them , unless they are about my writing . i become basically impossible to talk to , no matter how interesting someone is . i don t reply unless i have a certain goal , like helping the person with their mental illness es , in which case i write mountains of text . but my wrists are swollen and occasionally the wrist bones themselves hurt , so i can t type for long . it s a difficult situation i want to type so much but i have this impediment , so i end up replying late . irl the most difficult part is probably maintaining eye contact . i stopped maintaining it years ago when i was most paranoid not on meds . i thought by looking into someone s eyes , they could read my mind . and though i do not have that thought anymore , the sensation is still there , so i can t look .","244146":"i got this led planet that i love .","244147":"no . it has its pros and cons . i think it makes people lazier , but it makes others more creative . it can be a good treatment for diseases . it impacts depth perception , leading to car crashes . it can trigger psychosis and give people panic attacks . i acknowledge that it s healthier than something like cigarettes . but like any drug , it just causes superficial happiness and encourages people not to face their actual problems . it becomes an emotional crutch . and yes , it can in fact be addicting , despite what some people say . anyway , i don t trust anything going into the lungs that isn t oxygen .","244148":"i took this picture a long time ago . yes , my plant was dying .","244149":"things can be overcome through perceptions but not always through physical means . if you have a brian tumor , you can t do much to prevent yourself from dying from it . not all tumors can be removed , after all . diseases in general are hardships that cannot always be overcome . but if you have a positive mindset , you have already overcome your illness , in a sense . it s all the resisting that people do which makes them suffer .","244150":"not always . some changes are good changing your lifestyle to be healthier , changing your friend group to get rid of mean friends , changing how you perceive yourself to be nicer toward yourself , etc . other changes , like moving somewhere , getting a new job , changing your meds , etc . , might be detrimental but could also be good . you never really know if a change will be good for you or not , unless it s very obvious as with the example of a healthy lifestyle . i m not very afraid of change , but i hate certain things changing , like leaving my bedroom behind for a college dorm room soon . some changes , like puberty or ageing in general , can be hard to manage for many people .","244151":"it can . it s all about what you expose yourself to . if you follow a bunch of very skinny girls on instagram and develop an eating disorder because of them , it s less so the fault of social media and more so the fault of the material you choose to consume . social media makes it easier for people to bully you , however , and in that sense it is truly harmful and often not your fault . if you are concerned about it ruining your mental health , you should definitely take a break or change which social media platform s you re on .","244152":"it depends on someone s mental state . it s bad to give too much of yourself to people when you should be focusing on yourself . of course , that doesn t mean you should stop giving entirely . it s important to be a part of a community , otherwise your thoughts are all i focused , which ruins your health . in a bad state , it should be about self improvement focused and focused on helping other people . in a good state , about self focused and focused on others . if you are too focused on others then you lose sight of yourself , but if you are too focused on yourself then you become too detached from other people the world . this is also dependent on the nature of the focus . i m not saying that in a bad state that should be all self loathing and such . no , it means to prioritize your own health well being over that of others . because in order to help people better , you have to first be in a stable state . though if by your question you mean information , well , evaluating the pros and cons of sharing various things . also testing the waters with friends and potential friends , by indirectly referring to yourself .","244153":"it depends on the situation . i believe , for instance , that one of the reasons why people commit crimes is because they feel estranged from society , hated by the world . their actions are fueled by anger over not being accepted understood . so in that case it s important to see that the person was impacted by their environment , to better the environment for people in the future before they , too , commit crimes . you can of course go oh , they are just a terrible person , but that simply isn t true . people are not born evil or any of that bullshit individuals spout to not take responsibility for anything . as an individual , though , your focus what s more important is what you become . successful , for example . most people do not magically become successful , so you should care about how you become that way . but the ultimate goal is the success itself . or maybe you want to become rich . you can become rich through means of luck winning the lottery . or you can work toward it . there are various ways to become the person you want to become . the how is the means to the end , and also what other people should see about you .","244154":"i wouldn t say it s a matter of love but relationships themselves . if your feelings for someone disappear when things go downhill , it means they were not strong in the first place . weak things break easily . people want to leave relationships when they realize that things are not always pleasant . but nothing is always good . as they say , too much of a good thing is bad . i think it truly shows the value of your relationship love if it s always strong and you never leave that person . one of the most important things is to recognize the capacity for personal growth . two unhealthy people can be in a relationship , and naturally it would be unhealthy , as well . but if they work to help each other and improve themselves , things turn out fine . so it s best not to abandon ship when things go bad or if they were bad from the start . many things in life take patience , and this is one of them .","244155":"hm , i think consciousness means awareness . to be conscious of something is to be aware of it . to be self conscious is to be aware of something negative about oneself . consciousness , in other words , can be influenced by subjective perceptions . it s the same with reality . i would say that consciousness is more related to an individual themselves , while reality is all encompassing . so consciousness on a greater scale , essentially . there is also a personal reality , however , which is created through previous experiences , mental illness , etc . if i hallucinate a bug , that is in my personal reality . i can tell someone that i saw a bug , but they would disagree , because they did not see one . the objective reality is that there was no bug , but if any of the five senses deceives you then your reality becomes a travesty . reality is unchanging . it s objective and factual . however , we all have personal realities . for instance , if i was attacked by a dog in the past , i would likely carry around that experience and fear dogs themselves , or maybe even loathe them . someone else would say that dogs are comforting , reliable , etc . my reality would be that dogs are awful , but because that person s experiences would be different , their reality would be the opposite . so anyone s reality is a result of their own past . but what is the true reality of the situation ? well , it would focus on the good and bad aspects of dogs . for instance , dogs may be loyal , enlivening , and so forth , but they are also high maintenance creatures they require emotional attention , walks , baths , etc . there is a debate on whether all creatures have a conscience or not , but if we consider that consciousness is merely awareness of one s surroundings , i believe that all creatures do in fact have a conscience . they do not necessarily need a mind for this . a jellyfish has no brain , but it is conscious of its surroundings . if you are in its way , it will sting you . as long as you have the ability to sense your surroundings in some way meaning at least one of your senses works , you are conscious . someone who is asleep is considered unconscious , but if you disturb them , often they will wake up . their consciousness does not disappear forever , unless they die .","244156":"hardly anything is genetic for me . no one in my family was is schizophrenic or schizoaffective , yet i am . none of them had have ocd , either , but i do . my mental illnesses are not genetic , they are purely based on upbringing . now , i do have some traits of both parents i love solitude like my father , and i am very open and emotional like my mother . but these things are easily attributed to mental illness es , as well . if we consider their personality types , i believe my father is an istj and my mother is an infp . so it would make sense for me an isfp to have both te and fi functions , yet where did my se and ni come from ? my main brother is on the same axis as me , with se and ni , so we get along well . but it shows that functions themselves may not be genetic . my parents have no artistic talents , but i am gifted at writing . they also fight all the time , but i hate any conflict and do all i can to avoid it . my upbringing has been one of fear and isolation . from the age of about and onward , i stayed in one room all day , away from everyone , often writing endlessly . i do not write as much anymore , but i am just as isolated , if not more . i have very complex emotions , and that is my outlet for everything . i withdraw from anything that is unpleasant , whereas my parents engage in such things nonstop . they are quite close minded and conservative , but i m the very opposite . they were unable to impose their morals on me influence me much in that way . ironically my father works as a behavior specialist but is very unstable , himself . i can relate to that sort of thing . even when i was very unstable , i was able to assume a logical state and help others . we kind of shape shift , i guess . i m quite the paranoid person due to my upbringing i feared for my safety much of the time . it s gotten kind of better . i m gentle and nurturing when you really get to know me . my mom is like that , since she had so many kids . but she did not tend to my emotional needs while i was growing up . my parents are the type to have a bunch of kids but then neglect them , because they re too focused on themselves and their issues with each other . i ve had to solve my own problems i even treated my eating disorder on my own . i love taking care of things , and i do not neglect them . of course , i ve never had a child , but i am sure i would be very caring and attentive to their needs . i would not let them live in the same environment i ve had to live in , either one of arguments , hostility , and at times actual violence . i m a compromising person and a peacemaker . i want harmony in life , and for people to get along . i relish in friends being happy and peaceful . my parents are fairly destructive . i had an abundance of rage in the past , myself . i wanted to destroy . but unlike them , i ve grown and improved . it s like they don t even care to change at all . they just stay miserable with each other , and make everyone else miserable in the process .","244157":"yes , i do believe that a person s name can impact their personality . someone named grace is usually very bubbly and likes sports , for instance . someone named john is introverted and likes technology . i ve only met two people with the same first name as me . i didn t know one of them well , so i couldn t say much about her . the other girl , she had my sun sign scorpio , but she was more outgoing . she was quite open about things i am , as well , but online , not irl .","244158":"it s usually unproductive and pointless . it s not like saying your acne is gross will get rid of someone s acne , for instance . i look down on people who insult others for things they cannot help . and sure ,

statements of what i have , but my parents refuse to get me officially diagnosed since my mom got misdiagnosed in the past . . . she is paranoid . i couldn t get diagnosed before because i wasn t yet they re wary of diagnosing minors with more extreme illnesses . i m an adult now , though , and still can t get diagnosed , so . but anyway , i ve had symptoms since i was . i know it s probably

friends because i needed to meet my episode quota . i get obsessive thoughts about contracting a disease simply by looking at blood irl . it s quite insensitive for people to act like mental illnesses are just adjectives to throw around . and when people go on about the voices in their head , when really it s their internal dialogue . if i m not on meds for my hallucinations , i hear multiple voices screaming at me at all times , see bugs where there are no bugs , see disturbing things like corpses , etc . racing thoughts are also not voices . that s another thing , mentally ill people often act like they have domain over other mental illnesses and can incorporate their terminology . anyway , people romanticize illnesses until they know what they are actually like .","244178":"that s very true , as well . many people find it difficult to be alone with themselves . they always need something or someone to distract them , otherwise they become unstable . introverts naturally do more introspection , and they do not mind being alone with their hobbies , whereas extroverts want to share hobbies with others , and they are more sense based risk taking . also why they likely break cdc guidelines more .","244179":"it s likely because you are voluntarily isolated , and it feels unpleasant when you re forced to be isolated . no one likes things being imposed on them , and they would rather make their own decisions . quarantine isolation hasn t impacted me because i ve always been extremely isolated . i hate leaving my house , much less my room . i m rejoicing , if anything , because it means i do not have to physically go to school . i think other people dislike this forced isolation , though , because they experience loneliness . someone may be introverted but have a few friends , for example , that they see at school or work , and quarantine takes that away from them . people cannot deal with total isolation unless they already have no friends and such . so , the main issues are losing control of your situation and possibly feeling lonely .","244180":"i attribute my writing style primarily to mental illness . i often say that my writing improved as i became more schizophrenic , but when i reflect on it , i am a rather impressionistic person . by that i mean i can capture the essence of something without knowing much about it . i wrote several chapters of a story inspired by a game i had never even played . i rarely have psychotic episodes anymore , but my writing is more metaphorical and complex than ever , because it is harder to grasp something when it is actually impacting you , so to speak . it s the residue that stays with you . psychology runs in my family my father is a behavioral specialist , himself of course , mental illnesses do , as

them . sometimes you should , but sometimes you should stay , because people do have the capacity to change . it depends on what you see happening in the future . like , you might be in a manipulative

use boxes in every day life . book genres , clothing styles , political parties , etc . people identify with and take an interest in all sorts of boxes , yet have the audacity to complain about other boxes . it s hypocritical , in other words . like , if you are an atheist , a buddhist , a muslim , etc . , you identify with a box . just accept that everyone is in multiple boxes at once . you aren t unique for wanting to get out of a box , because you are unknowingly in many others . if you like mystery novels over fantasy novels , that s an entire box you like over another . it s impossible to

myself . people may think i m very open here , but this isn t my final form , lol , it can be a lot worse . i give someone my entire life story if they simply ask for it . but i won t do it here , because of word limits , potential harassment , etc . anyway , being so open has , as per the previous sentence , led to harassment years of it , in fact . i know to be more private in public places , because in reality people will not simply appreciate someone being so open and frank , they will use the information against them . not everyone is nice . despite everything , i still consider myself to be quite open . i think it makes people feel more comfortable and like they can share , themselves . i want people to feel welcome and like they can tell me anything . being open has caused people to mistake it for lacking self awareness , but i believe in optimal expression , and everything i do is very deliberate . i am too aware of myself , on the contrary , which is precisely why i have so much to share about myself . i know so much about myself . it seems like they just project themselves on to me . failures with no aspirations . i have countless goals , interests , and so forth .","244189":"people have not died on the moon at least , i cannot find anything to suggest they have . space smells like metal and burnt material because of the astronauts suits and gear . there are not corpses floating around in space , nor is there a rotten smell . even if someone hypothetically died in space , their body would decompose disintegrate faster due to a build up of gas , which causes pressure . this pressure makes internal fluids spill out , and the body can even explode .","244190":"my camera for film class was broken . i suspected i was simply winding the film incorrectly . the teacher said it was due by a certain day , otherwise we would get a , but i had a major history project due on the same day . in other words , i was expected to both do this project and go outside and take many photos on the same day . i had no time for that , so i cried even on the bus . my mom contacted the guidance counselor and explained the situation to the photography teacher , and he was understanding . in the end , i took pictures for that project about times keep in mind each film roll holds roughly spaces for pictures , so we re talking about pictures . but the problem wasn t the film or developing but the camera itself . the teacher never gave me an f , despite never turning that project in . and when i finally developed the pictures , school was out because of the coronavirus . while we were all away , a janitor came and threw my film away .","244191":"i have a hard time identifying what i feel anxious about , but i would say failure makes me most anxious , in the sense that it triggers my ocd , which is anxiety based . this is why when i was physically in school , i had various compulsions , such as a checking compulsion to make sure my phone hadn t fallen out of my bag , and obsessive thoughts about blood . but when i am not physically in school , my obsessions and compulsions are minor , if not nonexistent . i m scared to go to college because it will likely trigger things all over again .","244192":"hm , i definitely seek solace in my lover , i feel like she knows just what to say to make me feel better . i m used to feeling like everything is falling apart , though , so i just focus on my own aspirations and what i can control . after all , there is no sense in expending energy on things that cannot be controlled . people often talk about having a comfort show or comfort movie and such , and i think it s important to have something like that to fall back on . i ve never really had that sort of thing , but i think omori is my comfort game as of a few days ago . it s something to get your mind off of how upset you feel . i think everyone should practice meditation , as well , to ground themselves and forget about external stressors , though i admittedly haven t indulged in it much yet . i try not to catastrophize things , because otherwise i feel overwhelmed . that can be accomplished through recognizing the catastrophic thoughts and changing them . as for self harm , i would not call it moral nor immoral , so it can t be acceptable or unacceptable . it is what it is . i think everyone self harms to a degree , whether it be as major as physical mutilation or as minor as a caffeine addiction . but doing anything that is bad for you could be considered self harm . eating junk food versus healthy food , undermining your worth , mistreating your hair , scratching yourself , biting your nails , etc . of course , there are also arguments over what the self encompasses , but i believe it is both your inner self and appearance . that is , something like not practicing personal hygiene is self harm because your body is part of yourself . people resort to different forms of self harm depending on how they feel , but you cannot police someone s emotions . i do not think leaving actual scars from self harm is a good idea , but when someone is in that suicidal mindset , they become trapped in the present and neglect the future . but self harm cannot be unacceptable , because everyone has bodily autonomy .","244193":"my lover did some sacrificial things for me . she admitted to something socially unacceptable about herself so people would give negative attention to her rather than me . i couldn t stand up for myself , so she defended me all the time . she also visited me from states away when i was very suicidal . she gives me gifts without me asking for them . reading anything bad written about me drives me unstable , so at the height of me being harassed , she read everything , to protect me , even at the expense of her own health because reading these things made her unstable , too . i m not so sure about other people doing selfless things for me . people don t really help me or do things for me unless i explicitly ask them to .","244194":"sometimes i am too open about things , and it has been detrimental . i try to suppress myself more nowadays . i m not sure if i would have done things differently , though . if not for being open about a certain thing , i doubt my lover who was at the time just a stranger , of course would have talked to me to begin with . i regret not trusting my instinct more and befriending people who i suspected would come to betray me and yes , they did indeed come to betray me . i tend to hope for the best in people and try not to assume the worst , but at times it s necessary to assume the worst . i wish i did not continue talking to them . i also regret not being more expressive about things that upset me . this lack of assertion has caused people to walk all over me , and for me to simply tolerate it . i need to work on setting boundaries and telling people that being mean to me is unacceptable . i regret not taking meds sooner . my delusions and mania as well as headaches from my concussion caused me to be quite homicidal , and those careless homicidal rants have made people see me in a bad light , despite the fact that it has been years since i ve acted that way . i wish i did not type so much that i injured my wrists . i need more self preservation .","244195":"this .","244196":"my childhood has been one of emotional and physical neglect , as well as psychological abuse , regular harassment , sexual harassment , and abandonment from those i ve cared about . i witnessed my father abuse and later try to kill my mother . my mother threatened to overdose and die in front of me when i was ten . i have isolated myself all my life to get away from them constantly yelling at each other . my health has been neglected for years i was supposed to get an mri and most likely surgery on my wrists years ago , but it never happened , so i ve been in pain every day . when i expressed suicidal thoughts at the age of ten , i was merely hugged , not taken to a professional . i have been depressed and suicidal ever since , and i was not taken to anyone until i explicitly mentioned i had to , despite showing symptoms of derealization , psychosis , etc . , for months . my father laughed when i talked about having hallucinations , like it s something funny . he s a pathological liar and aggressive alcoholic . we have always had money problems , and i lose health insurance every now and then . one time my parents bank accounts were even in the negative digits . my mother was fired from her job due to being disabled , and my father had two jobs but lost one of them . he doesn t make much money anymore we ve had to rely on food trucks and such . it takes my parents a long time to treat bug infestations . i had to practically beg them to get help for a fruit fly infestation . i ve had a carpet beetle problem in my room for years . there was a beetle tiny bug infestation in the pantry and overall house for months , if not a year . the beetles got in our food . i would be eating a poptart and randomly see a beetle crawling on it . and i could go on . . . .","244197":"i think believing you have a chemical imbalance assuming you believe that , since many do , despite hardly any evidence supporting it encourages you to feel helpless against your depression , and like you are just sick and cannot be cured . but it tends to be a perception issue my life is horrible , i hate myself , no one loves me , etc . if you can identify the negative thoughts you have , write them down , and make them positive , then adopt those positive thoughts , you will feel better . fake it until you make it works best for depression .","244198":"no problem , i enjoy reading your posts , and thank you for liking my page . i think people mistakenly believe that happiness and elation are the same , but to me happiness is a feeling of contentment , or peace . peace with oneself , peace with others , peace with totality , and peace with one s life in general . there are four energy forces which i have recognized the force to your own body , the force to your peers , the force to where you live earth itself , if you think of it on a greater scale , and the force to the universe . when one of these is off balance , there is a lack of peace . for instance , if the force to yourself is greater than the force to any of those other things , this may manifest as self loathing , narrow mindedness , narcissism , etc . anything negatively related to the self now , it can just be a single thing or many things . excessive force to others would manifest as a desire for validation , a desire to never be alone , an interest in gossip drama , etc . excessive force to the universe manifests as extreme religiosity , irrational conspiracy theories , etc . excessive force to the world you live in manifests as the inability to be imaginative too grounded in reality , feeling overwhelmed and stressed all the time too much emphasis on obligations , giving up on aspirations , etc . there has to be a healthy balance of all of these things to create genuine happiness . an example of that self love , kindness toward others and peace in solitude , productivity but not overworking yourself or losing sight of your dreams , and a healthy interest in things such as astrology , spirituality does not necessarily have to be religion . . . i wouldn t consider myself to be religious , astronomy , and or other fantastical or far away things . too much emphasis on a single part of your life leads to an imbalance and thus sadness , paranoia , guilt , etc . am i happy , not most of the time . there is a force imbalance in my life . i hate this and that about myself , and have self deprecating thoughts . i m also too people pleasing and have a hard time setting boundaries . i m not happy about my health . my wrists hurt if i type too much . my back and neck hurt because of low vitamin d and bad posture . i get random pain in my arms , fingers , knees , ankles , and so on . i m not sure why . any criticism upsets me greatly . i wish i did not take things so personally . i perceive small things as attacks when they are likely not attacks and when it comes to real attacks , i spiral and have a breakdown . i hope that learning more about buddhism and practicing it not as a religion but as a science teaching it cannot quite be considered a philosophy because it does not deal with basic metaphysical questions will help me eliminate suffering in life and finally become happy .","244199":"because children believe in the existence of things that do not exist , such as santa , since their parents lie to them by saying that those things exist or their peers believe in those things and pass the belief on . i would not lie to my children . their friends can try to tell them that unicorns or santa exist , but i will tell them that they do not , simply . i don t see it as magical to tell children that those things exist , i see it as deceptive ."}}
