  Stop comparing two bands against each other and then commenting on there _____ is better and will be the best. Take into consideration that BOTH are good and yes one may be a bit better but they both work equally to put out good content and music and all the extra things as well and some even been doing it for years and that's okay if another band just started and they're already big! But just because one is in the public eye and making it big doesn't mean put the other band down they had their moment and stories as well and still continue to share and create with you even though they are kinda forgotten about :/

  #PRESSURE is out now everywhere!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I 100% wrote, produced, recorded, mixed, and mastered this whole song myself and I was feeling so much pressure the whole time like ... can I really do all of this myself ??? Is this good enough? Am I good enough? But ironically, listening to the song while I was working on it gave me the courage to take the pressure off and just do it, even if it’s not perfect. I hope it can do the same for you for whatever you have been putting too much pressure on yourself for 🧡

  Boon being a teenager who is only 17 is traveling around the world and working on/ producing music. He helped me produce the whole ""I love you or whatever "" EP as well.
  
  Clayton is  more into photography than the whole video aspect. I will forever cherish and be grateful for the content they did help make possible and the fun times. But I'm also happy to see what their journeys behold.
  
  However we do have new videographers which are Sean and Michael and we sometimes work with sam. It just depends on who is available and we also have acacia who takes alot of our photos and our dear friend Arielle who edits and helps the band flow so much more

  We are not forced to help others no. But there is no issue of taking out the time out of your day to check up on your friends and family to make sure they are actually okay. Theres bit and issue to give a stranger a compliment to make their day better, because who knows what they are actually going through. Its not an issue to clean up your mess or help a worker in a restaurant clean up. Its not an issue to donate money to help a family or a cause out. Its not an issue to go out your way for someone in need who truly deserves it such as making blankets to give to the homeless. We never know what life someone is living or what's going on inside their minds. We tend to be rude and selfish to others or hold a grudge against them, say its not that bad get over it. But the truth is we never know the last moments we will have with those people... And some of you don't even realize the love or respect that person had for anyone until they are gone. ... The world is honestly a sad place. And we all need to come together to spread love and help each other out.

  lol sorry this is so late guys but this was the longest week of my life omfjskskdjd I was in LA for the first half of this week and I was bOOKED from morn to nigh. Then when I got home I turned into a cleaning addict and cleaned almost all day for 2 days. I went through all the closets in my house AND cleaned my garage. I threw away/gave away probably half of what I own !! 🥳 might be turning into a ~minimalist~ stay tuned.. Thennn it was Dani’s birthday on Saturday so we had 3 celebrations for her, one of which was a pool hang on Friday night 🌊 and then we had a Father’s Day brunch this morning. Oh but before that, I had to hit up the medical clinic bc my ear got infected!!! (That picture is not included out of respect for y’all lol) but it’s fine now so don’t worry ahahah so now here i am sitting on my couch, very drained. basically, I have had about .6 seconds of alone time in the past week and a half and my introvert self is dying for some more. 🤯 p.s. my song Pressure comes out on Friday 🤟🏼 #pressurejune21st

  Happy Birthday to my youngest sister!!!!!! I have taken care of Dani since she was a baby. I remember her from the day she was born..... she has always been the most fun, energetic, full of personality and light little child ever! Dani used to write me nice notes or draw me pictures and leave them under my pillow for me to find. I saved them all in a folder and will never get rid of them. She would call me and leave me these sad voicemails if I ever went anywhere fun without her. She used to clean my room and I’d let her keep all the change she found around my room haha. She was so happy that I “let” her help.
  
  We have been through so much. So many ups and downs. I’ve changed her diapers, she’s thrown up on me as a baby, I’ve taken care of her when she was sick, I’ve literally carried her around on my hip, and gone from all of that to seeing her grow into a young woman who is not only an adult but also TALLER than me. So strange to see her from newborn to now having to look up at her. I am blessed to have known Dani her entire life and our family is so so so lucky to have her in it. She brings such a unique energy and beauty to our family and I am soooooo glad to have her in our sisterhood. Dani, you’re one of a kind NEVER CHANGE!!!!! And I will be here forever and ever to pick you up when you fall and smack around anyone who dares to hurt you!!!! Love you!!!! 💗💗💗

  !!!!!! Thanks for being my twin even tho we’re not twins !! thanks for always making me feel understood and seen !! thanks for being such a big part of my life through everything !! I’m so proud of the person that you are. You constantly surprise me with how talented you are, how fearless you are, and how big of a heart you have. You have the BEST personality and I’m so grateful to be able to experience it. We’ve been through so many ups and downs together and I’m so happy to be where we are now 💜 no one could ever replace you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

  They say our family wouldnt be complete without the six cimorelli sister, before it was just the five of us. There was a time when I wasn't to fond of you amd replaced you with a friend as you would always try to invade on that time when you were younger. But as we grew up I realized you had so much to give to the world and the people around you. And now that I'm older I realize that you were meant to be my best friend, my other half, my little sister, basically the twin in life that I should've had. We are two different people with two totally different personalities and likes and dislikes. But our bond is something that will never ever be broken or replaced. When you cry, I cry. When you're hurt I will fight for you. Thank you for always cheering me up, making me laugh, being your crazy wild self, thank you for being the biggest support I need when I get down, just thank you. I don't know why people hate you so much and like to put you down you deserve nothing but love, I'm glad you found emmyn after a tragic heartbreak, but mostly I'm glad to see you alive, growing up and making us more proud. I love you so much the spice to my sugar, happy 19th birthday danielle 🎂

   Are  you hairy shaved trimmed or waxed down there ? My boyfriend wants me to shave she he says all girls do it please help I need to know what other girls do
  ","
  You can wax if you don't like to shave and take the risk of getting razor bumps or a rash or cutting yourself etc. Waxing will hurt but most girls find its much safer and less time consuming plus you don't have to go full on skin with it, you can leave a strip or whatever you feel the most comfortable with until you decide if you want to wax it all off. And you can also use a hair remover cream such as nair to see if it helps remove. But you really dont have to remove the hair if you don't want to, again its your body and only you can decide what to do with it in the end

  My sisters and I went to california ( were we born and raised until 2015 we moved to Tennessee), we spent a week there doing a bunch of collaborations and videos with other people in the music industry or just the entertainment industry in general. We arrived a day late because we had an overlay in texas, then our flight got canceled mid air resulting in an emergency landing in phoenix, arizona. We got a flight the next morning after spending the night in arizona with no luggage. Stayed with sister james and it was such a wonderful time. Then we headed back home to Tennessee after the week was over

  R.I.P you sweet soul, still can't believe you're gone, I'm still brought to tears remembering this day. I cherish the times and memories we have from meeting eachother so many times, and doing the same events, you were always so sweet, down to earth and genuine. A rare gem in a world filled of darkness the bright light that shinned in an music industry that was filled with darkness.  She was always one person who was so kind when we met them. Always welcoming, and loving. Gone to soon but never forgotten may her legacy continue on. Sending my love to her family and friends and fandom 💛💛💛

   Jack J is the worst friend he is partying with Zack behind his friend's back godd may save Jack G
  ","
  You do realize just because jack is supposedly hanging out with Zack doesnt necessary mean he is a bad Friend. I'm sure he has more friends or people in his life he enjoys being around besides jack g. They been bestfriends their entire lives and do almost everything together maybe he just wanted to spend time with soneone else for a change. Know the circumstances before you start to judge and besides no ones knows their personality lives or reasoning 24/7 I'm sure its not a big deal between the two of them. And even if it is its only their business. Stop creating drama I'm sure

  I don't think I can ever live alone. I grew up with 13 people living in a house, sharing a room with two of my sisters almost my entire life. Then when we moved the older girls all got an apartment together, the older boys went to do their own things but I still had my parents, my sister dani, and my younger brothers at the house. Danielle moved out when she turned 18. Leaving only me and my parents and my brothers. But I do have friends from california and here in nashville that come over and stay in the extra rooms. :) but if I ever do live alone it would most likely be with a roommate or my husband

Our flight was delayed hours in dallas,texas. Then from dallas, texas we were mid air and our flight got camcelled resulting in an emergency landing in phoenix, Arizona. We had to book rooms for the 6 of us at a hotel overnight leaving our luggage behind and only allowed our cartoon and the clothes we were wearing for 36 HOURS! Then we went to sleep and woke up at 8-9 to eat breakfast then headed out to the airport and waited for our flight. Was on the flight the whole time and touched down at lax. We had to shower, eat, get dressed and film and edit videos which we are filming a lot. Then yesterday we had back to back meetings and interviews to do. And went to james house and hung out with sister james and went to bed to sleep

   unpopular opinions:
  ","
  Its super annoying when the person you're talking to that has something like let's say a movie coming out soon that has like an ex best friend or just an ex in general in it. But instead of having any bad blood between them they remained friemds who support eachother. And the person ends up just posting one thing like a photo of them together and the entire fan base is basically ""are you back together, please say your together"" like just because they posted a photo of them together does not instantly mean theyre planning or are back together and its disrespectful to them and the other person who is talking to the said person. Also hate when a guy/ girl is single but talking to someone and tje person is crushing on them but low key someone else is always commenting on their photos and stuff

  I kinda am 😊 been I the band since 2010 was the first ever girl band to actually get our started from youtube went viral overnight from posting a cover of party in the usa. Had many great experiences while signed to a major record label in la for a few years but eventually they were trying to change my sisters and I into something that just would never be us. And did not understand our actual message. So we broke away from the industry and went independent. Took a small break from music since by the time we left we wanted to completely give up music. Moved to nashville and started recording amd writing our own songs. Which we finally found our purpose and message, now we run a label amd create music all by ourselves. Our mother is our manager and christina is the leader. And we put out tons of new music and content since then.

  FOR the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I not -- and very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and to-day I would unburthen my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before the world, plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household events. In their consequences, these events have terrified -- have tortured -- have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to expound them. To me, they have presented little but Horror -- to many they will seem less terrible than barroques. Hereafter, perhaps, some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the common-place -- some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances I detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects.
  
  From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and, in my manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.
  
  I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a cat.
  
  This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition, made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever serious upon this point -- and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it happens, just now, to be remembered.
  
  Pluto -- this was the cat's name -- was my favorite pet and playmate. I alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me through the streets.
  
  Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which my general temperament and character -- th

  Be confident. Too many days are wasted comparing ourselves to others and wishing to be something or someone we aren’t. Everybody has their own strengths and weaknesses. It’s only when you accept everything you are - and aren’t - that you will truly succeed.

   Do you still do some of the things you used to do as a child? For instance, I always exclaim ""Cows"" whenever we drive past them, I make loads of weird ass noises, and I often play fight! Maybe I'm just a kid!

  I think overall my personality has remained that of when I was younger. I always been pretty mature for my age so I'm not that thrilling. However if you want to see my real rare peraonality Dani did a whole blog on that on our channel years ago

   If you were to create music, would you play an instrument or use your voice? What instrument, if you chose that?
Would you be in a band or would you be a solo artist? 
What kind of music would you want to create?
  ","
  I do play music and I do both. I been singing basically since I could talk lol, but for over 10 years to be more real. I play the tambourine, keyboard, piano and been trying to learn all the chords to play guitar. I'm in a band with my sisters and I also have done some solo music as well. And our genres are mixed mostly with pop

   Did you hear about Arkansas where the r*pist could sue you for getting an abortion?
  ","
  I haven't payed much attention to the whole news about that but I think its just taking away women's rights and if the person was r.ped who would want to raise a child that was conceived via the person who r.ped them. Especially a 12 year old girl who is a child and it does happen to them but that child is still in school, still has awhole life infront of her and now she's pregnant due to her r.post but she can't get a abortion because the government wants to take away that right also the whole thing about the birth control yes some some are on it because they don't don't want to get pregnant etc. But what about the other uses of it such as helping get rid of ovarian cysts and what not ... Its really sad what the world is coming to instead of creating a future with positive changes it seems like we are teaveling way back in time when the world was chaos and didnt have any rights or rules for anyone

   Thoughts on missouri banning abortion
  ","
  If your screwing around just to get pregnant and don't want kids then I see their viewpoint but the viewooint I don't agree with is they are COMPLETELY banning it. Think of a small child no older then let's say 12 who is a victim of a rape being pregnant and she is obviously still in school... And what not. The poor girl can't even get an abortion and is forced to raise a baby when she is a child herself and let alone a baby that belongs to a rapist

   You are so cute ♥
  ","
  Boy I bet you think about me all the time, in Florida not far from me I'm on your mind
  
  You asked if I would drive down to see you, as if I haven't done enough for you
  
  You didn't wanna try, you took over my mind, you kept me tossin' turnin' in the middle of the night
  
  Your car broke down and you didn't get a ride, didn't even see me when I took that plane ride
  
  Now I'm going through it but I won't give you a call, you let me walk away like it meant nothing at all
  
  Now you're all alone in a brand new state you can miss my voice you can miss my face cuz
  
  I was the best you ever had, you'll never find better than me
  
  You should've realized what you had, now I'm nothin' but a memory
  
  You wanted me to stay and be a secret, you'd hold me long as nobody could see it
  
  You never asked if I would be your lady, my family tried to tell me you were shady
  
  So much drama tried to keep it all inside, it kept me awake in the middle of the night
  
  I tried so hard I just wanted to be right, I tried too hard put up too much of a fight
  
  I let you slide when I shoulda let you go, now I'm doin' good and you're the one who's all alone
  
  I know you think about it and you know
  
  I was the best you ever had, you'll never find better than me
  
  You should've realized what you had, now I'm nothin' but a memory
  
  You treated me wrong, I wrote so many songs, I should've known in April you were already gone
  
  I cried so many tears, I just needed you here, you never came to see me over half of a year
  
  I'm with somebody new, he cares more than you, it's healing my anxiety to not be so blue
  
  So say what you want, do what you gotta do, I know deep down you know the truth
  
  I was the best you ever had, you'll never find better than me
  
  You should've realized what you had, now I'm nothin' but a memory
  
  Oh, you know I loved you boy, we really could've had it all
  
  You could've been the one, but you just let me fall
  
  And now I guess we'll never know, I guess we'll never know

  Dani helped him get a name, our fan base supports his band. Dani helped him with a fan base and even made him big, Dani supported him and his band. Helped him through depression and has done all his promo and photography for them as well. So if he ever does hurt her in a bad way lol thats the end

  I'm not saying I fully support him or I'm involved in the drama or I'm close with him or so so and basically throw unnecessary hate and drama that doesnt involve me or my sisters in this mess. I'm just going to say I'm confused, not sure what to say or do, I'm not on anyones side but I'm mostly just speechless and will say do not let the title of being a celebrity, overnight Hollywood fame and big bank control who you are as a person on the inside and think suddenly you're better than the others involved. Because if you let your overnight fame, money and media into your head your going to loose the things that matter the most and it will be to late to actually say sorry and have meaning behind that. And at the end you're going to be back st square one where you have nothing and no one. .. Due to this what goes up eventually comes back down

   Who’s James Charles? Everyone says he’s canceled. What is he some TV star?Never heard of this dude. And no I didn’t google it I’m using this as a platform  to ask a question and get answers so Nyah.
  ","
  Lol you're asking the wrong person because I know him personally. Hes a you tuber and makeup guru though. But he's trying to branch out and do more things that he loves as well. :) such as singing
  
   https://youtu.be/yDKWmNpw7gE
  























  But lately he's been in the news awhile lot because of some drama with him and tati and the sister squad.
  
  SISTER SQUAD:
  
  Apparently Emma, Ethan, Grayson all unfollowed him and have been hanging out with each other without him becase james was with his own friends at coachella and a convention  as well.
  
  - apparently at the time last year when the dolan twins father passed away James did not go out to support them when all the other friends where there, instead he was on live stream talking about how bored he was and didnt show up when everyone else even flew across states to be there.
  
  - and lastly in videos with Emma and the twins he would always seem to try to be close and touchy with Grayson and give off a predatory effect which sometimes made Grayson a bit uncomfortable
  
  - then the comment about Emma that he liked
  
  TATI
  
  - news going around he was hitting on one of Tati's straight friends and trying to pressure him idk
  
  Either way I try to stay out the gossip and be friends with anyone unless it involves me personally. I still talk and follow all of them regardless

  This week with Lauren - 5/5/19
  
  tbh this week was hard for me mentally, but I had a lot of good times too thanks to my good pals ❤️ if you are having a hard time for any reason today/this week, remember that all you have to do is try. Don’t expect yourself to be a superhuman right now and get everything done flawlessly bc that’s just not gonna happen. Do little things to take care of yourself. Go on a 20 minute walk in the morning to keep your body moving, actually wash your face and brush your teeth every night, go to bed before midnight, set a timer for 10 minutes and just pray. Make a goal for each day that’s something you can actually achieve. Don’t forget that people care about you too. Reach out to your family and friends let them know you’re going through a hard time right now and let them know if there’s anything they can do to help you, even if that just means listening or reminding you to do your laundry or clean your room or do your homework. Most importantly remember that everything happening right now is just temporary, things WILL change. They always do. And if you are putting in effort everyday to live the life you want to live, soon enough you will find yourself where you want to be ❤️

  I grew up in california sharing a room with my sisters Lisa and Danielle. We lived in a house with a total of 13 of us. ( my parents, 6 sisters/girls  6 brothers/boys). This lasted up until may of 2015, when we decided to move to Tennessee. The older girls : Christina, Katherine, Lisa and Amy all moved into an apartment with each other
  
  My parents, me, Dani, and our younger brothers christian, nick, and joey all lived in the family house
  
  And our older brothers Michael and Alex were still living in California but   had their own house as well
  
  Well as years went by :
  
  Christina got married to nick so she moved out - leaving a house to Kath,Lisa and Amy
  
  Dani turned 18 and moved out
  
  Michael- is a Realtor and travels alot
  
  Alex- travels and hardly is home
  
  So in the family house it leaves my parents, my younger brothers, and I and the dog. And our friends who come down from california to visit. We also have our own rooms as well

   Here's 7 questions..just because 

enjoy 

Use as a filler if you want ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  ","
  Hey guys! You may have seen us on YouTube and wondered, who are these girls? We are 6 sisters from a family of 11 kids- yep, we also have 5 brothers! We started our band in our hometown in Northern California in 2007 and since then it's been quite the journey. From playing classic rock covers as a full band, to creating acapella arrangements of covers and uploading them to our YouTube channel, to moving to L.A. and signing with a major record label, to going the traditional ""girl group"" route, to completely rebelling from that and dressing super grungey and performing a 90 minute set of almost all acoustic songs, to leaving our record label and moving all the way to Nashville to become independent artists, we've come a long way since 2007! lol
  
  The ONE constant in our journey has always been YOU GUYS- our amazing, bizarre, international, devoted internet family, the Cim Fam!! We really could not have done any of this without you guys, and to say we are incredibly thankful and full of gratitude for each and every one of you is a HUGE understatement.. THANK YOU, from the bottom of our hearts! We love you guys so much, and every single decision we make is with you and your well-being in mind!
  
  Through this crazy and incredible journey, what we've learned is that the most important part of what we do is the MESSAGE. You guys poured out your hearts to us and shared your darkest secrets, and we realized the only thing we could do was pour our hearts out back to you and make music with the messages we believe will be helpful and positive to you. Our messages are anti-suicide, positive body image, strong self-worth, and finding Faith in the darkest of times. Our mission is to create music and art that reflects this strong core belief that NO ONE is a lost cause- there is hope for everyone, no matter how ""far gone"" they may seem.
  
  We have cried in front of you guys dozens of times on stages from the U.S. to South America to Europe to the Philippines. We have held you, hugged you and listened to your stories in person in meet and greet lines and backstage. We know your hearts, and we care deeply for you guys as if you were our own brothers and sisters, and that is what makes us family!

  Not sure what's more depressing Jere. The fact you call yourself a ""friend"" to someone or the fact that every time they like someone or reveal they think they're cute you have to try and ruin that for them by saying oh he's been hanging out with so and so when there's nothing from the media or their socials of them be in together. Not even a simple picture. And the person has those people on her list where she can easily just message them and ask. So therefore we don't need toxic fake friends in our lives

  The sky's clear the storm has passed, But it's still raining in my head,
  
  I try to stop but I can't help replaying every word you said,
  
  I'm falling apart more each day,
  
  Try to hold on to your memories but I can feel it fade away,
  
  And after all this time,
  
  I haven't been alright,
  
  Since we said goodbye
  
  Cause I, I try to let go,
  
  But I don't know how to move on,
  
  And I tried to forget you,
  
  But I don't know how to move on,
  
  How do you just let go when you don't know how,
  
  How do you know in time it'll all work out?
  
  And how do I know someday, I'll be okay?
  
  When all I know is how I feel right now
  
  Cause I, I try to let go,
  
  But I don't know how to move on,
  
  And I tried to forget you,
  
  But I don't know how to move on,
  
  To Move On

  This week with Lauren - 4/21
  
  Went down to Florida with my sisters a couple days ago. I was in a really reserved/introspective mood this week but was unable really introspect at all bc I was so out of touch I couldn’t put words to anything I was feeling. So not exactly the best “vacation mood” lol but last night I couldn’t sleep so I went out to the back porch at our Airbnb and listened to some moody tunes and wrote out all my thoughts and feelings in a note on my phone. Basically was just attempting to understand my feelings or should I say the lack thereof lol I ended up understanding exactly how I had been feeling and why I had been trying to avoid it and felt waaayyy better after. Heading back to Nashville today feeling a lot more present and real than when I left ✨

  I met Ross lynch once at a event. Kindest soul ever I'm not sure if he had an account on here however. But I don't think he would ever be rude to a fan on purpose. But if they don't mention about being there or you see anything on the news or social media then its most likely not the person.

   🎞 How do you feel about unannounced “flashback” sequences in films and tv shows? By unannounced I mean with no warning or subtitle to tell you the character/s is/are now at a different point in time. Do you automatically understand you’re watching a flashback sequence, or do you find it confusing?
  ","
  In some TV shows or movies its easy to tell bevause they normally show the flashback before the actual present scene starts. In movies sometimes the screen just gets brighter or whiter. But if its like in the middle it canbe confusing. I personally feel they add up to the story if showed at the beginning

   If a man is in love with a married woman, and she’s in love with him, but is in a situation, what should he do? Stick by her and be her friend or move on if she’s not giving him what he wants? And if he can’t be a friend to her then were his intentions not in the right place to begin with ?

  I think he should remain a friend but not get/ give mixed signals on both sides because reminder she still is married.. And until she gets divorced she's basically cheating or comitting adultery if she's dsting the guy. If he can't accept that then he needs to move on

","
  The Red Priestesses are powerful and glamorous, so it makes sense that they'd be flashy fire-sign Leos. Because just as Leo's ruler is the sign, a Red Priestess' ruler is the Lord of Light. Leo, the mighty lion, is deeply connected to light, pride, and power. These associations also connect this mighty sign to the symbol of a Red Priestess. Their powers make them stand apart from all others in the world of Westeros, just as all Leos stand apart from the zodiac here because they are ruled by the Sun.

   What is wrong with the United States these days?
  ","
  Where to begin.. we would rather look for someone to blame than look for solutions to problems.
  
  We look to ruin people’s reputations without giving any due process nor accepting apologizes . Cancel culture is poison.
  
  We don’t respect one another’s opinions .
  
  We judge one another by color religion class sexual orientation and then we lie and say oh we accept you!
  
  We value money and possessions over our health and our family
  
  We’d rather talk to our phones than each other.
  
  We expect politicians to take care of us when they don’t give a shit about you
  
  We cry about our freedoms being taken and then when something bad happens we cry “ why did you allow this to happen?”
  
  Americas not a fun place anymore

  ","
  What comes to mind is this friend I had a yrs ago who would never hold himself accountable for anything. He would say comments that weren't very nice but then didn't care. It would hurt and made me feel less confident when they were about me. He was very judgmental and just didn't care how his rudeness or bluntness made others feel. I haven't told him to stay outta my life, but I hope he does now. I don't wanna be around someone who depresses me
  "
938163,"

  ","
  I would be skeptical
  "
938164,"
   I bet you know someone like that too...Someone who’ll refuse to let anyone speak negatively about you, but who’s gregarious and builds life-long bonds.
  ","
  But I don't. There is no one that I'm close to. No one that I trust over 90%. No one who wants to be my best friend or considers me their best friend. I'm a loner. I've been for a long time. It's crazy bc I was watching a show earlier this morning that I teared up at the end bc these two characters in the shows are such good friends; best friends, and I don't have that. No one who I've trusted as much as they trust each other. I want that so bad.
  "
938165,"
   I hope you’re answering that as the individual who purposely hurt you the most...not who affected your life the most.,.that would be unfair.
  ","
  Hmm. I guess when I answered, I was imagining someone who didn't purposely hurt me the most, but didn't seem to care that they did hurt me. I don't want someone to stay away from me who I know cares about me even if they accidentally hurt me. I think I want someone to stay away who is mindlessly threatening to my mental health (and physical too)

   IOS or Android?

Pros/cons for each?
  ","
  IOS:
  
  Pros: Gets updates for a long time, social media apps are more compatible, Facetime, iMessage & blue bubbles, better battery if you get an iPhone 11, more fluency in ecosystem, better facial recognition software, nicer looking widgets
  
  Cons: Lots of bugs, costs more than it's worth, boring bc of lack of customization, still uses lightning port, gets new features really late
  
  Android:
  
  Pro: Very customizable - can customize almost anything, expandable storage, more apps, splitscreen & popup window option, Google Assistant (better than all the others), very fast charging, more durable, keyboard clipboard, more innovative, faster web browsing, better file transferring between computers, button remapping
  
  Con: Only 3yrs of updates, tends to get more lag than Apple phones, social media apps less compatible (less features within the apps)
  
  But the real pros and cons really depend on the phone....some phones that run Android are very wack bc many companies make budgets phones. So, with phones like Samsung, Pixel, Huawei and OnePlus, you get a lot more pros than you would with any other Android running phone. Those are the only ones that can really compete with Apple phones.
  
  For me, I have both, but I prefer my Android phone (Samsung) as my main driver

   thanks for expressing that to me. I'm sorry about that. I definitely agree with you. Your grades shouldn't determine your potential. you ever tried opening your mind and thinking maybe your calling is something else? do you have any hobbies?
  ","
  Yes, I have been doing that more recently. I really like dance and think it would be cool to work in the dance industry... probably not as a dancer bc I'm not good enough for that, but like at a studio or with Danceon or Steezy or a dancer manager or social media manager for a dance company or studio or whatever bc I already have some social media pages geared to dance and that's kinda fun, but the problem is I don't really know how to get there. Plus, I don't currently live in a state that has many big dance opportunities like California. I also feel like to get a job in that industry that isn't dancing would probably require a business degree and I don't wanna get a degree in that mainly bc I don't wanna take all the dumb business classes they force you to take at school that have nothing to do with what I want to eventually do. I've seen some business classes and they did not seem fun. I wanna find ways to do what I want that doesnt involve college, but I kinda feel pressured to get a degree bc it feels like its what everyone expects. Another option for me would be to try and just find a job I like that doesn't require any degree and take a break from college. I have a job currently, but not one that I like, but I could try that and hope smth hires me.... But today I've just been feeling kinda unmotivated bc the whole education system just makes me really angry.

   Who is the closest person to you? What made them closer than anyone else?
  ","
  It's actually a little hard to answer that bc I have a friend who I have grown up with -- we knew each other since we were practically babies, but nowadays, I know we don't tell each other a lot. We live across the street and her family used to always have dinner with mine and we have summer activities we do together so we were pretty close, but then as we became teenagers, we both became a bit more reserved with our separate lives I think. I knew there were bigs things in her life she wasn't telling me so I kinda stopped trusting her.
  
  I would consider her my closest friend, but at the same time, I have told some of my deeper secrets to other friends bc I felt like I could talk to them more. They told me their sh*t so I told them mine and that made us closer. If we lived nearer to each other, we might be really close by now. But since this first friend lives across the street, we are always being in each other's lives, so I may not be the closest with her, but she's the one I see the most, hang out with the most, known for longest....so basically, it's hard to answer that question.
