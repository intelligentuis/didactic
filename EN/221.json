that s what we went for , for the best parts of the original and uaf . i don t regret doing the show . youngberg and i had talked for years about what we would do with ben if we got the chance . i

. the creation of the charms , along with their destruction and recreation over the ensuing years softened the veil of reality that separates our dimension from the ledger domain . this weakened the

one of the cn execs we actually liked , brian jones .","204878":"no , i don t think any of that stuff is the same . plus the servants being alt bens sounds like a specific plot . in omniverse , they are just robots .","204879":"just say that if he shows up again naked , that s a glitch , he should have had his pants on still .","204880":"no thanks .","204881":"i think it was supposed to be

similar .","204911":"okay .","204912":"we just ignored or got rid of any ideas like that that didn t make any sense .","204913":"it s been awesome since the beginning of time or so .","204914":"yeah ,

can find her and tell her .","204937":"lol ! that would be pretty cool .","204938":"yeah , we had a whole huge list of them . and it s so hard to choose because you just want to see perkins draw all of them .","204939":"i think so .","204940":"pfft","204941":"i really don t know . i mean the whole concept was made specifically for bandai , at their request . but the fact is toy sales were really our undoing . we were able to bring ben s ratings back up from the lows of the previous series , but near the end of ultimate , walmart dropped the toy line from their stores . target did the same soon after , and as different as fans view the latest series , the toys just weren t different enough from the older series for the retailers taste . i hope the later series of figures i saw makes it to retail in some form , there were some great characters there . ben k , some forever knights , vilgax , and of course more ben aliens .","204942":"awesome as always .","204943":"that s not a very good reason .","204944":"laaaaaame .","204945":"i dunno . i can t remember what he originally sounded like . i feel like clancy brown would be a good fit .","204946":"why","204947":"i like argit so

.","205143":"you re welcome .","205144":"well , it was certainly an interesting curve ball they threw us at the last minute . i think he came out alright , i like his how his personality clashes with ben .","205145":"future kai has excalibur .","205146":"no , i ve never heard anyone say they liked that episode . the ultimate ben concept was just too weak after having seen ben k in the original

vreedles for the rest of your natural life ! no chance of parole , case adjourned !","205184":"this is the last one i did . once again , they didn t tell me he had eating powers .","205185":"well ,

spamming me or you will be blocked . don t ask the same question over and over . either i will answer it or i won t .","205188":"he would shoot psychic sound waves .","205189":"no , upgade and techno bubble need machinery to upgrade .","205190":"ben hasn t encountered the vreedles .","205191":"there are a couple . this is for jury rigg , but they told me he was a demon , not a gremlin .","205192":"i guess it s already in there ? the watch seems to get angry when he doesn t have a dna sample that s nearby .","205193":"not really . her design is pretty haunted mansion inspired

are no naturally occurring vreedles . even ma pa were made in a lab somewhere . by extremely substandard scientists .","205204":"nope . but i found some of my original concepts ! this was part of the freelance work i did for ua .","205205":"yes .","205206":"shy .","205207":"there s a granny vreedle !","205208":"not my show .","205209":"watch the show .","205210":"one of the components of your formula is in error .","205211":"like a big chill that came out of the simulator completely intangible all the time , so he can t be hurt or hurt others or something ? seems highly unlikely .","205212":"probably not many , if any others .","205213":"ohh . . . like grandma . . .","205214":"it s the same . genetic code modified by harsh simulation .","205215":"well , there s habidash . he may look prim and proper , but he s not afraid to get his digits dirty .","205216":"what s that mean ? thaddeus was named after tj collins , who worked on uaf and the beginning of omniverse . tj also named blukic and driba .","205217":"nope nope nope .","205218":"bitey , with square tires .","205219":"lol","205220":"that s our prime vilgax in mad ben s eyes . mad ben was trained and brought to power through the machinations of vilgax and maltruant .","205221":"the block button is so conveniently right below that little x button on these questions . just thought you should know .","205222":"i like drawing civilian versions of ben s aliens the best .","205223":"jimmy is an admin !","205224":"and what about on your own behalf ?","205225":"well , get to it !","205226":"amazing how none of those words start with btff . very clever acronym .","205227":"yes . ben has probably used them off screen . somebody tell idw .","205228":"boundless overconfidence . and of course the possibility of total meltdown . that would be bad too .","205229":"yes ! fix the image on the vreedles species page . pick something representative and nice . get an image with as many different vreedles together as possible . and are there any other species pages that need updating ?","205230":"did , i ? sorry about that .","205231":"because i m not a masochist , and i m pretty sure an alias isn t something a guy offhandedly yells at another guy in the heat of battle .","205232":"nobody did good screen grabs of these guys !","205233":"i like them all , but . . .","205234":"nope .","205235":"well , since the species is the one family . . .","205236":"yes , he got him whenever ben got feedback , actiguana , and probably a few others .","205237":"lol , no they clean up after themselves . they don t leave loose pieces around .","205238":"you seriously don t know the story of dr jekyll and mr hyde ? ?","205239":"what am i , google ?","205240":"nah , you ll just get banned

just desperate .","205255":"no , he would have some kind of future hero watch . perhaps he ll even make the massively powerful hero watch amacallit .","205256":"thanks .","205257":"it s like the most hipster parts of seattle or portland .","205258":"or maybe yuri lowenthal","205259":"no thank you .","205260":"it s his first work in animation , i believe . i ve seen his shows before and i really wanted to use him as a voice . we wrote the part for him . have they announced the writer for this episode yet ? ? ? that s even more exciting news ! d","205261":"i guess if he makes it that far !","205262":"yes .","205263":"i know !","205264":"well , it is something for sure .","205265":"zenith is voiced by la historian and kitsch aficionado , charles phoenix . look him up on youtube , learn

style guide . i don t have any of those . try not to gum up the internet with fanon terminology . it just confuses the issues .","205280":"this could really be a complicated question . when the timestream splits , creating an alternate timeline , that is also an alternate dimension . but in theory , you could have an alternate dimension that is not the result of a split in the timeline . it could exist without being affected by ben s reality . i guess it partly depends on if the big bang created the universe , or the multiverse .","205281":"well , that s too bad , because what the hell is an official pose ?","205282":"if it s for the wiki , you should probably ask one of our guest writers who were only there one day a season or so . the wiki doesn t like me as a source because my facts don t fit with the wiki s head canon . honestly , i think i answered this already . some khufans sleep in sarcophagi . the more well off of them do . the poorer mummy citizens can t afford them . so they are a kind of status symbol among the thep khufan wealthy elite .","205283":"what ?","205284":"no , that s why dwayne and glen chose them .","205285":"no . but kevin is always kevin to me , just like ben is ben .","205286":"due to industry rules , i am thankfully not allowed to read any fan fiction .","205287":"i suppose it s a pretty good halloween image , but i ll always prefer them as

, i will give you thaddeus j . collins ! happy halloween !","205293":"how does he ever see with screws for eyes ?","205294":"almost complete ! but the key has unlocked his temporal abilities . if you ve experienced any sotobro effects in your localized time stream , that s probably why .","205295":"i see !","205296":"i used to hang out with dwayne way back when i was on teen titans , talk about comics and stuff . his static shock office was really close to my cube . he was a great guy .","205297":"yes , argit has a human transformation .","205298":"yes .","205299":"it seemed like the natural
