   This guy with depression mentioned that his bf sometimes rocks him back n forth slowly when he's feeling anxious and it weirdly helps him sleep.. don't you find that just plain old cringy and childish? Especially for a grown man.
  ","
  i rock back & forth when i'm feeling anxious or overwhelmed and it calms me down. it's actually a very common coping mechanism. i don't really know the actual science behind it, but it *is* comforting to a lot of people.
  "
407666,"
   Where are my messages?
  ","
  you'll have to be more specific. which messages are you talking about ??
  "
407667,"

   Did June go fast for you? Any highlights?
  ","
  yeah, june went by super fast for me !! i suppose the highlight was my cousin's wedding last weekend, but i also got my hair colored the weekend before that, so that was a highlight too. :'))

  "
407673,"
   Is it correct the use of 'frequently' in this sentence: Her and I use to call each other frequently.
  ","
  yeah, you used ""frequently"" correctly.
  
  however, it should be ""she and i..."" not ""her and i..."" in the beginning of the sentence.
  "
407674,"
   Did you enjoy school when you were there
  ","
  sorta, but not really. school was my escape from my home life, but at the same time, i didn't have many friends and i rarely saw anyone outside of school. i studied and worked hard most of the time because i wanted to get into a good college & leave.
  "
407675,"
   What's the last thing that genuinely surprised you?
  ","
  how much i managed to clean today despite waking up hungover from last night. i did two loads of laundry, dusted and vacuumed the living room and dining room, wiped down all of my furniture in my room, vacuumed my room, reorganized my belongings, and put fresh sheets and pillowcases on the bed.
  "
407676,"
   If you had to listen to one artist/band for the rest of your life, who would it be and why?
  ","
  linkin park. their discography is pretty diverse and they have a hell of a lot of songs, haha.

   Polemic question: Which is better, Burger King or McDonald's?
  ","
  mcdonalds, if i had to choose between the two. they have pretty good coffee.
  "
407678,"

  i honestly have no clue. i graduated from high school 10 years ago.
  "
407679,"
   Are you hard on yourself?
  ","
  yeah, i'm my hardest critic.
  "
407680,"
   Are you perfect at applying eyeliners
  ","
  definitely not, haha. i don't really wear eyeliner unless i'm *trying* to do a wing, but i usually fail miserably.
  "
407681,"
   How’s life?
  ","
  life has been all right, it's had its normal ups & downs like usual. i'm currently feeling pretty good rn actually, i have a lot of motivation so i've been cleaning for like four hours.
  "
407682,"
   Are you easily triggered?
  ","
  no, i've only been triggered on rare occasions, usually in things like television shows or movies. it has to be pretty graphic though.
  "
407683,"
   What are your favorite people/pages to follow on social media outside of ask.fm? (Like on Facebook, IG, or Tumblr)
  ","
  i don't really follow anyone on other social media besides my friends & a few youtubers, lol. i follow a lot of the cast and crew from rooster teeth/achievement hunter, as well as gamers such as markiplier and jacksepticeye.
  "

   #notsponsered ?
  ","
  LOL. i'll promote la croix any day, it's legit the only way i'll drink water. polar sparkling water is good too.
  "
407685,"
   Which movie is worth watching over and over?
  ","
  the lord of the rings trilogy. i can watch them endlessly.
  "
407686,"
   Is being eager to please a flaw or weakness?
  ","
  depends on how your eagerness affects you. if it's putting you at a disadvantage, then it's a flaw. however, if it empowers you, then it's a positive attribute.
  "
407687,"
   What are you grateful for today?
  ","
  la croix sparkling water !! i've been cleaning nonstop since 12pm and it's been keeping me hydrated, & it tastes great. :'))
  "
407688,"
   Are things true only if you believe in them?
  ","
  no. just because you believe in something doesn't mean that it's necessarily true. a lot of people believe in things that are generally inaccurate or false.
  "
407689,"
   Was he in the army?
  ","
  no, he wasn't in the army. he actually wanted to go so badly, but he couldn't for medical reasons.
  "
407690,"

  "
407691,"

  sure, that sounds like fun. :'))
  "
407695,"

  going on askfm, lmao.
  "
407696,"
   Have you ever seen glyphs of hobo code?
  ","
  uh, i don't even know what that is. lmao.
  "
407697,"
   How would you know if you've found happiness if you have nothing to compare it to?
  ","
  you're asking the wrong person, my friend.
  "
407698,"
   If a parent is opposed to their elementary school aged child learning about LGBT+ relationships and all the many different genders that exist, are they hateful and bigoted? Please explain your position.
  ","
  i wouldn't use the terms hateful or bigoted, but i would consider them to be fairly closeminded and ignorant. it's perfectly acceptable and very progressive to teach children about different s*xual orientations and genders, and it leads to further tolerance, understanding and acceptance later in life.
  "
407699,"
   what makes you blush?
  ","
  nothing makes me blush. i'm not really ashamed to talk about anything & i'm very hard to embarrass.
  "
407700,"
   How would you react if you found someone keying your car?
  ","
  i'd be pissed, obviously. i would contact my insurance company & see if it's covered.
  "
407701,"
   Do you like to put your brain on pause and listen to mainstream pop music?
  ","
  sometimes pop, but mostly rap. it doesn't stop my mind, though. lol.
  "
407702,"
   Which sub-genre of horror movies do you prefer?
  ","
  i'm not really a big fan of horror movies.
  "
407703,"
   How would you react if you found out that a secret was kept from you?
  ","
  depends on what the secret is and who the person was who was keeping it from me.
  "
407704,"
   i was wondering have occasional sex would help i'm fully behind other ways like you suggested meds/therapy etc
  ","
  it could lead to s*x addiction if someone is replacing actual coping mechanisms with the act of s*x. they become dependent on the actual feeling of an org*sm.
  "
407705,"
   do you have knowledge on dementia ?
  ","
  i have rudimentary knowledge, sure.
  "
407706,"
   Have you heard about the study that suggests that young men are refraining from s3xual relationships because they grew up with all the ideas around toxic masculinity?
  ","
  no, i haven't heard of that study. that's an interesting perspective, though.
  "
407707,"
   this is a serious question if your partner was depressed would you discreetly offer to take his mind of things or not
  ","
  you mean through s*x ??
  
  probably not. i wouldn't want him to feel obligated to have s*x, and the act of having s*x does not make someone less depressed. he's still going to feel the same way when it's over, and he may even adopt feelings of guilt because he may not enjoy it. if my boyfriend was depressed, i would sit down and talk to him about his feelings and make a plan to try to make him feel better, whether that's through medication or therapy or finding new hobbies that are healthy.
  "
407708,"
   Do you think affirmative actions are unfair?
  ","
  i'm a bit split on affirmative action because it has both pros and cons. on the one hand, i do agree that disadvantaged groups should be allowed to have the same treatment as advantaged groups due to historical background, it's sorta like making up for lost time. however, at the same time, it could lead to preferential treatment, i.e. colleges trying to meet a quota regarding percentages of students who are from minority groups.
  
  in addition, affirmative action leads people to suppress themselves and view themselves as disadvantaged more. while it's healthy to understand the history of oppression and discrimination, it may lead people to not want to progress further and see beyond their lack of advantage. they may not want to better themselves anymore because they see it as part of their identity.
  "
407709,"
   Is it good for your health?
  ","
  i'm not an expert on s*x, so i honestly don't know, lol.
  "
407710,"
   Why?
  ","
  i haven't had the time or the inspiration. normally when i get home from work, i'm totally burnt out from writing all day so i just want to relax.
  "
407711,"
   is it good for mental health?
  ","
  again, it depends on the person. some people have s*x in healthy manners and it gives them a sense of intimacy with their partner. however, other times it's an unhealthy coping mechanism for some people.
  "
407712,"
   Do you still write poems??
  ","
  occasionally, but it's been quite a few months since i've written poetry.
  "
407713,"
   do you think people have more s*x or less s*x these days ?
  ","
  it depends on the person. you can't really quantify something like that as a whole because each person has their own comfort levels regarding s*x and what they deem to be often enough in their own lives.
  "
407714,"
   Are your friends welcomed to visit you at your house?
  ","
  they're welcome if they insist on it, but i don't invite anyone over to my house. if i'm seeing a friend, i always either meet them out somewhere or go to their house.
  "
407715,"
   Are you for or against girdles for men?
  ","
  i have no opinions on it. it's just a clothing item.
  "
407716,"
   how much do you drink a day
  ","
  depends on the day. usually i'll have two large cups of coffee in the morning on the weekends, while during the week i'll only have one cup in the morning and then one cup in the afternoon.
  "
407717,"
   where are they
  ","
  i posted a picture of my tattoos last night, if you feel like scrolling.
  
  i have them on my shoulder blades, my upper and lower arm, the top of my thigh, the back of my calf, my ankle, and my ribs.
  "
407718,"
   Do you like Ruelle's songs?
  ","
  i've never heard her music before.
  "
407719,"
   Do you know how to pick a lock?
  ","
  no, i've actually never tried before.
  "
407720,"
   do you have a secret tattoo somewhere nonone knows about?
  ","
  lol, no. all of my tattoos are visible and everyone knows about them.
  "
407721,"
   is drinking too much coffee bad for your tummy?
  ","
  for some people, yeah. it's never bothered me though.
  "
407722,"
   Space for a phrase you like 〰
  ","
  ""you must move through pain if you wish to be happy, for he who stands still, feels the full force of misery.""
  "
407723,"
   Is your relationship with your mom getting better?
  ","
  no, it's the same as it's always been. i'm not putting any effort into improving relations because i honestly don't care enough.
  "
407724,"
   Do you believe people can be changed?
  ","
  yeah, but they have to acknowledge that they can improve and that what they're currently doing isn't good. however, outsiders cannot change their loved ones, friends, etc etc. to try to do so would be manipulative.
  "
407725,"
   How different do you think you will be in a year's time?
  ","
  i can't even imagine myself one month from now, let alone one year. lmao. i could be completely different with perhaps greater confidence, or i could be the same as i am today. it all depends on what i've gone through or accomplished within the next year.
  "
407726,"
   At what do you stop trying with someone?
  ","
  when they won't acknowledge that what they're doing is wrong or hurtful, have no desire to change, and aren't putting in any effort into the relationship or friendship.
  "
407727,"
   Are you good at pool table and tennis table?
  ","
  i'm absolutely terrible at both, lmao. however, that doesn't stop me from playing. pool is one of my favorite games, especially if there's a pool table at the bar.
  "
407728,"
   What is the best good moment in your life?! ♥♣♪♠♦
  ","
  any time my boyfriend and i have gone on a small weekend vacation are wonderful moments. we don't have responsibilities for once in our lives, and we can do what we please with no restrictions. we normally go to upstate new york or montauk, new york.
  "
407729,"
   If you had the opportunity to go somewhere and start a new life, where would you go? What job would you have? And how do you imagine your house there?
  ","
  i would likely either move abroad or go down south to perhaps north carolina. i would probably have a similar job as what i have now, which is a writer & editor for a publishing company, where i could write articles and press releases as well as help in publishing items. that, or i would settle down and try to be a published author.
  
  i imagine having a small, quaint house with a lot of windows and wood furnishings. there would be plants and animals everywhere, and it would be a place where my friends could come if they have nowhere else to go. i would like my future home to sorta have an ""open door"" policy because i would want others to feel comfortable.
  "
407730,"
   Have you ever been thrown out of anywhere or asked to leave?
  ","
  yeah, i got kicked out of a wal-mart once because my friend stole something, so we were asked to leave. i'm not sure if we were necessarily banned from there, but still i haven't gone back, haha. this was years ago.
  "
407731,"
   Are you a hermit? How often do you like to go to parties
  ","
  i'm not really a hermit, no. i usually see my friends once per week, and occasionally i'll go to parties but it's rather rare because they only happen on holidays really; i.e., my coworker threw a fourth of july party last night & i went, it was actually pretty fun.
  "
407732,"
   ""All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them.""  ―  Are you pursuing your dreams?
  ","
  yes, for the most part. i'm slowly working towards my dreams & goals, because unfortunately they aren't an overnight thing. sometimes the process can be a bit daunting or worrisome, but it's absolutely worth it in the end.
  "
407733,"
   What does your name mean?
  ","
  leigh means ""dweller by the wood or clearing.""
  "
407734,"
   What are some of the best feelings in life?
  ","
  hearing a loved one laugh or seeing them smile; immersing yourself in nature; having the first cup of coffee of the day; having a sense of accomplishment and pride when you did well on something you were previously worried about; receiving positive reinforcement from a trusted friend, family member or colleague; and being listened to and validated.
  "
407735,"
   What's the last lie that you told?
  ","
  one of my coworkers who's been pissing me off asked if i wanted to hang out today, so i lied and told her it was laundry day so i wouldn't be able to see her. lmao.
  "
407736,"
   Happy to know there are nonbinary people here on ask XD
  ","
  there's quite a few of us !!
  "
407737,"
   What is missing in your life that would make you very happy?
  ","
  another tattoo, lmao. i haven't gotten around to making an appointment or a consultation yet, though. i know which artist i want to do the tattoo, her work is amazing.
  "
407738,"
   If you like Mexican food what is your favorite dish?
  ","
  i don't know if this is considered mexican food, but i love classic rice & beans, as well as empanadas. my boyfriend's grandmother makes amazing empanadas and her rice & beans are so delicious. every time she makes them all, she ends up making a huge batch that lasts my boyfriend and me two days.
  "
407739,"
   How close are ypu with ypur family?
  ","
  i'm not close to my family at all, tbh. the person i'm closest to is perhaps my brother, but we don't generally speak to each other unless we're at a family event.
  "
407740,"
   What is your definition of perfection? What makes something perfect? ?STAIF?
  ","
  i don't believe perfection exists. we're human beings & we're naturally flawed creatures, so nothing we do or think will be absolutely perfect. we're prone to mistakes & the only thing we can do to prevent them in the future is to learn from them.

  "
407743,"

Takeout/ fast food?

  "
407749,"

  yeah, i was in nassau county & we got that, but also the really bad rain & hail. i couldn't believe it was hailing outside, i've never seen that before. i thought my windshield was going to break.

407762,"
   What are some things you dislike about your boyfriend? Habits, personality etc.

  the only thing that bothers me about him is that he's a fairly messy person. he has a bad habit of leaving cups on the table, throwing his clothes on the ground, etc etc. he's gotten a lot better over the past year, at the very least, but when he works a lot, his bedroom becomes atrocious because he doesn't have the energy or the time to clean it, lol.

  "
407768,"
   Whats a lesson your past relationship taught you?
  ","
  pursue a relationship with someone where you accept & love them for who they are, not for a fantasy version of them that differs from the truth. i was very young in my last relationship, and over time i noticed that i was in love with the *idea* of him, not so much him as he actually was. i eventually broke up with him, for a variety of other unrelated reasons as well, but it was a conclusion i came to perhaps months later.
  "
407769,"
   I'm in a long distance relationship and things were great for a couple months then he started working a lot and I feel we don't spend as much time as I please, he knows this. There's nothing I can do about his schedule. Everything else is great but that bothers me. What do you think I should do?
  ","
  ah, i can relate to this a lot. my boyfriend and i both work a lot (he works like 50 hours per week), and our schedules are totally opposite so i only see him once per week even though we live close to each other.
  
  have you tried other avenues of ""seeing"" each other? i.e., facetiming, skyping, snapchat or facebook video, etc etc. i also don't know how you feel about talking on the phone, but i talk to my boyfriend every night & it helps a lot on the days we can't see each other.

   When you watch music videos how do you like them? 

live, audio, background to films, acoustic version, lyrics shown etc

  "
407771,"
   What's the longest you've gone without sleep?
  ","
  i think the longest i've been awake was 40 hours. i didn't sleep for two days, i guess that equals out to, which doesn't seem like much but it definitely caused me a lot of trouble since i was a high school student at the time, haha.

   Which do you prefer books or movies game of thrones?
  ","
  i don't have much experience with reading the books, since i'm only maybe 200 pages into the first book in the series. however, it's definitely a lot more interesting, and it goes further in depth that the television show ever does.
  "
407774,"
   What is your happiest memory?
  ","
  i don't believe i can choose just one tbh. all of the road trips/vacations i've been on with my boyfriend are all happy, delightful memories -- ranging from when we go upstate to when we visit the east end and montauk. we even traveled to austin, texas, a few years ago and that was an amazing memory.
  "
407775,"
   Which has more value: creativity or knowledge?
  ","
  they're both inherently valuable, but it just depends on how/when you apply those traits throughout your life. you can be a creative person, but without the application of that creativity, you or your talents aren't very valuable. the same can be said for knowledge -- you may have a plethora of knowledge within you, but if you don't push forward and apply that knowledge to a greater cause, it's not valuable at all.

   Hi Leigh I guess I need to rant or something... my eyesight is shit and I’m already at the age where my myopia should stabilise but it’s not... even with contact lenses things are very blurry for me and it makes me more depressed and very sad.. my family genetics in eyesight aren’t good... I know
  ","
  (cont) my myopia has increased but I’m afraid to go check it out. Can you relate? Sorry just need to rant.
  
  --
  
  yeah, i can definitely relate to this !! i've been wearing glasses since i was a toddler, and my eyesight has only gotten worse as i've gotten older. it's never stabilized either, and i think that partially has to do with my astigmatism.
  
  honestly, contacts didn't help my eyesight at all and they made my eyes itchy and irritated. do you wear glasses as well? it may help more, but i do understand the fear of going to the doctor. i haven't gone in three years to get my eyes re-examined, even though i should ideally go annually.

   This answer shows that you actually are a strong person. You know yourself and your feelings. You always answer openly and respectfully. You know a lot about mental health and you always offer your help. I'm not judging here, but from my point of view, you are a very STRONG person Leigh.

  "
407818,"
   Do you believe in the concept of soul mates?

  not really, no. at least not the stereotypical concept that says that everyone has only one soul mate. i believe that if soul mates did exist then it could apply to several different people for various reasons, whether the relationship is romantic or platonic.

  ","
  no, it has nothing to do with me really so it doesn't affect me. if someone doesn't like me, then that's more of a ""them"" problem because they came to that conclusion, and unless they're going out of their way to damage my life, it doesn't bother me at all.

   They always say its the employees job to  clean it what are your thoughts on that
  ","
  that's such a bullsh*t excuse, lol. it's impossible for every employee to run around and immediately clean a machine after a customer has used it before the next customer starts using it, especially when it comes to treadmills and bikes.
  
  it's as simple as this -- clean up after yourself. wipe your own sweat off the machine and make it ready for the next person. if you have a problem with that, then don't go to the f*cking gym.

  lobster bisque, new england clam chowder, broccoli cheddar, and hearty vegetable.
  "
407840,"
   What do you do when you feel sad?
  ","
  it really depends on the kind of sadness, if that makes sense (lol). i have really somber periods of sadness, where all i do is cry and listen to sad music. i have destructive sadness, where i need to escape from my emotions and get drunk and/or high. and i have quiet sadness, where i sit in silence and do absolutely nothing or try to sleep it off.
  "
407841,"
   Do you wear less makeup in the summer? Favorite go to looks?
  ","
  i seldom wear makeup to begin with, unless i'm going out somewhere and have the patience to put some makeup on. i also do wear less foundation in the summer months anyway, mostly because my face gets tan and i don't feel like dishing out the money to buy a darker shade of foundation.
  
  my go-to look is similar to my makeup style in my current profile picture, if you can see it. neutral eyeshadow shades in reds, pinks, and browns; mascara; a small bit of contouring with highlighter; and a nude or red lip.

  i absolutely *love* cheez-its, lmaoo. they're my all time favorite snack. the regular, classic ones are delicious, but i also really like the cheez-it grooves in white cheddar.
  "
407845,"
   Not a question but you'll be a great mum

407846,"
   What is something people always do when you go to the gym. Mine is  wipe off your sweat off the fucking machine when you've finished using it
  ","
  yes !! that's a really big deal to me, and i've only ever seen maybe one or two people completely walk away from the machine without cleaning it first. there are cleaning stations all over the gym i used to go to, and there's really no excuse as to why you can't squirt some cleaner on a paper towel and wipe the machine down quickly. smh.
  "
407847,"

  "
407850,"

  ","
  it has helped me tremendously, yeah. i struggle with mental illness and i started attending therapy because i was having s*icidal thoughts and didn't know what to do with myself anymore. i went to my general practitioner & she referred me to a counseling center that had both therapists and psychiatrists, so i made appointments to see both.
  "

  it isn't my all-time favorite song (because i don't have one), but i've been listening to ""soco amaretto lime"" by brand new non-stop for the past 24 hours.

407855,"
   How's going
  ","
  things are going fine at the moment. i'm honestly just so mentally exhausted -- i feel like i'm burnt out from working, even though i had a three-day weekend last week. i find myself questioning if it's worth it to call out or leave work early, even though i really have no reasonable excuse. i'm just drained.

  "
407858,"
   Did you hear about that youtuber etika what a shame
  ","
  yes, i did. :// i follow some youtubers on twitter who were posting about him the day he was found, it brought me to tears. i never watched etika's videos or really knew who he was, unfortunately. but this is just further evidence that celebrities are human and prone to depression, anxiety, etc etc., just like the rest of us. no one is immune and we *need* to keep having conversations about mental health to make reaching out more acceptable and less stigmatizing.

  i wasn't tired, no. i still got more than 6 hours of sleep.

  don't settle for anything less than what you deserve. it's perfectly fine to be picky when dating, and even if you're already in a relationship, you shouldn't be anything less than happy with your partner and your progress together.
  
  life is too short to settle down with something that simply feels comfortable. you deserve someone who will not only make you feel at home, but also be a beacon of support, a source of encouragement, someone who brings out the best version of yourself.

  "
407917,"
   Why does society place such a high value on beauty when it serves no functional purpose?
  ","
  the truth is, everything is catered to the male gaze, and even though realistically beauty has no importance to what's significant in life, it's become conventional and standard to place that importance on beauty in order to quantify some sort of worth in society.
  
  from early times, women have always catered to men. the idea of a woman's beauty has been deemed as important to further serve the men in their lives. in the current age, that has manifested in different makeup forms, body types, body hair styles, etc etc. women are told ""men won't like you with short hair"" or ""men don't like when women are not shaved,"" and so on. it's become so typical and commonplace to see these standards of beauty and most people don't acknowledge how misogynistic it can be.
  "

  thankfully, i feel like my vocabulary is pretty diverse, due in part to my studies in grammar and literature while in college. the words come to me naturally, even words that i notice i haven't used in quite some time, depending on the situation and what message i'm trying to convey.
  "
407919,"
   What is a big decision you've made that has changed your life forever? Was it for good and for bad?
  ","
  while i do have a lot of terrible and depression decisions that made my life worse, for the sake of askfm i'll answer this on a positive note.
  
  deciding to stick through with college & graduate changed my life, and for the greater good. i struggled a lot with my grades and juggling assignments, especially with my mental health being as bad as it was, but i knew that if i dropped out then i would feel worse. i stuck through with my studies and ended up graduating with a 3.9 GPA. it's changed my life for the better because i wouldn't have had the job opportunities i've had, had i not graduated.
  "
407920,"
   Do you think it's fair to treat people exactly the same way they treat you?
  ","
  in theory, yes. it's technically fair -- but in application, no. for example, even if your boss looks down on you, in some circumstances you simply cannot treat them the same way otherwise you'll lose your job. and while some people may think that's worth losing their job over, other people can't afford that to happen to them.
  
  the reality is, sometimes we have no choice but to deal with being treated poorly by people. however, in most cases we do need to take a step above them and take the higher ground, because by behaving like them you're only stooping down to their level.
  "
407921,"
   What is the best book you have read?
  ","
  ""girl interrupted"" by susanna kaysen is perhaps the best, and most important, book i've read to date.
  
  it's definitely not a complex novel, but it's an autobiographical sketch of a woman's lessons she learned while staying in a psychiatric ward after being diagnosed with BPD. it was the first book i read that introduced me to the importance of mental health and also was my first insight into depression, anxiety, and BPD. i was able to relate to many of the characters, which was my first clue that i was struggling with mental health myself.
  "
407922,"
   How have your priorities changed over time?
  ","
  i used to prioritize other people's needs & desires over my own. as i've gotten older, i've learned that my own needs, desires, and happiness are just as important as those of others. i'm now acknowledging that i need to prioritize myself moreso than ever these days, because i cannot help others until i ultimately help myself. i'm learning that i deserve happiness and recognition.

   Do you ever self sensor on the internet because you're afraid of what other may think of your perspectives?

   What are some things your bf/husband does that annoys you
  ","
  the only thing that bothers me is that he's a very messy person, lol. he throws his clothes wherever, he leaves empty cups on the table, the garbage doesn't usually make it to the garbage, etc etc.
  
  it used to be much worse, so it's gotten better within the past year ever since he reorganized his bedroom. he has more incentive to keep it clean and has learned that he feels better mentally when his living space is organized.
  "
407987,"
   Any idea why bullies bully?
  ","
  usually because they're insecure with themselves or have pent up aggression from experiences (normally at home). people don't bully others unless they feel weak in some aspect of their lives, or unfulfilled. it never comes from a good place.
  "
407988,"
   Ever been bullied?

  yes, i was bullied a lot when i was in middle school, as well as the beginning of high school. i was bullied for my appearance and my dress style, because i was goth at the time.

   What was the thing that annoyed you?
  ","
  an experience i had at work this afternoon. on my lunch break, my coworkers and i were outside and noticed a dog running around the parking lot & it seemed scared. my coworkers cautiously walked to the parking lot to see what was going on, and after about 10 minutes, a woman walked out of the office building and basically said, ""oh yeah, that's my dog. did she escape?"" and totally didn't seem phased by the fact that her dog was running around and almost got lost.
  
  also, the dog didn't have a collar or identification. the woman left the dog in the car for who knows how long, with the window wide open. the dog likely hopped out of the car because it was dying of heat. ://
  
  i was so annoyed and upset over the entire ordeal, the woman was totally irresponsible. she shouldn't have a dog to begin with if she can't take care of it.

   What should someone have in a resume?
  ","
  a resume is a basic overview of your professional experiences and goals, and it can be as simple or as complex as you'd like.
  
  personally speaking, i've always gone with a more simple, straightforward approach with my resumes for easy reading. i'll list my career objectives, my past work history with a brief explanation of my tasks and responsibilities, and my schooling (with certain achievements, like being on the dean's list or graduating magna cum laude or being published).
  
  i also have a section on my resume of my professional skills, i.e. proficiency in adobe, microsoft office, photo editing, customer service, writing and editing, etc etc. at the end of the resume, i have a section that says ""references available upon request,"" and on a separate document i have a few professional references with their email addresses and whatnot.

   What's wrong with being a SJW?
  ","
  there's nothing inherently wrong with being a ""social justice warrior"" in the sense that there isn't anything wrong with being socially conscious, advocating for the rights of others, and calling out problematic behavior to be more inclusive.
  
  however, there's this SJW culture of people who claim to be feminists, but they use it to their advantage to try to justify their own problematic beliefs. it's more of a popularity label than anything else, and people generally don't advocate for what's morally and socially right anymore. it's just an arguing competition online, and in general these people don't transpose their words into actions IRL.

  ","
  no, quite the opposite actually. if a man cries, he's simply human -- it's normal, expected and healthy to cry for a variety of emotions & someone isn't less of a man for releasing those emotions.
  
  the idea that crying makes men weak is extremely unhealthy and antiquated. it's a stigma used against men to promote toxic hypermasculinity in a society where men are conditioned into thinking that they should never display emotion. it's not good or healthy to suppress yourself like that, regardless of your gender.

  haha, thank you !! i had a fine day -- my boyfriend and i woke up in the hotel, got on the road by 10am, and got home around 3pm. we picked up some lunch on the way home because we were starving, and after i dropped him off at his house, i came home, sorted through my things, and laid down for an hour or two.
  
  i'm still exhausted, so i'm probably going to call it an early night. i kinda regret not taking off from work tomorrow. ://

  i didn't drive, my boyfriend drove (bless his heart). the trip itself was fine, just getting through new york city was terrible both going there and coming home. it was a five hour ride both ways.
  "
408092,"

  partly, yes. i didn't want to go to the wedding with my hair as faded and terrible looking as it was, and i also wanted to color it again anyway. so it just worked out.

   at what point do you consider a fetus is ""alive"" and not equivalent to a brain dead person?

  i've always considered fetuses to be ""alive"" when they're viable outside of the womb. otherwise they're basically just a parasite.

   Is it possible to love more than one person at the same time?

  yes, some people have the capability of loving more than one person in a relationship (i.e. polyamorous people). you can love different people for different reasons, and love is not restricted to solely one person.

   Where's a good place to take a woman on a date if she helpfully said's ""Surprise me"" when asked for any input? ??‍♂️
  ","
  honestly, it depends on the woman. not everyone has the same interests, so it differs from person to person. try to gauge her personality and assess what you believe she would most like, and then try finding a place or event from there.

  yes, i've felt that numerous times before. i often think that my close friends are trying to phase me out of their lives because they never contact me first or ask me to hang out, and i feel as if i'm forcing them to hang out with me because i'm always the one to ask first. ://
  
  i always wonder if they would ever talk to me if i didn't text them first. and sometimes i try challenging it, but then i get extremely agitated and impulsive and wind up texting them anyway.
  "
408116,"
   What TV shows do you watch

  usually shows having to do with true crime or prison, haha. i absolutely love wentworth and orange is the new black, and i also watch shows like forensic files, NCIS, criminal minds, bones, castle, etc etc. i also like parks and recreation, how i met your mother, its always sunny in philadelphia, big mouth, bojack horseman, ghost adventures, the x files, and more.

   hey Leigh, what is a good argument against pro-life people who constantly say that ""abortion is murder""?
  ","
  life doesn't begin at conception or even when the heart develops. if a person is passing away, they're not clinically considered de*d until their brain stops working, not their heart. most people agree that life may begin after a fetus becomes viable outside of the womb.
  "
408122,"

  love feels differently for everyone, and there are multiple forms of love that exist.
  
  according to ancient greek beliefs, there are seven forms of love: eros, love of the body; philia, love of the mind; ludus, playful love; pragma, longstanding love; agape, love of the soul; philautia, love of the self; and storge; love of the child.
  "
408136,"
   What separates real, friends from acquaintances?
  ","
  real friends are people whom you can trust wholeheartedly with your secrets, struggles, and triumphs. people who will be real with you regardless of the circumstance, and people who bring out the best version of you. there's a certain platonic intimacy among real, close friends that doesn't exist elsewhere.
  
  acquaintances, on the other hand, are merely people you pass by without a semblance of intimacy or connection. they really just exist.

   When it comes to getting gifts , do you like to be surprised or would you prefer to pick out your own present?
  ","
  a little bit of both, sorta ?? i like being surprised by sentimental gifts, but there's also the risk of being placed in an awkward position if someone gives you a gift you don't like or can't use. i sometimes prefer to pick out my own gifts, like getting a visa gift card or something.

  abandonment by my loved ones, i.e. my boyfriend and a close friend or two.
  "
408151,"
   What is the most important thing in being a good friend?
  ","
  to be a good friend, i believe one of the most important things is to simply be upfront and honest. if a friend is exhibiting toxic behavior or is causing trouble for themselves, then it's only right to talk to that friend and try to help them realize that what they're doing is wrong so that they can better themselves.
  "
408152,"
   is it wrong to want to marry someone for their material wealth?
  ","
  yeah, i personally believe that's wrong. it's incredibly shallow to only marry a person to gain their inheritance or share their wealth. relationships should revolve around love and trust, not personal gain.
  "
408153,"
   How would you deal with someone who moans about everything

   Do you belive in love in first sight

  no, i don't believe in love at first sight. you cannot be in love with someone upon meeting them for the first time. what someone feels when they're infatuated with a person upon meeting them is merely lust.

   Is it healthy to stay in a relationship when one partner loves the other one more?
  ","
  unless the partner makes it completely obvious that they don't love their partner, i think it's difficult to determine if someone loves their partner more than the other. especially because love languages are complex and people express their love differently.
  
  however, in the case where one person definitely doesn't love their partner as much as their partner loves them, then yeah that can get really unhealthy. the same can be said for any sort of relationship, romantic or platonic. both people need to be putting in work to maintain that relationship, otherwise it's simply one-sided and unfair.
  "
408218,"
   I didn't say no one cares for you
  ","
  you said *most* people, which is basically a nice way of saying no one. i already have my doubts about people in my life caring about me, so reassuring the fact that they genuinely don't care -- or at least *most* of them don't care -- isn't exactly the right thing to say.
  
  that insinuates that i definitely have friends who pretend to be friends with me, whether out of obligation or pity, and only furthest my assumption that they actually don't care about whether i'm alive or de*d.
  "
408219,"
   No, I meant that it's not just you.  Most people don't care about other people and what happens to them.  It's a fact

  i understand that. but to basically say ""you're right, no one cares about you"" is definitely not a healthy or right thing to say to a person who clearly struggles with s*icidal thoughts. that was pretty insensitive.

  it isn't outrageous to expect fathers to be a parent to their children, regardless of whether or not they have a job. mothers usually have full-time jobs too, and they're 100 percent expected to also care for the children outside of their careers.

408264,"
   Watch any “Mom movie” and notice that every father in there is a complete idiot, a cheater, loser etc. People always praise mothers but fathers. Mothers get away with everything, they can easily have the children too. It’s unfair
  ","
  i don't really know what you mean by ""mom movie,"" lol. i don't generally watch movies that revolve around families and whatnot.
  
  i also believe when it comes to child custody, the responsibility does often go to the mother as well, so i agree with you. however, that's usually in instances where the father is obviously unfit to be a father so it's in the child's best interest to remain with the mother. otherwise, there's shared custody.
  "
408265,"
   Once again, you're saying something which applies to fathers in a much more dramatic way. Father's are treated seconds class to mother's.
  ","
  i respectfully disagree. in my experience, fathers are generally treated with more respect than mothers because of the culture that exists around men and women in general. women are seen as childbearers and their role as a mother is expected, meanwhile when a lot of fathers do necessary things for their children, it's praised.
  "
408266,"
   Expect for this thing called ""mother's day"", which is insanely more promoted, popular and mainstream than father's day.
  ","
  is it? i really never took notice of that before, in my eyes both hallmark holidays are basically treated the same way.
  
  even if that was indeed true, that doesn't mean that mothers aren't treated unfairly every other day of the year. showing appreciation for mothers one day per year doesn't mean that the stigma and expectations around being a mother aren't there anymore.

   lol like what? people don’t really care that much for Father’s Day
  ","
  i think it depends on where you're from, because i've been seeing a lot of posts online today already about people appreciating their fathers.
  
  but in general, mothers are normally expected to take care of the children and are never praised or rewarded for being mothers. there's a culture around fatherhood, on the other hand, where a lot of fathers seem to get immense praise for doing things like watching the children or changing diapers, even though realistically that's part of their role as a father.

  there's a part of me that says yes, because i'm a vengeful person at times and i only wish that those who hurt me would receive some sort of punishment. however, there's also a part of me that says no, because it's useless to invest your energy into something so negative that will only end up hurting you in the long run.

  at first, i'm normally down on myself because i have a difficult time accepting personal failures. i have high expectations for myself all the time. however, talking the situation out with my boyfriend or a close friend usually helps motivate me to do better. they can rationalize the situation and validate my feelings, which inspires me to move on and try again.
  "
408354,"
   why do you  think some people are racist!
  ","
  people are usually racist because they grew up in an environment that was racist, generally in a racist household. it becomes ingrained in them from when they're young. they never unlearned their thought process, and sometimes it gets to the point where they've become so intolerant that they're incapable of changing.

   Is it unhealthy to get mad and frustrated at other people's happiness just because I can't be like them? It makes me mad to see people fulfilled.
  ","
  yeah, that sounds pretty unhealthy to me. someone else's happiness shouldn't affect your happiness, and also just because someone gives off the impression that they're happy or fulfilled doesn't mean they actually are. people only talk or post about the good things in their life, never their struggles.
  "
408361,"
   What does 'first world problem' really mean? I hear that a lot
  ","
  when someone has a ""first world problem,"" it's generally referring to a problem that's pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things that would only happen to a person who is privileged to be living in a first world country.
  
  like, say someone complains that their favorite brand of bottled water is out of stock at the store. people might say that's a ""first world problem"" because there are countries that don't even have clean water.
  "
408362,"
   Is it inappropriate to ask a psychiatrist for certain meds?
  ","
  i think it depends on how long you've been seeing them and how you go about asking the question. there's nothing wrong with being educated about different medication, and if you think a certain medication may help you, then it's a good idea to ask about it. as long as you're not literally demanding for the medication, i see nothing wrong.

   Do you believe in the concept of karma?

  no, i don't believe in karma. life is simply unfair -- people who do bad things seldom receive consequence for what they've done, and good people are rarely rewarded or recognized for their good deeds.
  "
408365,"
   What do you prefer: Modern or Classic Literature?
  ","
  i can appreciate both forms of literature, so i don't really have a preference. i like reading the classics because it's interesting to me to see where contemporary works originated from and how the classics set the stage for other forms of writing. there's also something uniquely different and mystical about classic novels, i can't quite put my finger on it.
  
  however, i also like modern literature too because there's simply so much creative freedom out there now.
  "
408366,"
   Do you have any unfinished projects that you keep meaning to finish but don’t?

  yes, i have a bad habit of never finishing any of my creative projects, whether they're paintings or pieces of prose. i also have a lot of video games that i never finished playing, haha.
  "
408367,"
   What's your best piece of advice based on your life experiences?
  ","
  relationships (whether platonic or romantic) shouldn't be one-sided. don't put effort into a relationship if the other person does not reciprocate that same level of effort. people often get taken advantage of in relationships because they're either too nice or too shy and are too forgiving when it comes to the levels of dedication on each side.
  
  don't settle for anything less than you deserve. if you're being shorted in a relationship, either try to fix it with the other person through open communication or end the relationship. do what serves you first and foremost, there's nothing wrong with putting yourself first at times.

   what does it mean when someone uses the word 'late' to describe another person? i.e this bracelet belonged to the late Kelly. does it mean that person passed away?

  "
408374,"
   What makes a person rich?
  ","
  i don't really see being rich as a financial thing, because you can be wealthy and still be deeply unhappy with your life. a person is rich when they're happy or content with their life, they surround themselves with positivity and loved ones, they immerse themselves in hobbies and events that make them happy, and they contribute to others.
  "
408375,"

  i would rather lose my money and valuables. you can always make more money as time goes on and acquire new valuables, and generally speaking i don't own many things that are sentimental to me like that.
  
  however, i do value photographs a lot. i have a really bad memory, and photos are one of the few ways i'm reminded of all of the good moments of my life. i have a dozen photo albums of various trips i went on with my boyfriend and i'm constantly taking photos whenever i go out with friends, whether it's pictures of us or of the food and drinks or scenery.

  ","
  i don't care about looking ""hot."" i have no one that i wish to impress, and what you just described does not sound appealing to me at all. i'm growing my hair out, i rarely wear makeup, i don't have my ears pierced, and i don't wear tight clothing.

  i understand how you feel & your emotions are completely justified. death is difficult to process and overcome, especially in the context of a loved one or significant other.
  
  however, just because he passed away doesn't mean you cannot date other people. you may find that you'll be ready in due time. he probably wouldn't want you to dwell on the past or prevent yourself from being happy. if anything, he would likely want you to be the happiest version of yourself you can be and find someone who brings that out in you. you deserve to be happy and loved.

  i try really hard not to be a jealous person, but sometimes it comes out of me without me realizing it. it's something i'm continuously trying to work on. jealousy is a toxic emotion, and it hurts you first and foremost.

408404,"

   When you have to make a difficult decision, what do you do?
  ","
  if i have to make a difficult decision, i normally talk it through with my boyfriend so that i can get a different perspective on the situation before diving in and making a decision right away. he's always been good at presenting different points of view and getting me to see things from different angles.
  "
408408,"
   What drives you to succeed??
  ","
  i'm honestly not sure. i've always been self motivated because i felt as if i had no other option but to succeed. i'm terrified of failing at aspects of my life, so that in itself has been my motivation to step up and move forward.

  ","
  uh, probably gas station ""wine."" i didn't realize it wasn't actually wine until after i returned home and inspected the bottle more thoroughly. it's actually advertised as a ""wine product,"" which is deeply concerning and disgusting. it also tasted horrible.

  i would have lunch with chester bennington. he was a resounding influence on my life when i was a teenager, and i've always wanted to thank him for inspiring me, for motivating me, and for allowing me an outlet when i was going through really dark, difficult times. i'll forever be in his debt.
  "
408415,"
   Do you shower in the morning after you wake up before you go to bed?

  "
408416,"
   What makes you feel really uncomfortable?
  ","
  it makes me uncomfortable when i'm in a situation where i'm alone with someone and have no idea how to pass the time without making things awkward between us. i'm absolutely terrible at small talk, and i generally don't enjoy talking to new people to begin with, so when i'm in a position where i'm alone with my friend's friend (as an example), it makes me hella uncomfortable.
  "
408417,"

  to entertain myself, i usually listen to music, watch youtube videos, scroll through social media, read, write, play video games, or see if a friend is available to hang out.

   Would you date a guy if he didn't have a lot of money
  ","
  it would depend on the reason why he doesn't have money. if he doesn't have enough money because of unfortunate life circumstances, but he still puts the effort in to work extremely hard and take overtime to pay for his bills and generally be responsible, then i wouldn't hold it against him at all.
  
  however, if someone doesn't have money because they're irresponsible and spend it on useless things, then i have no desire to be associated with a person like that.

408443,"
   If a friend of mine (who has depression) doesn't answer my texts and doesn't even read my FB messages. Should I keep texting him from time to time or should I give him his space until he comes back?

  i can't really make this sort of call because i don't known you or your friend. but personally speaking, it feels good when someone checks in on me, even if i don't have the energy to respond. your friend might appreciate your messages even though he doesn't say anything. he might also think you don't care anymore if you stop responding.
  
  you might want to ask him if you're annoying him with your messages, just so that there's communication there. if he says that he's ignoring you purposely or doesn't want you to message him anymore, then so be it.

  the last episode was intense, and honestly the more i think about it, the more predictable it was. initially, i was a bit shocked but after speaking to a few people about the dynamics of some particular characters and their respective personalities, it made more and more sense. overall, everyone who survived ended up getting the ending they wanted or deserved.

   in society men are being ridiculed for showing feelings such as crying and being sensitive, does that have to do with toxic masculinity?
  ","
  yes, that's entirely due to toxic masculinity. men are ""supposed"" to exhibit masculine traits, which over the years has conditioned men into thinking that they have to be these stoic, stone cold figures with no emotions whatsoever. it's extremely damaging to men, and its one of the reasons why there's such an alarming rate of men who have mental health problems not getting professional help. it's still seen as ""weak"" in society.

  "
408504,"
   would you delete any social media account you have to try to salvage your relationship?

  no, i wouldn't. not because social media is overly meaningful to me or anything, but because a healthy relationship wouldn't force you to have to choose between them and something else in your life like that. that's extremely controlling behavior.

  there's really no such thing as a number of genders, in my opinion. just like there isn't a number of sexual orientations -- both gender and sexuality exist somewhat in a spectrum, and we've just developed labels for things as they come.
  
  i think students should overall have an overview of what gender identity is, what's the difference between cisgender and transgender, and how gender identity does and does not correlate with gender roles or expectations.
  "
408520,"
   What advice do you have for those who may be struggling with their own sexual identity?
  ","
  sexual identity ?? like, you mean their sexual orientation ??
  
  you're not any less or different of a person if you're gay, and if you're having a hard time coming to terms with your sexuality, then try to talk to trusted friends or family members about yourself and gain their support, if possible. everything is better with a support system, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with being gay. there's so much more acceptance now than there was in the past, and hopefully we can continue down this road until there's universal understanding of sexual orientation.
  "
408521,"

408522,"

  ","
  a lot of people are quick to reject notions that don't fit into their established square of beliefs and understandings. they weren't taught about trans people as children, for example, so therefore trans people's existences aren't valid or are seen as a phase. many people don't like their beliefs challenged because it makes them question themselves.

   Is this a relatively new concept/idea or has this theory been around for a long time regarding there being more than two genders?

  it's existed for centuries in many other cultures. it's just been rejected by mainstream society due to a lack of education (i'm talking about in the united states, i'm not sure about other countries). there have always been trans and non-binary people, but their existence has been oppressed and not accepted much like how gay people have been oppressed and not accepted over the decades and centuries.

  "
408526,"
   Why have we all been taught that there are only two genders? Make and female.
  ","
  male and female are sexes, not genders. the reason why we were taught about sex and not gender is because trans people in general have *always* been ostracized and discriminated against in society, and its only been within the past few years that people have become more open about gender and gender education.
  
  it's the same reason why when we were growing up, we weren't taught about being lgbtq+ either. sex education was barely being taught as it is, and that education was only restricted to heterosexual sex. we weren't taught about sexual orientation either.

  regardless of a person's gender, i would advise people struggling with mental illness to not be afraid to seek out help if they're concerned for their own well being. if they cannot afford professional treatment, there are also hotlines, text lines, and maybe even friends and/or family who will be willing to sit down and listen until you can find a way to be treated by a professional. there's no shame in needing help.

  i sought help for my mental illnesses when i was around 25 years old. i have been dealing with depression, anxiety, and s*icidal thoughts since i was a pre-teen, but my thoughts of harming myself & those around me were getting progressively stronger as i got older. at one point, my depression was so severe that i didn't go to work for a week, and i needed a doctor's referral to a psychiatrist so that i didn't get fired from my job. that's ultimately when i decided to seek treatment.
  "

  yeah, i notice that a lot too. i wonder if it's due to a lack of education, although even in primary school students are taught about all of the different asian countries, not *just* japan, korea, and china. but a lot of people have the misconception that other types of asian people don't exist, simply because they're not fetishized as strongly as light-skinned asians. any race that's dark-skinned is stigmatized severely in our society.

  ","
  ugh, that's horrible. i'm sorry you have to go through that. as for *why* people of your race are fetishized/objectified, i'm honestly not too sure. i just think it's ridiculous how in a s*xual context, asians are wanted, but in literally any other context, they're discriminated against.
  "
408556,"
   This is just an observation, but I realise that Asians are quite fetishised in western countries or am i wrong?
  ","
  no, you're definitely right. even if you look at the p*rn/s*x industry, there's a high demand for asian clients and videos of asian actresses.
  "
408557,"
   Reason I'm asking this is because I have seen a lot of people saying it's their *choice*if they only want to date whites (basically their own colour), and saying they don't want to date blacks or Asian because they are just not their type. And say people are too sensitive if we say they are racist
  ","
  people like that have to really look inside themselves and figure out why they even have that prejudice against other races to begin with. realistically, someone's race does not define them and humans are much more complex than their race. so for a white person to say that their ""type"" is solely other white people comes from a racist history, likely because they were raised in an intolerant household and society.
  "
408558,"
   I don't live in the US but why do some doctors accept your insurance but not the others? I mean are they like ""this insurance doesn't mean my requirements so I'm not going to accept it""? It's really different from where I am from.
  ","
  i don't know the criteria behind it, but you're essentially right. most doctors don't take all insurances, they only accept certain insurance companies (probably because they have longstanding business with some companies and not others). it's capitalism at its finest.
  
  therefore, even if you really want to see a certain doctor because they're knowledgeable and compassionate, it won't matter because if they don't take your insurance, you'll have to pay out-of-pocket for those visits, which is something not many people can actually afford.
  "
408559,"
   Do you personally think it is racism if someone, doesn't prefer to date outside their race because of the vast difference in culture and all sorts of things. Say, a Caucasian not wanting to date an Asian or vice versa?
  ","
  that seems a little racist to me, yeah. you're essentially rejecting the idea of being assimilated into another culture before you're even given the opportunity to do so, and there's also nothing wrong with dating someone with a different culture from you. it's actually a wonderful learning experience.
  
  if it isn't racism, then it's definitely intolerant and close-minded. you're essentially judging someone based on their race without getting to know them first, especially when you consider that not everyone is in tune with their heritage to begin with.
  "
408560,"
   Yeah honestly healthcare is so expensive. A first appointment with a psychiatrist here without subsidies is about $500 or more.

  i can imagine it's the same in new york if you're not covered with insurance. thankfully, i just pay my co-pay at each appointment so i'm thankful that i found a facility that takes my insurance and doesn't have an extremely long wait list.
  
  although, i'm changing psychiatrists and i have the number for a new doctor, i just haven't called her yet to see if she takes my insurance and how long of a wait it will be to get an appointment with her.
  "
408561,"
   Is a psychiatrist and psychologist in NY very expensive?
  ","
  it depends on a lot of factors, such as what your insurance company decides to cover, what the psychiatrist/psychologist charges for their services, whether or not the provider even takes your insurance in the first place, etc etc. for some people, it can be expensive. but for others, it may be the same amount of money compared to seeing a general practitioner.
  
  i can't even fathom how much money a psychiatrist or psychologist would be without insurance, honestly. i've always been covered (except for three months last year where i wasn't, but i didn't see my doctors during those three months). medication alone is expensive, so seeing the provider would likely be much more money.

   Hello Leigh. I have a best friend and we can go quite a long time without texting or talking to each other. However I did check up on her many times and I feel as if she doesn’t care enough to check up on me although she says she loves me. Should I talk to her about it or am I just clingy?
  ","
  this is a difficult situation to be in, and i totally empathize with you because i've been in the same boat many times before. i'm a clingy person myself and i take things really personally if i check up on someone, but they don't make the effort to check up on me.
  
  i think it depends on the person, though. she may not feel the need to check up on you, knowing that you're fine and that you two do talk occasionally. that may be her method of checking up on you. but if it still does concern you, perhaps for your own peace of mind you should try talking to her about it in a respectful manner.
  "
408622,"
   How long can you go without texting or talking to your boyfriend?
  ","
  i need to hear from him every day, otherwise i assume he's angry with me. even though he realistically isn't and has no reason to be, i'm terrified of him getting angry with me and abandoning me (#justBPDthings).

   This is just an example, but I would like to know what you would do. What if your boyfriend told you he got drunk and “accidentally” cheated on you, would you still deem it as cheating or do you forgive him since it was an accident as he was drunk?
  ","
  you don't ""accidentally"" cheat on someone, in my personal opinion. when you're drunk, you still have a concept of right versus wrong and it's not as if you forget that you have a partner temporarily.
  
  if my boyfriend told that to me, then i would still consider it to be cheating. being drunk is not an excuse.
  "

   What’s an unpopular opinion you have? I have one, Taylor Swift’s music isn’t very good. She’s really regressed since her country days.

  unpopular opinion ; mainstream pop music isn't automatically ""bad"" music. over the past year or so, i realized i liked a lot of top 40 pop songs and now i've totally embraced it. there's nothing wrong with liking certain types of music.
  "
408626,"
   Wow you are so strong to be honest. I doubt I could have taken someone who cheated on me back. After you got back with him, how long did it take to *fully* trust him again? Also how did he show you that he was worth trusting again?
  ","
  if he cheated on me *now* then i probably wouldn't take him back, considering how long we've been together and the nature of our relationship.
  
  i don't really remember how long it took for me to trust him again, but i'm thankful that he was understanding that i didn't trust him for a while since he knew what he did was wrong. to show me that he was worth trusting again, he became very open about his feelings and showed me respect with my own feelings and concerns about him cheating again. he didn't get angry or defensive at all.
  "
408627,"
   Do you think someone is not smart if they don’t read books or the news?

  no. there are different forms of intelligence, and remaining abreast of current events or reading books doesn't really define someone's intelligence at all. it's only one facet of what intelligence is.
  "
408628,"
   How did you get over it to be honest? Does thinking about it still make you angry?
  ","
  honestly, at the time it was the least of our problems. without going into much detail about what we were going through, we were both struggling with serious things and so the idea of he sleeping with someone else was a bit meaningless compared to the grand scheme of things.

  the most dangerous thing i've ever done was drive while drunk. it was absolutely horrible and reckless, and since that happened, i haven't driven myself to the bar at all. if i go out, i normally ask a friend to pick me up or get an uber.
  "
408634,"
   How much do you care about what other people think of you?
  ","
  the only opinions i care about are those of my boyfriend and close friends. when you get older, you realize that the opinions of acquaintances and strangers are utterly meaningless to your life because they simply don't know you, and you shouldn't focus your energy on people who do not matter to your life.
  "
408635,"
   I’m really glad to hear that. Also another question, does someone’s sexuality “change”? I mean people always talk about how this person always dates girls but in the end he was gay, and then they said he “turned” gay. I mean how does someone even “turn” gay?
  ","
  that's a common misconception among the lgbtq+ community, unfortunately. i believe that being gay is an inherent part of someone, and no one ""turns"" gay or anything. it's just them going through life, having new experiences, and realizing their true nature.
  
  him dating girls was an experimental phase and probably the catalyst for him realizing he didn't like women. sometimes people need to experiment with their sexuality before coming to terms with whether they're gay, bi, or straight.
  "
408636,"
   What was the last gift you gave someone? What was the last gift you recieved?
  ","
  i don't remember the last actual gift i gave someone besides buying my mother flowers for mother's day, if that counts for anything.
  
  the last ""gift"" i received was an egg sandwich last week, lol. me and my coworker were both going through difficult times one night for different reasons, so another coworker surprised us with egg sandwiches the following morning. it was a really nice gesture.
  "
408637,"
   Are you a morning person or night owl?
  ","
  i used to be a night owl, but i've slowly transitioned into becoming a morning person due to my work schedule and routine. i cannot sleep in past 9am these days, and honestly i do enjoy my quiet mornings because i'm able to relax without having to interact with anyone for a few hours.
  "
408638,"
   I’m glad to hear that to be honest. I used to thought maybe I was bisexual since I found some girls quite beautiful and I was questioning my sexuality. Even told my best friends about it. But later I realised I actually didn’t like them in that way. I’m just scared that it’s offensive to real bi ppl
  ","
  no, it isn't offensive at all. it's really common and expected for people to question their sexuality. it also isn't anyone else's business what you identify as, because that's something personal to you and only affects you really.
  "
408639,"
   Do you shy away from discussing difficult topics with strangers, such as politics and religion. Why / Why not?
  ","
  the only times i talk about controversial or difficult topics with strangers or acquaintances is online, usually on here, twitter, or facebook. i don't really interact with strangers otherwise.
  "
408640,"
   If you could change anything about your past, what would it be?
  ","
  i would change the ab*se i went through, so that i wasn't ab*sed at all. it was the cause of nearly all of my mental illnesses and still affects me today.
  "
408641,"
   Is their an appropriate way to tell someone that their breath stinks?
  ","
  yeah, although i think you need to be close with that person first so that they won't get offended if you mention it, lol.
  "
408642,"
   Is it possible for someone to be bi curious but turns out they learned they were straight after all?
  ","
  yes, that's actually fairly common !! it's normal for people to question their sexual orientation and then come to an understanding of themselves. i used to think i was gay when i was in high school because all i liked were women, until i met my boyfriend and realized i found him attractive too.
  "
408643,"
   Have you ever got a bone broken? Did you learn something about yourself? Did you learn a lesson about that situation?
  ","
  i've actually never broken a bone before.
  "
408644,"
   I remember you used to identify as pansexual? What made you realise you didn’t identify with pansexuality and instead identified with bisexuality?

  I realized i liked more than two genders, but not all genders or regardless of gender. bisexual just fits me more and its what i used to identify with in the past.
  "

  it was just the keyboard, not the tower. unless you mean my laptop, in that case it wasn't soaked or anything. it just got on the keys.
  "
408646,"
   Is there someone that when you first them you didn’t like them but now you’re really close with?
  ","
  one of my coworkers, LOL. i honestly thought she was a b*tch when i first met her because she's one of those loud, opinionated people. however, after i got to know her, i realized she was extremely passionate about her beliefs and is very empathetic towards other people and animals. we've become quite close over the past year.
  "
408647,"
   What will there always be a need for?
  ","
  the trades, i.e. auto repair, HVAC, construction, etc etc. that's why it's usually more productive to go to a trade school as opposed to a traditional college, because there will always be a demand for those services.
  "
408648,"
   Do you think first cousin marriages should be illegal?
  ","
  it is already illegal in some states, but legal in other states. apparently, first cousin marriages are legal in new york (which i previously didn't know about). even so, the prevalence of such an event occurring is rare.
  
  i don't support the concept, though. it's basically inc*st and can complicate genetics and cause unnecessary health problems if they decide to have a child together.
  "
408649,"
   What would you suggest everyone to try?
  ","
  this may sound silly, but going to bed early and waking up early in the morning, even if you don't necessarily have anything to do. i always feel much better when i get good sleep and wake up around 8/8:30am, because then i feel as if my day is productive and not wasted.
  "
408650,"
   How would you like to change the world?
  ","
  i don't believe that me, as an individual, can change the world. however, i do know that i can change some people's lives through my advocacy of mental health & illness awareness, as well as through my writing. overall, i want people to realize that there isn't anything wrong with having mental illness, that there will always be help available to them, and that they're not alone.
  "
408651,"
   This inspired my s*x question. Everyone keeps saying condoms/birth control but do you feel like there's a deeper meaning/understanding than just those ways?
  ","
  yes, safe s*x also includes consent between everyone involved in the interaction and making sure consent remains through to the very end. if someone, at any point in time, says no or even appears uncomfortable, then everything should stop because then that isn't consent anymore. people are allowed to retract consent at any point in time.
  "
408652,"
   Do you respond to rude or vitriolic messages on ask? Why / Why not?
  ","
  not usually, no. if i receive a rude or harsh message from someone, then i normally just delete it. there's no point in responding to such inquiries, especially if you know what they're trying to say isn't true.
  "
408653,"
   Music: Do you like singles or full albums more?
  ","
  it depends on what type of music it is !! i usually listen to singles when it comes to vocal music, but i listen to albums when it comes to instrumental music. lately, i've been listening to all of the game of thrones soundtracks on spotify.
  "
408654,"
   Do you tend to collect things or do regularly review and get rid of them?

  i regularly go through my things and get rid of them accordingly, especially when it comes to clothing. every season, i try to sort through my clothes and donate clothing that i either don't like anymore or doesn't fit me.
  "
408655,"
   What is your biggest pet peeve?

   Is a life that focuses on avoiding pain and seeking out pleasure a good and worthwhile life? Why or why not?
  ","
  i believe it's an ignorant life. it's impossible to avoid pain, but if you actively ignore it and don't try to learn from it or overcome it, and instead drown your pain with hedonistic pleasures, it can be extremely hurtful towards yourself and the people around you.
  "

   How do you best deal with heartbreak?

  ideally, the best way to deal with heartbreak is through talking with your friends and/or family about the ordeal, using methods of self care, and encouraging yourself that you're a strong individual and you can get through it.
  
  personally, i dealt with heartbreak through unhealthy coping mechanisms and constantly skipping from one person to the next in terms of who i was infatuated with, haha.

   Should people be required to pass a drug test in order to collect food stamps?
  ","
  no, i don't believe that people should be required to pass a drug test to collect food stamps. first, you obviously cannot spend your food stamps on drugs because it's only used for food and other goods (which is pre-determined), and you only get a particular amount of money per month.
  
  second, denying someone food stamps if they're a user or an addict is essentially denying a person their basic need to eat, as well as their children's needs to eat. it's doing more harm than good, and there should not be laws preventing people from consuming something necessary for their survival.
  
  third, it's somewhat classist (and ableist) to suggest a restriction on food stamps based on whether or not a person uses drugs. drug use is more prevalent in populations of lower class or lower financial stability, which is where food stamps are also more prevalent. in addition, these people normally don't have the resources to get treatment and recovery, which further complicates the situation. people who are users or addicts shouldn't be stigmatized and prevented from a basic need.
  "
408715,"
   Do you agree with legally assisted suicide?

  yes, i do know someone like this actually. it's terrible because as much as you do want to feel bad for them and try to help them, they make it awfully difficult because they feed off of the attention & sympathy. they exaggerate their symptoms to get a response from those around them as well.
  
  it's really a slap to the face to people who struggle with disabilities and don't use their disability as an excuse for bad behavior. it portrays a terrible image of disabled people, because most disabled people act the complete opposite and wish they weren't disabled, and they usually try their hardest to live life as normal as possible.

  yes, i'm very sentimental. i cherish things that people have made for me in particular, and i find it hard to give or throw away gifts people have gotten for me.

408793,"
   How would you respond if you were in a relationship with a partner who wanted you to deactivate all your social media?

What do you mean with non-binary?

Sorry , English isn't my first language

  i don't really blame those women tbh, especially if they have continual bad experiences with men as time goes on. obviously there will always be men who are genuine and good people, but a large number of men are sexist people who feel entitled to women. the culture surrounding men and hypermasculinity doesn't help either.

   When you listen to music. what is it that captures your attention the most? Is it the beat? Is it the lyrics? Is it the voice of the artist themselves?
  ","
  for me personally, it's all three -- the instruments, the lyrics, and the vocals. with some artists/songs, one is more pronounced over the other, but generally it's a blending of those three factors that make a song great to me.
  
  as an example of some artists where one is emphasized over the other, i listen to artists like watsky and grandson mainly for their lyrics, but i also like two feet's instrumentals (because the lyrics don't really mean much at all). i value the vocal range of bands like stone temple pilots, alice in chains, and soundgarden, but these three are also bands that also have beautiful lyrics and instrumentals.
  "
408847,"
   Do you have more male friends, or female friends?
  ","
  i believe i have more friends who are women, but i also have a small handful of friends who are men (keep in mind these numbers are small, though). i can name two men off the top of my head whom i would be able to talk to about anything, as well as perhaps three women.
  "
408848,"
   Is it better to have loved and lost or to never have loved at all?
  ","
  i believe it's better to have loved and lost, as opposed to have never loved at all. although the experience is painful, it's all-around better to have had that experience in the first place so that you're more aware of what to look out for in your next relationship or romantic venture. by not allowing yourself to love at all, you're doing yourself a disservice.

   My best friend has completely changed into someone whom I don't know. Do you think I should leave him?
  ","
  i don't know the nature of your friendship, how long you've been friends, etc etc. that's something you can only decide for yourself, depending on the types of changes he has made and what was the reason behind those changes.
  
  although, i will say this -- generally, people change as a result of outside influences on them, and if he has changed into someone you don't recognize anymore, it may be an indication that there's something personal going on in his life that he doesn't want to speak about. people don't change for no reason at all, and it's very possible that he's just trying to adjust to a dramatic change in his life.
  "
408858,"
   what should I do if my family is putting a lot of pressure on me in order to get married to someone whom I don't love?
  ","
  you have to speak up against your family and tell them exactly how you feel. i know it's a lot easier said than done, but if you don't love someone, then marrying them would be a terrible idea -- you both would likely be miserable in the marriage, and you both deserve much better.

  it's unbelievable in terms of my own personal achievements because i was struggling with mental health problems at the time and contemplated dropping out in light of those struggles, in addition to some personal things going on in my life.
  
  i know that so many students graduate with perfect 4.0 GPAs, with summa cum laude honors, etc etc. however, i genuinely didn't believe i had that potential within me. it's something i've always been proud of.

  after searching on google for some scientific discoveries in 2019, i came upon a study that suggested noninvasive electrical stimulation could improve short term memory function in those with pronounced memory loss, such as in the case of dementia. the researchers reported that a study group of 60- to 76-year-olds performed better in a series of working memory tasks after a half an hour of treatment.
  "
408866,"
   In fact, I can say I am addicted to coffee. The only problem is that I constantly get headache for no obvious reason. Any advice?
  ","
  i'm not sure if the headaches are correlated with your coffee intake, but it could be a possibility. there are many factors to take into account -- are you dehydrated? are you getting enough vitamins in your diet? are you exercising? etc etc.
  
  i get headaches sometimes, and migraines every so often, but they're normally hormonal for me or a result of a lack of water intake. i usually just pop two advil and call it a day.
  "
408867,"
   Have you ever done a severe damage to someone? and what did you do?
  ","
  i've never physically hurt someone before, but i'm sure i've hurt people emotionally in the past without intending to. i've also done a lot of questionable (morally, at least) things that were a negative influence on those around me, and i'm sure they had to deal with the consequences of those actions.

  "
408869,"
   Do you think that people who are complacent about their lives should stop doing efforts? why or why not?
  ","
  no, i don't believe so. even if you're happy with where you are and your achievements, that doesn't mean that you should stop putting effort into your life -- by ceasing effort, you're allowing yourself to fall into a dull routine, and eventually, you won't be satisfied with yourself anymore.
  "
408870,"
   Do you agree that everyone one has the right to addict drugs? And what are the upsides and downsides of such issue?
  ","
  generally speaking, everyone has the freedom to ab*se drugs (because let's face it, even though they're illegal people still have many ways to get them). however, drug addiction is a mental health/health care issue -- first and foremost. being addicted to anything is detrimental to your health and well being, and everyone who's an addict deserves proper treatment and support.

408876,"
   What do you do on the nights when you can't sleep?
  ","
  thankfully this hasn't happened to me in a while -- i'm usually good at falling asleep when i actually go to bed, probably because i'm always in a chronic state of exhaustion.
  
  however, when i really cannot sleep, i honestly just scroll through my phone or try to listen to calm music to ease me.
  "

  ","
  unfortunately, you cannot force someone to change their behavior. in order for someone to change, they have to be self aware and realize what they're doing is wrong and then also put the effort into changing themselves.
  
  what you and her are experiencing is normal, though. teenagers usually change once they reach those years because they either want to impress their friends or fit into the crowd or act out against their parents. when she gets older, she'll grow out of it.

  ","
  mumble rap, LOL. it's become more prominent and originated with soundcloud rappers, i believe, but i never understood the appeal behind it because honestly, it's just bad music in my eyes. especially when their voices are autotuned.

408904,"
   Have you ever felt hated by others/someone before? If yes, when was it? and why?
  ","
  yes, i have an irrational fear of people secretly hating me and that they're only friends with me out of pity or guilt, or that they backstab me and talk sh*t about me behind my back. i feel hated by some of my closest friends at times, which makes me push them away and talk to them less because i don't want to give them an excuse to leave.

   Thank you so much for your kind words. It really means so much to me, because no one understand me this much. Well as for therapy I am on the wait list since it's quite high demand I guess? It's on late August and I hope it goes well. But I also feel a lot of regret as for the past two years
  ","
  (cont) I haven't been doing much except being depressed and anxious and I spent a lot of time at home so it feels like I wasted a lot of time and I can't get it back. It also feels like nothing excites me anymore and whenever someone asks me my hobbies it gets a bit awkward because I have none haha.
  
  --
  
  i know this feeling all too well, unfortunately. when you struggle with depression and/or anxiety, or other mental illnesses, it sorta takes over your entire life because it becomes so detrimental to your well being and how you perceive everything around you.
  
  try not to fret about it too much, even though obviously that's easier said than done. you're not wasting your life, and you have so much time ahead of you still to do the things you want to do. it takes baby steps, which you're doing because you're on the wait list for therapy and in the process of seeing a psychiatrist. things *will* get better.

  it depends really. someone's writing style could be great in terms of their phrasing, but if their punctuation is in the wrong place, then it could sound awkward and not give off its intended meaning. that's where editors come into play, lol.
  
  to better your writing, in terms of punctuation and grammar at least, it's best to read some how-to books, i.e. strunk and white's elements of style or zen in the art of writing by ray bradbury (those are two of the books i read in college).

   (15) I’m sorry for rambling and such a long rant but I honestly don’t know how to feel or do. I’m sorry if my story was all over the place I hope you understand. Would really like your insight since I know you struggled with mental health back in school and completed school...
  ","
  no need to apologize for the messages !! i'm glad you gave me such deep insight into your history, so that i can give you an informed opinion.
  
  first off -- i hope you understand that what your mother has done to you is very wrong, and it's perfectly normal for that to have affected you negatively and even contributed to your depression. comparing yourself to classmates and other people in your culture will only hurt you, as you well know, and it truly doesn't matter what other people have gone through -- for all you know, they could be struggling just as badly. people don't outwardly show their struggles most of the time.
  
  you're not weak, unaccomplished, or a bad person for not being able to finish school. and honestly, perhaps you should try to apply for a different nursing program other than the one that rejected you, a different university maybe. if it's something you truly want to do, you should try to pursue it with all of your energy. and even if you get rejected, at least you'll have the comfort in knowing that you tried.
  
  as for your medication, there will be trials and errors. a lot of them. it took me two years to find the right cocktail of meds, and now i'm much more stable than i've ever been. please don't give up, i know it's going to be rough but it's so worth it. also, have you considered therapy?
  
  i truly hope you're able to find some hope and happiness within yourself. you seem like a hard working, compassionate person and you deserve the best.

  "
408920,"
   Why is depression so stigmatized in society?
  ","
  depression (and other mental illnesses, such as anxiety, personality disorders, dissociative disorders, psychosis, etc etc.) is stigmatized so much in society because mental health is not taken as seriously as physical health.
  
  there are still a lot of people who believe that disorders like depression or anxiety is simply a ""state of mind,"" that someone can ""snap out of it"" or that it's a choice. obviously that isn't true. in order to decrease the stigma associated with mental illnesses, we need to continue discussing them and raise awareness of methods of healthy coping, treatment, and understanding.
  "
408921,"
   Is happiness a state of mind or we need to act in order to achieve it?

  i believe it's both. while happiness is ultimately a state of mind influenced by brain chemicals and neurons, we also need to put the effort in to ensure that we attain happiness in our lives, even if that happiness comes from little things.

   What is one thing that you would never do no matter what?

  i would never treat a retail or food service worker poorly. coming from my experiences as a cashier and pharmacy technician, there are so many customers who feel so entitled to your services that they spend most of their time disrespecting retail workers. they treat them as less than human and believe that they only exist to serve them, which is wrong.
  
  when i go to the store or a restaurant, i treat each worker with the utmost respect and patience. i understand how difficult the jobs can be at times.

408928,"
   Do you believe that a person can truly change, or are you a firm believer that a leopard never changes their spots... And a person who has done wrong before will only do wrong again?

  i wholeheartedly believe that most people have the capability to change and adapt. being raised in a close-minded and oppressive environment doesn't mean you can't unlearn the behaviors that you were taught, especially if you take the time to educate yourself on topics such as mental and physical disabilities, racism, sexism, the lgbt+ community, etc etc.
  
  of course, there will always be some people who cannot change, especially if they don't *want* to change.

  yes, i do believe that it's just as painful losing a friend compared to losing someone you're attached to romantically. if you've bonded with a friend so deeply that they become as important to you as a partner, then losing them will put a hole in your heart just as much as losing a partner would.

  i believe it's good that major companies like gillette and chick-fil-a are open about their political stances. it shows the public their true endorsements and beliefs so that we can decide whether or not to support the company.
  
  i'm strictly against companies like chick-fil-a because of their oppressive and conservative views against the lgbt+ community, which is why i would never endorse them with my money. however, gillette is rapidly becoming one of my favorite companies because of how inclusive they are.

  it's true, though -- a lot of people like to shove deep meanings into situations to try to justify them, but the truth is that there *are* no hidden meanings or ulterior motives behind events, especially saddening or tragic events. things happen because life is ultimately unfair, and instead of trying to focus on why they happened, we should focus on accepting that they happened, coping with the consequences, and moving on.

  ","
  yes, that is indeed true. the longer you prolong getting treatment, the worse your mental illness will become. it may come and go in waves, much like a lot of other chronic illnesses, but symptoms do steadily get worse over time if you don't do anything to treat the illness.

   Can losing a friend be just as painful as going theough a breakup?

  yes, absolutely. you connect with your friends on deep levels, and you do develop an attachment to that friendship. to lose a friend could sometimes be worse than a romantic breakup, depending on the type of friendship it is or how long you've been friends.

  technically it's legal because your sister is a consenting adult, but that large of an age gap does concern me. normally men that age go after younger girls because they're vulnerable and easier to control. i would be concerned that the man has a nefarious motive behind dating your sister, and it also makes me wonder why he can't date people his own age.

  yeah, haha. i wake up in the morning before anyone else in my house is awake, so it's nerve wracking to try to do things quietly because then *everything* sounds amplified. i like making a glass of cold water with ice in the morning before i have a cup of coffee, and the sound of the ice dispenser is too jarring.

  ","
  i poured my heart out to my boyfriend last week while we were having a serious discussion around the campfire. it's something i try to do regularly, otherwise my emotions and thoughts get bottled up inside of me and it becomes toxic to my own well being.
  
  i believe it's more difficult for people to reveal their feelings these days because they often don't want to burden their loved ones with their negativity, even though that only increases those negative feelings in the long run. everyone is always so busy and preoccupied with their own dilemmas that we feel guilty if we put our stresses on someone else, even if just to talk it out.

  i would likely answer the question the same way because this is one of those situations that i cannot look at objectively. i can merely answer these questions based on what i already know, and quite frankly, i don't really care enough about the question to investigate further.
  "
409138,"
   To a degree, maybe, but it's actually possible to have an opinion and be objective at the same time. One strategy for this is not to make assumptions about information you weren't given or don't have.

  i agree with you. that's why i was basing my opinion on my own experiences. i obviously don't have statistics in front of me, i'm basing my thoughts on what i've experienced firsthand and also what i've seen on other websites (i.e. twitter).

  "
409140,"
   You may not have seen it, but it's actually hugely common...and I think I already pointed out that the questions aren't generally rude or disrespectful. Again the question is why a girl would react badly (and rudely) when people comment appreciatively on what she clearly has on display.
  ","
  you didn't point that out -- i personally believe that comments on a person's body are rude and disrespectful, especially if they're geared toward someone breasts or any other private area, regardless of the reason behind them posting the photo.
  
  i find it hard to believe that a person can oogle at someone's breasts and then make an ""appreciative"" comment without it coming off as gross.
  "
409141,"
   Well that was the question I asked you in the first place. This is literally the most common situation: a girl who's posted a picture where the sole focus is on her breasts, and gets mad when people say things like ""wow those are nice"". Why would she post that and get mad at comments?
  ","
  i've never seen that situation before. i think you misunderstood me when i mentioned a picture whose sole focus is on their breasts -- i was talking about lewd, NSFW photos. in those cases, i've never seen someone get angry over a person making a comment on their body. i'm sure it happens occasionally, but it isn't as common as you're making it out to be.
  
  any other photo that's SFW and just an average selfie, you can't assume that their intention is to show off their breasts. and again, regardless of that person's reasoning, making inappropriate comments on someone else's body is rude and disrespectful.
  "
409142,"
   Have your ever worn a loincloth or toga?
  ","
  uh, no ?? lmaoo.
  "
409143,"
   What if they're literally posting a picture where the sole focus is on their breasts?
  ","
  if someone posts a lewd photo like that, then most of them time they don't care about comments regarding their bodies (at least in my experience).
  "
409144,"
   What if the comments aren't rude but appreciative?
  ","
  some people are uncomfortable with *any* comments on their body, so unless you know that person on a deeper level, you're better off not saying anything at all to them.
  "
409145,"
   some of em get mad even if we look for a second so why even showing off? do they expect us to cover our eyes or turn away whenever one crosses paths with us? i know staring for too long is inappropriate but if theyre right there we cant avoid quick glances
  ","
  a person can flaunt their body however they wish, but i agree with you that something like ""quick glances"" isn't really a big deal. the original question was regarding physical comments on someone's appearance, though.
  "
409146,"
   Have you ever worn jorts?
  ","
  you mean jean shorts ?? yeah, all of my shorts are of denim material.
  "
409147,"
   What if the person doesn't have big breasts that she cannot hide?
  ","
  then evidently they're not posting a picture ""with their boobs out,"" not unless they're literally posting a picture where the sole focus is on their breasts.
  
  regardless of a person's reason for posting a picture of their body like that, it doesn't give others permission to make inappropriate comments on that person's body.
  "
409148,"
   if they have low cut cleavage how can they not fix that? i get that some ppl are too pushy or creepy but if a woman chooses to display her body she shouldn't get mad about one comment or look if thats all someone does without escalating
  ","
  perhaps they're proud of their bodies and like showing off a bit of cleavage -- that's something that makes them happy, and it isn't for other people to oogle. it's basic human decency.
  
  i honestly don't see why people cannot keep those types of comments to themselves. they're unnecessary, and surely those people know they're being inappropriate.
  "
409149,"
   What if it's obvious the person can both help and fix the situation?
  ","
  it generally isn't something obvious, most people with big breasts cannot hide their bodies and they shouldn't be expected to for the sake of other people either. like i said, it's rude and disrespectful. there's nothing stopping *you* from keeping your comments to yourself.
  "
409150,"
   Why do girls post selfies with their boobs out and get mad when people comment on boobs?
  ","
  because calling attention to something that a person cannot help or fix is rude and disrespectful. instead of making gross comments about a person's body, keep those thoughts to yourself.

  the stigma of mental health, especially revolving around the lgbtq+ community. even though there's slightly more awareness of mental health problems now when compared to the past, the stigma still affects teenagers whose concerns are often not addressed because mental health isn't taken seriously when it comes to young people.
  
  most adults attribute teenagers' mental health issues to hormones and claim that they'll ""grow out of it,"" but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't take their emotions and feelings seriously while they're already happening. it leads to further isolation and an exacerbation of symptoms when we don't acknowledge that something is a problem.

  you don't see much self-sufficiency these days -- we mainly rely upon other people for things like food, shelter, clothing, etc etc. we've become so used to the idea of capitalism and spending money on products and services that we rarely make things for ourselves anymore. that self-sufficient nature is lost.

  hello -- do you have a question ??
  "
409206,"
   What habit are you talking of?
  ","
  drinking alcohol. i've cut back severely, but for a while i was drinking every night in excess.
  "
409207,"
   wow sounds terrible im glad it got better
  ","
  thank you -- i am too. i still have strong urges and i've relapsed a few times, but overall i've broken free of the habit and i know all too well how much more terribly i would feel if i sank back into that again.
  "
409208,"
   what was it :(
  ","
  self-h*rming (i censored it because idk if askfm would delete that word). it got to the point where i was doing it because i was addicted to the feeling of it, even when i wasn't necessarily feeling bad in that current moment. it became such a strong habit and i couldn't see myself recovering.

   Today in Ireland, we're voting for who we want to join the European parliament on our behalf as Irish citizens. What policies/beliefs would someone need to have for you to vote for them?
  ","
  in order for me to vote for someone, they have to be protective of reproductive rights, as well as equal rights for the lgbtq+ community. they also have to believe in climate change and want to work towards fixing the climate and environment.
  "
409210,"

  i regret starting up a seven-year long addiction when i was 11 years old. it controlled my life up until the time i was around 18 years old.

  no, but i am overweight.

  i either wake up naturally or to my alarm. my alarm is set for 7:15am every morning, but sometimes i wake up before my alarm goes off.
  "
409213,"
   What are your prejudices?

  i assume that people dislike me right away before giving them a chance to get to know me, or even when they do know me & talk to me, i assume that they down-talk me behind my back and are only acquainted with me out of pity.

409215,"
   If you have to choose between two things, one is EASY and the other is RIGHT, which one do you choose?
  ","
  i would rather choose to do what's right as opposed to what's easy, especially if doing something easy means that it's the wrong thing to do. most things that are morally right are harder than taking the less moral route, but you end the day with a cleaner conscience.
  "
409216,"
   What do you prefer - to love or be loved?
  ","
  i would likely prefer to be loved, because it could be a source of encouragement and support depending on who it's coming from. simply loving someone is uncertain, because you could love someone who doesn't return the affection and end up feeling heartbroken.

   What legacy do you want people to remember about about you after you’re gone?
  ","
  i want people to remember me by my passion for giving a voice to those who struggle with mental illness by using my platforms to talk about stigma, misconceptions, and my own experiences. i want people to remember me by my writing and be comforted by the words i write, much like how i was comforted by the writing i read growing up.
  "
409220,"
   What’s the worst thing that’s happened so far in 2019?
  ","
  honestly, it was falling so deep into a habit that it became borderline addictive and was ruining my relationships with people, as well as my health. i've taken back control for the most part by now, but it's something that still plagues me every day.
  "
409221,"
   Who is your inspiration?
  ","
  my boyfriend and my best friend both inspire me in different ways, although their stories are quite similar. they're both strong-willed and strong-hearted people who have been through a lot of hardship, but they have also never allowed their struggles to define them or prevent them from chasing their goals. they're also both extremely passionate about things in their life, whether it's people or animals or their hobbies.
  "
409222,"
   How do you define happiness?
  ","
  a state of disillusion created by adequate levels of serotonin.
  "
409223,"

  much better than yesterday, thank you for asking. i woke up at 6am and my migraine was gone, so i was able to get through the day as i normally would.
  "
409224,"
   Which is more important to you: someone who has a similar sense of humor, or someone who has similar interests?
  ","
  this is a difficult question to answer, because they're equally important to me. it's hard to be with a person when you don't find humor in the same things, but it's also difficult (if not impossible) to be with someone who doesn't have the same interests as you either.
  "
409225,"
   What’s something you are passionate about?
  ","
  mental health advocacy. i try to raise awareness of mental health disorders and other problems as often as i can by talking about my own personal experiences, as well as misconceptions displayed through the media. ever since i started becoming more open about my own mental health, i've had people come up to me and tell me that i inspired them to either get help for their own issues or be more open about their issues themselves.
  "
409226,"
   What worries you the most?
  ","
  i'm constantly worried that my loved ones are going to get fed up with me and abandon me because of what an unstable mess i am most of the time. i try my best to make some sort of semblance of stability in my life, but i have a habit of spiraling out of control incredibly fast, and i often shut others out so that no one can witness me fall.
  "
409227,"
   Would you give any to chairty
  ","
  yeah, definitely. i would probably donate money to charities revolving around juvenile diabetes, mental health awareness, and environmental conservation.
  "
409228,"
   Why are you over weight?

  it's a combination of a sedentary lifestyle, my habit of drinking alcohol, and side effects of medication.

  "
409233,"
   In your opinion would it be easy to solve the issue of obesity in America?
  ","
  no, i don't believe it would be easy -- otherwise it would have been done already. there's such a culture of indulgence in the united states that obesity has become the new normal, and in order to combat against obesity rates, we have to challenge the very notion of that culture itself.

  i probably have at some point, but i honestly can't remember. most pictures i have aren't terribly important to me.
  "
409236,"
   Do you find praise or criticism to be more motivating?
  ","
  praise is more motivating to me, personally. i can handle constructive criticism, and i always strive to improve on myself and my work (especially in terms of my job), but it's nice to receive positive reinforcement every now and again because it reassures me that i'm doing well and that i can be trusted with the tasks handed to me.
  "
409237,"
   Do you think football/soccer  players earn too much money
  ","
  yeah, most athletes earn way too much money. they earn more money than people like police officers, firefighters, and other civic service jobs, which is wrong in my opinion.

   Do you like living in your country or would you like to move abroad? If abroad, then which country?

  i don't like the way my country is headed, but i also can't foresee myself moving to a completely different country either. if i had to move abroad, i would probably choose england or australia.

  "
409241,"
   I really like this sports jacket but its $100 is that worth it for a sports jacket
  ","
  you have to think about how often you may wear it, your current economic situation, and whether or not the pros outweigh the cons. if you're really breaking the bank to purchase this jacket and you don't think you'll wear it very often, then perhaps it isn't worth it.
  "
409242,"
   Is a man who is more touch with their feminine side unattractive
  ","
  i don't believe so, no. i actually think that it's an attractive quality to have -- there's so much stigma against men for being in touch with femininity or embracing parts of themselves that aren't masculine. you're not any less of a man for that, and the notion that men should *always* be rugged and emotionless is nonsense.
  "
409243,"

  "
409245,"
   Do you believe that going to college/university is really all that important? Do you think it's something that everyone should strive for?
  ","
  i believe it's important to some people, but not to others. it isn't a universal thing where *everyone* should go to college. some people simply are not cut out for standard academia, and that's perfectly okay. you shouldn't be expected to attend college if that isn't something that aligns with your skills.
  
  i believe that everyone has marketable skills, though, and sometimes traditional college isn't the way for people to improve on those skills. there are also things like trade schools, apprenticeships, etc etc.
  "
409246,"
   What event has greatly impacted your life?
  ","
  meeting my boyfriend greatly impacted my life for the better. he accepted me for who i was during a crucial point in my life, and he helped me get over an addiction & ultimately recover. i can't thank him enough for his influence.
  
  even today, he's a strong source of comfort, support, and encouragement for me. i wouldn't have accomplished as much as i have if it wasn't for him rooting me on and instilling in me a sense of confidence.
  "
409247,"
   Does a Bachelor's Degree mean anything in today's world?
  ","
  yes, it still means something at the very least. some places of employment like seeing that people graduated from college, so a bachelor's degree is still reputable. i believe that it isn't as meaningful as it used to be in the past, though. more and more jobs are looking for applicants with master's degree or above because they're more ""valuable.""

  "
409250,"
   What would you wish your parents knew about your current life so they could talk to you about it and maybe give you some advice?

  i don't desire to be given advice from my parents, so nothing. i'm content with what they know about my life already.
  "
409251,"
   What does it mean to feel empty inside?
  ","
  it's pretty self explanatory. you just feel hollow and void of emotion, like nothing excites you or even saddens you anymore. you simply exist.
  "
409252,"
   Are you good at saving money
  ","
  i am good at saving money, but that's because i have little money to save so i try to save whenever possible. if i was given something as large as 10 million dollars, i would probably spend a decent amount on a house, cars for people i know, a new wardrobe, etc etc.

  1,300 per month is the bare minimum, and i've only ever seen that maybe two times and they were questionable listings, lol. anything 1.3k or lower isn't a good place to be in, most reputable listings are at least 1.5k, unfortunately.

  it's difficult to make connections with people when everyone has a different concept of the type of connection they expect to have with someone else, if that makes sense. what each person wants will be different, so even though everyone wants an intimate connection with others, it's hard to find someone you're compatible with.

  he also has type 1 diabetes and has to be careful of his diet and activities, and his knowledge of his health problems is astounding because he knows more than his doctors at this point.

  lol, ""that dragon show."" funnily enough, i do know exactly what you mean by that.
  
  i don't believe the ending was silly, no. the ending was disappointing, in my personal opinion. it left viewers with more questions than answers, a lot of the plot turns didn't make sense compared to the rest of the series, and it was simply underwhelming. i sat there pretty emotionless throughout the entire episode, when beforehand i thought i would be rather emotional.

  ","
  i try to, but right now i'm more focused on my outer appearance and my health as opposed to my inner self, i.e. my mental health and stability.
  
  don't get me wrong -- both are equally as important, but because my mental health has been pretty stable these past few months, it has led me to focus more time on getting my priorities in order when it comes to my physical health.

  when someone treats someone else, particularly people in the food or drink service industry, in a nice and considerate manner -- that makes me have respect for others.

  i'm not sure if this would be considered a typical ""risk,"" but last week, i agreed to take on extra work in the form of training a new employee -- on top of all the other work i'm doing. at first, i was concerned that i was going to get anxious and overwhelmed with everything i had to juggle, but as the hours and days went by, i managed my time a lot better and was able to allocate an adequate amount of time to training the new employee while also finishing my own daily tasks.
  "
409385,"
   How can someone become reliable?
  ","
  becoming a reliable person isn't something you can follow steps to do. it takes a lot of hard work and self-realization, knowing that if you were once unreliable that you have to improve yourself and actively work on bettering yourself for the future. it's a conditioned behavior -- the more you do it and work towards it, the more it'll become second nature to you.
  "
409386,"
   In relationships (friendship or otherwise) do you avoid secretive people? Why?
  ","
  i understand why some people are secretive, because it usually means that they're simply a private person and don't feel comfortable sharing much about their life. i don't avoid people like that, because i know where they're coming from.
  
  however, it's difficult to really navigate a friendship or relationship when someone won't open up to you.

   If there was one song that described your life or connected with you on a personal level, what song would that be? What significance would it have to you?

  it sucks, because it makes me dissociate so badly, but i can't stop myself from thinking these things at times, especially late at night when i'm trying to go to sleep.
  "
409389,"
   What is something that you feel like should be discussed but hasn’t been? Why do you think this? Why do you think we don’t talk about it as much as we should?
  ","
  men who struggle with mental illness, i.e. depression, anxiety, personality disorders, psychosis, body dysmorphia, eating disorders, etc etc.
  
  there's so much of a stigma against men who have mental illnesses because it makes them seem ""weak,"" which leads to less men speaking out about their issues and further decreases the amount of men who seek treatment for their problems.

  "
409391,"
   Does one of your senses provide a more ""real"" experience for you, than the others, which and why? :)
  ","
  no, not particularly. on the contrary, it's more of a combination of those senses which provide a very ""real"" feeling to me. when i can see & hear something, or feel & taste something, or any combination or two or more senses, it's that much more grounding.
  "
409392,"
   What is the greatest challenge you have ever had to face?

  ","
  there is one thing i regret, although it's an internal battle for me to try to forgive myself of that mistake. i don't think about it most of the time, but at certain moments, it does really mess with me and i begin to wonder ""what if"" scenarios.

409394,"
   Be honest... Do you enjoy online drama? Or drama in general? Or do you avoid it all costs?
  ","
  honestly, i'm curious about drama when it doesn't involve me. LOL. but it's just curiosity, i don't feel any emotional connection to drama whatsoever unless it's something very serious that can't be considered ""drama"" anymore.
  
  i keep my online pages drama-free for the most part, but i do occasionally find myself in debates with people simply for voicing my opinion on things.

  "
409396,"
   are you happy with GoT ending
  ","
  eh, yes and no. i liked some of the outcomes of a few of the characters at the end, but at the same time, the writers of the episode did not answer all of the questions or tie up some of the loose ends. a few of the scenes honestly made no sense when comparing it to the rest of the series, and there were some inconsistencies as well.
  
  i was prepared to be emotional, but i was ultimately left emotionless and neutral. i was just watching it, not moved by any particular scene or emotion the characters were going through. it just sorta happened.
  
  however, i do have to say that the cinematics were beautiful.

  ","
  no, that isn't selfish at all. you shouldn't stay in any kind of relationship if you're unhappy. considering you're a parent, you should do what's best for yourself and your child. it's better to raise a child with two happy, separated parents as opposed to in a broken home.

409449,"

  i didn't say he *should* get a longer sentence -- just that they do. i don't agree with sentences not fitting the crimes, and hypothetically if a male and female committed the same crime, they should get the same sentence.

   You said you should be able to do whatever you want with your body. Its his body, are you saying he can't do whatever he wants with his body?
  ","
  he can do what he wants with his own body. not someone else's body. when you infringe on someone else's person without their consent, then that's a terrible thing to do. it doesn't even compare to getting an abortion. people have bodily autonomy, which means they have rights to what they can do with their *own* bodies.
  "
409451,"
   Yes, so women get priority over men.? Not the other way around
  ","
  it isn't really priority if the sentences fit the crime, tbh. if a male is more aggressive than a female, then logically he's going to get a longer and more severe sentence than a female.
  
  however, i do agree that there is a societal expectation placed on men to be aggressive as a whole -- to be more ""manly"" or ""masculine,"" and there's so much stigma attached to males showing ""feminine"" qualities.
  "
409452,"
   Okay, so I'm going to give you an example of someone doing something with their body. And I can almost guarantee you won't still think that way. A man takes his body and rxpes a woman with it. It's his body.. you said he would be able to do whatever he wants with it, without government inference

   Some are mad about straight Taron Egerton playing gay Elton John... Isn't the whole thing where people want shite like, ""gay has to play gay"", ""disabled has to play disabled"" actually a blinding insult to the person being portrayed?
  ","
  i don't believe it's insulting, no. there's a huge pool of actors and actresses who are lgbt+, disabled, trans, etc etc. the reason why a lot of people push for actors to have the same traits as the person they're acting is because there will be more representation in the media of those types of actors. there's really no reason why a gay actor shouldn't play a gay celebrity in a biopic, especially when the pool is so large.

   After years of being single I was hoping to hear your thoughts on something. 
I tend to push people away when I feel like I’m getting too close to someone.  
Do you think it ever gets easier to put your heart on the line and open yourself up to someone?  How would you handle a situation like this?
  ","
  i think it ultimately depends on who you're with. when i was single, i did the same thing -- i pushed people away, especially those who wanted to get close to me. however, when you do find someone that you feel you can share your feelings with, it does become easier to open up to them (at least, in my personal experience).
  
  like i said, i shut myself out from most people from an early age because i thought i was ""too much"" for them, and even though there were plenty of people who were interested in me, i nevertheless did not return their feelings and totally shut myself out from everyone. it wasn't until i met my current boyfriend that i felt i was able to open up to someone, because he first and foremost opened himself up to me. i felt as if it almost gave me needed ""permission"" to open up as well.
  
  long story short -- i believe you do have the capability of opening up to people, it just has to be the *right* person, and you won't know who that person is until you meet them or get to know them on a deeper level. i think it does get easier with time, especially as you get older and instill more confidence in yourself.

   What are your thoughts on the whole guy pays on first date scenario? Do you believe in it? Do you think we live in a time where this should no longer be a thing?
  ","
  i think it's a cute tradition, but it isn't really necessary in modern times anymore. first dates should be directed based on each person's preferences, i.e. if they both believe that a man should pay for the entire meal, then they should be allowed the freedom to do that. however, if they prefer the bill be split 50-50, then they should also be allowed to do that too.
  
  i believe my boyfriend paid for our first date because we were young and traditions were still strong, but these days, we normally switch back and forth on who pays the bill, i.e. he'll pay one day and i'll pay the following day, etc etc.

  i think it's something that's innately in a person, to be honest. there are some people who can be classified as ""evil"" who had a good upbringing, but their behavior turned out terrible anyway.
  
  while someone's environment could be attributed to the way someone conducts themselves later in life, i don't believe it is 100 percent their environment. there are thousands, if not millions, of people who endured similar hardships growing up, and they did not develop the social or behavioral traits that other people such as serial k*llers do. more often than not, people who are raised in ab*sive environments are more likely to hurt themselves than other people, which leads me to believe that ""evil"" behavior is something innate to them.

  eliminating that weakness would change me as a person for the better, so it's something i try to work towards on a regular basis. instead of jumping to conclusions, i try to stop myself and think rationally about the situation. i try to look at the situation from different angles or from someone else's perspective.

   What is truth? What’s the difference between facts and opinions?
  ","
  the truth is unbiased and supported by factual evidence, usually scientific evidence. you cannot deny facts and statistics, although there are a lot of people who like to claim that facts are wrong or catered toward a certain audience because it doesn't align with their personal beliefs.
  
  opinions are usually emotionally-oriented, and people have the tendency to base their opinions on their own emotions and feelings, even if they're irrational. sometimes they do parallel factual evidence, in that case the person has learned how to guide their opinions based on the evidence, but there are also plenty of people whose opinions are based on their own personal experiences and has nothing to do with facts at all.

   It seems that many people think birth control is the womans* responsibility. Do you think there should be more birth control options for men*? Also, do you believe people who want to be sterilised, should be able to do so regardless of if they have children, their age and/or marital status?
  ","
  yes, i believe birth control should also be available for men. it isn't fully the woman's responsibility to ensure that pregnancy does not happen if they don't want to be pregnant, and it's wrong in today's age to place that heavy of a responsibility solely on the woman. i read somewhere that vasectomies are actually reversible after a person of time, but of course -- men won't want their bodies being controlled like a woman's body is being controlled, so it's a toxic double standard.
  
  i also believe that people should have the option to be sterilized if they vehemently know that they do not want children. it isn't a matter of ""oh, they're going to change their mind,"" especially if it's something they've known from a very young age. there are so many standards a person has to meet in order to be sterilized, which is ridiculous in my opinion.

   James Charles controversy: Does waiting for a price reduction on James Charles’ x Morphe makeup palette mean you’re excusing his behaviour? Can you enjoy a product by someone who is claimed to have done terrible things? Discuss.
  ","
  i'm on the fence with this situation, because on the one hand, i believe that as long as you call out problematic behavior with a person, you can still enjoy their products. we all like problematic people at some point or another, it isn't something we can really avoid. however, as long as you're pointing out that the person's behavior is wrong, i don't necessarily see why you shouldn't be able to enjoy their products.
  
  on the other hand, however, it still doesn't sit right with me how you can disagree or vehemently be against someone's behavior while endorsing them by giving them money by buying their products. that's why i'm ultimately on the fence with this dilemma. for example, even though i enjoy kat von d's products, i probably won't buy any more of her products in the future because i believe that her opinions are wrong and harmful.

   Is it okay for adults to swear? If it’s not, why doesn’t it seem reprehensible anymore? Should it be reprehensible? If it’s okay, why shouldn’t minors be allowed to swear since it doesn’t seem harmful?
  ","
  i don't see any problem with adults swearing, unless you're in a work setting (such as a formal meeting). it's just a matter of expression and sometimes there are no stronger words to express how we feel than to use swear words. it shouldn't be seen as disgraceful or wrong.
  
  children, on the other hand, i believe should be taught not to swear until they're adults. even though i don't see swear words as a big deal, children should be taught to use language that expresses how they feel without swearing in order to advance their vocabulary. even so, i don't think it should be punishable or anything -- if a child does swear, just explain to them that those words as ""adult words"" and they can better express themselves using a plethora of different phrases.

  i found college to be a much better environment because the people who were there *wanted* to be there, and it was productive to the overall educational experience. people actually listened and asked questions and had discussions, whereas in high school that did not happen as often.

   If there were transparent trash cans would you use them?
  ","
  no, probably not. the reason why trash cans are colored black, red, green, etc etc., is so that no one can see what's inside of them. even if the trash is in bags, you would probably still be able to see the outline of certain things.

   What is your opinion on the Alabama abortion ban?
  ","
  absolutely despicable, and honestly, my jaw dropped when i read that it was passed because i didn't think we were regressing *that* far in society.
  
  people need to realize that this isn't going to stop abortions. it's going to stop *safe* abortions, and now people with uteruses are going to be in extreme danger if they want to terminate a pregnancy because of the lengths some people will go to do so. before abortion was as accessible as it is now, people died from coat hangers, ingesting poisons, etc etc. it's putting the safety of these people at risk.
  
  also, the fact that even having a miscarriage can be considered a felony is completely outrageous and unbelievable. i wholeheartedly cannot believe how the government treats women (and people with uteruses in general) in this day and age, it's absolutely astounding. this isn't a law against abortions, it's a law against women.

  so this morning when i saw her, i told her that they can't refuse a patient if they're sick regardless of whether or not they have insurance, and they would just bill them later. she made up some bullsh*t excuse about not wanting to be billed so she just went home, but i really do believe she just didn't want to be at work anymore and left for the hell of it.

   How do you deal with hateful messages online? Are you the sort to address the people who send them or do you just delete and ignore them?

409749,"

  i didn't know the exact statistic, but i did know that most homicides are towards victims who were struggling to leave the ab*sive relationship.

   Is being verbose a bad thing or do you look on it as thoroughness and precision? What’s your way; brevity or detailing?
  ","
  i typically view being verbose as a bad thing because it gives off the appearance that someone is trying too hard to sound educated, and often they don't understand the meaning of the words they're trying to use. the best way to get your point across is to recognize your audience and use terminology and copy that is in the best interest of the reader. by using excessive, floral language, it can lose the interest of the reader.

  it depends on where i am when i'm out tanning. if i'm in the comfort of my own backyard, then i'll use tanning oil because then when i'm done, i can quickly take a shower and get the oil off. however, if i'm at the beach, then i'll use lotion because it at least absorbs into the skin.

   Are you a go with the flow kind of person
  ","
  for the most part, i believe so. it really does depend on my mood, though. in some cases, i go with the flow and react accordingly to whatever is thrown at me. however, in other cases, i become really rigid and anxiety-ridden about how events unfold. it's never consistent.
  "
409795,"

409796,"
   Do you grow attached easily to people and/or objects and places?
  ","
  yes, i have the tendency to grow very attached to people, to the point where their emotions dictate my own emotions and feelings (without their realization) and i base my entire persona on their thoughts and behavior. because i've never truly known who i was on a deep level, i attach myself to other people and adopt their personas because it's the only way i can really have a personality.
  
  at the same time, however, if someone wrongs me then that attachment is quickly cut off and i have absolutely no issue removing them from my life. there are no feelings of regret or guilt in those cases.

  i've never had an argument or fight with my brother before, simply because he's much older than me and we never had a close relationship anyway.
  
  i also haven't had an argument with my parents in a long time. when things get heated, i choose to walk away instead of engaging with them. it isn't worth me getting angry and flustered over something that will only become worse if discussed. my mother, in particular, is insufferable when it comes to arguments because she'll believe she's always correct even when presented with evidence and logic proving otherwise.

   What’s your opinion on people who don’t shave and smell?
  ","
  there's not really much of a correlation between choosing not to shave & smelling bad, not unless you already don't take proper care of your personal hygiene. when i chose not to shave, i didn't smell bad because i wore deodorant to prevent myself from sweating or releasing odor, and body spray every day.
  
  however, i think everyone should try to be cognizant of their hygiene, mostly for themselves but also for the sake of people who are around them, lol. it's never pleasant when you have to sit close to someone or interact with someone & they smell terribly.

   Technology... are children growing up with too much of it? Should we be limiting our own screen time as adults? Is the increase in online games adding to aggressive behaviour in young people?
  ","
  yes, i do believe that children are growing up with too much screen time. i think studies have been done showing that too much screen time is bad for a child's health and development. i'm also strongly for allowing children to have fulfilling experiences outdoors and with family and friends, instead of sitting them in front of a television all day.
  
  the same can be said for adults too. we get so wrapped up in technology and social media that we neglect to live out own lives to its fullest potential.
  
  to answer your question regarding aggression and video games, i disagree that playing those games is a cause of aggression in children. often when children play video games and show signs of aggression, it's already something predisposed in them. the game itself doesn't cause it, but it could exacerbate the existing condition.

   A louis theroux documentary inspired question - do you think there are unrealistic expectation set on mothers by society. How they should feel about their children, their pregnancy, their lives in general once becoming a parent?
  ","
  i'm not a parent, but i do believe that there are a plethora of unrealistic expectations placed on mothers in society from what i've seen and heard. mothers are typically seen as the primary caregiver and are expected to take responsibility for most of the parenting, even if they have a partner. they're also expected to feel happy and fulfilled 24/7, when in reality being a parent comes with so many challenges and worries.
  
  it's perfectly okay to have bad days. it's okay to drop the kids off at a trusted person's house every now and again so you can get time to yourself. you're an individual person and ""mother"" is not the only title you have. you deserve to have your own interests and dreams outside of being a parent.

   What are some things that you believe need more awareness brought to them? What do you think bringing more attention to these issues would do?
  ","
  considering i'm always an advocate for mental health awareness and reform, i believe that there needs to be more awareness for stigmatized, lesser understood disorders -- such as personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and psychotic disorders. people always advocate for representation of depression/anxiety but rarely talk about other disorders that are much more complex.
  
  by talking about these disorders and mental health and illness in general, we seek to spread more understanding of them, including underlying causes and treatment methods. more people will be likely to seek help as a result.

409820,"
   Often we are told ""people change, someone's past doesn't define them"" do you agree? Where do we draw the line; does everyone deserve a clean slate and a fresh start from things they did as a child/teen?

  i believe in this notion to a certain degree, but it all depends on the severity of what someone did in their past, especially if they hurt other people. i wholeheartedly believe that most people have the capability to change, especially as they get older, but certain things cannot be forgiven or forgotten (i.e. abvsing or assaulting someone).

   Why are people faking relationships on Facebook and only posting the good things that happen to them and never the bad or the truth? If people can't be real in person/online, what good is left in this world?
  ","
  i believe that relationships are complex, so while someone pay post only about their successes with their relationships online, that doesn't mean that they're not being truthful. it's simply one facet of their relationship and doesn't encompass the relationship as a whole.
  
  the only exception, in my opinion, is when people flat out lie about their relationships online and post that they never have dilemmas or arguments or anything of the sort, when in reality they do. in that case, i think someone is better off not posting anything at all rather than pretend that everything is fine for the sake of their image.
  "
409840,"
   That's good. It's Sunday here too. That's always a dilemma on whether Sunday is the beginning of the week or the end of the week. Because in the Bible it says God rested on the 7th day and I've grown up with Sunday being the end of the week (day of rest).

  ","
  i don't believe it's predatory, but i do think it's an incredibly misinformed notion. you cannot help what your sexual orientation is, and if someone is heterosexual, they won't just magically turn bisexual or homosexual just because someone won't accept the fact that they're straight.
  "
409897,"
   Lots of people have this belief. But some people fall in love wth a idea. He thinks that she is his long lost dream girl. He says that Miley flirts with lots of other men besides her husband so her marriage doesn't matter to her. He has justifications for everything he does.
  ","
  that sounds like a delusion to me, to be perfectly honest. if he's going to great, irrational lengths to justify miley's behavior in an effort to claim that he can persuade her to be with him, then that could be indicative of an underlying problem.

   It depends on how we define love. If love is just excessive interest in something or someone, then it's love. If we try to set conditions for ""true love"" then it's another story. However the social media provides lots of information about people and specially celebrities. Even their personality
  ","
  my personal opinion is that you cannot love someone unless you know them personally. this man clearly doesn't know miley except for what is posted on social media, which isn't always reliable. he's infatuated with the idea of her.
  
  not to mention the fact that miley is happily married. he thinking he can win her over is disrespectful to her existing relationship.
  "

   How often do you check your mobile at work? Are there any cameras around to monitor employees?
  ","
  i don't check my cell phone at work unless i'm on my break. i don't get service in the office anyway.
  
  and yes, there are cameras in the office to monitor employee activity. which i think is a bit ridiculous, considering management uses it to meticulously watch people's actions in the office. however, i believe it may be useful in some situations if something gets stolen.
  "
409901,"
   The only way that it would be illegal is if he directly threatens to harm her. As long as he is describing his thoughts and daydreams, it's totally fine. I believe that mental health issues are a result of his love problem. The problem itself is not a mental health issue. It's a social issue.
  ","
  yes, i agree that as long as he doesn't begin threatening her, then his wishes are harmless (although no doubt they're hurting him greatly).
  
  i don't agree with you regarding mental health, though. his mental health problems are probably what's causing his obsession in the first place, because you honestly cannot love someone if you don't actually know them. you can be infatuated with someone, but love goes on a deeper, more intimate level. he doesn't personally know miley or her personality besides what she broadcasts on social media.
  "
409902,"
   True. Really how is pursuing someone for love is illegal? It doesn't matter what kind of girl she is. He can love her and go after her and he is just expressing his emotions. He loves her so much that it gives him anxiety and depression. So i would hope that he gets what he wants unlike them
  ","
  it's illegal when a fan becomes obsessive and delusional and begins breaking the law to try to pursue a celebrity. there are several cases of fans going to great lengths because they believe they're ""the one,"" which usually includes excessive stalking, threatening telephone calls or social media messages, etc etc.
  
  loving someone so much that it gives you anxiety or depression is not healthy, and this individual probably already has mental health issues that *need* to be addressed, otherwise his behavior will become more radical and dangerous.
  "
409903,"

   He says that he thinks about her non stop and he can never get over her. He says that Miley is a target and goal for him and not just a wish.

  i can understand why they feel that way. unfortunately, there isn't much the public can do though, not unless he begins breaking the law to try to get closer to her.

409907,"
   Well in the old days I would prob ask for your advice since we were close then but I'm thinking you really dislike me now so I prob won't ask...
   I mean if you ingratiate yourself there's no way to stop you and i wouldnt anyway...so
  ","
  i don't dislike you because you haven't done anything for me to develop such strong feelings like that. sometimes friendships simply fall apart over time, there's nothing you can do to stop it unless you try to take an active part in reviving the friendship and develop open communication with the person.
  
  however, it's a two-way street. if

   Someone named ""Foad"" is obsessing over celebrity girls on Instagram and particularly Miley Cyrus and keeps commening on everything they post and says that he loves and deserves Miley more than anyone else does. He says that he would do whatever it takes to get to her. What do you think about it?

   Do you think that social media increases the incidence of people being self conscious about their body image?

  yeah, definitely. there are so many accounts out there dedicated to showing off ""ideal"" body types, and even thinspo accounts on tumblr and such, and it can make a person feel quite self conscious about their body and how other people may perceive them.
  
  especially considering most of those posts are photoshopped as well, they're unattainable body types but it isn't apparent from the outside.
  "
409942,"
   Do you think there's an underlying spirit that animates the body?
  ","
  yes, i believe in the existence of a spirit.
  "
409943,"
   Why do some people have an obsession to be thin?
  ","
  it's pushed by society for people to be thin because it's more desirable, and there's such a culture surrounding thinness that some people become self conscious because they don't fit into that specific body type.
  
  in terms of eating disorders, it's also something that may arise out of trauma or being self conscious about your body in some form or another from a young age. it becomes so prominent that it really rearranges your thought processes and behaviors.

  they could burn in hell for all i care. ""non-offending"" is just a term they use to try to soften their feelings and make it ""acceptable,"" when in reality it's just as terrible as the ones who do offend. it simply means that they haven't offended yet because they weren't given the opportunity to do so.

  over the years, i've dropped more & more friendships. it's simply a part of getting older and realizing where your loyalties lie. you discover that some people are only friends with you out of curiosity, which is unhealthy. you should surround yourself with people who genuinely care about you, and who accept for you who you are while also being real enough with you to be comfortable telling you when you're doing something wrong.

  plant-based, like a vegetarian diet ?? if so, then i sorta already follow that kind of diet to a degree considering i don't eat meat often. when i do eat meat, it's usually just grilled chicken since that's among the healthiest ways to eat it. most of my diet consists of vegetables and other proteins, such as eggs and turkey breast. i also eat pasta (which is probably my downfall, LOL), but i've been trying to stick to whole grain pasta at least.

  i think it varies case-by-case. it would be virtually impossible to monitor every single case of cyber bullying, but there are obviously some cases that are worse than others, which can lead to detrimental effects on someone's mental health.
  
  in the case where someone is very negatively affected by cyber bullying to the point where it leads to a drastic change in mood, personality, and behavior, including SH or s*uicidal action, then legal consequences should take place.

   how do you feel about ALL forms of welfare ? 
tell me your reason behind your feelings.
  ","
  i support welfare in general. there's nothing wrong with needing extra help when it comes to the necessities of living, particularly in terms of food, shelter, and making sure you and your children are safe.
  
  a lot of people who criticize welfare, such as food stamps, claim that there are so many people who ab*se the system, when that isn't true whatsoever. there are stringent rules set in place for someone to receive government assistance and not everyone is qualified for them. i also think it's ridiculous how people who criticize those on welfare are essentially saying they don't believe those people deserve the basic right to exist comfortably.

   why do you think so many men can be ostracized from having “”women only”” type jobs such as a nanny and seen as inappropriate ?
  ","
  men are ostracized for having what are seen as ""women-oriented"" jobs because of the societal expectations that are in place regarding what a man's job is vs. what a woman's job is. it's seen as ""less"" manly for a man to be doing a job that is typically occupied by women, especially in the case of caregiving, nursing, etc etc.
  
  ideally, there should be less stigma associated with men doing what are stereotypically seen as ""womenly"" things, because the narrative behind those things is utterly false and it doesn't make someone less of a man for doing them.

   if you and your significant other have a rocky and dry intimate life and one of you cheat on the other, whose fault is it ?

  the one who cheated is at fault. cheating isn't acceptable if you're unhappy with your sex life, and there's an expectation of open communication and trust in relationships. ideally, the person who's unhappy with their intimate life should talk to their partner about these feelings so that they can come to a mutual agreement regarding what they should do to either spice up their life or make other arrangements.

   some moms won’t leave their child(ren) alone with the father even if they’re in a relationship. some of those moms prepare ahead of time (i.e. food, routine, clothing) as if the father is not capable of doing the same duties. what do you think about this ?
  ","
  i believe there's such a stereotype of women being the sole caregivers to children that it erases the responsibility of men being fathers to their children as well. women are typically viewed in society as being the main caregiver to children, even when they're in a relationship with or married to the father, because of their maternal instincts -- as well as the age-old expectation of women to be mothers instead of any other archetypes.
  
  in reality -- and idealistically -- fathers should be just as responsible as mothers for taking care of children. women shouldn't be expected to take ""extra"" care of their children in the event of them being gone for a period of time just so that it alleviates responsibility on the father. a father is just as much of a parent as a mother, and their responsibilities toward their children should be equal.

   what are some common myths that you know aren't true but people still believe them to be right and drives you crazy?
  ","
  a common myth that actually isn't true is that planned parenthood solely offers abortion services -- when in reality, abortions are only a small percentage of the services PP offer. they also offer gynecologic/obstetrics health exams, STD testing, birth control, breast exams, etc etc. a lot of people rely on PP for their services because they're not only efficient, but they work with you on a sliding scale whereas other doctor offices don't.
  
  even if PP only offered abortion services, there's nothing wrong with that at all. abortion itself is demonized greatly in society and there are still so many misconceptions regarding it, especially with respect to late term abortions. there should be no shame in getting an abortion, nor should there be guilt because you're not committing an act of m*rder. you're doing what's best for your own physical and mental health, and it would be more of an injustice to raise an unwanted child in a system that doesn't cater to it.
  "

   If you could establish criteria for the right to be a parent, what would they be?

  i don't believe there should be a limit like that on food stamps, no. you simply can't police what a person eats, and often enough, junk food is much, much cheaper than buying healthier alternatives (i.e., doritos chips versus veggie chips).
  
  people *need* to eat, and the government already doesn't give recipients of food stamps enough money to sustain a healthy lifestyle to begin with, and often these people need to really ration their allowances on a weekly basis. if someone wants to buy junk food, then they should be allowed to do so. there's nothing wrong with splurging on a bag of chips & dip every once in a while.

  ... have. I even knew that my parents knew because they would make small comments about it without actually coming forward and saying ""this is bad stop"". Luckily I grew out of being sxxually explicit as a kid and started growing more into sxxuality appropriately, if that makes sense. It still has really affected my sxx life in ways I'd rather not detail but I definitely didn't have the worst case scenario because I still had a good family despite that. The worst case is that I have a hard time finishing without seeing or thinking about pxrn. I hope that anon gets what they were looking for
  
  --
  
  thank you for explaining your experience !! i can relate with this a lot because i was definitely hyper-s*xual when i was a teenager, and i can probably attribute that to the p*rn i watched as well. i started having s*xual experiences from the time i was 12 years old, which is way too early in my opinion, and p*rn also gave me an unrealistic expectation of what sex would be like.
  
  i'm grateful in that my experiences weren't worse, but it definitely had the potential to be much worse than it was. i could have fallen into sex trafficking or started out in the industry from a very young age, and thankfully that didn't happen. however, it happens to a plethora of people when they're young.

  well i can't speak on behalf of that anon, but discovering p*rn at an early age can hinder development because of the increased emphasis placed on sex. it can make people value sex greater than it should be valued, and it can also lead to p*rn or sex addiction.

  sometimes i wish my parents were more aware when it came to things like the internet, because i was definitely too young to see some of the things i saw, but at the same time, i also found a community of people who genuinely helped me with my mental health during a crucial time of my life, and i don't know if i would be alive today had i not met them when i did.

  i believe i was around 11 or 12 years old when i first started using the internet unsupervised. honestly, i believe i was too young to use the internet completely because i was open to all of the horrible wonderment of the internet from a very early age, and it could have had devastating effects on me.
  
  i don't really feel comfortable with the idea of children using the internet for that reason -- there's simply so much danger out there, and it's usually disguised as something fun or meaningless. it's easy to fall into the traps of people who have nefarious reasoning and intentions. and it isn't that i wouldn't trust my future child, but i wouldn't trust the situation at all. children are naturally naive, so i would be terrified that they would fall into a situation that they cannot get out of.

410224,"
   I thought you said you'd allow it if he wasn't satisfied?

  having a relationship with someone is different from just having sex with someone, in my personal opinion. you can have no-strings-attached sex with a person simply to gain sexual satisfaction without having an intimate connection with them. if he admitted that he wasn't satisfied with our relationship on a sexual level, then i believe i would be fine with him pursuing sexual relations elsewhere, and he's perfectly capable of having sex without developing feelings for someone else.
  
  it's different in an open relationship because you *are* developing feelings for another person and you're actively dating them, just as you're dating your first partner. i wouldn't be able to handle the thought of him committing his emotions to another person while also maintaining our own relationship because our emotional relationship is sacred to me, and i would be afraid of that other person ""winning"" him over because i'm a general mess of a human being.

  as much as the law firm was a terrible job, i genuinely enjoyed ""advocating"" for the rights of disabled people, whether they were struggling with physical or mental disabilities, and sometimes both. we sought to win them their well-deserved disability benefits, which we often did, but unfortunately i couldn't continue with that job because it was so detrimental to my own mental health.
  "
410233,"
   Fair enough. But i dont see any able bodied people going around saying they have ""able-bodied privilege"".
  ","
  most people don't recognize their privilege, unfortunately. a lot of people are ignorant to what privilege is and whether or not they have it, and they often speak up over disabled people and discount their struggles. i witnessed it a lot when i was working at the law firm because we specialized in disability law. our clients were even discriminated against by their own doctors.
  "
410234,"
   By your upside-down logic, do you also consider yourself to have able-bodied privilege? You dont deal with the difficulties and discrimination that physically disabled people do.
  ","
  yes, you're correct. i don't have any physical disabilities, so i never experienced ableism as it relates to physical conditions. however, i do have mental illness where i've experienced ableism based on my mental conditions, even though they're not legally disabling.
  "
410235,"
   my point is that you as a white person would not know what its like to live as a poc, so you cant imply ""every poc experiences racism, and those who dont are lucky"".
  ","
  i didn't imply that, because i said that there are probably people who aren't white who haven't experienced racism (a few answers above). but you're correct -- i obviously wouldn't know what it's like to experience racism because i never have & i never will.
  "
410236,"
   ""it's definitely a privilege to have not experienced racism in your life"" - says the white person.
  ","
  i recognize my privilege, as i stated in an earlier answer. just because i benefit from white privilege doesn't mean i don't acknowledge that other people don't have the same privilege.
  "
410237,"
   As defined in the dictionary, a privilege is ""a special right"" granted to a ""particular person or group"". Freedom isnt a special right, nor is it limited to a particular group. Your view is upside down and implies racism is the norm, and everyone not experiencing racism is special.
  ","
  a dictionary definition doesn't take into account the sociological effects of privilege or racism, it's honestly just a rudimentary definition that doesn't necessarily evolve with the times.
  
  freedom shouldn't be a special right, but it nevertheless is, and racism is unfortunately ""normal"" and commonplace. it's harmful to not acknowledge that racism is widespread in today's society.
  "
410238,"
   Its interesting because a non-white person who hasnt experienced racism would technically have benefitted from ""white privilege"" even though they are not white....apparantly not experiencing racism is now considered a privilege instead of a basic human right.
  ","
  i don't know if they would experience *white* privilege, considering they're not white, but it's definitely a privilege to have not experienced racism in your life.
  
  unfortunately in today's society, it *is* a privilege. just because it's a basic human right in ideal terms doesn't mean that people recognize it as such. a lot of people, mostly people who are actually white, think of other races as inferior and don't believe they deserve the same rights.
  "
410239,"
   are you saying or implying that every non-white person suffers from racism?
  ","
  if they don't directly experience racism, because i'm sure there are some people who don't, then they obviously have the potential to experience racism because they're not white.
  "
410240,"
   not suffering from racism is a privilege?
  ","
  yes, it's called white privilege. white people don't experience racism, but people of other races do. white people have always been in positions of power & have been the oppressors in society, not the other way around.
  
  naturally, white people can be discriminated against but there's a difference between racism and discrimination.
  "
410241,"
   what privileges do you have as a white cis-passing person?
  ","
  people value my opinion higher than those who aren't white or cis, and i don't suffer from racism as a result of my white privilege. i do have people discriminate against me for being non-binary and i face a lot of transphobia, but it's mainly online because i don't advertise my gender in real life.
  "
410242,"
   Is it better to have a dysfunctional family or no family?
  ","
  i think this varies from person to person, because it all depends on the individual's value of family and the severity of the dysfunction within the family.
  
  personally speaking, i would have preferred to have no family over having a dysfunctional family. my family has been dysfunctional for as long as i can remember & it's been detrimental to my mental health. i don't place much value in my own family at all, so it would have been better for me if i didn't have a family at all.
  "
410243,"
   Do you prefer to have privileges or opportunities?
  ","
  i benefit from privilege because i'm a white cis-passing person, but i would prefer having opportunities over privilege because i don't want to be defined by my privilege. i try to use my privilege to speak up for other groups and make things right, because i feel it's my duty to do so. however, i would prefer to have opportunities based on my work ethic and talents.
  "
410244,"
   What is something that you said you'd NEVER do... But then changed your mind and did it any way.

  "
410245,"
   Which do you think is more important: following the dreams your parents want for you or following your own dreams?
  ","
  following your own dreams is *much* more important than following the dreams your parents want for you. you're your own individual first & foremost, and even if your parents push for you to go down a certain career path, you have to remember that you need to do what's best for yourself because you're ultimately in control of your own life -- not your parents.

  "
410248,"
   Do you enjoy cooking, or do you see it as a chore like cleaning?
  ","
  i don't enjoy cooking because i'm simply not good at it, rofl. i don't see it as a chore, though, because it's necessary (although most chores are necessary, but eating is obviously very important). on the flip side, i do enjoy cleaning and doing laundry because it makes me feel better when they're done.

   Do you like being the center of the attention or prefer to stand back?

  i like being in the center of attention when it comes to my close friends and boyfriend, but when it comes to other people & strangers, i prefer being in the background because the spotlight makes me uncomfortable.
  "
410251,"
   Your thoughts on the fast pace of social media and news?
  ","
  i think the fast pace that the news spreads across social media is a blessing, tbh. people are able to read the news and become informed on current events moreso now than ever before, and it also spreads to different countries so that now people are more aware than in past years. it's always good to be informed.
  "
410252,"

  "
410257,"
   do you give people a chance?
  ","
  it depends entirely on what sort of chance they're looking for and their behavior towards me in general. if someone wants to become friends, then i'm normally resistant to the idea because i'm under the belief that friendship cannot be forced upon others and should happen naturally. that's why it always puzzles me when people on askfm say ""can we be friends?"" because friendship just doesn't work that way.

  i believe they're equally important, which is why it's integral to try to establish tone of voice when speaking to someone via writing, whether it's through text message or social media. tone is often lost in text-based messages and can lead to miscommunication.
  
  when speaking face to face, what you say and how you say it are equally important because if you say something that's supposed to be helpful but it's in the wrong tone, then the other person could get offended. there are also statements you can say that can be rephrased a different way to convey better understanding.

  no, she's never seen a psychiatrist and would refuse to acknowledge that she would ever need one. she constantly harasses my father and i for seeing our respective psychiatrists and therapists, and like i stated in my previous answer, she believes she's the only ""sane"" person around. she brags about how she doesn't have any mental health issues, smh.

  i have considered that extensively, but she doesn't actually have a mental illness as far as i'm aware. i've heard the whole ""narcissistic ab*se"" term thrown around before and i could understand if she had narcissistic traits, but again -- it's something she would never admit to.
  
  for example, she frequently exclaims that both my father and i are ""crazy"" and she's the ""only sane person"" in our household. she asks me about my anxiety attacks and depressive episodes and has no clue how to understand them or sympathize with them.
  
  even if she *was* mentally ill when she was ab*sing me, that doesn't excuse her actions. you can be mentally ill and have a distinct concept of right vs wrong behavior. mental health doesn't justify toxic or harmful behaviors.

  someone who is 19 and the other is 25 could surprisingly work out, while another couple with the same age gap won't work out. everything varies case by case. as long as the younger individual is being hyperaware so that they don't become manipulated.
  "
410340,"
   what i’ve gathered from your responses is it’s not wrong, it’s really not a huge age gap. they’re both legal ages but what would be my issue would be their maturity and the differences in what you can do and accomplish being 25 versus being 19.

   you people are really moving the goal posts now. 18+ is legal so anything p*do is out the window as were talking about two adults here, regardless if they are in different ""stages"" of their life they are still both fully adult.
  ","
  it doesn't change the fact that an adult is attracted to someone who is barely legal. if they realize their age and still try to pursue them, then that's predatory behavior. there's no rational reason for a grown adult to pursue a teenager.
  "
410361,"
   dang im 19 and my bf is 25 lol ur making me feel bad leigh ? but we have a great relationship and pretty much the same maturity believe it or not so idk :/ he's definitely not a p*do tho
  ","
  like i said, it varies and goes on a case by case basis when it comes to that sort of age gap. no doubt there will be some ""good"" guys, but it would personally make me cautious if i knew someone who was around my age and was dating a 19 year old.
  "
410362,"
   Hmm but when she's 25 he will be 31/32 so it's not terrible.

  that's irrelevant, though. that's years down the line, and it has no reflection on the current moment when the 19 year old is still a teenager and the 25 year old is in their mid-20s.
  "
410363,"
   do u think the guy has p**dophiliac tendencies
  ","
  perhaps -- in those cases, it really varies because they're still in a ""transition"" stage of life. i would be cautious if i knew someone who was 25 was dating a 19 year old, for example.
  "
410364,"
   do you think a nineteen and 25 year old dating is weird?
  ","
  that's a bit of a borderline situation for me, but overall there's still a large gap in both age and life events. a 19 year old is just starting college, while someone who's 25 has already had their career started. they're in totally different areas of their life so i don't see how that would work.
  "
410365,"
   different anon but im sure if the guy is middle aged he probably has children the same age or around the same age as the girls he's trying to date.... or maybe even older lmfao i really don't understand how people can do that.. ego boost perhaps?? either way it's unhealthy and embarrassing.
  ","
  this is true too !! it's completely unnecessary, and guaranteed they also exhibited the same behavior when they were younger, going after literal children much younger than them.
  
  if anyone tries to justify an older man going after barely legal teenagers, i'm throwing hands.
  "
410366,"
   Ok I lied lmao another thing to consider -- if a man that damn old is willing to be with an 18 year old or consistently goes after barely legal teens, you don't think he'd mind being with a 17 or 16 year old?? Like your partner is a borderline child dude lmaooo, I'm gonna give you the side eye
  ","
  ???
  "
410367,"
   Amen! Last thing - a lot of people say ""oh it's legal so who cares"" but you really have to look at it from a different point of view. If the girl is 18 or 19 and the guy is in his 40s, that girl was considered a CHILD only a year or two ago. Like honestly that relationship won't work lmao. Yuck.
  ","
  AGREED. and it also doesn't matter if they're ""mature for their age"" -- that's hella predatory behavior.
  "
410368,"
   I think a lot of men find youth attractive which is fine but why not go for 25+ if you're in your forties? Or at the very least, get a partner who is old enough to drink. It seems like they just want a pretty girl who they can control & who will settle for things women their age won't. It's gross.

   The only reason men that age like young girls is bc they're easy to control and inexperienced so will settle for less.

  YES, ugh. that has happened to me on several occasions, haha. i normally just sit and wait in my car when that happens (unless the place is closed), or i internally battle with myself about just walking in early and seeing what happens. there have been a few occasions where i got to my doctor's appointments super early, but they took me anyway because they didn't have a previous appointment.

  i do believe that i'm holding onto something that i need to let go of, however. sometimes i get into old mindsets from when i was younger, where i become stuck in a depressive mindset and believe that nothing can truly get better. i hold onto that sadness and exasperated feeling, because it became familiar to me and i strangely find comfort in it. it's something i've been trying to work on letting go, because i'm in a different stage of my life now and i don't need to hold onto those feelings anymore.

  yes, some racist people have the capability to change. i've never witnessed it first-hand either, but i still believe that someone who is racist can realize the toxicity within themselves and actively change their perspectives to be more inclusive.
  
  often when this happens, the racist person was simply raised in a racist environment and was conditioned to think the same way. as they get older, they may realize how problematic that mindset was and seek to change themselves.

  i dislike when a person is disloyal, dishonest, and manipulative. i also don't like when people have an arrogant personality or are willingly close-minded, which usually involves them being racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, etc etc.
  
  i do believe that some people can change their personalities, or at least toxic traits that become apparent to them, as they get older. while we grow up, our traits and interests inevitably change. however, it's also important to note that not everyone evolves as they grow older, and some people retain the same toxic traits that they had when they were younger.

  ","
  i don't know your partner, so i can't really determine if he's racist based solely on this information. he may just be pointing out the differences in culture. however, if this is causing a rift in your relationship then perhaps you should try to talk to him about it more and get him to realize that you're not being over-sensitive. explain that there isn't much of a difference between him and yourself.
  
  it makes me wonder if perhaps he's insecure in the relationship considering how often he seems to bring it up. maybe he unconsciously thinks that the differences in culture may not be good for your relationship, although perhaps i'm also overthinking this.

   What Habits Are Holding You Back From Success?

  i try not to allow my bad habits to hold me back from success, which also includes my mental illnesses. in the past, my anxiety disorder held me back in a lot of different ways, because i was too anxious/afraid to take new opportunities in fear of failing at them. however, these days i've learned how to properly deal with my anxiety and pursue my goals despite feeling anxious over them. i understand that i shouldn't allow my anxiety to control my life, and i persist in spite of it.

   Do you think the avg person thinks beyond their own immediate life/surroundings (family, job, home etc)? If so, how often do they consider their greater impact on the world or the events occurring across the globe or even the universe? If not, why don't people consider the world beyond themselves?
  ","
  i don't believe the average person thinks beyond their immediate surroundings, no. most people are primarily concerned with how things affect their own lives, not so much the lives around them or the world as a whole. i've realized over the past few years that a lot of people also aren't aware of a lot of global affairs and events that *could* affect them in the long run because they don't care about politics, history, current events, etc etc.
  
  people don't consider the world beyond themselves because they simply believe that nothing will personally affect them, when that isn't the case at all. there are certain laws that have been passed that will sometimes ultimately affect a person's life, whether they believe it or not.

  yeah, this happened to me during my high school/early college years. i wanted to pursue creative writing as a primary subject of study, so i majored in the subject during my freshman year of college. some people around me told me that i wasn't going to find a job in that field because it would essentially be a useless degree, and i didn't believe them at first.
  
  however, during the end of my freshman year, i realized that they were somewhat right. it was too specific of a major to really find a versatile array of jobs in the field, not unless i wanted to pursue further education and go into teaching, which i didn't want to do. i changed my major to communications/professional writing, which is much more diverse because it encompassed not only writing, but also business, marketing, and journalism. since then, i've had two jobs in my field.

   What are the limits of ""not taking No for an answer"" ?
  ","
  i don't really know what you mean by ""limits"" in this context. however, there's a large problem with not taking ""no"" for an answer in today's society, especially in terms of dating and consent. a lot of people are under the impression that just because someone *doesn't* say no, it automatically means yes -- when that isn't the case whatsoever.
  
  when people don't take ""no"" for an answer, they're essentially forcing themselves upon other people and not willing to accept the truth. they'll continually try to pursue others regardless of the other person's feelings, and it can turn into a red flag for manipulative/ab*sive behavior.

  however, i honestly think my life would have turned out *better* had i not endured years of ab*se as a child, which led to the development of my mental illnesses. my mental illnesses aren't usually debilitating, but they have prevented me from taking some opportunities and they make it generally harder for me to live my life. i've nevertheless persisted in spite of them, but they're still there.

  ","
  i somewhat agree with it, but i also disagree with it. it's important to surround yourself with people who contribute to your personal growth, and if you feel that you're experiencing low self esteem and that your companions may be adding to those feelings. then you should rid them from your life. it helps to have supportive friends who aid in your development, not stifle it.
  
  at the same time, however, depression isn't necessarily caused by being around people who are a**holes, lol. it mainly stems from genetic causes as well as your upbringing. so you could be surrounded by positive people and still have depression, it doesn't discriminate. in that respect, i believe the quote is a bit misguided.

  recently, i have had to overcome my drinking habit because it was becoming problematic and toxic to other people in my life, particularly my boyfriend. i was drinking 4-5 nights per week and often getting blackout drunk, and it wasn't healthy for either my physical or mental health. so i've recently cut down severely on when i do drink, and i also don't allow myself to get drunk anymore if i do decide to have a drink at night.

  ","
  i've never been in an ab*sive relationship before, but i do know that it is extremely difficult for people to escape from those kinds of relationships. you never know that a person is ab*sive from the beginning, and it develops over time without you even realizing that it's becoming ab*sive until it's too late.
  
  in such cases, it's hard for people to leave those relationships because they fear for their lives, that their partner will retaliate against them for leaving and hurt them. that's why there are shelters for domestic ab*se survivors, it gives them a safe place to live while they're trying to leave a relationship.

   As an American, what do you think happens when American women get married to non-American men? And do you think the different backgrounds or the cultural gap between the two partners are going to affect their lives and their children's life negatively?
  ","
  it ultimately depends on the culture the woman gets married into, whether or not that culture is tolerant of women having freedoms, as well as the relationship as a whole. in addition, it also depends on the woman's willingness to immerse herself in that particular culture, because some people are more adaptable than others.
  
  depending on the couple's relationship, it could negatively affect their children's lives, but i think that has more to do with parenting styles as opposed to cultural norms. there generally isn't a bad connotation to being raised in various cultures unless that culture is inherently oppressive. one of my cousins married an indian man a few years ago, and they often travel to india to spend time with his family. it simply works for them.

  i don't see an issue with people watching movies or shows through pirating websites. my perspective is that those movies & shows already make more than enough money through regular avenues, and it wouldn't make a difference if a small percentage of people pirated their content instead of contributing money towards the content in the first place. they're big corporations/productions.

   What is the worst way your parents ever embarrassed you in public?

  i don't go out in public with my parents, so i haven't been put in a position to be embarrassed since i was a teenager. i can't remember if they ever embarrassed me in public that long ago.
  "
410620,"
   Do you think “I miss hanging out with you” is better than “I miss you.”? Why?
  ","
  i believe it depends on what message you're trying to convey. when you miss hanging out with someone, it gives off a different connotation than when you miss who an individual is as a person.
  
  also, when you say ""i miss you,"" it gives off the impression that you have deep feelings for someone -- unless you already have a close relationship with that person, then it's no big deal. if all you feel is that you miss seeing someone, then perhaps saying ""i miss hanging out with you"" is more precise and to the point.

  yes, i struggle with mental health conditions on nearly a daily basis. i'm diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and borderline personality disorder.
  
  when i'm feeling down, i ultimately have to wait until the episode passes because nothing can really make me feel ""better"" otherwise. i have really unhealthy coping mechanisms at the moment, but i also do try to talk out my feelings with trusted friends, which can aid the situation temporarily.

  ","
  i dislike when the media narrates a story to insinuate that a person is/was dangerous *because* of their mental illness, not because of their pre-existing traits which determined their violent behavior. it's statistically more common for those with mental illness to be victims of violent crimes, not the perpetrator themselves. however, there's still a lot of stigma that exists in news stories regarding violent criminals if they happen to have an existing mental health problem ; they blame it entirely on the illness and give off the impression that *everyone* with that illness is dangerous -- when that's simply not true.

  ---
  
  if he's cheated on his girlfriend with not only you, but also two other people, then i'm sorry to break this to you but you're likely not much different than those other women in his eyes. if he was truly unhappy with his girlfriend, he would break up with her -- the fact that he stays with her and continues to cheat just means that he's taking advantage of her naivety and doing what he can to get laid.
  
  you may have feelings for him, but you have to learn to set those feelings aside. he's not going to change for you if he hasn't taken the steps toward breaking up with his girlfriend or changing his behavior. this sounds like patterned behavior to him, and he's probably going to do the same exact thing to other women until he matures.

  ","
  when i play video games, i normally restrict my playing to one save file that i invest all of my energy into, and if i do something wrong, then i go back into the last save and restart the mission. i don't accept anything less than perfection in my gaming, which makes it arduous for me to complete a game.
  
  if my life was akin to a video game, then i would likely still only have one save file, but a lot of rewrites involved. if i made a hazardous mistake, i would immediately go back in time to fix it, even down to the little things like if i said something wrong in a conversation.
  
  my achievements would be small victories related to mental health, i.e. ""got out of bed!"" , ""took a shower and brushed your teeth!"" , ""drove to work without having an anxiety attack!"" etc etc. i've always loved getting achievements on xbox, so i would probably find a lot of little ones everywhere that were worth 5 points, lmao.

   How did you find your own identity? Not just personality wise, but things such as interests, your strengths, your weaknesses? Do you think your early childhood helped or hindered how long it took for you to descover who you are? (That's assuming you know truly who you are)
  ","
  one of the facets of borderline personality disorder that i deal with has to do with identity disturbance -- meaning an unclear sense of identity or void of a sense of self. it's something i've dealt with for my entire life, from what i remember, but i never knew there was an actual word for it until i was diagnosed a few years ago.
  
  my interests change frequently and are often the reflection of the interests of whoever i'm attached to at that current moment. if someone i'm attached to is into photography, then i pick up the hobby. if they're enthusiastic about going out and drinking, then i go out and drink with them. i have a few hobbies that i found i genuinely enjoyed, such as writing and video games, but even then, they're primarily influenced by someone else.
  
  my early childhood undoubtedly had a huge factor in why i developed BPD. studies have shown that BPD arises out of a combination of environmental and genetic factors, and because of my past history of trauma, it's suspected that my environment caused my development of BPD. my episodes are still in existence, despite being in routine treatment, because i'm still in the environment where i was raised. i don't believe i'll be able to recover until i'm out of my parents' house, because at that point i can start my own life on my own terms.

  ","
  if i'm feeling a particular craving that day, then i'll suggest that restaurant and see how my boyfriend or friend feels about it. there's a handful of regular places we frequent, and it's mostly because they're local to us and had good reviews. whenever my boyfriend and i go out to eat, we'll either go to a diner or a steakhouse. my friends normally prefer mexican food places.

  i also dealt with ridiculous customers on a daily basis when i worked in retail, as well. there were so many people who would get so hot-headed and irrational if you told them that you couldn't fulfill their wishes, whether that was using a coupon, getting a sales price, etc etc. they would get angry if their coupon was expired or if they were looking at the wrong sales tag, and they blamed it on the workers instead of themselves.

  i don't know much information about anonymous donors to have a *really* informed opinion -- however, my concern with anonymity is that you don't know the donor's medical history, and therefore, you don't know what potential the child has of developing certain illnesses, whether that occurs in their childhood or adulthood.
  
  if a donor has family history of diabetes or heart disease, then that's something i would want to know about so that i can take the proper precautions early on in that child's life to prevent them from developing heart disease and diabetes. it's also useful to know if alcoholism runs in the donor's family, if there's a history of mental illness, etc etc. i would want what's best for my child and that includes full awareness of the medical dilemmas that may occur as they get older.

  i used to wholeheartedly believe in reincarnation when i was younger (like a teenager), but now i'm not so sure that i believe in it anymore. it's an interesting perspective and it would give me further hope for traversing life in itself, but it doesn't seem ""realistic"" enough to me, and i don't have enough faith in religious/spiritual things like that to hold that belief anymore.

   If you could own a single prop from any film ever made, what would you choose?
  ","
  probably sting (frodo's sword from the lord of the rings trilogy). the LOTR films are among my favorite movies, and i've always had a great interest in swords and knives.
  "
410803,"
   If you could build a house anywhere, where would you build it?
  ","
  i would *love* to own a house somewhere in west virginia or north carolina, deep within the woods on the outskirts of a town. alternatively, my best friend recently moved to new hampshire and the surrounding area where she lives is absolutely beautiful, and she loves it there.
  "
410804,"
   last time you were desperate to do something?
  ","
  i don't feel desperation very often at all, so i'm not entirely sure. the only thing i can think of would probably be feeling desperate to have a cigarette after a particularly stressful day.

  i prefer cold weather over hot weather, if i had to choose between the two. i can't tolerate the heat and humidity.

  i don't generally shop for new clothing during the change of seasons, although i did buy two tank tops a few weeks ago off of amazon. as for cleaning, i try to clean well every week so that isn't a seasonal thing for me either.

  no, it wouldn't be possible for me to watch television while working because it would ruin my concentration. i'm also pretty certain that i would get in trouble at work if they discovered i was watching a show while working, lol.
  "
410809,"
   What would be harder for you, to tell someone you love them or that you donot love them back? ?
  ","
  it would be harder for me to tell someone that i do not love them in return. i've never had an issue expressing my feelings of love or gratitude toward my friends or partner, but it would be much more difficult for me to confide in someone that their feelings aren't reciprocated.

410810,"
   How do you judge a person

  i judge people by their character -- how they treat others in social situations, how they view strangers, how they treat their friends and significant others, and how they work (whether or not they have a hard work ethic).
  "
410811,"
   Should we concern ourselves with things that cannot be explained?

  spirited away !! it's one of my favorite animated movies.

   How do you push through with writer's block?
  ","
  because of my job, it's impossible for me to give into writer's block because i write assignments for programs on a daily basis. i can't afford to have writer's block because the features need to be written one way or another, and i always try my best to give the client my best effort in making their feature interesting and concise.
  
  at the same time, though, i also haven't written anything creatively in a long time. :// all of my efforts go toward writing at work, so when i'm home, i feel absolutely burnt out.

   What do you most like about writing?
  ","
  i like the satisfaction of finding the right words to use to portray the feeling i'm trying to describe, especially when i weave those words into a sentence that sounds particularly strong or appealing. i've thankfully always had a way with my words (written down, at least), so it's cathartic for me to get things down on paper.
  "
410816,"
   When's the last time you did something new?

  does beginning a new project at work count towards this ?? haha. when i took on this program after the previous administrator left on maternity leave, it was something i didn't really know how to do, so i had to teach myself along the way. it was daunting at first -- but now it's been three weeks since i've been running the program by myself, and i'm finally comfortable doing it.
  "
410817,"

  a cup of coffee from starbucks. my mother wanted a large iced latte, and the price for one of those is at least $5, which is ridiculous. especially considering it's mostly milk.

410818,"
   Do you think self love is hard?
  ","
  yes, i believe that self love can be difficult for some people. especially people who have been raised in environments where they were never taught how to love themselves. it's such a radical departure from the way we've been raised, so it can be hard to navigate how exactly to love yourself and where to even begin.

  it doesn't bother me, but i do delete them immediately. i have no interest in checking out someone else's music/project/etc etc.
  
  however, i do think it can also deter people from checking out their content because they're doing it in such a forceful manner. if they posted it on their own page every now and again and promoted it to their own followers, they might have a better chance of their content being seen.

  i first suspected that i had a mental illness when i was 13 years old, because i had been struggling with depression for about a year at that point and figured that something was ""wrong"" with me. i developed svicidal thoughts early on, but i wasn't really aware at that time that what i was feeling wasn't healthy or normal.

  unfortunately, there isn't much you can do in such a situation. :// if someone doesn't understand that they're mentally ill or in need of help, then they won't accept any help or acknowledge that they have a problem to begin with. you can tell them to infinity that their behavior or feelings are abnormal, but if they insist that there's nothing wrong, there isn't much you can do to help them.

  i truly value my internal drive and motivation. regardless of what has happened to me, i've always possessed a desire to do more and do better than how i previously was. i've never allowed anything to strike me down for longer than it was necessary, and i've always reinvented myself with each hardship to create a better version of myself.

   Are you a control freak?Are you able to let others do something without interfering?

  i can be a control freak at times, but only when it concerns projects that i work on myself, where my name is attached to whatever the project is. i was terrible at group projects when i was in high school & college because i always double-checked everyone else's work to make sure it was up to par. i didn't want to risk my grade because someone else didn't do their part.

  i'm working through my issues with self-control and impulsivity. i came to the conclusion a few weeks ago that i have problems with drinking alcohol, to the point where i was getting black out drunk 3-4 times per week. and on the nights i wasn't getting intoxicated, i was having at least one drink per night because i craved it.
  
  since i came to that understanding, i've been trying hard to limit myself and gain more control over my habits. i don't drink regularly anymore, which has been difficult in itself. i'll have one or two drinks here and there, but it isn't nearly as often as what i was doing a month ago, nor am i drinking as much on those nights that i do allow myself to have a drink.
  
  i still crave it every day. but it isn't healthy for me, and my boyfriend was getting overwhelmingly concerned for my health and my mental state when i was drinking heavily. i'm trying to be better.

   Do you think Victoria’s Secret gives a wrong message to girls that being thin is “sexy” ?
  ","
  yes, companies like victoria's secret do portray the wrong message to vulnerable, insecure children when it comes to their marketing techniques and clothing options. while there's obviously nothing wrong with being thin, the companies give off the impression that a thin body type is the *only* body type that's attractive or alluring -- when that's not true in any form.
  
  this is further complicated by their ways of photoshopping models to unrealistic perfection, not selling clothing or intimate apparel that's over a certain size, etc etc. they profit off of young girls' insecurities.

  i read an article the other day regarding notre dame and it's significance, particularly in historical video games like assassin's creed. they're utilizing the blueprints from assassin's creed: unity to recreate the cathedral, because everything in the game was built to scale and with significant detail. it's going to help the constructors and engineers rebuild it up.

   Do you think a cheater who proposes to his girlfriend, will stop the cheating once the ring is on her finger? Since he’s shown he wants her hand in marriage?
  ","
  it depends entirely on the individual. some people who have cheated in the past vow to remain faithful to their partner after marriage, whether that's due to loyalty or faith or tradition or something as simple as growing older and maturing. however, other people may want to marry their partner to ensure that they won't leave them if they continue cheating, and it has nothing to do with loyalty or maturity at all.
  
  marriage isn't an end-all, and they can be annulled. it doesn't always mean that a person is ready to stop cheating if they offer marriage. it could simply mean another method of manipulation.

  but what helps me usually is painting my nails -- i notice i don't bite or pick at my cuticles if my nails are painted because i don't want to ruin the polish. i don't know if that will help you personally, but it's something that helps me a lot.

   Are you dropping anyone who’s friends with Marissa?
  ","
  i don't think anyone is remaining friends with marissa after this incident. it's one thing to insult someone immaturely for their weight, but what she did today was beyond ""drama."" she not only attempted to hurt one person through her behavior, but she also consciously attacked others through her narrow-minded viewpoints regarding women and fertility.
  "
411005,"
   Is life nice in US?
  ","
  i forgot to mention in my previous answer --
  
  marissa implied in her answers that the only reason females populate the earth is to be impregnated and give birth, and therefore, those who cannot give birth are automatically ""weak."" HOWEVER, this ignores the fact that statistically, 1/10 females cannot sustain a pregnancy, and 1/4 females have miscarriages.
  
  you cannot rely on something you assume to be basic biology in order to undermine a person when the statistics are not in your favor. i'm not going to go into the feminist argument regarding the purpose of women, because it's 2019 and everyone knows that women are more than just baby-making machines, but you cannot deny scientific evidence that has been studied for decades.
  
  marissa's logic is null, and it only stems from her own internalized misogyny that she herself has to learn to cope with, instead of lashing out against other people who are complete strangers and don't fit into her small perspective of the world.
  "
411006,"
   Basically Marissa drama part II. Lots of going back and forth between her and others. What everyone has basically cut her off for is throwing up the stillbirth of deras child in her face after she said Marissa has no gains lol. She said she's not a real woman bc she can't have a living child.
  ","
  her answers have since been deleted (unless my app screwed up), so i had to rely on receipts to find out that this was indeed true. i was hoping no one would go *that* low, but my mind is blown yet again.
  
  if y'all want my opinion, it's this -- insulting a person for their looks, their weight, whatever ... that's one thing, and that's petty drama. however, to go so far as to attack a person for losing something as intimate and personal as a pregnancy, that's one of the most vile things i've ever heard discussed on askfm.
  
  everyone knows that marissa has always been one for dramatic effect, likely due to her own need for attention (which isn't necessarily bad, everyone does need attention), but going down such a toxic and hurtful route is unhealthy and manipulative. this goes further than liberals v. conservatives, trans v. cis, gay v. straight, etc etc. this was a personal attack.
  
  i've only ever associated with marissa once, and that was when she called me on the phone to tell me the truth about cas 2-3 years ago. i appreciated her efforts, but that was a different time. people usually grow as they get older, but in this instance, her development has been hindered. i honestly hope she does mature and realize the implications of her words and actions, because calling everyone derogatory names and trying to take the ""moral"" high road won't help this time.

  it is drama -- there's no threatening behavior, no one is at risk of getting hurt, and its just petty words on a screen. if the situation called for disciplinary action, then perhaps i would have said something. but someone misgendering a friend of mine, when that friend is more than capable of speaking for himself, isn't a serious crime. it's simply drama.

  the whole ""if you love something, set it free. if it comes back, it's yours. if it doesn't, it never was.""

  in short, everyone is struggling -- we're all fighting battles within ourselves that no one knows anything about, and if we had more compassion and recognized that other people were fighting to survive, perhaps there would be less conflict or toxic behaviors in the world. even the most intolerant people are fighting their own battles, and while it can be hard to have compassion for them, it's something we should keep in the back of our mind.

  no, it doesn't really bother me if people misgender me (unless they know i'm non-binary and insist on calling me a woman out of spite). in general, other people's opinions have no affect on my gender and their opinions ultimately make no difference in the long run.

  ","
  i think it ultimately depends on the individual -- sometimes baby steps are warranted because it helps people ease into change, while other times people are more comfortable taking big steps because it would be the only thing that works for them.
  
  i.e. my boyfriend required big steps when he went sober, otherwise he never would have broken the cycle of addiction if he tried to take baby steps. he quit cold turkey and has been sober from drugs ever since (it's been a few years now), and he rarely drinks alcohol except on special occasions every few months.

  i reconnected with an old friend a few months ago -- i have an online friend whom i spoke to for years when i was a teenager, and she ended up becoming one of my closest friends. we grew apart when i entered college because that's what happens during life at times, but i messaged her recently to gain a deeper understanding of my past since i don't remember much about my early life at all.

  unfortunately, you cannot expect everyone to respect you solely for existing, and there will always be people who will disagree with you, whether that disagreement is regarding someone's opinions, gender identity, sexual orientation, etc etc. i'm not bothered if people misgender me, for example, but i know plenty of other trans & non-binary people who are greatly troubled by it.

  not really, no. everyone gossips to some extent, whether they realize it or not. i think it borderlines on ""bad"" behavior when you're gossiping about a person to the point where you're spreading harmful or toxic rhetoric about a person that simply isn't true, because that's slander at that point.

   What is your opinion on the New Texas abortion law about the death penalty?
  ","
  it isn't a law, it was just a proposed bill that doesn't seem like it's going to go anywhere (whew!). in short, the bill proposed that people should be charged with homicide if they get an abortion, which implies the death penalty in the state of texas.
  
  i'm pro-choice, so of course i disagree highly with the bill entirely. i believe that people have the right to get an abortion because a fetus is not viable outside of the womb until much, much later in pregnancy, and even people who have abortions after x amount of weeks only do so in dire medical emergencies. abortions should be covered, even if partially, under health insurance as well.

411174,"
   That sounds about right actually. Interesting though for sure! Thanks for being curious enough for the update! 

Seems gender non-conforming is far different from being Transgender to me. Gender non-conforming to me seems more like it's more of a social desire, please correct me if I'm wrong :p
  ","
  gender non-conforming, to my understanding, is just a synonym for people who are genderfluid, non-binary, transgender, etc etc. at least that's the way i've always personally seen it used.
  
  i don't think it has anything to do with social desires, otherwise someone would be labeled a ""transtrender"" -- or whatever the term is for someone who's pretending to be trans when really they're just not ascribing to gender stereotypes, lol.

  ","
  i actually just did a quick google search on gender dysphoria, and i was slightly wrong -- what they *did* remove upon the release of the DSM-5 was ""gender identity disorder"" and replaced it with ""gender dysphoria,"" basically because they're portraying that being gender non-conforming isn't a disorder in itself. however, gender dysphoria is described as feelings of significant distress associated with gender, and the distress someone feels *is* disordered.
  "
411179,"
   Technically he's not wrong. I'm Trans, and to be going through transition you kind of need to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria which is a form of mental illness. Besides that most Trans suffer from other mental illnesses as well because of that, like myself with depression. I agree with you tootho

   Do you think someone is transphobic if they don't believe in multiple genders and think trans people are mentally ill but still use their pronouns and don't harass them about it?
  ","
  this doesn't make much sense to me because if someone didn't believe in a gender spectrum, then they probably wouldn't use a trans person's correct pronouns. if they did use a person's correct pronouns and was conscious that the trans person went by those pronouns, then that indicates a greater respect for that individual than previously thought.
  
  i think it is transphobic for people to think that being trans is a mental illness, though. there's no correlation between having a mental illness and being trans.

   In your relationships/past relationships what is considered as cheating to you? Do you think everyone needs to decide in their own relationship what is cheating or do you think there's a universal list that everyone in a relationship must abide by? If you think there's a list, what is it?
  ","
  i'm in a monogamous relationship, so cheating (in my own personal opinion and based on my own ideologies) would perhaps be if my partner went behind my back and developed a romantic or sexual relationship with another person -- without telling me, or asking me, about it first. i'm at the stage of my life where i'm comfortable and secure in my relationship, and if i wasn't satisfying my partner on a sexual level, for example, then i would be perfectly fine if he went out and sought that satisfaction elsewhere, as long as him and i communicated extensively about the excursion first and he still returned to me and respected me as his partner.
  
  every relationship is different though, there are open and polyamorous relationships as well as monogamous relationships. what constitutes as ""cheating"" depends entirely on the couple themselves, and some people may have more tolerance than others.

  depends entirely on the tattoo itself. you would have to see a tattoo artist for a consultation to decide what the best course of action is.

   Does your city or area have any annual huge events?
  ","
  my city personally doesn't, but there are always big events happening either on the island or in new york city. recently, there was a tattoo convention in queens this past weekend that i wanted to attend, but didn't feel like commuting out there. there are also plenty of other conventions, such as new york comic-con.

  new york city is a tourist attraction in itself, but there isn't much on long island with respect to tourism besides wine country & montauk point. there are also the hamptons, but i don't know any tourist who would want to willingly visit the hamptons unless they had a significant amount of money to spend.
  "
411383,"

411384,"

  my region has issues with crime in general, and most of it has to do with MS-13 and other gang-related crimes. my town in particular has gone downhill in the past 10 years with frequent armed robberies at banks, drug stores, 7-11s, etc etc.
  "
411385,"
   Does your city or area have a traffic problem?

  LOL, yes. the entire island is congested with people, so there's traffic literally everywhere. tie that into the fact that most people have road rage and believe they're entitled to the entire highway, and it makes for a wonderful commute.

  ","
  i have two instances ;
  
  -- in 2010, i took a road trip with my former roommate & friend to burlington, vermont. we left massachusetts and drove for what i think was around 8-10 hours through the mountains and greenery of vermont, which was absolutely beautiful. we also stopped at basically every scenic overpass to take photos.
  
  -- in 2013 or 2014 (i don't remember), i took a road trip to upstate new york with my boyfriend and his best friend. it was a lot of fun being in the car with them because they're hilarious together, and the scenery was also beautiful going into the mountains as well.

   Driving Spam: What is your opinion about tailgating? Do you tailgate other vehicles?

  i think tailgating is dangerous and should be avoided at all costs. if you have to brake suddenly, the person tailgating you could slam into the back of your car because they weren't allowing enough space between the cars.
  
  it's one of the things that angers me on the road actually, lol. i'll see people tailgating me and it automatically makes me question their intentions, whether they're purposely trying to f*ck with me or not. i usually switch over to another lane.

  no, it isn't selfish. you cannot force yourself to love someone, and if you're having doubts about your relationship, you cannot ignore those signs. you shouldn't settle for someone because you feel obligated to be with them, and as much as ending things with him will hurt, you do deserve to be content in your relationships.

  ""insanity"" is perhaps the wrong word to use in this context, because mental illness is particularly manifested as a result of both environmental factors and genetic predispositions, as well as the abundance or lack thereof of certain chemicals in the brain.
  
  anger/rage is a natural human emotion which occurs moreso in some individuals than others, and i also believe that emotion is influenced by both a person's upbringing and their genetics. some people are more quick to anger than others.

  that seems a bit odd. unless your friend is strapped for money and desperately needs it, i don't really see a reason why she would ask you to pay back for the plate you broke -- unless it was a really expensive plate or something.
  
  do you know how much she's asking for ?? depending on how much it is, i may pay her back just to keep the friendship amicable. however, if the plate is super expensive, i would question why she suddenly wants you to pay for it. especially if you're low on cash too.

  it frustrates me when people talk over me when i'm in the middle of speaking, or they respond to what i'm saying with something that's completely irrelevant to the conversation (showing that they probably weren't even listening). i find that a lot of people talk just to hear themselves speak or revert the conversation so that they can talk about themselves, instead of listening and responding to what's actually being discussed.

  yes, i'm currently experiencing this now at my job. the administrator of one of the programs my company offers went on maternity leave, so she elected me to take over her program while she's gone for three months. i received little training because it was on such short notice, so i was basically thrown into the program and suddenly found myself responsible for making major decisions that i was previously unaware of.
  
  i'm slowly getting used to it, since it's been a week since i officially took over the program, but it's still overwhelming to me and i have to take it hour-by-hour in order to not stress myself out more.

  the wine tasting event was wonderful -- we got to look at all of the fish at night when the aquarium was closed, and there were at least 20 different vineyard vendors offering free samples of wine. there was also live music and a big buffet upstairs of different crackers, cheese, and spreads.

   what's your feelings towards queerbaiting?
  ","
  i had to google this term to find out what it meant because i've never heard of ""queerbaiting"" before. for those who don't know, it basically means situations where producers of fictional stories hint at, but don't explicitly portray, a same sex relationship, normally in an effort to appeal to the lgbtq+ community without actually writing lgbtq+ characters.
  
  with that in mind, i think it's wrong. it's detrimental to the lgbtq+ community because they're basically regarded as an after-thought, instead of a character being explicitly written as a lgbtq+ character from the very start. it reminds me of what jk rowling has been doing these past few years, stating that some characters are actually gay, even though she never wrote those characters like that to begin with.

  that makes no sense that she wasn't called out by fans for pretending to be pregnant as a ""joke."" she's at fault just as much as justin beiber is, and she shouldn't be exempt from criticism for any reason. i honestly have no idea why fans weren't critical of her like they were of justin beiber.

   Many people say that they fear the dark, bit all of a sudden aren't afraid when they're given night vision eyewear although they're still in the dark so with that in mind what do you think people are more afraid of.... The dark or the inability to see what surrounds them or something else?
  ","
  i think people are more afraid of the inability to perceive threats in the darkness. when you're wearing night vision eyewear, although you're technically in darkness, you can still see your surroundings and can correctly perceive disturbances around you. without that ability to see, you're basically traversing your surroundings completely blind and cannot be alert to what's around you.

   Are you one to bottle up your feelings or to express them openly? Give an example of when you think it's okay to do the opposite.
  ","
  it depends on what sort of emotion i'm feeling, and what happened in my life to prompt that feeling. i generally express my feelings openly, particularly to my boyfriend, but there are some things i bottle up because they're too shameful or concerning for me to express them without him becoming alarmed or concerned for my well being.

   What's the creepiest, strangest or darkest story you were told as a child?
  ","
  when i was in high school, i had this one friend who swore that she attracted spirits wherever she went, and she visited a children's graveyard and ended up being followed by the spirit of a young child who wouldn't leave her side. it got to the point where my friend claimed that the spirit followed her to school, and on the bus ride home, my friend would be bouncing the spirit on her knee or rocking it in her arms. it was just bizarre.

  there have also been instances at my boyfriend's house that were peculiar, after his mother passed away. things randomly flying off the counter, lights flickering even though the electrical was fine, the dogs howling at night, etc etc.

  i always found the folklore behind ""ring a ring o' roses"" to be incredibly dark. the song is meant to be sung by children and is often taught to children from a young age, but allegedly one of the supposed meanings of the song dates back to the time of the black plague. a rash was one of the symptoms of the plague, and posies were herbs were carried as protection or to ward off the smell. eventually they would ""all fall down,"" which means that they passed away.

  no, not everyone deserves forgiveness, and you shouldn't feel obligated to forgive someone at any point in your life if they hurt you terribly. everyone has different experiences and levels of tolerance, and you shouldn't be shamed for not wanting to forgive someone who hurt you if other people have forgiven their abusers.

   What's the payoff for the gaslighter from your perspective?

  by gaslighting someone else, they believe it puts them in a position of power. because they may feel powerless in some aspects of their lives, they turn to manipulative tactics against others in an effort to exert control over them so that they feel powerful in one facet of their lives.
  
  most gaslighters don't actually believe that their behavior is wrong, though. it sometimes is an innate quality about them that they've exhibited their entire lives.

   Can you still like an artist if that artist has done really bad things?

  obviously you have the capability to do so, but you realistically should take their behavior into consideration when liking the artist or endorsing their products/music/etc etc. by ignoring their behavior when you continue to buy their products or listen to their music, you're essentially implying that you care more about materialism than what they've done to hurt someone else.

  i have a tendency to hold grudges sometimes, yeah. someone really has to anger me or hurt me in order for me to actually hold a grudge against them, though. my behavior is nevertheless a lot better now than it was in the past. i've learned to let things go for the most part.

  if you're dating someone and you're curious about their sexual past, then i believe that it's warranted to ask them when you're both comfortable enough to discuss that topic.
  "

  yeah, i agree. i normally don't either, especially if they just randomly post their opinion in my inbox without something prompting it first. i normally just delete them. people aren't willing to have civil discussions about different perspectives, especially if they're convinced that they're right and everyone else is wrong.

  ","
  racism is a form of oppression that's based upon historical evidence. it's geared toward people of color in general, and white people cannot be oppressed because they've always been in a position of power. that's why white people don't experience racism. it's systemic oppression.
  
  however, white people do face individual instances of discrimination based on their race. discrimination isn't rooted in oppression. it's simply a mindset.

   thoughts on love, relationship and marriage?
  ","
  everyone has a different perception of love & what a relationship should entail. likewise, marriage is not a necessity and people should not feel obligated to get married. these days, people are more likely to experiment and push off marriage until they're absolutely certain they want to marry their partner, and a lot of people are also emphasizing their careers instead of relationships, marriage, or starting a family.

  strangers talking to me randomly is creepy to me. when people get too close when they're talking to you, or even just in general. certain questions people ask or statements they've made can be creepy. i also usually get vibes off of people at times which makes me wary of them.
  "

   What does friendship mean to you? What should your friend be like? Do you have a lot of friends? What could be your reasons for discontinuing friendship with a person?

  ideally, friends should be loyal to your friendship, not sugarcoat the truth to you, and push you to be the best version of yourself you can be. i only have a handful of friends, but i prefer it that way. i would rather have a few close friends than a lot of acquaintances.
  
  i normally discontinue friendships if they're toxic to my well being or they irritate me more than they bring me joy.

  "
411723,"
   ""Your grades don't define your intelligence."" Do you agree with it? Why?
  ","
  i agree with this statement. most tests are standardized and don't take into account students' various methods of learning. some students are just inept at taking exams, and their understanding of the material is more hands-on than anything else. someone can be intelligent without being good at a conventional school because there are multiple forms of intelligence as well.
  "
411724,"
   how much pain,
                             you can take in?
  ","
  i'm emotionally strong, but that's because i spent the majority of my life living in not so ideal situations and i was forced to become accustomed to dealing with emotional pain. because of that, i can handle emotional pain far better than physical pain.
  
  that being said, i'm extremely sensitive on a physical scale and i cannot handle much physical pain at all. sometimes my boyfriend holds me too tightly and it ends up hurting me for hours afterwards (obviously that wasn't his intention). my body is just very sensitive to pain for some reason.
  "

   if there are two doors, by which you can go to your past and another one for going to future. No coming back. Which door will you choose and why, what will you do after going there?
  ","
  if i was allowed a third option, i would choose not to go through either door. it's useless to live in the past because you cannot change what has happened to you, and the most you can do is learn from your experiences and utilize them to make your present moments and future brighter. at the same time, however, living in the future takes away from the present moment because the future could change at any point. the future isn't guaranteed either.
  
  i would rather stay where i am now, because i've come to terms with my past and i'll deal with the future as it comes to me.
  "
411727,"
   What movie can you quote word for word?
  ","
  i don't think there's any movie i can quote word-for-word at the moment, sadly. i don't watch movies very often at all. although when i was much younger, i used to be able to quote harry potter & the sorcerer's stone word-for-word because i had seen it so often.
  "
411728,"
   Are you more ""right brain"" or ""left brain""
  ","
  i'm definitely more ""right brain"" -- i'm much more creative/artistic than analytical, and i always enjoyed the arts more than the sciences. i have a natural ability for writing and painting, and while i also used to understand mathematics and other technical concepts well, the arts just came easily to me.

  i don't have an ""evil"" inner voice, but i do have a portion of me that's extremely self-deprecating, toxic, and hurtful. regardless of how much mental health treatment i've gone through, i think that side of myself will always somewhat exist -- it's just a matter of how i combat those thoughts and rise above my impulses.
  
  lately i haven't been dealing with them well at all, but i'm trying to build myself from the ground up with the support of my boyfriend and therapist.

  "
411745,"
   What are your thoughts about people who are unwilling to post any pics at all of themselves on this site? Do you think they perceive themselves as unattractive? Does it make you suspicious of them?
  ","
  i don't think it's inherently right to make assumptions about a person's self esteem solely because they choose not to post photos of themselves on askfm. their unwillingness to post photos could mean a plethora of things, whether that's because they *are* self conscious, or because they simply want to maintain their own privacy.
  
  it doesn't make me suspicious of anyone, no. fake accounts are pretty easy to discover because usually they *do* post photos, except it's obviously not of themselves. that's a lot different than finding a person on askfm who simply is uncomfortable posting a selfie.
  "
411746,"
   Do you think that most of people always partner the wrong person and only few gets to end with the right one?
  ","
  i don't believe so, no. it's a lot more common these days to see people splitting with their partner in pursuit of someone who suits them better, rather than couples who stay together even though they're unhappy. in general, there's a lot more conversation regarding what's a healthy versus unhealthy relationship, which i think is really good.

  in most cases, no. there's no reason why you can't talk to your partner and let them know why you're unhappy, and either try to fix the relationship or break up. the only exception that i can think of would be if someone was in an abvsive relationship and started dating someone else in an attempt to escape from that situation.

  every relationship has boundaries that shouldn't be crossed, and it varies from couple to couple. everyone should ideally be able to do what they want -- within reason -- as long as it doesn't hurt the relationship or their partner. what's hurtful to others varies wildly, so it goes on an individualized basis.

  "
411774,"
   Why is the past so hard to forgive in your opinion?
  ","
  i think the past may be difficult to forgive because there isn't anything we can do to change it. we may wish that things were different, but nevertheless, the past is concrete and the most we can do is accept the past and move on in spite of it. some people have problems forgiving their past because they still feel regret over what they said or did.
  "
411775,"
   What makes you sure God isn't real?
  ","
  i don't believe in god because there isn't any scientific evidence to prove that god actually exists. all religions are based upon a matter of faith -- having faith that something or someone exists, regardless of the lack of or abundance of evidence that says otherwise.
  
  i've never believed in god, even as a child (from what i can remember). i was raised in a religious household and attended religion classes, but after i was confirmed, i basically told my parents i didn't believe in god and wanted nothing to do with the church anymore.

   Why people treat others differently? That’s sad, I tried to change one of my friends but they think they are superior.
  ","
  you can't change people's points of view, unfortunately. the most you can do is sit them down and point out that their way of thinking is inherently wrong and hurtful, and it's ultimately up to them to take that into consideration and do critical thinking about their own thoughts and feelings.
  
  a lot of racism is rooted in family values, so when someone grows up in a racist home, they will likely grow up to be racist just like their family. it takes effort and freedom of thought for these people to understand that the way they were raised was wrong.

  my friends aren't racist, no. if they were racist, then i wouldn't be friends with them.
  
  someone who is racist judges people negatively based on the fact that they're black, spanish, asian, native american, etc etc. they fall into false stereotypes and treat people of different races as inferior to them.

  depends on what the thoughts are, as well as what context they're in -- whether you're thinking in a positive, negative, or neutral light. sometimes overthinking can be good in a sense because you're attacking a situation from all angles and coming to a logical conclusion. however, overthinking is generally bad when you're degrading yourself or other people and promoting negative thought patterns.

  "
411841,"
   What u do to fresh ur mood ??
  ","
  the best thing for me to do to alleviate a bad mood is to talk about my feelings with someone else and come to a general understanding of why i feel that way and decide on what to do in order to feel better. communication fosters healing, so i usually try to seek out private conversation with a close friend or my boyfriend when i'm not feeling so great mentally.

  the most irritating thing to me personally is when someone hovers and watches me while i work -- it really gets under my skin and i feel like they're just waiting for me to make a mistake, or they're otherwise judging me. it's too much pressure and i would rather be left alone to get my work done correctly.

  i only got interested in music when i was a pre-teen, and at that point in time, my favorite musicians were linkin park, evanescence, eminem, avril lavigne, sum 41, green day, etc etc. then i started getting more into older alternative rock music, and i began listening to stone temple pilots, alice in chains, pearl jam, audioslave, soundgarden, and others.
  
  my taste today is basically the same, but a lot more diverse. i listen to the same alternative rock music from the 1990s and early 2000s, but i also like newer rock music, such as grandson. i also like poppier musicians, i.e. matt maeson and hozier. at the same time, i'm also really into hip hop (watsky and grieves, for example). when i'm writing, i additionally listen to classical soundtracks for video games.

  i was proud of myself for getting through last week without calling out of work or leaving early, especially considering how overwhelmed i was with learning new tasks in a short period of time. sometimes my anxiety gets the best of me and i panic, which causes me to not be able to focus on anything at all. however, despite being overwhelmed, i was able to control my anxiety for the most part and get through the day.

  ","
  it depends on the situation. because in that case, then most people would be seen as selfish since a lot of the things people do and buy negatively impact animals and the environment. but if you're taking the right steps to lessen your imprint, then that's not selfish at all.

  i'm not close to many people, so if one of my friends hurt me without really knowing that they did, i would let them know that their words/actions were hurtful in a polite way and advise them not to do it again.
  
  it's kinda difficult to really determine whether something was done accidentally or on purpose, though. i have a small circle so i've never had any issues with my current friends, so i would hope that they wouldn't turn around and purposely hurt me.

  everyone is judgmental to a certain degree, i believe. i try to remain unbiased until i know a person, though. it's difficult to break out of that habit of judging someone without knowing them, since we all do it from a young age, but it becomes easier after you recognize that everyone has different experiences and you cannot know a person solely from looking at them.

   opinion on western feminism?
  ","
  i think western feminism, particularly this new wave of feminism that has emerged over the past few years, focuses on insignificant issues that doesn't implement real change in regards to women's rights. in addition, western feminism focuses solely on the issues that mainly affect white women instead of broadening their advocacy for other people of color, especially in war-torn and developing nations.
  
  i'm all for traditional feminism, and i respect the original individuals who advocated for feminism back in the 1960s and 1970s. but western feminism these days has largely been a joke and gives feminism overall a bad name.

   What do you think about South Carolina law against sagging pants?

  i honestly had no idea this was even a thing until you sent me this question, LOL. either way, i think it's silly. legislators should be focusing more on other means of reform regarding taxes, education, the prison system, etc etc., instead of worrying about people who wear saggy pants.
  
  the whole saggy pants trend originated in the prison system, where people would wear their pants low since belts were confiscated in the institution. since then, it's been associated with hip hop culture, although i'm not really sure where the transition occurred. i don't personally see the point in wearing pants that sag if you obviously own a belt, but to each their own.

  yes, i do find it difficult to open up to people. i don't trust anyone from meeting them for the first time, and it usually takes a while for me to warm up to a person until i believe i can trust them (if i can at all). however, once i feel comfortable around that person, i'm basically an open book.

  ","
  driving makes me the most nervous. you simply never know when you're going to get into an accident or have car troubles, and you don't know how other people are feeling on the road. you could easily get involved in an issue with another driver if they're feeling road rage.

   When someone tells you they like you more than a friend but then kinda avoids you and stands not talking to you for weeks. Does that mean they weren’t being honest and everything they said was a lie? What do you think about this?

  i don't think that someone would lie about something like that and then proceed to ignore you. i think what happened in this circumstance means that they likely felt embarrassed by telling you their feelings and are avoiding you because they don't want to embarrass themselves further.

  no, they're videos that trigger an ""autonomous sensory meridian response"" (ASMR). sounds and images that trigger such a response gives you a tingling sensation that starts with your head and travels downward, and it's supposed to relax you.

   (sorry, 6 didn't send properly!) Do you want to raise children? If so, why is that? If not, please explain. Do you think it's socially responsible to have children in an overpopulated world? Should people adopt/foster before having biological kids? Should you have a pet before having kids? (Spam 6)
  ","
  i'm not sure if i want to have children or not. it's something i'm constantly going back and forth with, which is probably an indication that i *shouldn't* have children.
  
  i don't believe the world is overpopulated, and people in general are free to have as many children as they would like -- granted, of course, they provide their children with a loving and healthy environment. i also believe in the importance of adopting and fostering children because there are so many kids, especially teenagers, who are in the system and they also deserve loving homes.

  i was an academic student when i was younger, so i learned best through lectures, including physical representations of subjects such as powerpoint presentations. i learned best through both listening, reading, and writing, and i often copied over my own notes multiple times to better understand the material.

  ","
  i think the increase in the use of technology among children is detrimental to their development, and i'm not entirely sure but i also think there are studies conducted on this topic too which reached the same conclusion (don't quote me on that, though). i think limiting screen time is important because it teaches children from a young age to become dependent on technology, instead of doing things that encourage personal growth such as reading, playing outside, and practicing hobbies and sports.

   Do you feel that people in today's society are facing a higher incidence of stress/anxiety/mental illness or is it just that we are more aware and better at documenting the effects of mental illness? Have you seen this in your own circles? What about your parents' circles?(Spam 3)
  ","
  i believe that society in general is just more cognizant of mental health problems in general thanks to the decrease in stigma, as well as increase in mental health professionals and scientific studies pertaining to mental illnesses. in the past, people who exhibited mental illness symptoms were deemed ""crazy"" and were locked away at an institution, while today there are more options for treatment and a general understanding.
  
  a lot of the people i know IRL have some degree of mental illness due to how prevalent it is. not everyone, of course, but i would say most of the people i interact with have had experienced mental illness either first hand or through someone they also know.

  i know i mentioned it on here once before, but i'm so sick of my psychiatrist not responding to me in a timely manner, and ultimately, making me skip days of my medication because she doesn't refill my prescriptions on time. last month, my anxiety medication was on back order & the pharmacy needed her permission to switch me to a different number of mgs, and i called my psychiatrist at least 4 times within 5 days before she put the authorization through. in that span of time, i ran out of medication and had a panic attack at work.
  
  after that got ""sorted out,"" here i am one month later and i need another refill on the same prescription. even though i only see my psychiatrist every 90 days, she only authorized a 30-day refill. last week, i called the pharmacy to refill the prescription, and the next day, i received a call that my psychiatrist did not authorize the refill. i called her office three times -- twice it went straight to voicemail, and the third time i spoke to someone, but not my psychiatrist. i explained to them that i needed a refill ASAP, but so far i haven't received any notification from my pharmacy. that was yesterday afternoon.
  
  if this script doesn't get refilled by tomorrow, i'm going to run out of medication AGAIN and deal with everything all over like i did last month. i'm so done with this doctor. after this gets sorted out, i'm calling the office and changing providers because this is ridiculous.

   qotd: what are some of your favourite songs/musicians from last century? what is your favourite decade for music?
  ","
  my favorite decade for music is probably 1990s alternative rock. bands like stone temple pilots, pearl jam, tool, soundgarden, nine inch nails, etc etc. STP was my all-time favorite band for an extremely long time, so naturally i was mortified when scott weiland passed away (as well as chris cornell from soundgarden, RIP).
  
  however, my taste in music is so vast that it's difficult to really narrow down my favorite songs or musicians throughout the past century. i listen to alternative rock, classic rock, metal, hip hop, r&b, blues, jazz, pop, classical music, etc etc. while linkin park and STP are probably two of my all-time favorite bands, it has more to do with the memories associated with them than anything else. their music has never defined my musical taste, if that makes sense.

  however, my favorite memories with them both have included going to concerts with them and going on vacations with them. my best friend and i used to see concerts when we were teenagers, and we saw linkin park together like 2-3 times. in addition, her wedding back in 2017 was absolutely beautiful, and everyone had an amazing time.

412087,"
   Math is a subject of contention for many people, but do you think it gets a bad rap because of how it's taught or because of the subject matter? Do you think this goes for most subjects, that it's less of what it is and more of how it's taught that captures a student's attention/interest? (Spam 1)
  ","
  i think it has more to do with how it's taught -- if a teacher isn't passionate about the subject or patient with their students, then it's going to be more difficult for the students to learn and comprehend the material.
  
  and yeah, that goes for most other subjects as well. i don't think mathematics has a bad reputation at all because there are many students who are naturally good at math and understand the material easily. it isn't for everyone, though.

   I'm 19 and going through a bit of an identity crisis and I have no idea how to deal with that, I'm not content with being who I am right now or with who I've been in the past 6 years and it's awfully affecting me, I can't live normally because of that -1
  ","
  (cont) ...I think one of the reasons I'm like that is my appearance, I know it sounds stupid and you can't even imagine how embarrassed I'm to admit that, I'm ""average"" looking not ugly nor beautiful just..plain. And I think I'm not supposed to look like the way I look despite beauty or ugliness, when I see myself in the mirror it's like I don't know who that is I don't relate to that person, I doubt if that is body-dysmorphia cuz I know I'm normal there's nothing wrong with me physically. Another reason is that i stress too much about what people think of me i care too much about their opinions and image of me, so you probably know that I hate socializing even if I did socialize I'd get anxious because I'd think to myself that I'm below them and not as good. And this resulted in so much bad stuff, I don't have any friends or a social circle cuz I drive people away from me cuz I don't even like myself, I have no idea what I wanna be or who I am or how to act cuz im lost and u don't feel like a whole person. I don't know how long this going to last I looked up how to get over identity crisis and came with nothing... I also have OCD I either do things perfectly or don't do them at all, I guess this is why I'm like that, I wanna be perfect from all aspects or be nothing. I'm gonna go crazy from overthinking, and going to a shrink is not an option unfortunately.. even if I could I wouldn't go cuz I don't want the shrink to judge.. I'm actually sweating I don't want you to judge me either. I don't know if this is one of the reasons but I grew up in a dysfunctional family and I don't feel stable at all I just don't seem to act like a person...please do ignore all of this if you want to♡, I know my problems aren't real problems.
  
  --
  
  i'm sorry you're feeling this way, and your problems *are* real problems in your own life, and that makes them just as valid as anyone else's problems. not knowing your own identity when you're a young adult is extremely common, and you're not alone in the way you feel. transitioning from a teenager to an adult is difficult, but as time goes on, you'll experience more things and get a better feel for who you are and your relation to the rest of the world.
  
  your home life could have an effect on the way you're feeling, but i don't know you or your life, so obviously i can't say for certain. either way, what you're feeling is common and normal, and sometimes it's best to take things one step at a time instead of looking at the larger picture. and if you're unhappy with your appearance, perhaps try changing things up a bit -- a haircut or hair color change, different wardrobe, etc etc.

  there are places, like saunas, in europe where the changing rooms are mixed gender, which makes sense considering how people use saunas, lol. but those are reserved for adults, so that's perfectly fine. everyone knows what the human body looks like.
  
  i think it's different when children are involved because you don't want strangers seeing them in that context, so it would make more sense accompanying them to the room that corresponds with their sex.

  personally speaking, i wouldn't feel comfortable sending questions out to someone who's openly transphobic, racist, sexist, homophobic, etc etc. i would feel as if i'm endorsing those qualities about that person and it wouldn't sit right with me.

  ","
  i'm pretty neutral on this question because i believe it could go either way depending on the individual. a lot of proverbs are relatively commonplace and universally known, so it wouldn't really make someone more intelligent for knowing those proverbs or understanding what they mean. at the same time, however, it also doesn't make someone less intelligent because their knowledge of the proverb could be an indication of their opinion, just in a metaphor-like manner.

412243,"

  ","
  even though she's not a minor, it's still p*dophilic in nature considering the large age gap between the girl and the older man. also, you can't tell how old someone is just by looking at them and there's a good chance that the older man believes that she's a minor. cases of p*dophilia aren't one-time acts, they're recurrent in nature and guaranteed he has tried to do this before to similar-aged girls.

  not really, no. my circle of friends is quite small though, lol. i only really hang out with three people excluding my boyfriend, and two of them i don't see very often at all.
  
  regardless, we've always had the same vibe regarding the same people and if someone dislikes someone else, then usually that feeling will carry over.

  i think one of the most pressing issues is the topic of white supremacy. there have been so many tragedies done by the hands of white supremacists and nothing is being done to stop them, government-wise at the very least. racism is becoming more and more prevalent these days (or at least racists are being given the validation they desire for being racist), and there are still a lot of people who see nothing wrong with it.

  depends on the context of the relationship. i'm in a monogamous relationship, so if he had sxxual relations with other people, then he would be cheating on me. however, if we were in a polyamorous relationship, then i wouldn't see a problem with him being with other people at all.
  
  it's only possessive if you're controlling your partner and dictating what they should and should not do. whether that's in terms of their friends or their career or anything in between.
  "
412283,"
   Are you possessive of your boyfriend?
  ","
  no, not really. he has his own life, just like i have my own life. he sees his friends while i see my own friends, and there's nothing wrong with that. i trust him wholeheartedly and i know if he was unhappy with our relationship then he would talk to me about it first before doing anything else.

  she probably wasn't angry with you, although obviously i don't know the exact situation and can't say for certain. if she still seems angry now, even though it's been quite a few days, then perhaps you should talk to her about it -- ask her what you did wrong and how you can better the situation.

  no, society needs to get down to the root of the problem which is gun control. i don't know what new zealand's gun laws are like, but at least in the united states and other places with lax gun laws, it should be much harder for people to obtain a gun in the first place.

   Unpopular opinion?
  ","
  individuals shouldn't be praised for being lgbtq+ allies.
  
  i recently saw a post on facebook questioning whether people should be rewarded for being allies to the lgbtq+ community, and i thought it was ridiculous because you shouldn't be praised for being a normal, decent human being. it's common sense to support people of different genders and s*xual orientations, and to go to far as to induct cis, straight allies into queer ceremonies is pointless.

  however, the whole idea of him being around children has never sat well with me, even prior to this new documentary that just came out. i always found it alarming how he would invite children to his house and have sleepovers with him because i've always considered that ped*philic behavior.

  "
412341,"
   Does your work ask why a person is calling out?? My work doesn't even ask so is she lying just to lie??
  ","
  my job requires a reason, but they're fairly lenient as long as you're not calling out *too* often (i.e. at least 3 times per month or so).
  
  she's lying, at least in my opinion, because she wants to look good in upper management's eyes. she's already the ""favorite"" of the CEO of the company and she doesn't want to ruin that, so she makes up bullsh*t excuses that seem more than valid instead of letting it be known that she's probably calling out just because she doesn't want to be there.

   What's your passion?
  ","
  my passion is writing !! i've loved writing for as long as i can remember, and it makes me incredibly happy when something i've written has helped someone else or made them think of the topic in a different light. i also enjoy emotional responses to my writing as well -- some of the stories i've written in the past have made people tear up because of how strongly they felt about the piece since it moved them so much.

   What was the last thing to make you roll your eyes??
  ","
  one of my coworkers has a really terrible habit of lying about a lot of things related to her actual work or why she called out sick. there was a big issue regarding the work she neglected to complete about a week ago, where she refused to do the longer assignments and only did the shorter ones to the point where my other coworker found things from october in her pile that she never finished.
  
  recently, my coworker who lies said that she left work early because her sister's appendix burst and she had to pick up her children from school, or something. however, i didn't believe that at all because of her habit of lying so much (last week, she called out sick because she had ""pink eye,"" but she never went to the doctor and came to work the next day and was fine). it made me roll my eyes.

   Which do you think is more important: following the dreams your parents want for you or following your own dreams?

  following your own dreams is more important, in my opinion. your life, your dreams and your goals are important, and you're your own individual above anything else. your parents should recognize that and understand that you should ideally pursue your own dreams because that is what will make you happy, and they shouldn't pressure you to follow *their* dreams simply because they perhaps couldn't follow through with them themselves.

  yes, there are often strong thunderstorms in my area actually. i don't feel compelled to learn more about meteorology, but i do find weather to be an interesting phenomenon -- especially things like thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc etc.

  i think it's wrong for a person to expect someone else to take care of them solely because they're lazy and don't want to work (assuming they're not disabled, at least).
  
  however, that honestly only really accounts for a small fraction of people who don't work. there are a lot of barriers to employment, such as difficulty finding positions, lack of transportation, disability, etc etc. also, not everyone *needs* to work either, which is evident in households where one partner may stay home while the other works and makes enough money for the two of them.

  ","
  no. if that was the case, then everyone with the same name would act similar.
  "
412455,"
   Are you afraid to be yourself among strangers?
  ","
  no, i've learned that it isn't worth it to be afraid to be yourself around other people. individuals who matter to you won't be bothered and will embrace who you are, while those who are bothered don't end up meaning anything to you anyway. i wouldn't want someone in my life who can't handle me for who i actually am.

   If you have an alexa or a similar device, what do you have it programmed to do? If not, do you want one?
  ","
  i don't have an alexa, but my father and my boyfriend do. idk what my father has been using it for besides setting alarms and hearing about the weather, but my boyfriend mainly uses it to listen to music.
  
  i don't personally want one, even though they're both obsessed with their devices, lol. i don't have a need for something like that.
  "
412457,"

  yeah, that's true. it only gets triggered when there's conflict in any of my relationships. although sometimes the most minor things can set the fear off.
  "
412458,"
   Would you rather day someone who's not on any social media and has no interest in it, someone who is on social media but only posts sporadically and mentions you once in a while, or someone who spends a lot of time on social media and posts frequently including posts with you in them. Why?
  ","
  someone's social media usage has no effect on whether or not i would date them, as long as their use isn't problematic in the relationship (i.e. not socializing with your partner, ignoring them for your phone, etc etc).
  
  i use social media a lot more than my boyfriend does, and it's never really been an issue. he browses occasionally, but he seldom posts things.
  "
412459,"
   If you found a hair in your drink/food/ice cream, what would you do? Eat it or throw it away?

  i agree with it somewhat -- it sorta entails the perspective that your thoughts toward yourself are what matter most of all, and if you believe you're attractive and have confidence, then it could take you far.

  i believe that the spirit and our own conscience are two separate entities. our conscience is what drives us in our current vessel, while our spirit transcends our bodily form and remains regardless of whether we're alive or dead. i believe that after our body dies, our spirit lives on and moves to a different medium because it's made out of energy.

  i just want to be able to live independently with my boyfriend and a few pets while maintaining a full time job to keep myself busy. that would probably make me the most happy and free, at this stage of my life. i'm currently tied down to my parents' house which holds a lot of terrible feelings and memories, and i think i'll flourish once i'm out of this toxic environment.

   For the Alabama proposal, if a parent tests positive for drugs, the parent can designate someone else to receive benefits on the child's behalf as long as that person is not using drugs. I guess this is a good thing but a lot of drug addicts lack support and many likely won't know someone who will b
  ","
  ah, your message got cut off. ://
  
  but i agree with you -- unfortunately a lot of addicts don't have adequate support both mentally and personally, so it would be difficult to find someone to designate as their child's guardian like that. even so, the idea of refusing someone their necessity to eat because they tested positive for drugs is so extreme.

   The state of Alabama is proposing a new law that would require people to pass a drug test in order to get food stamps. The state of Arkansas is proposing a bill to limit the amount of junk food that people with food stamps can buy. What do you think of these two proposals?
  ","
  i think alabama's food stamp proposal is ableist -- people still deserve to be able to eat regardless of their drug use, it's a necessity and to deny someone their need to eat goes against human rights. in addition, food stamps are also used for children of recipients and it's incredibly wrong to deny those children food too.
  
  as for arkansas' proposal, i also think that's a bit ridiculous. sometimes junk food is cheaper than healthier food, and people are allowed to enjoy things instead of being forced to buy certain foods just because they're not in a position where they can't afford to not be on food stamps.
  
  being on food stamps doesn't mean you're a lesser individual. and i think it's wild how there's such a stigma against those who need extra help, solely because the standard and cost of living is too high for most people to afford.

  i'll always recommend the hobbit by jrr tolkien if you haven't read it already. it's an easy read and it's fantasy, but it's very entertaining and a good introduction to the rest of the lord of the rings books.
  
  my all time favorite book is girl interrupted by susanna kaysen, which is also a pretty easy read. it's about a woman's experience with her own mental health as she lives in a psych hospital.
  
  stephen king's collections of short stories are great as well. if you're into thrillers, then i recommend the shining or cujo too, they're a bit more detailed than the previous books i mentioned but they keep you on the edge of your seat.

  i think it's sad that dark skinned people feel pressure to lighten their skin because of expectations from society, which is due in part to what i mentioned before about european features being seen as the ""most attractive.""

  regardless -- no, i don't agree with the statement. love can last years, decades even, as long as both people put in the work to allow the relationship to flourish and have effective communication to make things better.
  
  if you view your relationship as a habit, then that's an indication that you don't feel as deeply for your partner as you should and perhaps it's time to move on. you shouldn't stay in a relationship for the mere sake of being in a relationship.

  yeah, i recently came to that conclusion about a certain friend of mine. he only reaches out to my boyfriend and i when he needs something and never takes our opinions into consideration when we tell him that we're concerned about something he's doing. regardless of how often we've told him, he never acknowledges that he did something wrong.
  
  it's gotten to the point where telling him again isn't going to change anything, so we've been distancing ourselves from him.
  "
412604,"

412605,"
   Is anyone else like me, where i want to ask someone how they are or about a specific area in their life because they've mentioned it before BUT it seems like a ""personal"" subject (such as mental health, relationship issues etc) and you're not close so don't know if its seen as crossing a line?

412606,"
   Do you still paint/draw (I'm rubbish with anything arty)? Do you find that being creative in that manner, passes onto your creativity when matching outfits, interior design or is it purely with a physical canvass?

412610,"
   Social media - a great way to stay connected & communicate with people? Or is it a way for us to slowly isolate ourselves from human contact and become disconnected to emotions?
  ","
  i honestly believe it can be both. social media is a wonderful way to connect with like-minded individuals from across the globe and make friends, and it's often a useful means of communication and socialization for those who don't really do well in real life situations.
  
  however, at the same time, it has the potential to encourage real life isolation if a person spends *too* much time on social media.
  "
412611,"
   Are you able to be friends with someone who has very strong opposing views?
  ","
  i think it ultimately depends on what those views are. if someone is being willingly oppressive toward a group of people, i.e. if they're transphobic, ableist, homophobic, or racist, then i won't feel comfortable being friends with them because it directly discriminates against a group of people.
  
  however, if someone has varying political opinions from me, then i don't believe that's a big deal at all.

  nah, not really. however, i do think that most bits of information can be useful depending on the situation. even random facts about animals (i.e., a fish will only grow as big as the tank its in) can be useful to people who own animals or are in an industry where they deal with animals on a regular basis.

  i don't really have any ""guilty"" pleasures because i'm generally not ashamed of what i enjoy. however, i can't help but admit that ""thank you, next"" by ariana grande is seriously catchy. it's nowhere close to the type of music i listen to, but i really like it.

   If you could travel back in time, what decade would you visit?

  assuming that i can retain my current age while traveling back in time, i think i would want to visit the 1980s or 1990s because of the music. there are so many bands i would have loved to see perform live that don't exist anymore in today's age.

  happy saturday !!
  
  nothing is new with me at all. i'm just going about my normal saturday routine of ingesting gallons of coffee and working on some freelance assignments for my job. i woke up at 7am for some ungodly reason, so i've been making the most out of it.

  boots. i don't wear heels.

  ","
  i'm grateful for my best friend for sticking my me during my lowest points and being a source of unconditional love and support when my mental health was worsening. i'm also proud of her for persisting through her endeavors, both personal and professional, despite enduring several hardships along the way, ranging from chronic illness to death and everything in between. she's always been a source of inspiration for me.

   Qualities you’d like in your boyfriend/girlfriend?
Qualities you’d like in your husband/wife?
  ","
  i already have a boyfriend, so i'll just list his qualities that i like ;
  
  he's passionate about the things he cares about, he's incredibly hard working and will go above and beyond expectations, he's knowledgeable about a variety of things, he's very open and communicates his feelings well, he doesn't sugarcoat the truth and tells you how it is, he's creative and often paints and writes, he has a terrific taste in music, and we have the same sense of humor.
  "
412665,"
   What do you think of this new trend to believe the victims instead of the facts?
  ","
  i don't believe it's new, nor is it a trend. when it comes to things like abvse or assault, then you should believe the victims -- up until evidence comes out stating otherwise.
  
  if there's factual and scientific evidence proving the contrary, then obviously the victim was lying. but when there isn't evidence at all then it's right to think that the victim is telling the truth, especially considering the small fraction of people there are who are lying about abvse.
  "

  deciding to stick through with college, even though i was severely depressed at the time and wanted nothing more than to drop out. it's because of my college degree that i've been able to have these great job opportunities which have turned my life for the better lately -- they have provided a sense of routine and stability for me.

   Should regulated assisted s*icide be allowed legally and provided by healthcare professionals? Why/why not? If yes, do you think it should be allowed for anyone able to consent to it or only those who are terminally ill?

  i believe in assisted s*icide, but only in cases of terminally ill patients. i believe people should be given the right to die on their own terms in such cases, and it should also be regulated strictly on a case by case basis.
  

   @princess_tal
  
  also raised a good point about the mentally ill -- mental illness isn't a terminal diagnosis so i don't believe those with just mental illness should qualify for assisted s*icide.

   In the past, I often called a male teacher ""Miss"" or a female teacher ""Mr"". Have you ever messed up anyone's pronouns or prefixes accidentally? What are your pronouns? (I'm he)
  ","
  in the past, i accidentally would refer to people as their wrong pronouns because i simply wasn't aware of the importance of pronouns when i was much younger. in the same vein, i also try to signify the importance of prefixes, especially when speaking with clients. many of the clients who purchase products through my company are doctors, so it's important to be aware of their credentials.
  
  as for my own pronouns, i go by they/them.

  "
412682,"
   Do you feel bad for teens that never got to listen to the radio and have a tape recording it or burn their own cds?
  ","
  lol, no. i don't feel bad for teenagers who never experienced that.
  
  if anything, it's so much easier to listen to music now with all of the various streaming services, like apple music and spotify. and in most cases, it's also easier to find new artists as well. i think technology has really stepped up in terms of that because it's become so much easier to listen to and share music.
  "
412683,"
   Do you feel younger or older than your actual age?
  ","
  neither -- i feel like my actual age. when i was younger, i often felt older than my age because i was more mature than my peers. but these days, there isn't really much more maturity i can have considering i'm 27 years old.
  "
412684,"
   Why do you feel horrible?
  ","
  i've had a stomach ache and migraine all day, even though i felt fine when i woke up this morning. it got worse as time progressed so i ended up trying to sleep it off -- which actually somewhat helped, lol.
  "
412685,"
   Do you ever regret doing something nice to a friend when they don’t say thank you?
  ","
  sometimes, but i try not to regret actions like those. if i'm doing something nice for someone and they don't express gratitude, then that's a reflection of them, not me. the only thing i can do is continue being the best person i can be, and if someone doesn't appreciate that, then they don't deserve to be in my life.
  "
412686,"
   What do you feel when u do something right?
  ","
  pride, i suppose. i completed a batch of new orders at work last week for the first time (i.e. compiling them and sending them all to clients), and my supervisor said i did everything correctly, so that made me feel proud of myself.

  "
412690,"
   Favorite type of car?

  i'm not a fan of cars in general, so it doesn't much matter to me. as long as a car drives and is comfortable, then i don't care what make or model it is.
  "
412691,"

   When it comes to significant others sharing a bathroom, what's your opinion? Should someone be allowed to pee in the toilet while another is showering in the shower etc or is it all a big no-no?
  ","
  i don't personally see the problem with it. my boyfriend and i share the bathroom all the time.
  
  however, not everyone is going to obviously feel the same way. and it ultimately depends on each relationship and what works best for them.
  "
412693,"
   What's the most ridiculous thing anyone has ever tried to argue/fight with you about?
  ","
  on askfm in particular, some anons try to convince me that i'm a woman, even though they clearly don't know me at all or have gone through my experiences which have led me to determine that i'm non-binary.
  
  it's silly above all else. if i'm steadfast about something regarding myself then an anonymous stranger on the internet isn't going to lead me to believe otherwise.
  "
412694,"
   What's one of your own, personal beliefs that you don't think you'll ever change?

  i don't believe my stance will ever change on abortion. people have the right to decide what to do with their own bodies, and they deserve the freedom to choose what they want to do with an unwanted pregnancy.
  "
412695,"
   Is your life anything like it was two years ago?
  ","
  no, not at all. two years ago, i was severely depressed & svicidal, i was stuck in a job that made me cry nearly every day, and i was friends with people who didn't care about the friendship to the same degree that i did.
  
  since then, i've gotten professional treatment for my mental health, got a new job, and dropped old friends who didn't contribute to my life at all.

  no, i don't believe the dog should be euthanized. the child put a sock over his arm and stuck his arm beneath the fence. the dog didn't know that it was a human arm -- to his perspective, it looked exactly like a toy. in addition, the owners said it was his first bite incident, and normally the dog is incredibly docile.
  
  you can't blame an animal for acting on its instincts when confronted with a situation like that. it goes along the same lines as knowing not to annoy an animal, and teaching your children not to poke or prod or climb all over an animal.

   Do you think the reason why so many potential relationships fail is because people are still broken from previous relationships and are  not taking enough time out to heal inbetween?? ??

  i believe that may be a large component of it, yes. some people try to move on from previous relationships without completely getting over their ex, which may cause issues when pursuing new relationships. there's this comparison between their ex and their new date, and sometimes people unconsciously judge their new date based on how their ex would behave.

  yes, i work hard at my job. i don't allow myself to get distracted by the internet or my phone (i keep my phone on airplane mode while i'm working, actually). i've always been quick and efficient in my work, and now that i've been promoted to a program administrator, i've been keeping up to date with all of the emails and spreadsheets on a daily basis.

   Rape happens mostly because of porn?
  ","
  no, but p*rn puts forth unrealistic notions of sexual relationships, and a lot of content is violent which only encourages budding r*pists to act out on their desires.
  
  technically, r*pe is about power and dominance.

412801,"
   Okay so you don’t watch porn anymore because of the fact there are so many danger

  i stopped watching p*rn long before i understood the reality of the sex industry. it wasn't the reason why i stopped, but it helped me develop a greater understanding of why a lot of people are against it overall.
  "
412802,"
   Did it strengthen your relationship after having sex? Did it work for you?

  yes, it did for me personally because sex is somewhat important to my relationship. it created a deeper feeling of comfort and intimacy.

412803,"

  ","
  yeah, i do believe that most people only care about themselves and their loved ones. obviously there are people who exist who are passionate about humanity as a whole and are willing to help anyone in need, but i honestly do believe that a majority of individuals only genuinely care about themselves and those close to them.

  there's a lot of danger involved in the sex industry, from human trafficking to unreported cases of r*pe and everything in between. you can easily google this information, there are quite a few resources available with statistics and whatnot.

   I need your help, I have a girlfriend. We both are 18 and we are dating for 3 years. I haven’t asked her for sex but do you think sex reinforces the relationship to better out and understand each other well?
  ","
  it depends entirely on the relationship itself. some people value sex while others don't -- everyone is different and you have to experiment with your own relationship to see what works best for you.
  
  in some cases, sex is important so those people value the act and it makes their relationship stronger. however that isn't the case for everyone.
  "
412807,"

  i think i watched p*rn for the first time when i was 10 or 11 years old. it wasn't problematic for me at the time because i simply didn't know better. i only learned about the dangers and implications of the industry recently within the past few years.
  "
412808,"
   Do you regret having sex with your boyfriend?
  ","
  not at all. if it was something i regretted, then i would seriously have to reconsider the relationship. if i were to regret something like having sxx with him, then it might indicate that my feelings towards him aren't as strong as i think they are.

  "
412810,"
   What do you think about porn? Should it be banned or should there be serious consequences against it?
  ","
  i don't like the idea of p*rn because of the implications regarding sxx trafficking and the high rate of r*pe that occurs in the sxx industry in general. also, p*rn perpetuates unrealistic standards and practices that are unhealthy for relationships.
  
  it would be impossible to ban it completely, but i do believe there should be some sort of regulation involved.

  the past wasn't so great, and i don't really envision the future being great either (depending on how the next election goes). i suppose it would depend on if i'm being reborn as myself or someone else entirely.

  sure, it definitely could be. they've dodged every attempt at death that happens during life, as it can occur at any moment.
  "
412982,"
   Is it gross to brush your teeth in the kitchen sink?

  i don't personally think so. it's a sink regardless, and as long as you're brushing your teeth, it doesn't really matter where it happens.
  "

   I was watching a documentary about how ""regular people"" became drug addicts because their doctors prescribed them opioid pain killers. Is it a widespread issue?

  yeah, it's close to an epidemic, at least in the united states. painkillers are so easily gotten and easily addictive.

   how do you see your financial future in your field of work ? do you see yourself making it to the highest position in your job ? or are you planning something completely different?
  ","
  i don't think i would want the highest position in my current job because to be in charge of an entire publishing company seems incredibly daunting. i just got a promotion where i'm the sole person in charge of a specific program, so right now, i'm happy with where i am. if there's something else that catches my eye that i would want to pursue, or if another opportunity presents itself to me, then i would also take that into consideration.
  
  as for the financial aspect of my job, i don't really think people make a *lot* of money in my field unless they're in some higher-up corporate position, which is why i feel sorta stuck at the moment.
  "
412999,"
   What age could you see yourself having a child and how many can you see yourself having (if any)
  ","
  honestly, i don't know if i want children. i've never have a parental instinct and i don't know how to behave around children (i.e. i never know what to talk to them about, haha), and it always makes me feel so awkward.
  
  if i *did* end up having a child, i don't know if those instincts would miraculously appear. i know it's possible since people form an automatic bond with their children during pregnancy and at birth, but it isn't something guaranteed for me and it scares me sometimes.
  "
413000,"
   do you think you are wife material?
  ","
  everyone is ""wife"" material, lol. you don't have to act or behave a certain way in order to be someone's spouse. the only thing you have to do is love someone unconditionally while maintaining consistency in the distribution of household chores and parenting with your spouse, which isn't dependent on gender.
  "
413001,"

   it isn’t worth to discuss anything with you bc you don’t use your brain. you literally follow what the feminists on ask say
  ","
  there are no feminists on askfm anymore, lol. regardless, i always took what the former feminists on askfm said into consideration before creating my own opinions, but i didn't allow their opinions to rule my own thoughts. contrary to what you believe, most of my opinions are rooted in some sort of factual basis.

   Do u know someone who watched degrassi
  ","
  this basically defines my entire childhood, haha. nearly everyone i know in my age group watched degrassi. i saw a few episodes when i was younger, but i wasn't obsessed with the show or anything.
  "
413008,"
   lmao go to the gym the fat is getting to your brain
  ","
  this is a prime example of the whole ""bashing other people for their opinions because they have inner turmoil"" that i just talked about. instead of criticizing my weight, which has nothing to do with my opinions, perhaps you should take a critical look at yourself and discover why you feel the need to lash out at a stranger anonymously on the internet.
  "
413009,"
   so do you admit you’re wrong about all this gender crap?
  ","
  no, because my opinions aren't simply opinions -- they're supported by factual evidence from scientists, psychologists, anthropologists, etc etc. if it was simply an opinion and not based in any sort of physical or scientific evidence, then perhaps i would reconsider my opinions. however, that isn't the case when it comes to gender identity.
  "
413010,"
   How do you feel about people who always got to be right about everything and bash people on about what they believe in over opinions?
  ","
  everyone is entitled to their own opinion as long as that opinion doesn't directly discriminate against people for things that are out of their control, such as their race, sex, gender, mental or physical illness, etc etc.
  
  it's always wrong to feel the need to *always* be right about certain things because it simply isn't aiding in your personal growth. and if someone feels the need to bash someone else over their personal opinions, then they probably have some sort of inner turmoil that's making them lash out in such a manner.
  "
413011,"
   Do you ever feel sad when people leave this site or other social media sites?
  ","
  no, it doesn't make me sad at all. most of the time, the people i'm close with on social media have other forms of accounts on other apps, so i end up talking to them or following them on there instead.

  "
413013,"
   Do you think it’s must to share all your thoughts with your partner?
  ","
  no, no one is obligated to share all of their thoughts with their partner. everyone is their own individual and they should only share what's comfortable to them, and that ranges depending on how close you are in the relationship. however, if you're afraid to share things with your partner, then that may be a red flag.
  "
413014,"
   Are you a picky eater? Do you like trying new food?
  ","
  i'm not a picky eater at all, and i'll eat almost anything as long as it sustains me. sometimes i enjoy trying new food, but i usually stick with what i know.
  "

  aw, that's perfectly okay !! i hope you feel better ~~
  "
413016,"
   Do you prefer to approach someone or wait for them to approach you?
  ","
  it depends on the situation. if i need help with something, then i'll approach the person first so that we can handle the situation together (it mostly occurs during work, though). however, that's pretty much the only time i ever approach people.
  "
413017,"

  i know it's super early on the east coast (it's not even 8am where i live, lol), but if anyone is awake -- ask me questions !!
  
  i'll be working on some freelance stuff and enjoying the snow fall outside my window, so i'm up for answering nearly anything.
  "
413018,"
   Why do people loose their interest?
  ","
  people are constantly growing & evolving. it's only natural for them to lose interest in certain hobbies, and even certain people, because it doesn't relate to them the same way as it is when they were younger. it's a natural part of getting older and discovering what you truly like and value.

   Apparently a school has added Vape Detectors in their bathrooms. The article I read didn't give much information on HOW the vape is detected but apparently it will send text alerts to the principal and other higher up people and they then bust the person vaping. Thoughts on this?
  ","
  i think schools should focus more on problem students and how to inspire them to work better for themselves, as well as crack down on actual problems in school like drug & substance usage. by focusing on something as mild as vaping, you're minimalizing the other problems at hand.
  
  obviously vaping *can* be an issue because of the nicotine involved, but i simply believe that there are more important matters at stake when it comes to middle schools and high schools.
  "
413020,"
   Are you open to acquaintances with English-learning people? Could be an advisor in this field?
  ","
  i'm never in situations where i'm around people who are just learning how to speak english, and i don't really have the patience to sit down and teach someone how to speak & write in english. i couldn't be an advisor in that field because it simply isn't something i'm interested in.
  "
413021,"
   Do you think giving compliments to random people is creepy?
  ","
  no, i don't think it's creepy in a general sense. however, it depends entirely on what you say & how you say it as well. the way you approach a person could be creepy, even if the words themselves aren't creepy.

   The store Kroger is starting to not accept Visa Credit Cards. Do you think it matters which way you pay for something or do you think more brand stores like that should follow suit?
  ","
  wow, that's going to be a huge loss on their part. even most debit cards have the word ""visa"" written on them to indicate that they can be used as a credit card, so even if someone doesn't have an actual credit card, they probably won't be able to use their debit card either unless they manually put in their PIN number.
  
  i think it doesn't matter which way a person pays, as long as they're obviously paying for their purchase and it doesn't get declined.

   You're never too old to... (phrase) - Used by grown ups or teenagers when they want to do something childish without being labeled ""immature.""

Have you ever used that phrase and would the meaning be the same for you?
  ","
  i've used the phrase before, but not in any sort of nefarious or problematic way.
  
  the first example that comes to mind would be, ""you're never too old to have cereal for dinner."" it isn't exactly immature by any means, but it does bring you back to that childlike state, especially if you're doing something like watching cartoons while you eat, lol.

   Would you rather know the date of death or cause? ?

 (death cannot be avoided by acting upon this knowledge)
