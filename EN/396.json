lifesaving medications should be free of cost or, if not, at least extremely affordable. the games that insurance companies play with pharmaceuticals and doctor offices is asinine, and it prevents a lot of people from obtaining medication which can literally save their life. diabetics shouldn't have to empty their wallets to pay for their insulin, just like how a mental health patient shouldn't go without their mood stabilizers because they can't afford it.\n  ","425046":"\n\n   @anancitae\n  \n\n\n   @HeartOfStitches\n  \n\n\n   @michaelanotxvx\n  \n\n\n   @puta4president\n  \n\n\n   @Consequuence\n  \n\n  (( this doesn't mean i don't like anyone else i follow, obviously !! i just like to check up on these peoples' pages when i have the free time because there's always something interesting or educational. ))\n  ","425047":"\n  i obviously can't speak on your behalf because i'm not in your circumstances, but you're an adult -

because she totally is. and i'm obviously too old to \"call out\" people, and i didn't want to tiptoe the issue any longer, especially considering i work with disabled adults and children for a living.\n  \n  idk, also part of my mental illnesses have to do with acceptance and abandonment, so a large part of me was afraid of backlash from everyone. i hope i portrayed myself correctly, because i'm not attacking anyone by any means.\n  ","425703":"\n  ok so you guys know that i generally don't involve myself in drama, but considering i'm a feminist as well as a disability advocate, i felt the need to say something.\n  \n  the way marissa went about portraying her opinion was wrong - that, i agree with. you (collectively) do not get to decide who does or does not get offended by what you (collectively) say - that doesn't make people too sensitive, it makes them human beings. by stating what she said, it gave an incredibly bad name to those with disabilities and only furthered the stigma that those with disabilities are somehow \"lesser\" human beings. and, as you know, that isn't true.\n  \n  i think what's crucial here is language - the term \"burden\" has many heavy, negative connotations. and while i think marissa had a logical theory in mind, she went about portraying that opinion in a very negative fashion. obviously being disabled places a person in positions of medical or financial destitution, but the term \"burden\" has always meant something deeper\/more intimate than that, and i think that's why this entire situation went awry.\n  \n  people with disabilities are not \"burdens\" (in the negative context of the term), and if you ask parents with disabled children, they will tell you that they're thankful for what they have - because having a child when you want one is better than not having one at all. if you're the type of person who could not handle having a child with a disability, then - to me - that indicates that you're simply not ready to handle parenthood.\n  \n  that's just my two cents ~~\n  ","425704":"\n  i think askfm's expiration date is fast approaching, tbh. a lot of people have been leaving and i've been noticing that it hasn't been as lively as it used to be in the past. if anything, it'll be a domino effect - one person leaves, which prompts another to leave, and so on and so on.\n  \n  personally speaking, i'm already giving up on askfm. half of the time, idk why i'm still here because 80% of what i receive in my inbox is either spam or harassment.\n  ","425705":"\n  i love this quote, and i agree. you do not have to necessarily agree with a certain viewpoint in order to look at it from that perspective and contemplate how other people can agree with it. a major part of education is learning about perspectives and opinions other than your own, as well as learning how to play the devil's advocate, so to speak, in balancing all of these views.\n  \n  it's important to see things from all sides - it would be close minded to only want to view an issue from one side only. if you feel strongly about a subject, you have every right to hold your own opinion, but it's important to consider all facets of the topic first.\n  ","425706":"\n  i've never had an eating disorder, but i agree. nobody should aspire to have ANY illness, whether it's anorexia nervosa or bipolar disorder or personality

how jokingly saying \"triggered!\" has become such a hot trend these days because it's been taking away from the legitimacy of those who suffer from REAL triggers. mental health patients are literally

take reign over every little detail of someone's life, and for someone who's neurotypical to make a commodity out of mental illness means that they're spitting in the face of survivors, neuroatypical type, and other people struggling with illnesses.\n  \n  - people who have a mental illness that dramatizes their illness for attention - this situation is something i have more sympathy towards because it could simply be a symptom of their illness. i require a lot of attention myself, and i'm not afraid to tell a person that the attention they're paying to me is inadequate. i know it's a

started ignoring her calls and texts after a while. she actually called me again last night, and i knew why because she had previously ranted on facebook about what a hard time she's been having with her boyfriend. i'm just sick of being people's go-to when they're in trouble, meanwhile they couldn't give two shits about me.\n  ","425895":"\n  (in no particular order, i'm just listing based on

idk if it's because i'm getting sick or because i increased the dosage of my medication or both. :\/\/ i woke up congested and my entire body aches. i want to try to take it easy, but it's been difficult because my mother has been asking me to catch up on all of the household chores since i wasn't home at all the past two nights.\n  ","425897":"\n  rooster teeth \/ achievement hunter is even bigger than ever before. i've been a huge fan of theirs for the past 3-4 years and their content has only gotten better, rooster teeth has gotten larger, and the staff is just as amazing as they've always been. ?\n  ","425898":"\n  and on today's episode of \"things that make no fucking sense\".....\n  ","425899":"\n  i just dislike the obligation that i have to be nice, friendly, and charismatic to my family members -- there was always so much pressure growing up on me being the \"perfect relative\" and my parents would give me shit if i was too depressed to go. and when i was there, i would always have to stay for conversation, smile, endure everyone's half assed hugs and kisses, etc.\n  \n  thankfully when i turned 21, i was able to drink the table wine so i'd always get drunk and not give a fuck so it made holidays more tolerable lmao.\n  ","425900":"\n  i mean, obviously? it's not like it's a place you can go to visit, lmao.\n  ","425901":"\n  i've never related more to a meme.\n  ","425902":"\n  american horror story.\n  \n  at its best, it has brilliant characterization, it pushes the boundaries of discomfort, and it keeps you entertained. however, at its worst, it's downright ableist, makes absolutely zero sense, and further stigmatizes taboo subjects just for that entertainment factor. there are some seasons (like asylum and freak show) that i absolutely hated.\n  ","425903":"\n  no. i think we need a total overhaul of the system, honestly. our current political state is extremely corrupt and the citizens aren't being represented properly.\n  ","425904":"\n  you mean when bernie was cheated out of the primaries? there were plenty of people protesting that.\n  ","425905":"\n  this is the first time i've ever made one of these

this a real thought people have. this absolutely terrifies me.\n  ","425912":"\n  idk anyone who disagrees with trump and is violent... it's actually ironic because someone who supported trump was actually one who threatened to do physical harm to me last night, lol.\n  ","425913":"\n  those who are uneducated rarely see anything wrong with their statements or actions -- they place the blame on others. those who are educated know when to apologize for their actions and have a more worldly view of things, and they recognize when they perhaps don't know things.\n  \n  the most ironic thing about the past few days is that while i've simply been stating my opinion, i've gotten nothing but backlash and personal attacks from people who disagree with me.\n  ","425914":"\n  people have the freedom to protest what they want to protest. i don't see what the big issue is, especially when their protests aren't personally affecting your life.\n  ","425915":"\n  what makes you think that trump doesn't...? i never said i supported many of clinton's views but at least she hasn't threatened to take away the rights of the people who are already living in america.\n  ","425916":"\n  they're human beings, for crying out loud. you people have no compassion.\n  ","425917":"\n  i have a lot more things to worry about than the legalization of medical marijuana, hahah. i honestly think it's a great thing, cannabis oil has been proven effective in treating a multitude of medical conditions and medical grade marijuana also helps medical conditions like chronic pain and PTSD.\n

anxiety has almost completely disappeared !!\n  \n  i've been noticing over the past week or so that i haven't been nervous while driving, even with daylight savings and it getting darker outside. i just went to my doctor's office spontaneously to pick up a sample trial of medication, and i wasn't even fretting about it at all. it's like a load off my shoulders.\n  ","425924":"\n  hahah aw thank

you're lucky i just got them done last week.\n  ","425927":"\n  we have no choice but to give him a chance, unfortunately. that's the scary part -- there's no going back.\n  \n  the only intelligent thing about him is that he's been able to convince a majority of america that he's going to do great things for this country, preying on their insecurities and inciting them with words of violence. he does a terrific job at portraying an image that he's going to say and do a lot without actually saying or doing anything at all.\n  ","425928":"\n  WHAT LMAO.\n  \n  how the fuck...?\n  ","425929":"\n  i haven't checked my phone in 3 hours, and i logged into 16 troll messages, telling me that i'm hypocritical, a liar, authoritarian, and a liberal freak.\n  \n  what lives do you all have to relentlessly retaliate against those who express opinions that are different than yours? why don't you guys gain a sense of maturity and realize that you can't walk through life expecting everyone to feel the same way as you? grow the fuck up.\n  ","425930":"\n  i am currently living in what you call \"affordable suburbs.\" anything less expensive than where i am now would be governmental housing.\n  ","425931":"\n  it's sad that there's this stereotype about long islanders that they're ALL wealthy, because that's the furthest from the truth. there are wealthy people who live in the hamptons and on the north shore, but that only accounts for a small portion of who actually lives and works on long island.\n  ","425932":"\n  it's ridiculously expensive to live there, there's too many people, and i'm just not a fan of urban settings.\n  ","425933":"\n  plenty of times, sure. this isn't my first account on askfm, i also frequented this site 4-5 years ago and took a year or two

must band together as a solid union and combat against whatever unjust policies the government will hurl our way. we have endured so much, and we are facing tough times ahead.\n  \n  but we will not bow, and we cannot be broken. there is revolution in the air, and we will not stand here and allow our government to do whatever they please -- when the time comes (and i expect it will come soon), we will prove our strength in numbers. we will love each other and refuse to settle for injustice.\n  \n  things will eventually be ok, but right now, we must prepare for battle.\n  ","425936":"\n\n   @cybergrrrl\n  \n  for president when she turns 35, i'm putting my vote in now.\n  ","425937":"\n  increasing minimum wage will also increase the amount of money people will have to spend on those objects -- even *if* prices are slightly raised (and even so, that depends entirely by region), people will have the finances to actually afford those items. as opposed to now, where prices are so inflated and people aren't properly compensated to afford those items at all.\n  ","425938":"\n  exactly this. minimum wage is supposed to be a liveable wage, and people cannot live off of what minimum wage is right now due to the inflation of prices everywhere else.\n  ","425939":"\n  i wish i had the privilege to not understand how his policies would affect underprivileged groups. many people will have their rights taken away from them, and many more are already afraid to face the public due to the heightened sense of violence surrounding this nation due to this decision.\n  ","425940":"\n  of course -- low self esteem, lack of validation in their own life, and a sense of entitlement. they likely didn't receive adequate care and attention growing up, so they lash out in one of the few ways they can with no repurcussions.\n  ","425941":"\n  people are angry. people protest.\n  \n  they know that their actions won't impeach trump when he enters office, but it gives people a sense of purpose and solidarity when they come together with like minded people to fight for a cause they believe in. they want their voices to be heard.\n  ","425942":"\n  firewood and

much as i'd love to disconnect and do that, i would rather not get the shit end of the stick because of it. my mother is incessant on keeping in contact with me, so if i don't respond to her, she'll continuously text or call until i answer her. i can't tell you how many times i've been berated because i was at work and wouldn't answer my phone or texts.\n  ","425946":"\n  i think i'm going to refrain from using the internet for the next few hours. my heart hurts too much. seeing all of these people suffering from this decision is so painful. there are muslims afraid to leave their houses in hijab. there are trans kids afraid to go to school and face their peers. there are trans adults afraid to present how they want to present in fear of being attacked. people are crying and yelling and protesting, and nobody sees anything wrong with that? i need to take a step back and reflect. i'm losing hope fast and it isn't healthy for me right now.\n  ","425947":"\n  right now, some johnny on the rocks. i'm still so angry.\n  ","425948":"\n  leather. guns. fur.\n  ","425949":"\n  i mean he wants people to use bathrooms according to what genitalia they have so i mean \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  ","425950":"\n  i highly doubt it. who are the people who end up doing a lot of construction work that isn't part of a union? oh that's right, illegal immigrants.\n  ","425951":"\n  basically in trump's mind... muslim = ISIS. which couldn't be further from the truth.\n  \n  he's talked about instituting surveillance on muslim mosques and other places muslim people frequent. there will be stricter policies on muslims entering or exciting the country. he's literally infringing on privacy laws because he doesn't trust islam.\n  ","425952":"\n  no, i honestly can't even listen to the guy speak. i'll read what he said when i get home, but i can't listen to him talk because he gets under my skin so badly.\n  ","425953":"\n  only time will tell.\n  ","425954":"\n  trump actually used to be a lot more liberal in the past than he is now.\n  ","425955":"\n  i don't have the time, energy, or mental strength to join a physical protest. i have way too much shit going on in my life. for now, i'll safely protest from the comfort of my own home where i know i won't be attacked.\n  ","425956":"\n  go online and do your research on the things trump has said and done in the past. his entire persona is a contradiction. he has never remained consistent in his beliefs, and because of that, it's hard to determine what he ACTUALLY believes.\n  \n  i was briefly skimming through his wikipedia page earlier today and going through the sources, and the stuff written there makes me sick to my stomach. not to mention the things pence believes as well.\n  ","425957":"\n  statistics showed that he could have possibly won against trump in a landslide.\n  \n  however, statistics also estimated that clinton would have won the election and that didn't turn out to be true either.\n  ","425958":"\n  if clinton rigged the elections, then wouldn't it have made more sense for HER to get elected? lmao fucking hell, these conspiracy theories are nonsense.\n  ","425959":"\n  i feel like there's going to be a hell of a lot more hate crime.\n  \n  stay friends, friends. ?\n  ","425960":"\n  literally if everyone who had a protest vote gave their vote to clinton, she would have won.\n  \n  instead, they relied on bs third party candidates who have no realistic chance in the presidential race and invalid write ins. the immaturity of this entire country has me shaking my head in anger, frustration, and disbelief.\n  ","425961":"\n  idk. hopefully they'll be able to stay married. but who knows.\n  ","425962":"\n  i'm not being dramatic. i'm simply regurgitating the information i've read online about his beliefs and pence's beliefs.\n  \n  trump has the option to appoint new supreme court justices. i won't be surprised if they overturn marriage equality.\n  ","425963":"\n  no, my immediate response was anger. anger and resentment. i'm still angry.\n  ","425964":"\n  i love you, bee. ?\n  \n  no need for apologies. this will undoubtedly affect everyone, not just the US. i'm terrified of the months and years to come with respect to international affairs.\n  ","425965":"\n  trump has a remarkable history of saying one thing and then contradicting himself months later. if he was pro-lgbt, he wouldn't have taken on pence as a VP. they don't believe in marriage equality or even civil unions.\n  ","425966":"\n  i'm not saying clinton was a perfect candidate, because she's not. i would have preferred bernie, personally. however, she at least has had experience in politics for most of her life, knows what she is talking about, and is a lot less radical than trump.\n  \n  if you're going to talk about war, then i don't see how you can't think that trump is anti-war. he wants more nuclear weaponry. he believes that torture methods like waterboarding should be more severe. and he doesn't even respect veterans.\n  ","425967":"\n  as a fellow new yorker, i can affirm that the majority of new yorkers (especially in the metro areas) hate his guts and everything he stands for. i'm happy that new york is a blue state.\n  ","425968":"\n  hello, i'm also biologically female, part of the lgbt community, and mentally ill.\n  ","425969":"\n  i didn't say he wanted to deport all mexicans and muslims, lol. i clearly said illegal immigrants.\n  ","425970":"\n  i support hard working people who have built the foundations of this country. trump's idea of a mass deportation of illegal mexican immigrants and muslims is going to cause our society to plummet both economically and socially. there will be riots.\n  ","425971":"\n  the presidency is based on the electoral college votes. the first one to obtain 270 electoral votes wins overall.\n  ","425972":"\n  once trump deports all of the illegal immigrants and makes it impossible for them to apply for citizenship or a work visa, watch how fast this economy will crumble.\n  ","425973":"\n  potentially, yes.\n  ","425974":"\n  senate, house of representatives, and the presidency. and eventually the supreme court, as well, once trump elects his judges.\n  ","425975":"\n  no doubt, by a landslide.\n  ","425976":"\n  unfortunately, that's how america's \"democracy\" works -- clinton won the popular vote, but trump won the electoral college vote.\n  \n  in addition, all three branches of government are now republican so the whole checks and balances deal doesn't seem too convincing anymore, lol.\n  ","425977":"\n  trump and pence are against literally everything that i stand for. my life, and the lives of my friends and loved ones, will be in danger because they do not fit the mold of trump's \"perfect citizen.\"\n  \n  i voted for clinton, although i do not like her, because she was the only way this country wouldn't succumb to a trump presidency. well now look at us.\n  ","425978":"\n  anon: you have no right to speak, you didn't vote!\n  \n  me: hello, i did vote\n  \n  anon: LOL STOP BRAGGING ABOUT VOTING GET FUCKED\n  \n  seriously? this country
