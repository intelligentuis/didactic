Another reason is they can't get in and out of our driveways and we can't see over the grass.\n  \n  Plus Gardens and trees would die and more.\n  \n  There are multiple reasons to why we country-folk definitely cut our dresses.\n  \n  People in the city?

Even if you ask a few people about this place that I'm talking about you probably can find out where it is but it's extremely expensive but totally worth it because his work is amazing even if it takes a year or so to get into his shop I would definitely consider going there. He also does before appointments to see what you want first before getting it and then he has a second appointment so it will be a process but exciting and totally worth it in the end. At least you will be getting a piece of work and actually getting something beautiful instead of going to someone cheap and it being super fast and not being done all the way and you spending a lot of money. Not saying all tattoo artists other than him or like this now. There are other tattoo artists that are amazing as well\n  ","26281":"\n  Just ware on it.. And not keeping it up. But not always in a sense.. But just maybe it being out of date. Keeping it's original self for so long and people knowing that in mind just automatically makes it seem to be like that but honestly I just think it's because of the history the thought behind it and of course it being out of date.\n  ","26282":"\n  Ayyye what's good.\n  ","26283":"\n  Nice shoutout.\n  \n  \ud83e\udd19 Hope your ok..\n  ","26284":"\n  yeah in a few days and the South part of USA it's supposed to be like 10 to 5 degrees and that is freezing for us.

There will always be catfish\n  ","26288":"\n  DS and Xbox then Wii\n  ","26289":"\n  Oh okay. My apologies there. Well. We were up on the levee back home where I was born and raised and again we were up on the Mississippi Levee. the Mississippi Levee where we were at is located in Louisiana but it's the Mississippi River and we were standing on the Levee. Absolutely beautiful. This is a destination that my grandfather used to go to nearly every single day in the morning and even sometimes in the evening to enjoy its beauty and just to take in the nature, to watch the boats come by and to look at the bridge... the giant skyscrapers  and planes helicopters and more. There were also be periodically different events that happened up here.  But most the time was peaceful and quiet. Awesome place to visit. Unfortunately my grandfather passed away a few years back  plus my grandmother soon after sadly... They mean a lot to me. They partly raised me with my mom. They played a big role in my life. I love my grandparents. but this is a memory that I will always remember about him, my Paw paw and I love going to this place while we were there one day he got down on one knee after making a joke that he saw a trash boat in the water got my attention because I wanted to see it turned back around and he was on one knee asking me to marry him. Which the joke that he made was something similar to what my grandfather would say it was very touching, very sweet and very just emotional altogether. I loved it I couldn't have asked for a better proposal. but altogether I find that very special and I just loved it loved it. That's how my husband proposed to me.\n  ","26290":"\n  Yeah. They are good. Yeah!\n  ","26291":"\n  I can hand write with both arms but not that great but I can throw with both arms ambidextrous in throwing\n  ","26292":"\n  well if you want a tattoo done very beautifully and extreme detail I would make sure that you go to a very good artist and make sure that you pay good money to get that tattoo done. And I would look far and wide for a very good tattoo artist. I know there's one in Miami Florida that's extremely good that I definitely recommend but you have to make an appointment with him and honestly his appointments are probably so backed up that you would probably have to make a reservation a year ahead of time. But all I know is make sure that you have a really good artist and make sure that they know for sure how much detail that you want in your tattoo. I would stick around their shop for a few weeks before actually letting them tattoo on you or just check out their work for a couple of weeks and just see if that's the kind of stuff that you want in your skin. The way that they're doing that to people tattoos the detail. It's important to develop a relationship with your tattoo artist as well also in my opinion and which is what I did. But like I said just be careful and make sure you know what you want before getting it. Because it ain't coming off your body unless you want to spend thousands of dollars in laser surgery and honestly one surgery does it fix it and sometimes it never does\n  ","26293":"\n  I don't mind either\n  ","26294":"\n  Make sure you want what you want and make sure you really going to want it because it's going to be on you for the rest of your life.

But instead this time I want a giant pot for them so I don't have to keep switching them because of course switching a Cactus is not the easiest thing to do. I'm going to tell you is I had to do it very carefully LOL. I would also like a ivy plant. I want one for right by my door. And then I would like one for my kitchen. And then I would like to have some other plants outside more Windchimes and to hummingbird feeders at least on the front of my porch and two on the side by my carport. I would also like to pecan trees a magnolia tree and a couple peach trees for the backyard. But I doubt that will happen.
