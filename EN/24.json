took one and i got sick so in my opinion when you get those shots all they do is make you sick . probably not in everyone s case but in my case it did so it s not going to help me it s going to hurt me . hopefully your immune system is strong enough to fight it off because that s the point of the shot . it s inject you with a little bit of the virus and see if your body can fight it off and not all the time everybody can fight it off . they say that the shot doesn t get you sick but in my opinion sorry if you weren t sick with it at all and then you get the shot and then it gets you sick a week later then that is the shot getting you sick . idc what any doctor or scientist says . that sh just pisses me off when they want to try to say that that s not the reason . good luck . i m sure

money almost ever . because i don t like having to stress about getting it back because that s just how i am . i am not one to lie and not pay someone back . that s why i don t give money out a lot

to waste your time and sit there and stalk you but if you give them reactions then they re going to keep going but if you ignore them then you don t have to worry about them anymore . if you don t want to stay that s up to you but this site is pretty cool and has some awesome people on it when you get to looking . but there are people that are greedy and there are people that want you to like their post and give them things even though they should earn it . but you just have to stick to yourself and remember to not get angry when someone comes on your page that you don t know at all and have never met or talked to you have to remember to not react to them . because that s the only reason why they re here is to make people angry","22411":"i m great . tired though . prob about to hit

you d be surprised that some families don t fight . and it s kind of weird honestly . you should definitely not be a perfect family or act like you are at least . keeping that image is actually bizarre . but i definitely see what you mean by why do some families fight so much ? because there are some families that are really bad . like sometimes we have people come in our store and they re just screaming across the store at each other or hitting each other or calling each other names are snatching things from each other and then they want to know why everyone keeps being so rude to them or talking so down about them . if you re going to show that reputation then people are going to do that to you . but yes i have always wondered why some families fight so much .","22507":"i mean . find out the number to the jail asked about the ferguson and then asked if you could talk to them the worst they can say is no and then you can be like well how do i get and to contact with him ? i wouldn t even tell them what you re trying to do because then he might not want to talk to you immediately . but if they ask why i just be like i just have a question for this person and if they do keep persisting to know why then i guess tell them . but that s the best thing i can tell you is to just call them and ask to speak to him or ask how to speak to him or if you can come in and talk to him","22508":"i have never been to canada but i have always wanted to visit not just because i have a lot of friends from there but i want to go to alaska and of course really honestly the only way

feel about my marriage and how i feel people should look at their marriage and how they should look at relationships . it s not all about one thing it s about a lot of things at once and the most important things . you not only are in a relationship with that person but that person is your best friend and friendship is important for a relationship . you should get along with that person . you don t want to be with someone difficult that doesn t treat you right or something . it s not all about looks . it s about attitude and what they want in life and other things . connecting with them . this picture means a lot to me and explains so much .","22511":"like on a dating site ? i have never did that . or have i went online intentionally trying to find someone ? no . me and my husband did

does with you or something which isn t really good . he should keep those things in between both of you but this is just me assuming . but honestly why would he start doing this towards you ? being nasty ? after all he is best friends with your boyfriend . maybe they have been discussing some of the things that you and your boyfriend doing together and maybe your boyfriend s best friend is starting to look at you a different way . which isn t really good . like i said i m just assuming . don t automatically think that this is what it is but i would definitely start asking your boyfriend when he discusses with his best friend about you because at the end of the day i don t think it s appropriate for his best friend to be being nasty to you especially if you re with someone especially his best friend . i would have a discussion with him . but i m friendly i don t want him to do that type of discussion . good luck . hopefully i helped","22659":"haha . . thanks . and that s my

people a chance to give an animal a second chance . and then maybe . . . try to give to poor families that are struggling . sometimes people like that sign up for certain programs . like one parent families . like girls or guys that have three or four children and they re raising them on their own or even more five or six children . orphanages . it s really good to donate mostly items to
