anything ! ? that doesn t show if someone is racist or not .","318366":"hey , hru","318367":"umm what ? dude , do not bring race into this . i told you the same thing before you mentioned anything

told you my reasons on why i don t friend people on instagram , why should i make an exception ?","318370":"my answer still stands , doing what you re doing makes me not want to talk to you at all tbh

things between us . . ? i ve never talked to you before . . but like i said , i don t want to get to know someone who i don t personally know . . plus a lot of guys get creepy with me , so i m trying to avoid that by not talking to someone i don t really know . . and you kept saying we had to video chat so you know i m real ? i m not into that .","318373":"i have a lot of respect for people , but i don t follow anonymous accounts that i don t know in real life or people who ride or have horses , it s way easier when i have stuff in common with my friends . and you were saying how we have to video chat , i would not video chat and i don t follow people who i don t know . and why do you want my love . . ? it honestly sounds like you want to eventually date me , but idk for sure . . .","318374":"dude i never said it was because of you re looks , if you said i m super hot and the same stuff , while on anon , i wouldn t be interested either , it has nothing to do with looks . how am i hurting you , if you don t know me ? why do you want to get to know me so badly ?","318375":"oh dang , yeah haven t paid much attention to awards","318376":"just any kind of website ? if you have

you want , that s fine . and idk , i might look into your profile to see if you have content that looks good . how am i hurting you ?","318383":"okay , but like i said earlier , i don t video call like anyone unless it s a girl i m close with or if i m dating someone , so that doesn t change . and after you follow me , i pretty much already said . you can follow me if you want , if not , that s fine . but maybe i ll look at your profile , i mostly just follow friends i know or horse accounts","318384":"but what exactly are you looking for ? ? it seems like you want to be more then friends .

that haircut and was super p ! ssed off bc she got me to have bangs again , without telling me , and then a couple years ago i had side longer bangs and liked them","318389":"dude no we don t have to video call , i have enough pictures of myself on my account , so no . i m not fake . and why do you want to hang out with me ? and honestly ? you were accusing me of not responding bc of ur looks ,

never ever have respect from me , but that s because they don t deserve it they ve done some stuff to me , so i have reasons tho","318446":"probably not going to a college to work with horses would ve loved to of done that . but life is good , so i suppose everything worked out good","318447":"maybe the way i are","318448":"if everyone respected everyone , the world would be a better place , but

to buy something quickly , there was a glass covering by the register , so when he handed me my stuff , he held onto my hands for a second longer and muttered something . after that everything screamed to run , but i stupidly waited , he came around by me and then hugged me and touched my upper area . my boyfriend at the time now ex came back and threatened to call the cops . he was a year old dude never went back there , so that s my crazy story","318646":"not really this month tbh , but i just bought myself a new camera today and got my horse june th","318647":"when i was super young i loved this one horse game , legacy of rosemond hill , i bought it this year again because i really loved it and played it a bit , right now tho ? i liked to play skyrim and horse riding delux . i ve played zoo tycoon , i ve played a few of them","318648":"yeah , i rather be with my loved ones","318649":"lolol , i want my dream boyfriend who can hopefully ride a horse to come along sometime soon","318650":"not the one guys , but a year later a different store manager that was there for a month wanted me to be a manager there , but i couldn t stand working for him , i literally cried when my one friend manager had to leave for a few minutes to get something from her house and i had to be left alone with him and i think the guy cleaning captain","318651":"lol , the one store manager a year later wanted me to be his store manager , but i declined because i could barely stand working there and being a manager at that time there didn t sound good , should ve reported everything to hr lol","318652":"i ve had both crab and lobster , they both taste sooooooooo good , but are expensive","318653":"uhh it was inappropriate and i never really considered him my boss boss he was a manager that worked there above me . and he asked what size my b bs were and might of asked for a photo i can t remember exactly and how he wouldn t tell my boyfriend at the time we were dating and stuff like that . and it was either facebook or snap i don t remember , that s the main one i remember , keep in mind that was either or and i can t remember all of the dumb stuff he said","318654":"hahahaha definitely","318655":"haha if i liked them i would , but my dream guy would be someone who can hopefully ride a horse !","318656":"oh nooo , i wouldn t make her do that ! if i was gonna get one done ,

. lol jk , but uh i m not dating haha","318658":"nope , never actually watched the horse races , i ve been to louisville for our world championship horse shows tho","318659":"sure i like massages","318660":"comet , diablo or thunder","318661":"not in the slightest .","318662":"i like it , it s super fun . i ended up spraining my knee while attempting to ice skate a few years ago fail","318663":"i ve been to chicago before , yes","318664":"no i don t believe so , where is it located at ?","318665":"i ve never had mango juice before and i don t know if i would , i m not a big fan of juice , but i definitely would have a mango smoothie !","318666":"depends on who i would still have on earth . if everyone i love is down on earth , of course i would choose to get a second chance at life . but if everyone i love has crossed over , i would rather cross over","318667":"salmon , garlic pasta cheesy noodles and a flounder rolled over some shrimp","318668":"yasssss , haven t listened to them in awhile but i still like them !","318669":"nope nope nope nope , i would never ever in a million years do that . if people are okay with that , that s not my place to call them out , but i don t agree with it in the slightest and honestly , i think it s kinda wrong because it seems like you should only love and care for one other person in marriage , but if they want to do it , not my place to call them out and just my thoughts , so no hate","318670":"hell yeah , definitely legendary lol","318671":"lol yup , other then customers yelling at me , i stayed out of it , one customer who tried telling me what to do , i was like nope , not happening they got pissed off and left , leaving a review saying they want me fired","318672":"honestly no , not that i could remember haha . but a guy apparently from what people told us was selling drugs at the corner by the bus stop and always came in to just get a cup of water but would bother all the workers and people were ready to fight him haha , we were aloud to kick him out . he got arrested later on . or this homeless guy would always come in and apparently would get drunk and get sick in the bathroom . i have more stories of some customers tho if anyone wants to hear it lol","318673":"nope , kind of just stayed away from that , since the only time i saw a couple fights were in high school . if it happened now , i probably would record it , but i really don t see any fights","318674":"i love a few of the food items there ! the chicken chalupa completely plan and the potato tacos with just the potatos and cheese ! but you really don t wanna know how often they cleaned it at the time","318675":"it s okay , what matters is i m out now . it was sooo mentally draining , i really only stayed because i got weekends off and never worked nights since i was the store opener . and it really does unfortunately and i m doing so much better , i love my job and really don t have any complaints at all , people are great there and it s just an awesome workplace and they truly care about all their employees if you don t mind me asking , where did you work ? and i m glad that you are doing much better !","318676":"because they treated me unfair , i worked there two years and only got a c raise . i left making only . people came in making way more then me . i got harassed multiple times by one of the store managers , one of the guy managers i think after he got fired because of him smoking in the store harassed me on facebook asking me a couple inappropriate questions , they hardly ever let me leave on time , even when i told him if i didn t leave now , i wouldn t have a ride , he told me to figure it out , i rarely got any breaks . even tho i ve worked hours before , i even had new store managers over a few months if that says anything about them . and a few days before i quit , the new store manager made me go in the store by myself when the store was unlocked all night and my manager was an hour late at that time , so i was in there at am am with no one in there . and if someone snuck in the store , i could ve been serious hurt . it wasn t worth it , i was suffering when i worked there , i m still friends with one of my managers who worked there . she was the best manager i had there . sorry it s so long , but that s all the crap that happened to me","318677":"bc i just don t ?","318678":"no ?","318679":"hello !","318680":"mixed drinks , i really don t like beers unless it s the lemonade flavored ones","318681":"don t make me choose between those two , i just can t

on who the person is , some people who are rich are happy and have love . while some who are poor are way happier with just love . i think it depends on the circumstances , it could be either or both . depends on the person and the situation","318695":"super sensitive issues , can t wear jeans , stuff like that","318696":"lol fr , like i m soooo sorry , but i don t care what ya look like , i ll

talking about ? i have two and idk the food , it s whatever my trainer feeds him , pretty much the same as every other horse in the barn","318701":"i just keep looking forward to spending time with my family , that i m lucky to have them and my two horses","318702":"beauty is on the inside and not out . someone could be super pretty on the outside but mean on the inside , which ultimately makes them ugly because that s how they treat other people","318703":"make money work for me","318704":"definitely eggs","318705":"not gonna lie , this has to take it . so in freshmen year i believe it was , i was forced to do marching band and in my dream i dreamt that it was a process of elimination and if you didn t try hard enough and he wasn t impressed the band director would kill you , it was about to be me , but i jumped behind someone so it wouldn t be me . i don t know how this happened , considering he was one of the best teachers i had buuuut , ya know ?","318706":"occasionally and

anyone lol","318715":"german shepherds for sure ! i also like the shetland sheep dog too that s what we have","318716":"i mean i don t think it should be a law to be honest . i wouldn t like it either if i was looking for a full time job , i would just hey a job with someone who is fine with full time work . sometimes part time jobs are good for people in school or who just need a second job to earn a little extra money","318717":"if she made a bet , like an actual serious bet , not just joking around , then she d have to pay . don t make bets you can t keep lol , since if it was the opposite position , i would be forced to pay . i would never be in that situation tho because i don t make bets lol","318718":"i mean if the people are okay with it , that s fine . some jobs like gamestop do that to save some money","318719":"that was saut ed shrimp with onions , worcester sauce , green peppers , rolled into my flounder","318720":"nooo but i sometimes take photos of my food if
