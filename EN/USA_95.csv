   ""Never complain and never explain"" is a phrase said by people who have rumours spread about them. Do you think it's good advice to never complain about rumours spread about you and to never explain yourself or the truth?

  I think in that way you should try to stop it depending on what it is. I'd rather have someone fight for what is right instead of some p*ssy who goes along with  ____. If it's something horribly stupid that nobody would ever believe it might be a different outcome.
  
  I feel like other ways (not rumor based) is more understandable. Example you have goals and instead of explaining everything, you just do it. No complaining, no bs.

   Following Saturday’s horse racing Grand National, Ricky Gervais tweeted ""Why would you gamble with a horse’s life for fun?"" and while the majority of people supported this, there was a loud minority of people disagreeing. Do you agree or disagree with Ricky and why? How would you answer Ricky?
  ","
  Hmm. I kind of see both ways to it. If the horses are well taken care of and not worked to the bone then i don't really see the problem? There's so many ways to gamble..
  
  I'm a bit biased since my grandpa would always go to the track. Back then (90's) I didn't really view it as gambling for a horses life. I get where this Rocky dude is coming from.
  
  I'm not sure how I'd answer him. Especially since I don't know the whole story. What made him say something? Was the horse nearly dead? Talking as a whole or just one specific horse/person? I do believe that horse racing isn't as popular these days so its a bit weird hearing about.

   In your relationships/past relationships what is considered as cheating to you? Do you think everyone needs to decide in their own relationship what is cheating or do you think there's a universal list that everyone in a relationship must abide by? If you think there's a list, what is it?

  I've never cheated nor been cheated on to my knowledge.

510099,"
   'if you have a mental illness it does not give you the excuse to totally manipulate and emotionally abuse someone. '
  ","
  I agree. People should be aware of right/wrong behavior. People shouldn't always make excuses because of a mental illness. Deep down should know better. It also seems a bit premeditated because they'd have to think of a way to manipulate someone first. It just doesn't happen.
  
  People should have kindness etc

  Went to the gym. I definitely pushed myself today. I walked around the track with a weighted ball. There was a kettle ball in the area so used that at times too. Basically moved it in a circle around me. I couldn't see the weight # but seemed like 30 pounds or so. Also one outdoor track lap for the outdoor workout.
  
  dinner. Chicken ceasar salad. Threw some at the dog. She's obsessed with chicken.

   On April Fool's Justin Bieber posted pics of an ultrasound pretending his wife was pregnant. He apologised after & said it was just a joke, due to the backlash from people saying it wasn't something to joke about due to miscarriage stats. What's your opinion on this? Did he need to apologise or not?
  ","
  No. It's a day of pranks. Pregnancy and engagement ones happen all the time which is stupid to begin with. These people should have known what was up.
  
  It's a little weird to bring miscarriages in the discussion. If someone just had one they should have known better than to even go online that day?
  "
510377,"
   Follow up on the last question. Justin's famous wife was in on the prank/joke and posed for photos to appear as if she was in hospital with doctors. Why do you think she wasn't called out on behalf of it all? Do you think this is different to when someone fools their partner with a fake pregnancy?

   It's a bad time to be a r*pist. The golden days of crime are over. In 2018 Sacramento investigators nailed the Golden State Killer and the NorCal Rapist by using a genealogy websites and they committed their crimes in the 70s 80s and 90s

   Many people say that they fear the dark, bit all of a sudden aren't afraid when they're given night vision eyewear although they're still in the dark so with that in mind what do you think people are more afraid of.... The dark or the inability to see what surrounds them or something else?
  ","
  What is around them, active mind etc
  
  My sister was scared of the dark. Think she still is 😂 My mom slept in the same bed with her before. Also nightlights. We had bunkbeds growing up.
  
  I was never afraid of the dark.
  
  I do think it can be creepy at night walking and hear something or you see someone randomly when nobody was around before. More about  the mindset too.

   Was there any creepy, strange, or dark places you visited as a child? If so, where?
  ","
  Graveyards. Went at night before with friends
  
  This path connecting our old house and the neighbors. They'd say it was haunted by a hradless horsemen/pumpkin head man. There was something hanging from the brach in the tree too. It got really dark and we'd literally go around it to avoid it at night when going home 😂
  
  This camp with little cabins. It's rumored that a bride ended up killing herself in the upstairs attic with a noose. Also that a rocking chair moves, her crying out. There's also a loading dock area for trucks to backup into BUT there's no way that a truck can get into it.. rumored dead bodies and such are in it. There's literally a steep hill and nowhere to enter. Also everyone that I've known who has gotten married there has been divorced. A curse maybe? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ deals with Indian land back in the day.

  It was raining and thundering out and made a post about dancing in the rain kind of thing. My nephew's uncle's mom got offended and thought it was about killing myself because of the lighting and was all that's not funny etc
  
  like uh no... not what I was talking about at all. it was very bizarre. I've literally danced in the rain before with friends so was more like nostalgia kind of thing.

  Ended up making keto chocolate cheesecake. Very chocolaty. Got ready and walked to Goodwill. I ended up buying a pair of Forever 21 shorts from there. Size 14 😮
  
  I've never purchased their pants/shorts but I've tried stuff on in 18s from there before so that's pretty awesome. 4 sizes down. I'd probably still be in their plus sizes for tops and dresses though.
  
  Also went to Ross quickly. They had some cute things.

   What are your thoughts about people who are unwilling to post any pics at all of themselves on this site? Do you think they perceive themselves as unattractive? Does it make you suspicious of them? What are other possible reasons for not doing it?
  ","
  I don't care what others do. As long as they aren't faking anyone, I'm fine with people not sharing.
  
  I'm not photogenic, I like being a mystery, not comfortable with my body at times. It's also a Q&A site.. it really shouldn't matter here. I don't think I'm totally unattractive.. cute/pretty 5-7 range at most. I don't need to flaunt myself on here... I've posted some pictures at times of legs, when I was a kid, semi-hidden recent face/hair one. I also had creepy ""fanpages"" made WITHOUT a picture. Another reason why I'm more iffy about posting here. I don't need photoshopped p0rn pictures etc

  I'm not taking any pills. I feel like most of that stuff is a scam or could actually be harmful in the end. (Niall tagged me in a keto pill post)
  
  It's probably the same? Just more macro based, maybe. Lots more information on it, apps like Carb Manager and such.
  
  We've only really found alternatives for flours, sugar, salt, and stuff like that. My sister did end up buying a ketone meal replacement but I haven't tried it yet.
  
  Just been eating keto foods, exercise. No pills besides my metformin (pcos) and a multivitamin when I feel like it. It's the one i usually take.. not anything new on keto lol
  
  15.5 down since Jan 9th
  
  I'm not sure that I'd recommend pills to anyone. But eating keto could help people. Everyone's journey is different. I've noticed some that dropped a ton in the first month. I'm going into my 3rd month soon and only 15.5 down on keto. There's also different types of keto too - strict, dirty and lazy. I'm losing more inches since I workout. Basically average a 2 pound loss each week...

  I know i sound petty right now but the gym does so its annoying having this happening at the moment. Especially when doing a challenge and literally see results and not sure when I'll have the money kind of thing. I hope everyone else is mad at them doing all this with no warnings as well. They should have posted about it somewhere.. email update, anything but they didn't. They also usually send an email updating me when the month is over and I didn't get one.. Instead they told me it ended on Monday when i went there. You'd think they would have mentioned that yesterday too.

  Yes. It's sad how everything is technology based for kids today.

   Math is a subject of contention for many people, but do you think it gets a bad rap because of how it's taught or because of the subject matter? Do you think this goes for most subjects, that it's less of what it is and more of how it's taught that captures a student's attention/interest? (Spam 1)
  ","
  Agree with what you wrote
  
  I feel like I've only had about 3 or 4 good math teachers that made it fun and easy to learn.

   Pendulums are a weight on the end of a chain/string. A circle means ""yes"" and a straight line means ""no"".

  I've talked about going to PT as a kid  (more so at the school for balance type stuff)
  
  I've mentioned being in sped classes before. I feel like math is more of a harder subject depending on what it is. I'd say it was 50/50 and with college it was more normal classes.
  
  As for labeling myself.. I don't even know. I feel like what I was diagnosed with as a kid isn't what I actually might have hence not bringing it up. The doctor didn't even take me into an office or anything. I guess she was spying on me? Didn't talk to me at all. I don't like doctors or hospitals so why play the whole time waiting? Germs.. I'd always get sick. There also wasn't many kids my age to play with either. I was shy but sizing people up. I don't feel like any of the ""symptoms"" relate to me. I tried filing for disability a few years ago and they denied me. So I'm just like ok? I really don't think that doctor was correct. I was on honor roll and other things. It's just whatever at this point. They did want to send me to rehab but like why? I'd be the smartest and most functioning person there (like always, even in sped classes). Also MRI's freak me out just thinking about them so I haven't done anything to see if the disability isn't the right one. 99% sure its something else.

   i bet you would sacrifice your feelings for a bf feelings or friends am i right ?
  ","
  I'm not sure if I understand this right...
  
  I'd say no because in doing so i would kill a part of me. I'm not going to sugar coat anything. I obviously wouldn't want their feelings hurt to begin with. I'm also not going to have someone walk all over me. I'm not going to walk around on egg shells because someone feels that i should be weak. We can still disagree on things without feelings being hurt. If I had no say in anything in a relationship then clearly that is controlling and borderline mental abuse.. I'm definitely a peace maker but I wouldn't sacrifice my identity for anyone. likewise, I wouldn't want the guy (or friends) to always feel like they need to sacrifice a part of themselves to please me. It's give and take. I wouldn't want anything that's one sided.

   recently it was talked about on one of our local radio stations that schools were thinking about providing rooms specifically for students to privately vape. but it was also never stated if they meant high-schools or colleges. what is your opinion on this?
  ","
  I don't get why they'd need a room for that. Also most schools have no smoking grounds on them. Even my college was pretty anti-smoke but they did have those ash tray things as well. No smoking signs near the doors etc granted vaping was just getting started then. I think the money should go towards something useful that the school actually needs regardless of the type.

  Arizona is trying to do the opposite of that.
  
  ""Arizona Representative Heather Carter (R-Cave Creek) is pushing restrictions on access to vapor products in order to combat underage access and use.
  
  Carter’s proposed legislation, SB1009 would treat vapor products as tobacco products at the state level where age verification is concerned. It would also give the Arizona Attorney General’s office the task of conducting age verification compliance checks on retailers which sell vapor products, as it currently does with tobacco products.
  
  SB1009 is not alone on the docket, however. Arizona Senator John Kavanough (R-Fountain Hills) would impose restrictions statewide against vaping in public accommodations such as bars, restaurants, the common areas of hotels and of apartments, and more.
  
  Kavanaugh may have a tougher time implementing his proposed bill, HB 2024, because it is legally an amendment to Arizona’s existingSmoke Free Arizona Act, passed in 2006. An amendment to that legislation would require a Yes vote from three quarters of both Arizona’s House and Senate in order to pass.""

  I suppose bringing back swimwear is supposed to make people buy again? They really should be more size inclusive. They wouldn't have as much problems then. Does it really cost them so much to add a little more fabric? They always seem to have something going on with race as well.
  
  I think I'd fit their clothing.. haven't tried. Pretty much L and XL still on the bottoms. Noticed some people around my size range that still fit in them. I feel like I'd only buy from them if a sale or in desperate need of new bras and underwear. I guess that explains why they have had a lot of sales going since December.

  ","
  I feel like this helps. It is keto related but definitely do-able on any food plans. Sometimes buying in bulk helps too. You can always freeze meat etc.
  
  buy what you need. Just because something is on sale doesn't mean you need X amount of it especially when its something that you rarely have. be a bit picky
  
  most stores also price down meat if its going to expire real soon.
  
  I will be meal prepping sometime this week. I don't really plan my meals. I just go by feeling or I'll see something on instagram, keto fb group or pinterest and want to try it out. great recipes. Sometimes I'll look up IG hashtags for specific items and see the recipes/pictures and get ideas.
  
  I'm sure there are meal planning apps or websites out there. I don't use them. I was using myfitnesspal to track food but Carb Manager is way easier to use while on keto. CM does have recipes on it but you need to pay the premium & I'm not about that 😂
  
  like last night i had chicken and broccoli, ate half and still have some for today. easy hacks like that help.

  True. Make certain ""cheat days"". All in moderation too :P should add more water to get rid of toxins as well. Glad there was improvement :)
  
  Ya. still decent amount. It sucks hearing about others down more pounds, going into week 7 now and still not as much. Was 7.5 down then gained 2 so total of 6 so far while doing it. This is a tracker people use to remember in keto.

  went to Big Lots after that. They had a lot of cute things and some keto snacks, powders and such. I ended up getting a Sriracha vegetable cheese block from there. Had some when i got back, wasn't too bad. Seemed intriguing.

   Happy Keto day! How was your check-in? I have to go every 3 months to start. Got my blood results back and they were improving. I have to bump up the meds for this next 3 months though. The doctor wants to see how good I can get my numbers on a high dose so this is kind of an experiment too.
  ","
  After I see the doc next time, he said that I might only have to see him every 4 months and then if everthing is great and my numbers really get good, then it would be only every 6 months. But I should have my blookd checked every 6 months.

  bit harsh but I understand what you mean. Someone on here came to mind XD
  "
513002,"
   You know, I learned the hard way that one of the worst things you can say to a girl you're looking to date is that she's beautiful. She either knows it already and thinks you're unoriginal, or (like you) she doesn't believe you, thinks you're a player, and doesn't believe anything else you say.
  ","
  I think it's nice to get but they shouldn't always say it either. The meaning ends up dying. Like that Zack guy always calls me sweet... I already know that.
  
  I wouldn't think that the guy is a player. There would need to be more evidence to support that. I would think they were more friendly if anything. unsure of flirting vs being nice.
  
  Just because I don't feel beautiful  (more cute/pretty if anything. 5-7 usually ) doesn't mean that I wouldn't believe anything else someone said.
  
  you shouldn't judge everyone that way. Also if i was dating someone and they never ever paid me any type of complement then i would feel a little shitty about myself. I just don't need them 24/7 lol never is a little extreme

  Someone said ""good night fatty"" on here. I never denied being big, fat, overweight etc so it's definitely not ""a hard truth"" at all. It's more funny that they felt the need to belittle me when they haven't even seen me. I have the mirror, scale, my own thoughts and feelings that tell me the truth. Also I know it's from pcos and not because I eat junk 100% of the time. Can't really cure medical things overnight, dude. I also did the inbody scan which shares a lot of weight related areas. I know what I have to work on and doing that.
  
  whereas someone is just being a d!ck online for no reason. wouldn't surprise me if they were worse off. Jealous of all the ""gorgeous and sexy"" comments too. I don't consider myself that way so they shouldn't feel the need to comment mean things either. anonymous warriors, ya'll.

  Don't be rude on my page.
  
  Also i was thinking more fitness way. Pcos and insulin resistance can fuvk up goals at times. Yes, I have some and met some. Yes, I feel like I can start over at times too. Nobody is perfect. Weight isn't always linear when you have medical problems either. The scale and a # isn't everything. It's not going to change overnight. Goals are nice but I look at the bigger picture in the end as my goal. Also I did an inbody test to learn information about my body. Ideally I'd like to increase skeletal mass and decrease all the other numbers.
  
  Also don't act entitled to know everything. I don't need to share my goals with you. I don't even know you at all. You were anon and now some guy who thinks everyone should answer him in the way that you deem worthy, fuck off with that bullshit attitude.

  ","
  My friend's dad comes to mind. Cheated and new family kind of thing. She'd see him on the weekends. He was never the one to come see her. Even in adulthood, she was the one making time and the commute. She was way more close with her stepdad. He passed a few years ago and it made her have an even bigger falling out with her biological dad. There's probably more resentment since she found him cheating as a young kid.
  "

   Is asking someone's parents for permission to propose to their child more respectful or disrespectful in your opinion?
  ","
  If you two never talked about marriage at all and they went behind your back to ask then i feel like that could be disrespectful. You should really talk about marriage with the person way before they ask you. Or you ask them!
  
  It's a nice gesture but obviously outdated at the same time. Either way, at the wedding they'd ""give you away"" so I just view it in that way? It's their blessing. I feel like if the parents and the soon-to-be bride/groom didn't get along at all then f8ck even asking to begin with lol. Hopefully both are adults and can make their own decisions on the best way to move forward. There's a lot of different wedding etiquette to be looked at.
  
  I think it would be a better surprise to tell parents you got engaged instead of all ""we knew"" kind of thing but I don't really see getting their blessing a bad thing either.
  
  Personally, I could careless what my dad had to offer up but knowing what my mom thought would be nice. Clearly, I'd know ahead of time on her views on the s/o.

  Difference between insulin resistance vs diabetes
  
  ""There might be some similarities in the diagnosis of diabetes and insulin resistance, but they are different medical conditions. In case of IR, the beta cells will keep producing insulin. Even after the muscle and fat cells become resistant to insulin, the pancreas will keep producing more insulin to help the body cells absorb the glucose that has accumulated in the bloodstream. On the other hand, diabetes occurs when the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin or the body becomes resistant to insulin. However, in the long run, IR can lead to prediabetes, which, if not treated, can progress to diabetes. There is no evidence to show why some people develop insulin resistance while others develop a sensitivity to insulin.""

  5. same eye color as my mom (hazel)
  
  6. pcos + insulin resistance
  
  7. I've never worn a bikini even when I was skinny
  
  8. My sister keeps saying that I'm a keto expert because I was helping others in the group lol Feels nice but its weird too. I love fitness but I'm not someone who really talks about it in person. I feel like family would just roll their eyes because a fat girl giving advice or input on certain diets etc Like on one of the family parties weightloss and stuff came up. I stayed out of the discussion. My sister and I both have pcos but I'm big and she's skinny so definitely felt odd being all adding to the subject.

In one part of the dream my leg started to bleed. He ended up moving me out of view into a compartment thing with boxes blocking the way. Ended up being a nurse to me lol remember there was some type of dirt like substance going on my leg to help the bleeding. So feeling trapped and then taken care of and helped to get away.
  
  I went back to bed and had a dream where I was shopping, hung up my purse on a rack to try something on and went back to the rack, the purse wasn't there anymore.

  The same could go for father's. Seems rude to leave each parent out of going to argue that case.
  
  like yes, both are shitty.
  
  I feel like they probably just want attention, making it a ""why me"" kind of thing. Of course all about the tune used. Comparing apples to oranges. One day out of a year vs a lifetime.
  
  Is mentioning it really complaining? I think it's normal to say you are single so therefore not invested in the day. Am I complaining? I don't think so. I'm not all ""why me"". It's just another day. I also don't have to spend money. Don't need to share my love on just ONE day out of the year. 💕💞💕

   I know sugar is a carbohydrate but when you're on a keto diet are you allowed sugar? Or is it all carbs apart from fibre that you're not allowed?
  ","
  Some stuff will obviously contain sugar. more about the net carbs. I still have some fiber but its definitely a smaller portion. You'd subtract thefibergrams from the carbs of the food item to get the Net Carb. Sugar if t has it too.
  
  The app Carb Manager is great to look into. They even have a diabetes tracker too.
  
  We have a keto powdered sugar and Erythritol sweetener for baking.

   Sapiosxual is a term used to describe someone attracted primarily to intelligence and educated people. Does this apply to you? Would you date a sapiosxual?

  ","
  It would be nice but not exactly what I'm after either. I need humor most of all. Most seem like they'd be very stuck up and down talk you if didn't understand something. Intelligence can be sexy but don't want a know it all 24/7 either.

   What do you think about people who bring their hangups from past relationships into new relationships? Are those people worth dating?
  ","
  Some stuff might stay with a person  (abuse related, words etc)
  
  Obviously they should start new with *you*
  
  not every person is going to be the same.
  
  Its just different. getting that trust, building something. With time. When I'm with someone, i only have eyes for them. I wouldn't judge based on past experiences/loves.
  
  If always holding back and fighting about exes, that's not healthy. Better to let the relationship end. take time for yourself. Work on yourself, whether that's physically or mentally.

We were helping with the search party since my sister has a metal detector. Was looking for the car keys that were missing to their abandoned car. He kept asking what I was looking for relationship wise. mentioned cooking dinner and stuff. he seemed clingy but still a decent enough guy..

   What's your opinion on the terms of endearment ""work husband"" & ""work wife""? It's used to refer to the person at your work who you're close to & spend a lot of time with, however many don't like the terms as some people who use them already have a spouse at home & often flirt with their work spouse
  ","
  I wouldn't mind it if it was strictly at work. Don't be all ""my work wife/husband"" to your actual partner? Rather hear their actual name if they do come up.
