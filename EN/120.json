distraction from real life","111522":"i probably wear makeup about half of the time . i learned to apply it from some old fashioned books geared towards young ladies in the s that an old neighbor of mine gave me . they taught basic application and hair styles and grooming and date etiquette and all sorts of weird , sexist , but occasionally useful things . from there , it s just years of practice . these past few years are the first years in my life it s ever been popular to fill in eyebrows like it is now , so i had to learn how to use an eyebrow kit recently and i did so by trial and error .","111523":"i made myself get up and exercise for min which wasn t a lot but it at least eased the feeling of hopelessness a bit . i guess that s really what it s going to come down to forcing myself to go through the motions and do the healthy things until i m ready to roll along on my own without grumbling and getting stuck .","111524":"i m the only person bubo loves for sure . she does not trust new people and will even try to bite some people if she deems them too aggressive . she jumped on my friend kate s shoulder once and gave her kisses but we think that s because kate was wearing a scarf i knitted because normally she won t even tolerate kate s hand for a treat of millet . i am trying to socialize her more to my husband and guests but she s really just a very antisocial baby when it comes to humans . now cats , she likes . she wants to get closer to any cat she sees .","111525":"none , it s a regular day for me . feel free to send a billion questions my way , people reading , because i m in a mental rut and i need something to spark a leap out of it .","111526":"i don t think they re mutually exclusive . i know plenty of creative people without mental illness and vice versa . i don t feel that my creativity comes from my illnesses .","111527":"my name is allison , not google .","111528":"hmmmmm . my husband took me to the aquarium in oregon a few birthdays ago , that was nice . years and years ago when i was still dating other people i went to party in new hampshire that ended with tequila sunrises on the back porch and a diner breakfast , i went to atlantic city to gamble with a date once , i used to go swing dancing with an ex , once i climbed the fence to a graveyard in massachusetts in the middle of the night to try to find jack kerouac s grave . most dates have been pretty normal i d say .","111529":"i have no idea . my first date was to chuck e cheese . my first teen date was to a dollar movie theater where we just made out the whole movie . neither was impressive .","111530":"because they re delusional . the created a version of their victim in their head and have confused it with reality .","111531":"i feel like the obvious answer here is trump . because he s running us towards ww .","111532":"sensuality is like , enjoyment of the senses but sensitivity is a reaction to senses . i think i can be both sensual and

stuff","111536":"gassy","111537":"i was , which i feel is pretty average from the people i ve talked to . it was with a boy named george in a stranger s front yard on a walk in the rain . he was too eager and sloppy . i was embarrassed to be on someone s lawn .","111538":"i d just be available in case they need me .","111539":"i don t and i can t think of anything . as someone with plenty of rare psychological things going on i tend to not focus on that sort of thing .","111540":"once again i have no strong opinions on school because i m old and i am unable to have children and honestly the questions are just getting annoying it feels like you re reading right out of a workbook for a future educator s classwork .","111541":"thanks ! i don t really have a goal in mind . i gained about lbs beginning two years ago when i had my appendix removed because since that point i ve had medical issues after medical issues and haven t been able to exercise . i have plenty more to lose after that should i continue with it but i m not pushing weight loss so much as just being healthy again . it would be great if i could shoot for a size m but i m currently at the low end of plus sizing .","111542":"algebra because i was able to take that class without a tutor but not so with trig","111543":"right after lunch time is when i usually have a burst of energy and want to do chores work .","111544":"i m a bit of a couch potato now , but that comes from being unable to exercise on doctor s orders for like years because of one medical issue after another . i ve been cleared to get back to it as of last month and have lost lbs since i ve been able to exercise again . the summer will be more active for me for sure i like to go on hikes and long walks in the sun","111545":"i don t know . i don t think i ve ever known anyone who didn t love at least one person , a parent or family member or a so or even an unrequited love . it doesn t seem like a thing that happens but i guess it does .","111546":"i prefer to talk through it if i care enough . if i don t care about the person or it s a final straw situation then i d prefer to just walk away .","111547":"your mom","111548":"i wouldn t know i m not a person who commits evil acts . i would assume that there are different reasons for things of an evil nature just like there are different reasons for actions otherwise . i would rather not believe that shitty behaviour started because someone thought it was the right thing to do","111549":"i couldn t say what i like most , i like everything . i like the pretty colored water , and the transformation of the water as the bomb is first dropped i like the perfumes and skin moisturizers and i like just relaxing listening to the fizzing sound and smelling the pretty smells .","111550":"i d say i m the same , i have a pretty strong personality so it s hard to mask it or even dilute it sometimes . the only difference is probably how anxious i am in real life . i mean , i m anxious all the time and online as well but it s major in person .","111551":"i couldn t say . i started an account here to follow others too but i did eventually start sending out questions . i hope some of our followers start sending out more questions , i know you ve said that you re in a similar situation .","111552":"i have lots i m basically a low key hedonist but let s pick just one for the sake of the question lush s bath bombs . i could make them myself for a fraction of the cost but why would i when theirs are perfect","111553":"maybe , but not to any great extent . seems like everyone i talk to of any gender has similar dream types flying , for instance , or being in school again , or various types of anxiety dreams and those are for anyone of any gender . i personally dream mostly about myself as a woman but about of the time i dream about myself as a man and nothing is different other than that so shrug who knows dreams are weird

except for with more farmer s markets and hikes than usual","111557":"oh probably around or so . seems like i believed in the easter bunny for longer than the rest for some reason , don t know why the giant egg laying rabbit seemed the most realistic","111558":"you know what ? i m going to shame any kink that gets in my face and i don t feel bad about that at all . someone has something gross and forward to say about my feet on insta or whatever they are getting shamed . keep it to yourselves . people walking their partners on leashes in full bondage gear in front of children is unacceptable . i don t care what you re into but the world isn t your sex life and no one else consented to your bullshit .","111559":"it s ridiculous and i won t be watching either","111560":"sure , i d eat it . i m willing to try most things .","111561":"when i was a teen and a smoker i would just confidently hand my id to sales clerks even though i was underage because most of the time they didn t even look at the date so that s not really lying but it s definitely sneaky","111562":"no , i don t spend enough time there to need to .","111563":"i don t , really . i use tumblr and am mutuals there with a few people from here alex sterling , natasha stewart , leigh , i feel like probably someone else that i m not recalling pre coffee but tumblr isn t really bloggy blogs it s kinda but i dunno","111564":"poetalunam has a pretty cool job i think , or at least one that s well suited she should probably stay in a position that helps the mentally ill in some way because it s fulfilling to help others for her . sometimes witty should keep their current profession i can t remember if that s secret or not but it seems well suited as well . lumos shreya i just recently began following her but it seems like she really appreciates music and shakespeare and she writes well so maybe something combining those things . transferterotique is going to school for something psych related i believe , she s very interested in the mind from what i can see but is also quite critical and analytical so anything with data and research might be a good fit also .","111565":"spiders . there are no poisonous spiders really to worry about where i live , and where i grew up there were but they were rare and i never encountered those , and the ones i ve seen in the past few years haven t even been very big but i hate them the way they move creeps me out their little eyes full of hate ugh","111566":"we have savings building up for some home improvement projects better decking , clearing a wild backyard , finishing a basement , etc .","111567":"i don t know as much about contemporary artists because i ve not been in classes learning about them this past decade , basically . i just haven t kept up on it on my own . i know what my friends are doing and i have a few artists i like here and there but i don t have as much as a book knowledge about art anymore . my favorite period in art was in europe between the two world wars expressionism , dada , surrealism , cubism , all of these flourished during that time","111568":"i m sure i ll be depressed about it but i doubt i ll take it out on those around me . i didn t enjoy turning because it feels like the end of mid thirties and the beginning of late thirties .","111569":"i taught myself by using a book called stitch n bitch the knitter s handbook . it has really clear instructions and diagrams for beginners as well as some cool beginner patterns . there was one decrease i couldn t get the hang of from the book , a slip slip knit or ssk stitch , so i went to the local craft store and asked their knitting specialist to show me in the store lol .","111570":"she gets up there to preen me , which is flock bonding . she stands on my glasses where she has good access to preen my bangs , my eyebrows , my eyelashes , and my nose ring . when i went on vacation and left her in boarding for weeks last fall , the first thing she did upon seeing me again was preen my eyebrows .","111571":"we have a counselor , we saw times but he won t see us anymore until my husband has had private therapy because he isn t really opening up in couples counseling and seems to have a lot of internal issues outside of me with his job and age and upbringing and whatnot . my personal opinion is that he s having a mid life crisis his th birthday was recently and is taking it out on me a little a lot . i ve done everything in my power to improve on the things he complained of but it s just not enough and i m not really sure what his deal is . i had no complaints about us before he asked for couples counseling .","111572":"i ve taught drawing privately , and in college i taught a printmaking class focussed on acid bite etching so i guess either of those things could be taught by me again . maybe art history as long as it s not dealing with contemporary artists . i can teach someone how to knit but it s not easy because i m left handed and everyone who s come to me to learn how has been a rightie . how to cook i m teaching my husband to cook and he s doing pretty well . i don t think i ve taught anything else , at least not that i can think of now . i could teach people about the birds in my area . how to load a bong for best results . how to make big poofy bows out of ribbon . how to do eye makeup . how to use procreate as an art tool on an ipad . how to play somebody that i used to know by gotye on the ukulele .","111573":"because in general people have zero understanding of mental health and see it as something that good people don t have to worry about . it s pretty gross . there s a long way to come to overcome mental illness stigma .","111574":"when i was younger and more romantic i saw a painting by oskar kokoschka in the boston museum of fine arts that i had seen before in books but it didn t strike me as anything special until i saw it in person . i did cry . i think i sank onto a bench and sobbed . the painting is called two lovers and it depicts the artist and his love obsession , alma mahler . he even made a life sized doll of her later in his life . total weirdo .","111575":"i guess if it s against family or society s wishes , i dunno . love is one of those topics i roll my eyes about lately . it doesn t seem worth the hassle .","111576":"i don t know anything about love but it seems to me that it s happened and happens both ways .","111577":"sneakers . i have a bunion on my right foot had one on my left also that was worse but it had to be surgically altered i don t own but one pair of heels and i only have those to look at basically because wearing them is a bitch","111578":"i don t personally think i am like that . my husband of years nearly is . recently we struggled a little with things and he informed me that he doesn t find me attractive anymore . it s one of those things you can t take back . i doubt he d have the nerve to say something like that to someone he doesn t know as well .","111579":"lol i hadn t thought that it could be a marketing ploy , interesting . i mostly think that people like to judge their friends and trivial things to judge them for makes them feel weirdly superior . winning in a trivial way is still winning . even if it s really unclear who wins .","111580":"my husband ordered pizza a few nights ago and it was pepperoni . personally , i can t remember the last time i ordered pizza but my favorite toppings are olives , anchovies , and mushrooms","111581":"i have to be in control . which seems strange for me to say considering all of the casual drug use but i am always aware of my surroundings and my options . it s part of panic disorder i m sure .","111582":"it s up and down . i m withdrawing from one antidepressant while switching into a new dosage of another over the past weeks and for the next week and it s not easy on my system at all . thank you for the kind thoughts","111583":"bubo s a flock bird for sure but i spend enough time with her daily that myself and the rest of the household have become her new flock . i got her specifically to spend time with me to keep panic away and she s my emotional support animal but if a time comes where i can t spend as much time with her i might consider another parakeet for company .","111584":"i was lucky to have many great teachers throughout my school years including a few i m still in touch with on facebook or whatever nowadays but there was one that was creepy so let s talk about that . i had a teacher who was sort of a father figure to me growing up who i went to with a lot of my problems and who i thought was an important part of my life but then when i turned and graduated he got wicked creepy and sent me love notes and jewelry so like , that basically cemented my distrust of men .","111585":"wtf is this even","111586":"i m in a crappy mood and it s raining but other than that , just fine .","111587":"yeah it s probably best to label things in case people have specific dietary needs or restrictions","111588":"i don t try to look attractive at all lately someone close to me told me they thought i was unattractive and it s wounded my self confidence .","111589":"independence . truly being able to support myself","111590":"yes . kids burn through calories more quickly than adults and need plenty of protein and while both can be acquired vegan probably it would mean careful planning .","111591":"bubby is hilarious when she takes a shower in the kitchen sink . she spreads her wings out and runnnnnnns through the water and rubs her face in the water gathering on the bottom of the sink and flings water back on her backside","111592":"ooof it s been about a decade since i ve played but i d say i m above average . no one suspects the adult woman to be the one sniping them so i scoot under most people s radar .","111593":"i am not a poetry fan but i ll maybe check her out later . always good to learn about more black women in humanities at any rate .","111594":"almost all of my dreams are recurring . they come in phases . when i was a child i had a recurring nightmare about jabba the hutt and not being able to understand what he was saying to me . lately , i dream that i m moving from one small apartment to another over and over again . before that , for years i dreamed of a mall and a school that were part of a complex that i basically did everything in and there were bad scientists that lived underground that want to experiment on me .","111595":"someone sent this question to me and made me read it with my own two eyes","111596":"yeah , i had a rough time with trigonometry at first until i got a tutor","111597":"absolutely","111598":"laser tag for sure less painful","111599":"i guess falsely accused and angry ? i ve never been in a situation like this and school is a million years behind me .","111600":"i suppose i embrace it , or at least understand vulnerability . because i m an empathetic person and care about others and myself .","111601":"i don t have any elaborate thoughts on dreams other than they happen . i don t know why , i don t speculate why , my therapists seem uninterested in them , it s boring to hear about other people s unless something really silly is happening , i don t ever feel like i can access anything it s out of my control but whether it s my unconscious mind or a replay of the day s concerns or whatever shrug . my dreams are vivid and boring and anxiety filled .","111602":"i do , but i also don t feel obligated or interested in reading every book to find it s worth .","111603":"no one episode of angel stands out , but i have a definite favorite buffy . it s probably everyone s favorite the episode when the gentlemen took the voices of everyone in town they were so absolutely creepy and spooky and the direction of the episode without dialogue was amazing .","111604":"i saw every episode , and then every episode of angel . loved it . feel old now .","111605":"i have a very strong memory so this hasn t really happened that i m aware of . i tend to remember things pretty accurately and with detail . at least , long term . short term memory is wonky because of how much weed i smoke .","111606":"i live in a house that s build into a slope , so the main floor is really the upstairs and the downstairs is set into the ground an unfinished basement . wind whips down the hill and whistles around the corner like no one s business . i guess that s sort of similar to creaking . we have some creaky floorboards as well . the sounds don t bother me because i have cats and a bird here that are nonplussed by such noises . if some noise happened that the pets all acted very alert to , i might suspect it more .","111607":"i have . it s heart wrenching","111608":"house hunters","111609":"i d rather stay home i m sleepy today","111610":"mostly i just idle away at the computer on social media but there are breaks for meditating , playing dance central on xbox for exercise , smoking up , long baths , knitting . on the rare days i m feeling chatty , talking to a friend helps .","111611":"i d put a spell on emperor cheeto and force him to resign","111612":"i say bad words all the time but i don t curse people with spells or anything","111613":"well i m not sure what to recommend but my current favorite song is ivan by von sell","111614":"i m not really willing to pay anything right now i rarely wear t shirts and have so many already anyway","111615":"i m a big fan of steven universe and bob s burgers","111616":"yes it reminds me of being yelled at by my mother as a kid . i feel like i am guilty of something i m not guilty of when someone debates me . like it s really anger that s compelling them . it s why i struggle with some of the anons so much probs .","111617":"i am , and i have a great team of doctors and a psychotherapist and psychiatrist i trust . it s been immensely helpful to get out from under her toxicity and seek out what i needed to start repairs .","111618":"bubo really loves my keyboard . she thinks its her toy , and the back part where the cable comes out especially is her favorite part because she likes to snuggle against it and scratch her cheeks . because it s hers , it s not mine . while i was answering your previous question , she bit me several times because i m pounding my fingers on her toy . not hard enough to hurt but enough to try to warn me away . now she s sitting on the side fussing at me .","111619":"one cat views me as her personal bed , she sleeps on my legs and demands i go to bed when it s bedtime in her book so that she can get comfortable . she understands the word nap and loves it almost as much as the word treat . the other two cats are the beta cats , i think they view me as alpha instead of the alpha cat . they act like normal cats and don t seem to have any major expectations from me other than a head pat once in awhile .","111620":"i avoid fried foods when i m opting to eat healthier but i don t ever buy lite foods because i ve read that they re less healthy than full fat . except diet soda , i just prefer the taste of diet regular is too sweet .","111621":"my dad and i get along fine , my mother is abusive and is dead to me .","111622":"i tend to keep the circles around me similar to myself in ideologies . i hate debating , i don t have a lot of respect for people on the conservative side of things .","111623":"we should","111624":"shower for cleanliness , but i do love a relaxing bath a few times a month with a perfumed bath bomb or some epsom salts . my bathtub is small and i am tall and wide though so i do really wish i had a fancier tub .","111625":"i don t have one . i don t spend very much time on wikipedia .","111626":"every rich person should have an aviary mine would be of small parrots adopted from rescues . i like them because they re smart and affectionate . i

or not i have met and petted rojo the therapy llama featured in the article . he and his owner were at my county fair as we re in the portland area . i don t know if i d give him a carrot kiss but i love the idea of therapy llamas . he was very soft and calm . i didn t get to hang out with any llamas the couple of times i was in the hospital last year but we did have a therapy dog come by and that was super cute . they gave me a little trading card with facts about the dog on it the whole thing was adorable .","111634":"yellow , for bubo s pretty face and for the color of the eyedrops my optometrist used today in my annual glaucoma workup .","111635":"i only have the one parakeet but she has enough personality for a flock . she s very adventurous , affectionate , bossy , and confident . she loves to explore and try new foods and places , she loves to fight with her mirror friend , she loves to boss the cats and me around she s known to fly towards them and run after them like a big bully , she loves to give me kisses and rub her fluffed out head feathers against my cheek and is quick to run to my fingers when she wants cheek scritches .","111636":"bubo has three feline flockmates , rin , kyo , and mimi . rin is very much a cat and wants to hunt bubo . bubo is a little wary of rin . kyo is terrified of bubo . she s a bully with him because she knows he ll run away . she likes to peck at his tail and jump on his back when he s asleep . mimi and bubo have some sort of understanding . mimi is very patient with bubo and lets her ride her and preen her fur . i don t let them hang out too much because i have to supervise so closely just in case and because mimi only tolerates it and while she s patient now who knows how long that will last .","111637":"not unless i m very cold or in the hospital where they insist on those slipper socks all the time","111638":"hi","111639":"i have not , but a few have chased me down the street or similar nightmare situations i

norm , or cooked well enough that it feels different .","111644":"there was a small apartment on the bottom floor in newport news , va that i was convinced was haunted and therefore couldn t get anything done . i was probably having a psychotic break because i wasn t medicated at the time and i m schizophrenic , but i saw some really terrible things in that place . i think i did one painting the entire time i was there and it was dark . the place also only had one window and that one window faced the shaded parking lot so it was just dark and gross .","111645":"i have bajillion scars . the most recent is a v shaped scar on my left forearm from about months ago . when i first started going to visit my parakeet at the nursery she was born at , there was a group of cages in the back where the bonding area was for not so nice parrots . one of them is norman , who needs to stay in his cage unless supervised because he s a biter . norman has a friend named carmen , who is allowed to wander and normally doesn t do anything other than hang outside of norman s cage . i was there with my bby , she flew out of my hands and under carmen , carmen pretended he was going to groom my hair so i held out my arm for him to perch on while i grabbed my baby , and instead of perching he deliberately and slowly bit me . parrots can be total assholes .","111646":"i hate when y all use the word

cabinet where we d scream sex ! each time mr . and mrs . pacman went off screen together between levels . it became something that we were kinda known for there and the regulars would yell sex ! with us after a while . i still think about that everytime i get an opportunity to play mrs . pacman . the rest of the nights included greek pizza , drawing in sketchbooks at a diner , and then laying in the back of his truck watching the stars in a cornfield .","111652":"not an artificial smile , but a selfie from earlier today","111653":"nothing i m comfortable sharing , but even my worst actions

the mindfulness solution , have been trying to work on mindfulness and meditation but i m really bad at it , i ve drawn a few birds , watched some hgtv and diy shows . mostly i ve just rested and healed . it s been cabin fever y but i have in the later half of these months been able to get out at least once a week to doctor s appointments and the grocery store or whatever .","111655":"just what restrictions i place on myself . i m supposed to ease into things , try out different shoes , stretch my foot really well daily , etc . currently i m still limping so it seems like even if i m technically healed next week i ll probably still be tender for a while .","111656":"i d probably buy my husband a used truck so i can have the car we currently share during the day while he s at work and so we ll have a truck for hauling things which seems almost necessary now that we re homeowners .","111657":"i m passionate about art and social justice and i ve just always been that way . i ve

anyone for sure . it s all in how you look at things around you really . drawing a still life doesn t start with outlines of the objects , it starts with where the shadows and lights fall . if you

houses around us were built in the late s or roundabouts . one holiday weekend when everyone was out of the building except for me , one ra and a handful of other students who couldn t or didn t travel home for long weekends shit got weird . it started with me sitting in my living room on a winter day , windows closed and heat on as one does . i was chain smoking and listening to music while doing homework . after getting up to get a soda , i noticed a smell . a strong , dangerous smell linseed oil . across the apartment somehow my roommate s oil painting supplies had upturned on their own and soaked half of the floor . the fumes were unbearable and as i ran to the window to open it , all four burners of our gas stove came on by themselves . there could have been an explosion if i hadn t acted so fast i m sure of it or at least a fire . i got things as clean and operational as possible , sat down on the sofa to rest , and noticed that the curtains in my bedroom were waving wildly , standing almost straight out with a closed window . as i went down the short hallway to investigate , the door slammed in my face and i decided that this was enough i wasn t playing with ghosts anymore . i started yelling that i wasn t scared i was and that this was my home and they needed to leave . as a response , every light in the house turned off . i walked around , terrified , turning each light back on one by one while talking a big game about being not scared and demanding i be left alone . the last lamp refused to turn on . i felt like every hair on my body was standing up , i didn t feel safe , so i went downstairs to ask my ra to come up and tell me i was imagining things . when he got there , the bedroom doors were open and the windows were closed and all of the lights were on . however , as he walked towards the hallway , the curtains did the thing again and the door closed again and he noped out and took me back to his place for the night until he could get his friend who was a witch to come over and cleanse the place the next day . we didn t have any other problems past that other than one of my roommates swearing she could hear voices in the walls .","111712":"thank you i was snowed in most of my birthday so i sat at home until late afternoon when my husband kindly dug out the car and scraped the driveway so we could at least get out for dinner

broke me down and ruined my life and credit and self esteem and home and everything . i tried to ask for help from friends and family but at the time everyone thought he was so fucking charming . i tried to ask for help from the police but they turned me away because his father was a police officer . the only way i got out was by attempting suicide . he knew he did that to me . he dumped my

beliefs , the confidence that comes with being relaxed and sure which honestly i don t get much of but weed helps","111867":"named my husband my proxy for advanced care directives and met with a

to keep messaging someone who asked you not to , it s rude to not rsvp to an evite , etc . i can t think of anything specifically online that isn t sort of like regular offline etiquette but basically
