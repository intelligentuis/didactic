continue fucking around on the computer and drinking coffee . eventually light therapy ends and i grab a glass of water , take my meds , and go outside to smoke up . from there the rest of the day is spent in between chores , smoking , playing with bubo , and relaxing at my desk until like , pm when my husband gets home then we fix dinner and watch tv together and then i generally end out my night at my desk again , sometimes painting , sometimes whatever , until bedtime which is early because i take night meds at pm and generally get very tired within an hour of that .","108431":"if i was

guess . it s like wine , it has tannins in it . they re extra bitter to some people but acceptable to some people . it s a weird thing .","108442":"it s acquired for sure lol . i started drinking it with milk and sugar and then just milk and now black . i had to work up to the bitterness haha . but now that i like it , i realllllly like it","108443":"that s really rough , i m sorry . the only

now . unless they have a fancy frappe like the unicorn or zombie ones","108445":"well i got bubo thinking i could train her to talk because her breed is capable of it but she just doesn t want to . males are more likely to talk than females . she mimics other birds but not people . when her time is finished i may look into a slightly larger breed and try the talking thing over again . i ll probably try for a male next time just because bubo lays eggs once a year and it s a month that i don t have her support emotional services when she s laying on her eggs . but she is a perfect baby

twice a year so that s two wing clippings and she just has her toes done while she s there for her wings .","108564":"i got her from a store in my town that specializes in parrots . they rehome larger breeds and breed smaller companion breeds and work with the rescue people to foster birds so it s a really great store . she was hand reared to be good with people , and trained to step up before she came home with me at weeks old . i was able to come visit her after weeks old which i did several times so that she d remember me . she still goes back there for grooming wings , toenails and for boarding when i m unable to keep her overnight somewhere like for instance i drove across the country years ago so she had to stay in boarding because it would have been cruel to have her in the car that long .","108565":"i m still in the pajama pants and long sleeved jersey dress i wore to bed . i ll be changing into probably a flannel , a tunic , and leggings when i get up and get clean and

psyched about how ca is handling cannabis legalization , with the pardoning or revisiting cases of retroactive crimes committed over small amounts of drugs because the criminalization of weed has always led to more people of color being treated harshly for next to nothing and now they re trying to fix that . i want my state to do the same . we ve been legal years now , but nothing about those in prisons for small time pot offenses has been discussed yet that i know of .","108578":"you could easily google these definitions . urbanism is the study of an urban area and urbanization is the act

color are treated worse in ways that effect like every part of living . when i was harassed by cops as an unruly teen , i never had to worry about being shot to death like a person of color does . i think about that a lot . i ve been stopped by so many officers for so many small things and in a lot of cases i was drunk or psychotic and they definitely could have seen me as a risk and killed me but my whiteness saved me .","108580":"the relationships we have with each other , the hope of continued good experiences , the expression of life","108581":"both , generally . i m actually kinda

women","108636":"it slowed down for us but that s mainly because i am on a lot of psychiatric meds that make my sex drive next to nothing .","108637":"nah , my husband is a very accepting man i wasn t worried . he had questions about in particular my tastes that part fascinated him lol we like different types of girls .","108638":"i just told him it wasn t difficult at all","108639":"because i just

experiences , like shadow men . or like , lake monsters . or abductions . so it s an interesting theory but i tend to believe that i was just an active paranoid schizophrenic .","108973":"i do somewhere in the garage , it has old letters from pen pals and art people gave me in high school and that sort of thing . mostly notes .","108974":"i cook maybe once a week just me cooking for him . we eat out times a week , and the rest of the week we cook together as a team . he s recently taken interest in cooking because of various diets he reads about or whatever and because a friend of his is a very good cook so i welcome his help in the kitchen for sure .","108975":"yeah but the tasks are pretty mundane lol . i m listening to music , waiting for a dryer to finish , and getting ready to make a bowl of parsley and ice water for bubo to take a bath in","108976":"i am lucky enough that i mostly recognize things as delusion when it comes to hallucinations and voices at least . the example i used with the black birds , for instance , i knew that they weren t really there for other people so it wouldn t be something i d share . the delusions of persecution and stuff was way more believable so sometimes i would try to explain those things to people . for instance i thought my apartments in mass were haunted and believed that for years and have told the ghost stories many times but now that i m on antipsychotics i realize that it was more delusion than truth so i wish i hadn t of blabbed my mouth so much .","108977":"no way","108978":"i had so many fears that normal things didn t phase me . it s like , priorities . when you think your landlady summoned a demon with the help of the freemasons and it s targeting you , or like , think you re being followed by a flock of black birds that you can see and that it s an omen that something bad will happen to me , other things like social anxiety take a backseat .","108979":"no . i wouldn t be able to hunt i don t think . i don t like to think about where my meals come from . if it wasn t for the cost , convenience , and my medical restrictions , i would be vegan easily .","108980":"i think a part of him enjoyed how wild i was p i m more afraid of that now than i was then . i hopefully have nothing to worry about though . i just worry sometimes that i m pretty boring or hopeless or i dunno . at least when i was delusional i was really taking life by the horns .","108981":"yeah , i like to do something special . this past one i went to eugene , or to the cascade raptor center to see the rehabilitated owls and other birds . we also went out to dinner of my choosing , which was a seafood feast .","108982":"nope no kids . as well as being mentally ill i won the medical issue lottery and also have several physical issues including polycystic ovarian syndrome which has left me infertile .","108983":"he has some seasonal depression and mild anxiety issues that he goes to therapy for as needed but otherwise not really he s the stable one","108984":"i guess they got away with a crime , but i like to think it at least haunted them while they were living","108985":"scholarship and marrying up i guess p like we weren t below the poverty line just like , barely above it . i m sure white privilege helped me out and also just luck","108986":"twin peaks , but i do know some people who fangirl as hard as me now that i live in the pacific nw where it took place","108987":"i look around my desk for my bird when she s safely away in her cage frequently . it s almost a tic . if i don t feel her on my shoulder i do a quick scan every time i m at my desk because often , she s at my desk with me . it started when she was a baby and she got on the floor without me noticing and i can t soothe myself enough to stop even when i hear her singing merrily from her cage behind me","108988":"i can t think of anyone i idolize , i tend to view others as human beings with faults and strengths so while i admire others i don t really set anyone way above the rest","108989":"no i don t think so , which is sad and lonely to think probably","108990":"i ve never really thought about it . it s kinda creepy but then again i m sure there are medical reasons why it would be good like as organ donors or something , i dunno . didn t the animal experiments not turn out that well ? i don t remember the fate of dolly the sheep","108991":"nope but i guess if it comes down to it it s better them than me","108992":"hey hey hey","108993":"nah i ve never been rich enough i grew up poor and now am middle class but still not well off .","108994":"that s what i ve played as in elder scrolls games more than anything else followed by khajiit","108995":"i wouldn t know i haven t kept fish since i was a kid","108996":"a fried chicken breast i didn t finish from dinner the other night , a bag of curly parsley for bubo , several cans of my husband s favorite , pineapple juice","108997":"orange is the new black","108998":"i mean i probably have but i don t dwell on such deep topics often because it just leads to depression or feeling like something s missing","108999":"i don t . i was raised atheist . i toyed with spirituality in my younger years but i think it was mixed up with my schizophrenic delusions a lot , so now that i m on antipsychotics i no longer have any of those tentative beliefs .","109000":"i guess if one is broken in a way that the other is not then there s still some strength left in other places to help others","109001":"ben","109002":"nope hide it away in a shoebox or whatever and read it a few years from now and feel glad that time passed and you got it off your chest","109003":"i enjoy taking pictures though i wish my phone camera had a better auto focus","109004":"i ve never seen either but i m more interested in vampires than zombies","109005":"ketchup i hate it it s so nasty","109006":"pets but no kids is my life now and i m fine with it","109007":"i like all the weird names to be honest like chicago west isn t that bad of a name it s kinda cute","109008":"depends . sometimes i brush them off , sometimes i sulk","109009":"yeah a few times i m severely mentally ill that s one thing i m not that comfortable talking about as far as mental health goes though . suicide attempts are intensely personal for most people","109010":"i smoke pot every night . and day .","109011":"inorite","109012":"nah i think most people come to appreciate what they have at some point there s no such thing as life that s too good","109013":"http www . smh . com . au world he ate raw fish almost every day until a footlong tapeworm slithered out of his body h llkc . html okay it was ft i don t know why i thought ft","109014":"i dunno , i guess any time i might die . i ve never been in a situation where i ve thought i might starve to death before though .","109015":"yeah kind of in that i acknowledge that most things are holidays but like i do more for my birthday than i do easter or whatever and christmas gets decorations but the other holidays don t","109016":"loads of really unnecessary things i have panic disorder and i just really have a hard time going places alone or driving or being in crowds or being away from my house for long or talking on the phone even . i can t explain why it just happens .","109017":"i d like to think i wouldn t but who knows what i would do once survival mode has kicked in","109018":"there s a guy in fresno who had an foot long tapeworm dangling out of him from eating raw fish daily","109019":"no way i am way too anxious for that","109020":"yes this past one i picked seafood . in the past i ve chosen lebanese , jordanian , thai , indian , cheeseburgers , diner food , and greek and probably more i can t remember . japanese at least a couple of times .","109021":"well i hadn t before but now i have lol","109022":"my teeth are kinda weird but i like em anyway . i brush twice daily with a regular fluoride toothpaste and see a dentist twice a year","109023":"how advanced are their medical abilities , or like , can they heal us or what do they know bigfoot how long have they been buzzing around observing us before making contact","109024":"this whole unapologetically white campaign i ve heard about is the most asinine , butthurt , idiotic thing ever . i don t have much more to say on the topic than that .","109025":"maybe once a month if that i don t love going","109026":"i prefer to wade through the nitty gritty and talk it out . i hate leaving something unfinished for a few days","109027":"because i don t know that s just how it s done i guess it s mainly to safely let the passengers out and to stay out of the way of direct traffic","109028":"nobody i would hate to be anyone besides me i m really good at being me","109029":"a vampire because live forever and also , hot","109030":"life","109031":"i don t remember you sending a weird question so i guess not lol if things get super deep my brain shuts down though . send whatever anyway","109032":"i dunno a cheeseburger sounds pretty good to me","109033":"a little bit of both . sometimes i feel very tiny inside of my body though . and sometimes i feel like my mind has expanded out .","109034":"probably existing not much differently than now . i hope that i m still well managed mentally and able to do art .","109035":"when it comes to joint and muscle pain , yes . i definitely notice a difference between what my joints can handle now versus when i was younger . otherwise not really . like i have a white eyebrow hair that i keep plucking . the skin around my eyes is thinner .","109036":"if you scroll back a few days i posted a pic of my yard . it s completely overgrown and on a slope .","109037":"it is legal for someone with a medical license to grow up to plants . i have considered it , sure , but i when i looked into the amount of money it would cost to convert part of my garage into a grow and to properly raise it it just didn t seem worth the money or effort .","109038":"this got too twisty for me i just wanna enjoy life","109039":"no but i feel like i probably could have believed that back before i took antipsychotics","109040":"yeah i kinda love looking in the mirror a little haha . it s reassuring to see yourself looking back .","109041":"i don t know , i ve not bought it illegally . it goes as low as g for flower though so that seems probably pretty competitive if i was guessing .","109042":"not really , it s been legal here recreationally for or years now and medically since . the dispensaries are frequented by college kids and grandmas at about the same rate . there s always a wide variety of folks when i go from all walks of life .","109043":"depends on the strain . they have strains that have virtually no thc , and are high cbd they have concentrates that are only cbd , but in general most weed has some thc and a little bit of cbd . so most strains can get you high just not as much as something bred specifically for high thc","109044":"nope","109045":"being genuine","109046":"depends on where it comes from . generally if i buy it in or it s labeled as medical , but if i buy it in wa it s labeled as recreational . just because of how the dispensaries work .","109047":"that is an old wive s tale from when there were very few real studies on schizophrenia . in reality , it s a genetic disorder , like most things .","109048":"standard edibles don t do shot for me because my tolerance is very high but i did buy some bho concentrate in a syringe not long ago as a birthday gift to myself to dose my own coffee and that was pretty amazing . i see myself buying that again in the future .","109049":"sometimes i do , at least a few details or a certain mood or something . last night i dreamed i was in a p . e . class and didn t want to be there but they were insistent that i had to stay and they made me drink a protein shake before putting on some gross red sweatpants","109050":"lol i ve never heard that , what in the world . i smell like a human being who uses lavender soap and smokes a lot of weed","109051":"yeah some podcast i used to listen to but haven t in a while , mysterious universe , talked about one of his books once i think ? him or someone with similar work to him . they used to really like to talk about ayahuasca in particular on the show","109052":"eventually my friend found me but i sort of snuck away unnoticed it was a weird party . i don t officially know if it was lsd i just assume because of the type of people i knew at the edge of my groups who would be malicious enough to drug someone , and because the visual hallucinations and delusions with the solidified cigarette smoke . i ended up being schizophrenic so i don t know if that s just how other drugs affect us or if i hallucinate differently than others or what .","109053":"someone dosed me with lsd when i was , in my drink . i had a very bad trip . it was at a party . i crawled away because i thought the smoke hanging in the air was solid and sort of went on a weird , crawling trip through someone s garden and ended up curled up asleep on the front porch . that s my only experience . i ve never taken any drugs on purpose except cannabis which was recommended by my doctors .","109054":"thank you","109055":"he only gets what s left in a cup after i ve eaten all the yogurt out , so that little bit is fine for him . i ve had to put pills for him in yogurt before so he would take them so at those times it was like , a teaspoon . he just started whining when i was eating yogurt one day so i let him lick the bowl and now if he hears the foil top come off of a yogurt cup , he comes running . he doesn t finish vanilla or any creamy flavors but he will get every last drop of most fruit flavors especially strawberry . sometimes , he gets so into licking the cup that it gets stuck on his snout and i have to help him out .","109056":"nope , i just have one bird and she has shown no interest in talking though her species is capable of it","109057":"shehitsback","109058":"it s kinda weird and i can only eat it once in a while but when i want it i really want it . also , one of my cats really loves strawberry yogurt .","109059":"i

sick","109062":"i don t know so i m going to go with . . . . your mom .","109063":"yes , and i m not sure , something does keep me going though i guess fear of nothingness , it s better to have a tomorrow than it is to not .","109064":"i sleep too well probably . like , hours ish .","109065":"i don t think i ve ever ordered food at starbucks so i m not sure what to advise","109066":"rainbow by kesha","109067":"i like wendy s best","109068":"probably my mom","109069":"wendy s because the training videos that popped up on youtube are amazing","109070":"madison , tyler , anything with a y in it somewhere","109071":"measurements . we create them so we can categorize things but they re not tangible things that occur in nature they re an illusion or a construct we all adopted time for instance is an illusion","109072":"you mean like , phone ? it s a moto g plus","109073":"a gallery in ma was willing to hang a one woman show of my art at the time and i was so proud of myself but then psychosis took over and i ended up bailing on it and fleeing the state .","109074":"knitting again lol . it comes and goes . i have some unfinished work just sitting on my desk glaring at me .","109075":"forests , sunny days , hearing from friends , ocean day trips , feeling stable and feeling loved","109076":"staying motivated to do anything . it s the negative symptom of schizophrenia i haven t been successful in treating . some days it s hard to get up from my chair .","109077":"everything is starting to bloom i love flowers","109078":"i am bad at baking desserts so i would like to be better at that","109079":"any big city in ohio . that state is pure mediocracy","109080":"my husband . my doctors . weed . my friends","109081":"i am married for nearly years now . he copes because

that s the longest mindfulness exercises i ve successfully completed","109087":"i m okay with myself mostly though i do appreciate social media so i can get outside of my head once in a while","109088":"i d be afraid of the spiders but it would be worth it for the birds","109089":"i follow another member here who has schizophrenia but she s recently diagnosed so it s a lot different . i met a musician when i was in my early s who was also schizophrenic but he passed away shortly after . otherwise , we re only of the population so it s pretty lonely lol . i found out recently i m the only person at my pharmacy on my particular schizophrenic medicine so they didn t notice when the shipment was late but i of course did","109090":"no it sucks . i live in america . we have good doctors but only the privileged can see them .","109091":"i was raised to believe that it s all a random event but i don t know what i truly believe . a lot of speculation about religion and spirituality has been entangled with schizophrenic delusions so it s hard for me to really decide what to believe .","109092":"no , the opposite . i struggled to find my artistic voice again for a long time but i ve been grateful lately and have been able to paint again","109093":"you mean why it came on to begin with ? it s hereditary i have a great aunt who was severely mentally ill and i suspect the genes came from her","109094":"i used to . i m considered residual schizophrenic which means basically treated or managed but before i was on a reliable antipsychotic i heard and saw things that weren t there as well as believed things that weren t true","109095":"yup","109096":"no but i do sell enough to keep selling . i don t make a living period . my husband supports us and if it weren t for him , i d be on disability .","109097":"no , when i was i never expected in a million years that i would be schizophrenic or suffer from panic disorder . but i do , and i manage , and i at least always thought i d be an artist and lo and behold i am so that s good","109098":"hey brody i just checked it out , i dig your work a lot it s so modern and bright","109099":"interesting","109100":"acrylic painting lately , which is a bit different from my background in oils . but i have a pet bird now so i have to worry about fumes .","109101":"my life s purpose is to create until i can t . i am an artist .","109102":"i was mostly joking but if you re feeling like your self is changing a lot or that you have several versions of self or if you don t know what to claim as self then for real those are symptoms .","109103":"i already am old lol . i just turned on the th . i think about it a lot when i talk to my grandmother who is especially . and my father in law , who has alzheimer s . we gotta do what we can for however long we can though .","109104":"then you need to go see a doctor because you have a personality disorder","109105":"you learn to depend on yourself and make self the center of your world .","109106":"because they re comforting . because i m addicted to bad foods . because i care less about what goes in my body than what goes on my body . i dunno . it s just not something i ever worried about .","109107":"i do especially right now i had a friend pass and everyone from that era of my life has sort of come together to reconnect and it s kind of beautiful","109108":"no i don t . i m much better about policing my beauty products than my food . i usually only buy vegan or cruelty free makeup but i have no qualms about eating gross fast food . it s something i should work on .","109109":"nah , i still feel way connected to nature when i want to and it doesn t take much more than peeling myself away from a screen and going . i think it depends on where you live maybe . i live in a very outdoorsy place","109110":"just like it , and then only like once a month and preferably if it s fairtrade","109111":"i think things can be repaired and we can do better for sure . we might have to do it without chocolate though , i keep reading that that will be extinct by","109112":"hey i want you to know i m comfortable with our friendship no matter what your feelings are but i think i like you or just i think you re cute","109113":"i ve been thinking about this all evening and i just can t come up with anything i think that through my therapist journeys over the years i ve learned to be very grateful and mindful of things in my life so i hope i haven t taken anything for granted .","109114":"i find both overrated and i m sorry i feel guilty for that there are so many reason i should love them both","109115":"i m one of those people who gets embarrassed but plays it off like i don t care about anything so i can t remember any particular instance where i was humiliated because i kind of just take what is thrown at me and move on with my life .","109116":"yes , i do . feeling understood can do wonders for a person . it sucks to complain all the time but in moderation , complain away it s totally normal .","109117":"thanks","109118":"i do not but i welcome anyone to follow me on instagram instead at shehitsback","109119":"a friend from high school was murdered yesterday . i ve been messaging phoning all of our old friends to let them know . i feel sad , and a little angry , and also selfishly i feel like i should have been closer to the deceased or i should reach out to more old friends to say hi because you just don t know how much time anyone has .","109120":"no and no lol . i m estranged from my mom and while i have a good relationship with my dad i have serious abandonment issues from some cptsd shit and he left when i was little so i don t know if i ll ever trust him for realz .","109121":"this is such a strange postmodern question . they re just tv i don t believe in any of them if i was still a kid in the s my answer would be mtv","109122":"heading to eugene , or to

tbh","109126":"i ve never even heard of gram parsons","109127":"good morning","109128":"panic probably that s what i d do","109129":"penicillin and mango","109130":"yeah , i used to slug down peach schnapps secretly as a small child to try to get out of school because of stomachache i didn t really drink recreationally until i was or so though .","109131":"john , but mental illness and circumstance sort of ruined that for me in the end . i think he s married with kids now . like basically everyone my age .","109132":"squeeze water out of my hair","109133":"hi ! i m . name s allison . i am married . i do not have children . i m a capricorn . i finished two years of college . i like both but i have cats . i don t want cant have kids . lime .","109134":"well , i just had a birthday and i didn t necessarily want anything but my various family members sent anyway so lucky me . i plan on hiring a maid to deep clean my house with that and maybe buy that one chocolate gold palette from too faced","109135":"the love and support of my partner , competent doctors and an empathetic medical team , the love and calming my esa bird brings , cannabis , modern medicine , friends , social media","109136":"i just turned on the th in fact . thank you . i think the best advice i can give on looking your best while aging is to stay hydrated . like , so hydrated . always drink water .","109137":"i can t have children but if i did they would be fully vaccinated .","109138":"i wouldn t ever tickle a kid or an adult i find it creepy and borderline abusive . miss me with your fetish questions .","109139":"carrie fisher . she seemed so genuine and loving .","109140":"this is old . . . like . but i love it this was the painting that got me a scholarship to my college","109141":"my art . i love my illustrations as much as i love my expressionistic paintings . i think i have a true talent .","109142":"well i started off high school being bullied for being different like i had all through elementary and middle , but i quickly put a stop to that shit and came up from the bottom to the top of my school , collecting up all the freaks and weirdos as my friends and becoming alt popular . by my senior year i was feeling like i was on top of the world . i had good friends and the respect of my peers . college was more of the same , both high school and all of my schooling and college were art specific so i was like queen of the artsy kids . until schizophrenia then i sort of unraveled and had to leave school and lost a lot of the confidence i had .","109143":"i m in the in between stages of growing short hair out long . it s about chin length now and wavy and i normally wear it down and combed over from a side part like a bob or else i clip the front parts back from my face . right now i have it pulled back into a stubby little ponytail which i probably wouldn t do in public until it s a little longer .","109144":"specifically owls i collect owl stuff my house is full of them but birds in general are pretty good . i feed wild birds and hummingbirds on my patio and have my service animal baby , bubo .","109145":"no not really . i never know what to say and end up being cliche probably but i deeply care and i want them to feel better i just don t know the best way to verbalize that . i like to think my friends understand though .","109146":"technically bubo is a parrot , just the smallest type . her breed can talk but mostly only the males learn to talk and she is female and has shown no interest in it . i ve tried though ! my next bird will probably be a larger species and we ll try talking again . there s a parakeet named disco who says all sorts of things , here s his video https www . youtube . com watch ? v jxc ylcxqcw","109147":"well , she s tame and she knows certain commands but she s also spoiled and does what she wants . luckily what she wants is often to hang out and be cute . she s also very affectionate which is great because parakeet kisses are the sweetest .","109148":"thanks for clarifying because i was a little miffed for sure","109149":"so far so good , my light therapy just ended so i m about to grab my bird and bring her back to my desk for awhile she likes to sit behind my monitor and sing along with spotify"}}
