I love it when I get compliments and stuff like that. And the last thing that I probably love the most when I get complimented by is my food. I love to cook I'm Cajun so it's a big deal to make sure that my food tastes great. And when people compliment it more than just saying it tastes good and they're like this tastes amazing and start asking me what did I put in here and how did I do this and oh my gosh that's great.

And all three of my pittis said hello Mary Jane G Fred and Dixie said hello. Thanks so much my friend for the hellos and checking in with me. I hope everything is going all right with you! Happy holidays to you by the way! Happy late Thanksgiving and happy early Christmas and New Year! And yes I will be 25 soon isn't that crazy how the years go by?

And now I'm about to stop and get breakfast because I did not eat at my house I'm going to get a sausage biscuit probably\n  ","27910":"\n  Yeah usually by this time of the year I have went to my mom's anywhere from four to seven times considering I live about 300 to 600 miles away from her depending. But this year I've only seen her once or twice... Really upsetting to be honest. And most people are just like... well it's all for a reason.. Blah blah.. and I'm like.. just shut up. I am tired of hearing the same thing. Nothing is getting better.. Understand this whole covid-19 thing needs to be stopped they say... and not continuously spreaded but we can't stop our lives forever. And that's the thing that pisses me off when someone tells me over and over like I am a horrible person for missing the events and people that we wants used to spend time with your round. They get mad at me and tell me will again it offer a reason why would you want to continue to spread? I say.. what is so wrong about me missing things? And wanting it to all be back the same. Though it's never going to happen. We cannot sit here for 3 to 10 years waiting for this stuff to go away when it's not going to. Like any other sickness it will fade. It just takes time. In the meantime we just have to all be cautious and careful. But we can't forget our roots and our family. Cause I already know this.. That it's not going away but literally this sickness stuff has got people scared and hiding in their houses and not even coming out to see daylight. It has got people literally working from home eating from home and not doing anything and having people deliver their groceries and everything. I haven't seen one of my family members and almost an entire year because they are terrified to come out of their house now because they have now scared them to death. I think that is completely and utterly ridiculous on every extent. B\/c they literally are terrified. It's sad. But like it's going to take all of us to understand that it's not going to go away and that we means all connecting even if it means connecting one by one. Our lives must go on\n  ","27911":"\n  A lot of family get-togethers and events have been canceled and it has been a very upsetting your because of that. Some of the most popular event has been canceled this year. Mardi Gras nearly really popular fairs most popular events have been canceled this year. Mardi Gras nearly really popular fares. Family get togethers on Thanksgiving and other events that have happened in between now and March and June or whenever this all started\n  ","27912":"\n  Well the first thing I do is walk around the house and make sure everything's looking okay and I turn the heater on if I'm cold or I turn the air on if I'm hot. Then go into the bathroom and try to freshen up brush my hair my teeth put some nice clothes on wash my face either put a little makeup on it just depends going to try to get me something to eat pack up everything and try to figure out what the temperature is outside if I need to wear a jacket or if I need to wear boots or if I need to wear heavy socks or an extra pair of pants or something. And then I try to pack a drink. If I don't eat anything at my house I will go get breakfast from somewhere. It just depends. I also walk my dogs and feed them depending on what time it is. Sometimes my husband doesn't go into work yet so he can feed them. And this about almost everything I do. Get my bag and make sure I have everything me and then hit the road.\n  ","27913":"\n  Yeah I still do this to try to remember who's getting what and I don't really buy for a lot of people because that's just too expensive nowadays and I make a list so I make sure I can budget my money pretty well.

Lots of Louisiana and Mississippi history on the walls. Wonderful and beautiful pictures of family members. Grey carpets gray flooring dark color Furnitures Browns. Very patriotic looking house. And of course we are Gamers so you're probably going to see a gaming lamp here and there or a gaming console or Tower of games or two TVs in the same room because you're a gaming couple and you like to put together LOL for a picture here in there from the video games we play. Or a poster. We are definitely very laid-back fun people\n  ","27929":"\n  I love Disney Channel and I like the show called That's So Raven and Life With Derek. These two shows were my favorite. Hannah Montana was pretty good. And then I like Wizards of Waverly Place. Cory in the House was also pretty good Sunny With The Chance was decent and and then of course we have Good Luck Charlie. The Cheetah Girls in High School Musical. But there's so many other shows that I liked as well. I like the Thirteenth Year. That's probably one of my most favorite shows.\n  ","27930":"\n  Maybe 3 times? Twice?\n  \n  Considering moving back and forth not even a mile from my house to my grandmother's back to my mom's back and forth Just too live in a different spot and work was closer. Just a little bit closer. Plus I was trying to take care of my grandmother because she needed someone there to care for her. But I don't really count that so if I really had to tell you how many times I actually have moved in my life would only be once. And I guess I'll count moving to my grandmother's ass never too. But I moved back and forth a few times. Which I love living in both places that's why I move so much. I love living with my mom and my sisters and I love living with one of my sisters and my at my grandmother's. Everything was so nearby that I literally used my bike is transportation for literally 2 years as I lived there. Now I moved from Louisiana to Mississippi and I love it. Though of course I miss at home but I have two homes now. I can go back home and have a good time with my family and I can come here and spend time with family in law and my husband and my pitbulls.\n  ","27931":"\n  If we were back home in Louisiana... there is so many different things you can do. Let's pretend it's Mardi Gras night right? Or a good Mardi Gras day right? We could go and get some very small breakfast and go walk around on the Levee for just a little bit and then we'd probably start heading to the house to get a few things and some food together to go to a Mardi Gras parade. I would probably go pick up some friends and we would get some chairs and tables and we would set them up before the parade and we would just enjoy some good music and just sit around and conversate a little bit. Maybe buy some really cool merchandise from the trailer that ride around for Mardi Gras. They sell many different types of merchandise that you can wear at the parades and go home with. Sometimes we'll play different types of games and will play with the kids and throw footballs and baseballs. Sometimes will even set up in the middle of the road and actual baseball game until the parade start. Usually will start lining up and waiting for parade even almost 7 hours at a time or longer. Just to celebrate. We eat really good food and have a great time. And catch awesome stuff. After the parade would probably go home and look at the things that we got wash up and get ready to go and watch movies in the living room and probably bake cookies at the end of the day. And in the day in the best way you can after a wonderful Mardi Gras celebration.\n  ","27932":"\n  My scare was pretty tough because I lost some very close family members of mine and this year has not been going good until now the month of December.

They don't want to be.

A lot of color to the food. The food can be slightly spicy but it's never super hot. Most of the time you add extra spices to your own bowl. Not to the main pot. But basically Cajun food just has tons of flavor. It's really really good food. I grew up around Cajun culture and they just have some of the best food ever. A lot of it isn't the most healthiest for you so most of the time a lot of it you have to have on occasion. But red beans and rice is really good for you. It's got beans in it it's got sausage in it it's got ham in it lots of spices. Mild spices not hot hot spices. The cornbread just a really buttery sweet cornbread and then the cheesy cornbread is just a slightly sweet cornbread with cheese and a little spice to it. And then the potato salad is just a simple potato, eggs, little mayonnaise, very little mustard, sprinkle of salt and pepper and parsley. Nothing too extravagant or strange. Just your everyday potato salad. And if you like Relish in yours you can add a teaspoon of relish. I'm not too much of a fan of vinegar in my potato salad. If y'all eat that in your country. It's a very everyday American side dish. Something easy and yummy. But red beans and rice is definitely a Southern food homemade Thai Dish. It's very warm. So if it's cold out it's a good dish to make when it's freezing out. Made to warm you up. It's mouth-watering to be honest with you. It's just so good.

Once they are done they're delicious and that's all that matters. Everybody has a certain technique in how to make things. You just need to always remember to be professional, safe and of course presentation. You need to always present your food and make it look like it's going to be tasty. And you need to hurry and make it in a matter of time. You don't want to sit there for 3 hours.

Sour cream takes a while to go bad even when it reaches its expiration date. Chips are pretty decent until you open them. Even after expiration. Not all chips though. Milk can sometimes be fine even at its expiration and sometimes you can even go bad 3 days before its expiration. You just have to be careful. Jugs of tea usually don't go bad on their expiration date. Everything has to have an expiration date or at least almost everything especially when a store is selling the item. It's insured that the item is safe for the customer to consume or be around.

The tourist attractions of course who doesn't like them right? And then the experience with our pitties. We have three pitbulls now. A little newborn puppy and then we have Old Dixie she's about 13 and we have G he's about mid Age 5 and 1\/2. And we take them everywhere with us because that's just what we love to do with them.

Some water is super duper purified and some of it is just partially purified and they just slap a label on it to try and get people to buy it. And especially that wire that is purified where do they get it? You need to go and look up the section yourself and find out yourself. It is appalling to find out where they get their water from sometimes. Considering nobody really owns some of the water lands in certain places. There's a hint. Pretty much everyone for themselves. And just hope they don't use all the water. Pump it all. And then some water has salt in it. A lot. And then other places also. This is just a few. I literally took a class on this.

But of course we have that one side of the Paranormal world that is evil. Sorry about my typos I am voicing the text because it's a lot to type\n  ","28602":"\n  Spirits are bad now but other entities can be harmful. All the researches I've done on Ouija boards. Most of the time people don't play them correctly and bad things come from them. You really have to be aware and careful when using Ouija boards. I have years and years of research and practice in learning how to use a Ouija board properly. I have explained to people so many times how to use them. Properly. And why they shouldn't use. The do's and the don'ts. But there's so many different things about the Paranormal world that are complicated that I'm not going to get into because there's so many different branches and such a long conversation that I would be here for hours explaining it.

It's a really important commitment. It's really hard to get out of a marriage than it is to get into a marriage. Buy paper is what I mean. So don't just jump into a relationship and not even wait a couple weeks and then get married. I would probably wait a good couple months at least and get to know the person and their family and how they are and how they live. And just know for sure that you want to be with that person. As long as both of you know for sure that you are ready to get married then I don't see a problem in it. Like I said the legal age of course. Me and Jason knew for sure that we were ready to get married when we were only a year and a half maybe together. But we waited till four years because one money to we just wanted to make sure that we were ready but we were. But we did the right thing I think. Plus there were tons of obstacles and distance in between us. So it was a little hard for us to get married. We wanted to make sure we were together when we got married. Physically in person together. We were in a long distance relationship for 4 and 1\/2 years before we permanently we're together and living together. I never regret marrying Jason. He is wonderful and I love him very much. But of course not every relationship works like me and my husband's did. You really need to make sure that you are ready to be with a person. It's an extremely important decision to make in life. And if you want to leave leave. Don't stick around and let them control you.\n  ","28614":"\n  Thanks! I appreciate the compliment. At one point I didn't believe in it neither. Just at one point in my life I witnessed to certain things and that's what made me believe. Just certain events and things that I have witnessed made me believe. Some people laugh at it. Some people don't believe in it. But that's just because they're Skeptics and they have seen it firsthand. And that's okay.\n  \n  I have been interested and curious about the Paranormal as young as the age of eight years old.

ROAD TRIP! COME ON!\n  ","28690":"\n  I would have told that person off. Here in America sometimes people can't get a job. Because of homelessness. Once they see that you're homeless they don't want you because they don't see that you're clean they don't see that you're this they don't see that you're that but the thing about it is is the fact that you're even trying to come up there and get a job when it's so hard to get the courage because it's embarrassing to be homeless. To be able to have the courage to go up there and actually try to get a job regardless of what it is and how much it is is the bravest thing you could do and it is a good thing. As long as they're in there trying and they look like they're trying and you see their story maybe try helping them out and really seeing the real person behind the homelessness? Starting on homeless with no money whatsoever is hard especially if you've been homeless for a while. They could have no type of proper clothes for working or maybe even no shoes. Maybe buy them a pair of shoes. Or maybe two or three pairs of socks. Or maybe buy them a pair of khaki pants. Honestly they could be an extremely intelligent person, something just happened. Things happen. Family members died or something... maybe they're handling something in life really hard. People get addictions and then they overcome them... Some don't... Sadly but they still are homeless. Many things can happen. They could get sick. They could be even a veteran... people just want to judge. They never want to look at the big picture or put themselves in someone's shoes. But when they they're homeless they're crying and they're sobbing just like that person was that they were making fun of. Now they will really see what it's like once they get into the situation and then when they get mad when people make fun of them but they were the ones that were making fun of someone else once. Then they will realize but they did was messed up and they should have never did it. Karma is horrible.\n  ","28691":"\n  My costume was very simple and comfortable because it was really cold yesterday.

It was young and talented and that's what happened. Fame and money. But in the song and I'm going to post below is his real thoughts on it. Even though you have all that thing in money does it mean that you're happy it really means that you're really lonely. People aren't going to listen and people aren't going to be there for you as properly as you think they would. But this song right here. I have been here since day one. I have always been a fan of him. A huge fan of his actions? No. Just because he was really young and around the same age as me when I found out that he got famous at the same age. I know for sure he wishes he could go back though he doesn't take any of the fame and love for granted though I think he really doesn't miss his old life. A life without judgment. A life without criticism. If you have been here since day one for him you will understand this video. If you haven't put yourself into his shoes. What would you do if you were 11-13 years old and a kid and got famous? Yeah. There.

I love to hear thunder. It's just something different with the day. Adds character. Lately we haven't really been getting a lot of rain which is sad but it's okay. We're about to get another hurricane down here. But you would be surprised how to some people how much the rain means to them. Some people are not able to see the sky and Rain like we are able to. And they appreciate just that small thing. Being able to witness it. It's just something I don't take for granted. I love the rain. \u2764\n  ","28788":"\n  Depressing feelings\n  \n   And then morning... a loved one or pet like family member or friend...\n   \n\n     View more\n    \n\n","28789":"\n  My mom's for sure\n  \n  All the time\n  ","28790":"\n  In my younger ages of course.

Shooting a dog just because it doesn't know any better and it came over to your house and it is trying to play with your chickens. Shooting it and trying to mame it and hurt it when not even realizing that it's someone's loved pet and it actually happens to be a little girl's pet. Horrible. All they had to do was come over and tell the neighbor that their dog was in their yard messing with their livestock. Chickens that maybe cost $0.50 to a dollar that were bought. They're going to slaughter the chickens. They're not even that important. But let's kill a expensive loved animal that is a little girls dog because you are a evil person. I never understood how people work. Now there are thousands of little pellets in this dog's body and they are going to have to take each and every one of them out of him. He is literally the sweetest dog in the world and it never hurt a fly. All he wanted to do is play with the chickens. And of course we have people like this in the world that can't physically walk themselves over and verbally speak about the manor. Even maybe call the police? But have to shoot the animal?

I'm not sure what you guys know me by or not but I'm sure you guys know me by singing for sure and paranormal investigation. And researching. Another few hobbies that I really like I enjoy drawing painting and wood burning. These are things throughout my life I love to do off and on. With singing. I say for many schools events funerals football games parties weddings all kinds of different things. I have done this throughout my life. I also have even let a choir at a school for a few years. I really really enjoyed this in loved it. Another thing that I really like that I haven't physically been able to get into but I have been researching it is Gem mining. Another one magnet fishing. These are two things that I would absolutely love to physically get into doing. I also left playing sports as a child. Volleyball and soccer being my favorites and then I also played basketball and baseball. If I had to say the number one sport that I was best at was volleyball. Being the team captain for 2 years and playing for almost seven to eight years of volleyball I almost went professional. A couple injuries happened and that's why I did not go professional. I also used to write poetry and some songwriting with a very close friend of mine while I was at the peak of my singing. Over the years I have been moving a lot and haven't been doing as much as I used to but I still love to sing. I don't do much songwriting anymore like I used to but I still every now and then like to pick up a book and write something down. I also love to cook. This is something that my family culture and everything has always been into. I love cooking things for people and then seeing their reactions. Smiles. Also gaming. These are some of the things that I love to do.\n  ","28821":"\n  Myself? Sometimes. Not too often though because it is very tedious. I do love art though. I love to woodburn. I really been wanting to get into wood carving. It's kind related to wood-burning, you can associate for two together and make beautiful art out of there. These two things are very popular around where I live. I also love oil paints and acrylic. Sometimes I do it'll. More of a landscape painter more than anything. And really neat abstract.

And to this thread.\n  \n  After I ate at the jalapeno. I had two dashes of salt I add 3 tablespoons of butter depending on how sweet you want your cornbread to be. 2 is okay. Usually you will use a cast iron skillet to make your cornbread. You want a small cast iron skillet to make your cornbread about 1 in tall. You were going to want to take a stick of butter and rub it on the cast iron skillet walls and on the floor of the cast iron skillet. Why? This acts as vegetable oil and also taste better instead of using regular vegetable oil. Rub it densely against the sides of the cast iron skillet. You're going to want to chop up an egg add milk according to the Jiffy box instructions go ahead and additionally I had a half a teaspoon of sugar to your cornbread. Then add a 16 oz of shredded cheese usually sharp cheddar to your cheesy cornbread. Now that you have the jalapeno all of the ingredients on the back of the Jiffy box the cheese the sugar and the salt added you can cook this cornbread from 20 minutes to 30 minutes in the oven until the top of the corn bread becomes brown and the inside of it isn't too mushy.\n  \n  You can also eat mild Cajun chili with some corn chips. And some extra cheese if you really want. And then of course you have your cheesy jalapeno cornbread! Bon appetit!\n  ","28895":"\n  When you go to try the chili. It needs to taste really strong. It's probably going to need some salt. This is when you add your salt. It's at again. You don't want to add enough salt to your taste but just enough to where you almost need more. If you salt your food too much it might be more\/too salted for someone else. So very carefully add your salt. The thing about it is when you go to try your chili you need to sit there and really think what it's missing. Is it missing some more garlic powder? Is it missing some more chili powder? Do I need to add a little bit more salt? Does it need more tony chachere's? Do I need more bell pepper? You go ahead and you add what you want. If it tastes fine then eat it. But the thing about it is you really need to sit and think. Is it missing anything? If you add any seasoning to your chili make sure you mix it and let cook for another 5 minutes to let the seasonings that you added additional to melt into your chili and keep mixing it off and on for the next five minutes.\n  \n  Say for instance you're done with your chili right? You need something else to eat with it. How about cheesy jalapeno cornbread. To make that I get the regular cornbread Jiffy from the store if it sells around where you live. I follow the instructions and then I add one tablespoon without the juice of pre-packaged cut up jalapenos. You can get them in a jar on the aisle at the store usually or in a can. If you get fresh jalapenos be careful when you cut them because they can cause acid burns your fingers. Use gloves and make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap after. Only add one medium sized jalapeno to your cornbread if you use fresh jalapenos\n  ","28896":"\n  Go ahead and add your three or four cans of beans.\n  \n  It doesn't really matter how many cans of beans you get as long as you get enough. Three or four cans. Just don't get only kidney beans and only chili beans unless you have to.\n  \n  Again you can go ahead and add the beans to your ground beef and vegetables and Seasonings.\n  \n  Mix it together really really well. And if your chili is not watery enough then you need add a little more water or go ahead and add all of the kidney bean juice. It's your opinion on what you want to do with your chili. If you want your chili more dry then you don't have to add any more water or any of the canned beans juice. But honestly I would recommend having your chili a little watery. Especially if you're going to be eating it with chips corn chips or corn bread. So if you want to have it watery go ahead and add one cup of hot water to your chili. With the beans vegetables seasoning and the beans juice that you already have in the pot. Go ahead and mix your Chilli together. Mix it extremely well for about 2 to 3 minutes. Leave it on a really good temperature that it's boiling on. Let It boil for about 5 to 10 minutes with all of the seasoning and vegetables in it. Make sure it doesn't get dry and burn. Add more water as you can to make sure it stays watery. You should be able to see the water at the top of your chili. That's usually the density that you want. Make it a little soupy. Barely tho...\n  \n  And go ahead and try it. When you add the beans make sure that you try to crush up some of the beans in your chili. Why? It will add texture color and make the chili taste better with the inside of the beans mashed up inside of the chili. It really does matter if you crush up some of your beans. Not all of them. Just as you started maybe smash him up against the wall of the chili pot.\n  \n  Will continue...\n  ","28897":"\n  This is a continuation to Cajun chili seasoning adding.\n  \n  After you add the garlic ingredients seasonings.\n  \n  If you have to dried crushed bell pepper you can add a little bit more if you would like. Even though it's dried it's going to read marinate and become a different texture in your soup with the juices. So don't be alarmed by the heart pieces of bell pepper.\n  \n  You're going to want to add the two chili packets that you bought from the store and then add a couple dashes of the regular chili powder that you have. Maybe four or five dashes. Not too much just enough.\n  \n  Depending on if you bought fresh cilantro or in the bottle cilantro. If you bought regular cilantro cut you up about four or five pieces and put it in the chilling. If you want to add six pieces of cilantro you can. Fresh cilantro is stronger than in the bottle cilantro. So be careful with the fresh cilantro adding. If you have dried cilantro from the store off of the baking Isles then you can add a full teaspoon of cilantro.\n  \n  You are going to want to get two cans of regular kidney beans any size it doesn't matter light kidney beans dark kidney beans it doesn't matter you can mix it up. And you're going to want to get two cans of regular chili beans. It should just say chili beans on the can. If you don't have chili beans in your area just get four cans of kidney beans. If you don't have kidney beans in your area than just get three or four cans of regular chili beans. The only reason why you don't want to get too many chili beans is because they come with the chili flavor in the can. Regular kidney beans come with a more Bean taste. That's why you want to mix them together.\n  \n  So you have four cans of beans? Or 3. How ever much beans you want in your chili really.\n  \n  You want to drain half of the juice out of each can. You don't want to add all of the juice to your chili. If you want to you can but I would recommend raining at least a quarter or half of the cans juice from each can.\n  \n  Will continue\n  ","28898":"\n  Salt at the beginning you're really not going to add this first. But if you really want to go ahead and add it. Don't even put 1\/4 of a teaspoon in your chili at start. So maybe just a dash or two of salt . A dash basically meaning one or two good shakes.\n  \n  You're going to want to put a decent amount of pepper. Probably a half a teaspoon.\n  \n  Crushed red pepper you're probably going to need to put half a teaspoon of crushed red pepper. Maybe a couple more dashes after the half a teaspoon. The red pepper really gives the chili a wonderful taste. I promise you put it in there it will not be that hot. It will add a little taste spice but that's it.\n  \n  The next thing that you're going to add is Tony chachere's if you're stores sell it around there. You're going to want to add probably a half a teaspoon of Tony chachere's.\n  \n  If you sell Slap Your Mama seasoning you probably are going to want to do about three dashes of slap your Mama seasoning.\n  \n  If you were able to find the minced garlic in your store put a teaspoon of minced garlic in your chili. You're also going to want to add a dash of garlic powder. And if you were able to find The Garlic hot sauce put 2 tablespoons of garlic hot sauce in your chili. Don't get mixed up with tablespoons and teaspoons. Teaspoon smaller than a tablespoon. Teaspoons are usually associated with seasonings. Tablespoons can be also but they are larger than teaspoons.\n  \n  This will continue on.\n  ","28899":"\n  So the type of seasonings that you're going to want for this chili. Usually I get to pre-made chili packets from the store when I make about 3 lb of ground beef chili. So get two of them. Just in case get a thing of chili powder. It comes in a premade bottle. Get that just in case if it's not chili tasting enough. You can add that and it's pretty much the same thing in the chili packets. The next type of seasonings are going to want is of course salt pepper red pepper chips. I promise they're not that hot get them they add flavor to the ground beef. You're going to want dry bell peppers if your store has them. If not the one that you cut up should be enough. You're going to want to get cilantro parsley Tony chachere's if your store sells it this is the best in chili. You can also buy it online from Louisiana products sell stores. Are you suggesting called Cajun sauce. This is a special ingredient that you're only able to actually get from the stores in south Louisiana. So unfortunately you're not going to be able to add this. But it's okay. Are you the garlic tasting hot sauce. As long as you don't put a lot of the hot sauce it won't make the chili hot. It will only add flavor and make it mild. You're going to need garlic powder or minced garlic. Slap Your Mama seasoning if you have it where you live. You're going to need cayenne pepper. And I think that's all of the seasoning that I use.\n  \n  And of course you're going to have to carefully add till taste.\n  \n  But if I had to be exact on how much of each one I put in there I will describe it for you.\n  \n  This will continue on...\n  ","28900":"\n  As you're letting the ground beef cook down. Keep focusing back and forth on your vegetables and of course your ground beef.\n  \n  After about 30 minutes of letting your vegetables cook down they should be done. You can actually poke them with stuff and see if there mushy. Do you want them to all be mushy. If they're not mushy keep cooking them until they get to this texture.\n  \n  So say that you are done with the marinating of the vegetables and that you are done with your ground beef cooking down. If you want to add a few spices to your ground beef you can. If you want to wait until you add everything you also can. You just might have to let everything cook down for about 30 minutes in the end. It's very important to stir your pot and let it cook about 30 minutes after you put everything in. This helps the seasoning cook into the juices and all of the ingredients inside of the pot. It helps them all infused and taste correctly.\n  \n  So you can go ahead and add your ground beef to your vegetables that you marinate it for about 30 minutes or so and got them to a mushy texture.\n  \n  So now you just mix it together really well. Now you only have ground beef and well cut up vegetables.\n  \n  You can start seasoning everything now. This is your first attempt to seasoning. You are not going to get correct the first time. You really need to know your seasonings. You don't want to add too much of something too strong. It's sometimes part 2 fix a pot after adding too much of something. You really want to focus and make sure you don't add any salt really. When you're adding the other seasonings sometimes they have salt in them. Do you want to wait till the end add salt.\n  \n  This will again. Continue. Not only am I putting the ingredients but I'm telling you how to do it as well. Trying to show you the technique. If you don't know then you're really not going to know how to do it. So I hope you enjoy reading on.\n  ","28901":"\n  This is a recipe to my\n  \n  \ud83d\udd3bCajun Mild Tasting Chili.\ud83d\udd3a\n  \n  Feeding about 3 to 5.\n  \n  So the first thing that you're going to want is about 3 lb of ground beef.\n  \n  In one pot you're going to Brown the ground beef.\n  \n  In a separate pot there is a such thing called at the store as all seasoning bags. They're on the frozen aisle where the vegetables are. It's already cut frozen seasoning bags. The frozen bag will read celery onion and bell pepper in it.\n  \n  If your store does not sell this then I recommend you getting a medium sized onion. I'm medium size bell pepper. And then you need to get three or four celery sticks and green onions and cut them off very well and put them in the chili. You're not going to need a lot of green onion. Just enough. You can never put too much onion bell pepper celery green onion in your chili. So it doesn't matter how much you put. Just make sure that you put enough. By the way if you don't like these types of vegetables it doesn't matter because once you put them in your chili they're going to condense in and you're not even going to realize that they're in your chili. Just try it and go with it and you will see what I mean.\n  \n  Now don't add this to your ground beef. You want to cook this in a separate pot and marinate your vegetables down before you add them to anything. For about 30 minutes you want to put your vegetables on high. You want to put your vegetables in that pot as soon as it gets hot enough and you want to add 3 tablespoons of butter water and olive oil. Every time your vegetable start to get dry out a little bit more water. Do you want to let these vegetables marinade really really well. The smell will be wonderful as you wait.\n  \n  As you're focusing on the vegetables your ground beef will be able to cook down. Make sure that you mix it periodically as you're trying to focus on the vegetables you don't want to burn your ground beef. You don't even want to cook it on high. Just slowly cook it.\n  \n  This will continue on...\n  ","28902":"\n  So what I do for the chili. It is a lot of ingredients. And honestly all of the seasoning is by taste. So as long as you have a very strong tasting. It's going to be a good chili. Another thing is people get so nervous about making it too spicy or hot really more or less. Spicy isn't really hot. It's just your tolerance on what you can handle when you eat it more or less. Hot is hot. So I never understood why people say spicy is hot? Maybe it's just a different opinion. I respect that.\n  \n  But anyway.\n  \n  Here's the main things I put in my chili.\n  \n  It also depends on how much you want to make. Do you want to make enough for yourself only? Do you want to make enough for three people? Or do you want to make enough for like a party size of 10? It just depends. Because then it gets harder to cook it when you get into the bigger quantities. I'm going to tell you how much to make for three people which honestly it's enough for 5 but really and truly if you really like the taste of your chili it's only going to last you maybe two days. I'm going to explain to you what I put in my chili and the next thread.\n  ","28903":"\n  Living and caring for others.\n  ","28904":"\n  Actual real mountain climbing? Unfortunately I have never seen an actual mountain in my life. This is definitely something I want to do. Definitely something on my bucket list\n  ","28905":"\n  - paperwork and you have to talk to the right kind of people. Once you start getting everything together you need to be really cautious and careful when you move to a new country especially by yourself. And you have to learn to fit in. If you make it obvious that you're from another country then people might judge you and not help you. There's nothing wrong with being yourself but unfortunately if you really want to fit in and get a job and be able to do stuff like everyone else can around the area you really have to try to accustom yourself to the area. They want bilingual and intelligent people. So when you move to that country you really have to understand their language. You also have to know the slang. But it is very nice here but I'm not going to tell you that it's 100% safe in the USA. Anywhere you go is going to be nasty and there's going to be nasty people. Unfortunately. But we are very free here and you did a lot of opportunities here. And I can understand why you want to come here. But like I said before I would definitely try to look and go into Canada first and then maybe a year or so later try to come to the USA if you really want to. It's probably going to be a lot before you can come to the USA but at least you can start today and try to make your way to your goal. You have to start somewhere\n  ","28906":"\n  I'm not 100% on the details on how it works to move from one country to another but I can tell you this... I have a friend that lives in Brazil or really, he grew up there. Well the part of Brazil that he lives in is really horrible violence and there's a lot of really bad people that live there. Not everyone and Brazil is bad, no. But where he is from it is really bad. You can't even go to the grocery store and back safe. This makes him feel really upset. So he tried to move to Saudi Arabia. It was worse there...but! he found really good work... unfortunately it got really bad and he didn't like it and he also really missed his family. After about four five or even six years of living in Saudi Arabia he moved back to Brazil. It's still really bad there and he would like to move again. But this time he wants to move to the USA. He tried to look into moving to the USA. He tried talking to me about it but I knew nothing about it. I befriended him because he seems like a really nice person. I have been trying to help him learn English so when he does try to come to an English-speaking country he's able to at least know the basics. I have been teaching him English for about 3 years now. He tried to look into moving to America and it's way harder to move here then to the other place where he's trying to move to now which is Canada. I say the same for you. I would try to move to Canada before trying to move the USA. It's not a one or two-day process it might not even be a one or two-year process. But you might as well go ahead and start now. Time will help. You need to stay in school and keep making money. Unfortunately that's how this world Works. Everybody Time will help. You need to stay in school and keep making money.
