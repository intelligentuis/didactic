since way back in the s when it all started .","24070":"i haaaave .","24071":"this one . avril .","24072":"this is also a continuation from the last question . and to this thread . after i ate at the jalapeno . i had two dashes of salt i add tablespoons of butter depending on how sweet you want your cornbread to be . is okay . usually you will use a cast iron skillet to make your cornbread . you want a small cast iron skillet to make your cornbread about in tall . you were going to want to take a stick of butter and rub it on the cast iron skillet walls and on the floor of the cast iron skillet . why ? this acts as vegetable oil and also taste better instead of using regular vegetable oil . rub it densely against the sides of the cast iron skillet . you re going to want to chop up an egg add milk according to the jiffy box instructions go ahead and additionally i had a half a teaspoon of sugar to your cornbread . then add a oz of shredded cheese usually sharp cheddar to your cheesy cornbread . now that you have the jalapeno all of the ingredients on the back of the jiffy box the cheese the sugar and the salt added you can cook this cornbread from minutes to minutes in the oven until the top of the corn bread becomes brown and the inside of it isn t too mushy . you can also eat mild cajun chili with some corn chips . and some extra cheese if you really want . and then of course you have your cheesy jalapeno cornbread ! bon appetit !","24073":"when you go to try the chili . it needs to taste really strong . it s probably going to need some salt . this is when you add your salt . it s at again . you don t want to add enough salt to your taste but just enough to where you almost need more . if you salt your food too much it might be more too salted for someone else . so very carefully add your salt . the thing about it is when you go to try your chili you need to sit there and really think what it s missing . is it missing some more garlic powder ? is it missing some more chili powder ? do i need to add a little bit more salt ? does it need more tony chachere s ? do i need more bell pepper ? you go ahead and you add what you want . if it tastes fine then eat it . but the thing about it is you really need to sit and think . is it missing anything ? if you add any seasoning to your chili make sure you mix it and let cook for another minutes to let the seasonings that you added additional to melt into your chili and keep mixing it off and on for the next five minutes . say for instance you re done with your chili right ? you need something else to eat with it . how about cheesy jalapeno cornbread . to make that i get the regular cornbread jiffy from the store if it sells around where you live . i follow the instructions and then i add one tablespoon without the juice of pre packaged cut up jalapenos . you can get them in a jar on the aisle at the store usually or in a can . if you get fresh jalapenos be careful when you cut them because they can cause acid burns your fingers . use gloves and make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap after . only add one medium sized jalapeno to your cornbread if you use fresh jalapenos","24074":"go ahead and add your three or four cans of beans . it doesn t really matter how many cans of beans you get as long as you get enough . three or four cans . just don t get only kidney beans and only chili beans unless you have to . again you can go ahead and add the beans to your ground beef and vegetables and seasonings . mix it together really really well . and if your chili is not watery enough then you need add a little more water or go ahead and add all of the kidney bean juice . it s your opinion on what you want to do with your chili . if you want your chili more dry then you don t have to add any more water or any of the canned beans juice . but honestly i would recommend having your chili a little watery . especially if you re going to be eating it with chips corn chips or corn bread . so if you want to have it watery go ahead and add one cup of hot water to your chili . with the beans vegetables seasoning and the beans juice that you already have in the pot . go ahead and mix your chilli together . mix it extremely well for about to minutes . leave it on a really good temperature that it s boiling on . let it boil for about to minutes with all of the seasoning and vegetables in it . make sure it doesn t get dry and burn . add more water as you can to make sure it stays watery . you should be able to see the water at the top of your chili . that s usually the density that you want . make it a little soupy . barely tho . . . and go ahead and try it . when you add the beans make sure that you try to crush up some of the beans in your chili . why ? it will add texture color and make the chili taste better with the inside of the beans mashed up inside of the chili . it really does matter if you crush up some of your beans . not all of them . just as you started maybe smash him up against the wall of the chili pot . will continue . . .","24075":"this is a continuation to cajun chili seasoning adding . after you add the garlic ingredients seasonings . if you have to dried crushed bell pepper you can add a little bit more if you would like . even though it s dried it s going to read marinate and become a different texture in your soup with the juices . so don t be alarmed by the heart pieces of bell pepper . you re going to want to add the two chili packets that you bought from the store and then add a couple dashes of the regular chili powder that you have . maybe four or five dashes . not too much just enough . depending on if you bought fresh cilantro or in the bottle cilantro . if you bought regular cilantro cut you up about four or five pieces and put it in the chilling . if you want to add six pieces of cilantro you can . fresh cilantro is stronger than in the bottle cilantro . so be careful with the fresh cilantro adding . if you have dried cilantro from the store off of the baking isles then you can add a full teaspoon of cilantro . you are going to want to get two cans of regular kidney beans any size it doesn t matter light kidney beans dark kidney beans it doesn t matter you can mix it up . and you re going to want to get two cans of regular chili beans . it should just say chili beans on the can . if you don t have chili beans in your area just get four cans of kidney beans . if you don t have kidney beans in your area than just get three or four cans of regular chili beans . the only reason why you don t want to get too many chili beans is because they come with the chili flavor in the can . regular kidney beans come with a more bean taste . that s why you want to mix them together . so you have four cans of beans ? or . how ever much beans you want in your chili really . you want to drain half of the juice out of each can . you don t want to add all of the juice to your chili . if you want to you can but i would recommend raining at least a quarter or half of the cans juice from each can . will continue","24076":"salt at the beginning you re really not going to add this first . but if you really want to go ahead and add it . don t even put of a teaspoon in your chili at start . so maybe just a dash or two of salt . a dash basically meaning one or two good shakes . you re going to want to put a decent amount of pepper . probably a half a teaspoon . crushed red pepper you re probably going to need to put half a teaspoon of crushed red pepper . maybe a couple more dashes after the half a teaspoon . the red pepper really gives the chili a wonderful taste . i promise you put it in there it will not be that hot . it will add a little taste spice but that s it . the next thing that you re going to add is tony chachere s if you re stores sell it around there . you re going to want to add probably a half a teaspoon of tony chachere s . if you sell slap your mama seasoning you probably are going to want to do about three dashes of slap your mama seasoning . if you were able to find the minced garlic in your store put a teaspoon of minced garlic in your chili . you re also going to want to add a dash of garlic powder . and if you were able to find the garlic hot sauce put tablespoons of garlic hot sauce in your chili . don t get mixed up with tablespoons and teaspoons . teaspoon smaller than a tablespoon . teaspoons are usually associated with seasonings . tablespoons can be also but they are larger than teaspoons . this will continue on .","24077":"so the type of seasonings that you re going to want for this chili . usually i get to pre made chili packets from the store when i make about lb of ground beef chili . so get two of them . just in case get a thing of chili powder . it comes in a premade bottle . get that just in case if it s not chili tasting enough . you can add that and it s pretty much the same thing in the chili packets . the next type of seasonings are going to want is of course salt pepper red pepper chips . i promise they re not that hot get them they add flavor to the ground beef . you re going to want dry bell peppers if your store has them . if not the one that you cut up should be enough . you re going to want to get cilantro parsley tony chachere s if your store sells it this is the best in chili . you can also buy it online from louisiana products sell stores . are you suggesting called cajun sauce . this is a special ingredient that you re only able to actually get from the stores in south louisiana . so unfortunately you re not going to be able to add this . but it s okay . are you the garlic tasting hot sauce . as long as you don t put a lot of the hot sauce it won t make the chili hot . it will only add flavor and make it mild . you re going to need garlic powder or minced garlic . slap your mama seasoning if you have it where you live . you re going to need cayenne pepper . and i think that s all of the seasoning that i use . and of course you re going to have to carefully add till taste . but if i had to be exact on how much of each one i put in there i will describe it for you . this will continue on . . .","24078":"as you re letting the ground beef cook down . keep focusing back and forth on your vegetables and of course your ground beef . after about minutes of letting your vegetables cook down they should be done . you can actually poke them with stuff and see if there mushy . do you want them to all be mushy . if they re not mushy keep cooking them until they get to this texture . so say that you are done with the marinating of the vegetables and that you are done with your ground beef cooking down . if you want to add a few spices to your ground beef you can . if you want to wait until you add everything you also can . you just might have to let everything cook down for about minutes in the end . it s very important to stir your pot and let it cook about minutes after you put everything in . this helps the seasoning cook into the juices and all of the ingredients inside of the pot . it helps them all infused and taste correctly . so you can go ahead and add your ground beef to your vegetables that you marinate it for about minutes or so and got them to a mushy texture . so now you just mix it together really well . now you only have ground beef and well cut up vegetables . you can start seasoning everything now . this is your first attempt to seasoning . you are not going to get correct the first time . you really need to know your seasonings . you don t want to add too much of something too strong . it s sometimes part fix a pot after adding too much of something . you really want to focus and make sure you don t add any salt really . when you re adding the other seasonings sometimes they have salt in them . do you want to wait till the end add salt . this will again . continue . not only am i putting the ingredients but i m telling you how to do it as well . trying to show you the technique . if you don t know then you re really not going to know how to do it . so i hope you enjoy reading on .","24079":"this is a recipe to my cajun mild tasting chili . feeding about to . so the first thing that you re going to want is about lb of ground beef . in one pot you re going to brown the ground beef . in a separate pot there is a such thing called at the store as all seasoning bags . they re on the frozen aisle where the vegetables are . it s already cut frozen seasoning bags . the frozen bag will read celery onion and bell pepper in it . if your store does not sell this then i recommend you getting a medium sized onion . i m medium size bell pepper . and then you need to get three or four celery sticks and green onions and cut them off very well and put them in the chili . you re not going to need a lot of green onion . just enough . you can never put too much onion bell pepper celery green onion in your chili . so it doesn t matter how much you put . just make sure that you put enough . by the way if you don t like these types of vegetables it doesn t matter because once you put them in your chili they re going to condense in and you re not even going to realize that they re in your chili . just try it and go with it and you will see what i mean . now don t add this to your ground beef . you want to cook this in a separate pot and marinate your vegetables down before you add them to anything . for about minutes you want to put your vegetables on high . you want to put your vegetables in that pot as soon as it gets hot enough and you want to add tablespoons of butter water and olive oil . every time your vegetable start to get dry out a little bit more water . do you want to let these vegetables marinade really really well . the smell will be wonderful as you wait . as you re focusing on the vegetables your ground beef will be able to cook down . make sure that you mix it periodically as you re trying to focus on the vegetables you don t want to burn your ground beef . you don t even want to cook it on high . just slowly cook it . this will continue on . . .","24080":"so what i do for the chili . it is a lot of ingredients . and honestly all of the seasoning is by taste . so as long as you have a very strong tasting . it s going to be a good chili . another thing is people get so nervous about making it too spicy or hot really more or less . spicy isn t really hot . it s just your tolerance on what you can handle when you eat it more or less . hot is hot . so i never understood why people say spicy is hot ? maybe it s just a different opinion . i respect that . but anyway . here s the main things i put in my chili . it also depends on how much you want to make . do you want to make enough for yourself only ? do you want to make enough for three people ? or do you want to make enough for like a party size of ? it just depends . because then it gets harder to cook it when you get into the bigger quantities . i m going to tell you how much to make for three people which honestly it s enough for but really and truly if you really like the taste of your chili it s only going to last you maybe two days . i m going to explain to you what i put in my chili and the next thread .","24081":"living and caring for others .","24082":"actual real mountain climbing ? unfortunately i have never seen an actual mountain in my life . this is definitely something i want to do . definitely something on my bucket list","24083":"paperwork and you have to talk to the right kind of people . once you start getting everything together you need to be really cautious and careful when you move to a new country especially by yourself . and you have to learn to fit in . if you make it obvious that you re from another country then people might judge you and not help you . there s nothing wrong with being yourself but unfortunately if you really want to fit in and get a job and be able to do stuff like everyone else can around the area you really have to try to accustom yourself to the area . they want bilingual and intelligent people . so when you move to that country you really have to understand their language . you also have to know the slang . but it is very nice here but i m not going to tell you that it s safe in the usa . anywhere you go is going to be nasty and there s going to be nasty people . unfortunately . but we are very free here and you did a lot of opportunities here . and i can understand why you want to come here . but like i said before i would definitely try to look and go into canada first and then maybe a year or so later try to come to the usa if you really want to . it s probably going to be a lot before you can come to the usa but at least you can start today and try to make your way to your goal . you have to start somewhere","24084":"i m not on the details on how it works to move from one country to another but i can tell you this . . . i have a friend that lives in brazil or really , he grew up there . well the part of brazil that he lives in is really horrible violence and there s a lot of really bad people that live there . not everyone and brazil is bad , no . but where he is from it is really bad . you can t even go to the grocery store and back safe . this makes him feel really upset . so he tried to move to saudi arabia . it was worse there . . . but ! he found really good work . . . unfortunately it got really bad and he didn t like it and he also really missed his family . after about four five or even six years of living in saudi arabia he moved back to brazil . it s still really bad there and he would like to move again . but this time he wants to move to the usa . he tried to look into moving to the usa . he tried talking to me about it but i knew nothing about it . i befriended him because he seems like a really nice person . i have been trying to help him learn english so when he does try to come to an english speaking country he s able to at least know the basics . i have been teaching him english for about years now . he tried to look into moving to america and it s way harder to move here then to the other place where he s trying to move to now which is canada . i say the same for you . i would try to move to canada before trying to move the usa . it s not a one or two day process it might not even be a one or two year process . but you might as well go ahead and start now . time will help . you need to stay in school and keep making money . unfortunately that s how this world works . everybody time will help . you need to stay in school and keep making money . unfortunately that s how this world works . everybody wants money . plane tickets cost money . but it s nothing impossible to save up for . and then of course you have to get into all of the paperwork and this thread will

running and there s no one there . you can t just run . you have to investigate . it does take a real person to do it but it s not impossible for anybody .","24123":"unfortunately many inwhich it s hard to talk about sometimes . i havd alot of problems now . it sucks remembering the situations sometimes and stuff . . but it s all good . but yeah . it s whatever i guess . sucks .","24124":"it s

anyway . or tell someone where something is if i need them to get it . it also makes me feel good","24140":"i wish people would see my determination to accept people for who they are . instead of just jumping the gunlike they do with everyone else actually look at the situation and see what i m doing . see my progress .","24141":"i am very much a gamer .","24142":"there s quite a few things that we have to do tomorrow . tomorrow is my off day so i ll probably be able to at least get of them done . i know i need to cut my husband s hair . he is needing one . i need to get my eyebrows done . but that s not a priority . i know we have to run a few errands and get dinner . i know we have to cut the grass and make a few phone calls . and then we have to put a lot of things away in the shed and get some of christmas things out because i know that s coming up around the corner .","24143":"i have been researching the paranormal for probably around or more years . i go to different locations

politics or something along the lines . . even though they don t know each other at all . i think that stuff is stupid to talk about especially if you can t have a civil conversation about it and actually state facts and actually be civil about it . but if you actually start stating facts and having a civil conversation about it and stop looking at everyone s color and stop judging everybody by this group and that group then we ll start having a conversation about it . if people can t just have a civil conversation then it needs to just be all left alone .","24150":"thank youuu . same back ! and to al !","24151":"i will answer the first question . no not every educated person is smart . it depends on how you do it all and how you feel about it all if that makes any sense . i know some people that have went to college for to years and some of them are still as narrow as a dang . . . idk . . it s just bad . . or they might be super intelligent but don t have a single emotional thoughts of their selves . or their narrow minded or they re just straight up rude and forget their morals they were taught growing up by their parents or they forget the people feel . they just act like they re perfect and that everyone around them has to be the same way . if that makes any sense","24152":"my bad ! for some reason i thought i had it wrong . i always seem to get the two mixed up

east or west coast maybe one day","24154":"depends if you mean a family member or if you mean . . like a boyfriend . . . or even a husband . like through a divorce or even losing them , like them passing . . . because if you mean a family member sometimes it s just really hard the loss of a family member . and you really never let go of the situation . it s usually always hurts . only time can heal . if you mean like a boyfriend from them cheating or you just don t want to be together with them eventually you will move on to bigger and better things . if you mean through a divorce sometimes that can take longer but you still move on eventually . heartbreak can really last a while . months . . years . . . longer . . . . and then if you mean if you lose somebody . like you lose your husband . that s extremely hard . it does go away kind of but not fully ever . again time can only heal . mourning the loss of a very close loved one like that is really hard . i could never imagine losing jason . it would take me a very long time to even slightly heal from something like that . but there s a few different views on this kind of question . hopefully i answered it right in some way

you . they re just going to mention the obvious or what they think is the obvious . every year i get mom or dad with questions like this and i just don t answer them . i have never really gotten into

someone else this morning . this year just all around has not been a good year . ever since i lost my grandmother in november since that it seems like everything is just been getting worse and not better . everyone has been going through a lot and it s really hard to get through a passing of a family member especially someone very close to you . the best thing i could say to you is try everything you can remember the good memories about down and not to forget them and to remember that they re in a better place and that they re not suffering . as i said before it s not easy to get over a death in the family at all . if anything you never get over it it s always there . again the best thing to do is to remember the great things . only time can heal such . . . i will pray for you and send positive vibes your way . and sincere condolences to you and your family and their family . for this is a sad time for all of you . .","24455":"thanks ! i m super excited !","24456":"i mean mostly in schools and that work this kind of thing is regulated . if you re at home or on your own walking in public as long as you re not taking it too far and you re being appropriate a kiss or a hug or a hand holding isn t really that bad . even cuddling and holding each other close while walking isn t that bad of course the whole covid and social distancing is important but if you re always around that person anyway and know where they ve been and who they ve been around honestly there some sort of a loophole for that person with you . spanish always remember that there s kids probably watching and that you shouldn t be too inappropriate because they could be seeing your actions . some people say i don t care sometimes kids don t understand that stuff and it s better for us to try to be appropriate about it and keep it at a minimal especially in school because they re trying their best practice social distancing and it being safe from getting sick of covid . they don t know where you have been but all they know is you are around a lot of kids in which you don t know where they have been and you don t realize that you could be getting sick and not even know it . so it s better to just try to space ourselves out and social distance anyway and try not to show any sort of pda in school towards anyone","24457":"srry . that s sad . praying for ya . you ll get through it . . . honestly . . . just this year has been just all around hard . . for anyone . ? yeeaah . . . it s just seems that it gets worse and worse . cheer up dollin . . . . after losing my maw maw in nov .

happened there and do investigations to see if the paranormal there really is there . it s very interesting . you re very curious when you go to these places . sometimes people mess with things are not supposed to and sometimes they need guidance and i have been researching for over years and i have a lot of experience and knowledge in this field to be able to try to guide these people and help them . sometimes people get themselves in the wrong positions and mess with the things . sometimes people need things explained to them a certain way so they understand the severity . a lot of the time it s a learning experience and you see different things . witnessing the things . being able to see them first hand and proved that something s there and the evidence is showing . it s really hard to explain because there s just so much to it . i ve been doing this for like ever .","24734":"this is wood burning . when burning is when you use a tool that is a little hot and it s in the shape of kind of like a pen and there are many different types of pens you can use for different effects . when it gets really hot it burns the wood and you can create art with it you can also do wood carving and carve out certain things . this is one of the pieces that i did . for me and my husband . but wood burning is a really easy and simple hobby you can get into the kits are only to depending on what kind you want to get it and how many pieces you want . but i have wood burned quite a few different pieces . it s very enjoyable . of course it can be a little dangerous but honestly just don t touch the burner and your fine . it is a forum of woodworking kind of in a way but wood burning added on","24735":"lol i know right ? i used to do flower bouquets to at my old job and i love to do

love to woodburn . we clean even more than we did before and we have to wear masks continuously and apply sanitizer a lot to ourselves and to a different surfaces even more than we already did before

call me when i go to the bathroom ? so this is kind of what the incident happened . kind of sad that they want to argue about that . i should be able to go to the bathroom if i really need to . it was really annoying because it was like i couldn t do anything right or wrong everything was just wrong . i never understood by this person treated me this way . i m glad i don t work there anymore .","24846":"depends . i usually try to kill people with kindness if they re mean . sometimes people want to take advantage of you but in the end don t let them and still just kill them with kindness . there s no reason for someone to the ugly to you just because they re sad . continue to be happy regardless of them trying to make you upset . it makes them mad . they re just jealous of you . or envy you more or less","24847":"if someone i know with me is doing something illegal i m not going to hang out with them anymore . . of course i m going to tell them what they re doing in that it s illegal and that they can get in serious trouble when i don t want them to and that they need to be more careful . of course i would tell them . but if they want to keep doing it especially when i m around then that s not no friend . i have dropped plenty of friends from doing stuff like that . bad things that are illegal and that could get them in jail . i don t hang out with people that are like that

no older than","24873":"i definitely think i m older than you unfortunately","24874":"i guess just because there s so much bad and craziness going on in the world some people want to separate that and their lives that they want to have . they don t want to reach towards reality or maybe just not all the way . maybe some . sometimes they want to have something different and feel that they can do anything regardless of how crazy this world is how many obstacles are in the way . like gaming . you can go on there and build a house with some games . and then again you can get unrealistic and have a dragon as a pet or have a child that is half angel or something . some people just really want to disconnect from the real world sometimes . to really feel like they re living .","24875":"yeah . i

you haven t remembered the ariel castro incident you really should go and look it up and watch a few videos on it and what happened . i find that documentary extremely intriguing and crazy . i feel so horrible for the victims that were in that whorehouse . here is a summary of what i am talking about . basically three people were kidnapped at honestly a pretty young age . one being one being and the other being . they were taken and held captive for as long as years . they were lured into this house by this predator and were then on tortured and some of the most craziest and horrible ways you

out on the levee wall in louisiana and i was looking at some barges and we were talking about the barges as he was getting the ring ready and getting down on one knee and then he asked me right there but the reason why he asked me right there is because that was my grandfather s favorite place to walk back and forth with my grandmother and so that spot was very special to me and my grandfather used to watch the barges go back and forth and i always said i wanted to get married right there so we pretty much kind of did if you think about it in a way but it was funny because we were looking at a metal garbage barge and then right after you asked me and in which it was sweet and funny","24893":"cake batter","24894":"sorry i m late but thank you ! this week has been going really

would be like or p . m . where everyone has to lay down and be quiet at least . nobody has to go to sleep but if you re going to be loud that is not okay . you are welcome in my house but you must follow the basic rules of being in anyone s house . and that is being quiet when the sun goes down because others may be sleeping . just because you re not sleeping doesn t mean others aren t . so no if someone was to have their kids over at my house and they would be loud i would not allow them back over unless they told me for sure that their kids would listen to the rules . you must respect people when you go to their home . you are the company but at the same time you still need to respect the owner s requests .","24899":"it s been awhile but i absolutely love this ! regardless of my

. wait do you see that ?","24966":"this is actually a really hard question to answer because there are so many different types of people on this earth and there are so many different types of mindsets says if you really think about it . there could just be one little small thing different about someone s mindset and that s a different mindset . i just really think people need to just be chill and go with the flow and just be kind to people . understand common sense and react off of that . if you know something s bad , don t do it . if you know something is good then maybe you should be doing that instead . we should always be continuously learning . helping people and keeping our ecosystem clean because we live in that . take care of kids . they are innocent . take care of elders especially when they can t help themselves . be kind to strangers and keep your distance still . make things comfortable . i think people just need to think about doing things normal . or at least try to . but at the same time be able to express themselves and be unique in their own ways . and then keeping an open mind about things . letting people do them in minding your own business . let people do them . and you focus on yourself . view more","24967":"followed","24968":"of what ? i am confused .","24969":"yep . there s nothing wrong with setting goals and then trying your best to be determined to achieve them ! that is a really good way to be in life ! success is a big part of life . and it really makes you feel good when you complete certain tasks especially ones that took you weeks or even months !","24970":"it can . . . just depends . they always say you re supposed to stretch before you workout . like if you lift weights or go for a jog . they always say you stretch for about to minutes and you should stretch every part of your body before going and working out and picking up heavy things . you should stretch your back out your legs or arm your neck all of that if we re going and working out . especially if you haven t worked out in a while . and they say even after you re done working out to do the same stretching methods that you did before when you worked out before starting . sometimes you can pull a muscle on accident or even irritate a nerve . you really have to be careful sometimes with working out you don t want to just go into it hardcore . if you start working out say for instance do you want to do push ups maybe start off with just doing and the next day doing and then the next day doing and then the next day doing you might even want to start out with doing less everyday like push ups for a whole week straight and then the next week start with doing for days straight . picking certain days to work out your legs and certain days to do heavy pickups with your legs and heavy pickups with your arms and then working on your chest area and stomach . it s really complicated but you can look up certain youtube videos to follow . you can even work on different dieting while you re working out . hope i helped . it s never easy getting back into working out but it s always the right thing to do regardless .","24971":"i think you should do whatever you want but don t stress . go with the flow but at the same time if you really want to complete certain things in your life there s nothing wrong with doing that and setting goals","24972":"i do like to bake and i think the last thing that i begged was either some food or if you re literally meaning baking foods i made some muffins","24973":"if you go from lifting weights to not lifting weights if you were start lifting weights again it might actually hurt . but that s the best way i can answer this question because i know from experience . i used to lift weights and if i stop for a few days or a week and got back onto doing it again it would actually her a little bit . like i would just be sore for a few days after but it would be okay . i just need to keep on doing it continuously and don t take such long breaks","24974":"winter"}}
