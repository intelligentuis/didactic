  sometimes, like every gift I'm watching on my private wishlist for amazon for my partner went up in price yesterday and did not come down today. But I found a great deal on eyeshadow on a different site and it was an honest 60%+ off the normal prices which I was aware of and had been watching.
  
  I don't go out shopping today, or usually, so today doesn't compel me to shop really but I did check prices because it's nice to get a deal on things I was going to get eventually anyway

   Do you use Uber or Lyft often? Do you prefer a taxi or light rail or a bus? Or do you just drive yourself? Do you walk many places? Have you ever roller skated? Have you ever water skied?Have bout in the snow? Ever hitch hiked? That‚Äôs really dangerous to do by the way. What are you staring at?
  ","
  I use Lyft fairly often. For getting around when my partner is out of town or getting to doctor's appointments. If we had light rail here I might use it but our bus system is terrible and it's quicker to walk most places I need to go than to try to figure out the bus . I walk sometimes, I can walk to the clinic and the grocery store and the hospital and the farmer's market. Last time I tried to roller skate I broke my elbow immediately. I have not water skied. I have never snow skied. I've never hitch hiked.

  there isn't thanksgiving candy aisles at the store but there is for sure some good Easter candy

   What attracts you to birds? Or what are some things you love about birds that others may not know about?

  I have good memories of bird watching with my otherwise very strict grandfather. Certain things remind me of him in a good way- ways that make me feel proud to have been his favorite granddaughter even if I never lived up to his high expectations. So I've paid attention to and loved birds since a very small child. I think they're graceful, but strong. They're so tiny and light but so athletic and with such big personalities.

   What types of art do you think at most profitable and why in your opinion?
  ","
  right now, impressionism, old masters, and surrealists are the ones bringing in the big dough at auction. My generation's art movements aren't really structured so it varies wildly what sells as far as contemporary art. The internet and globalization sort of killed the idea of an art movement, so it's sort of up in the air and new territory going forward what will be most profitable.

  the plumbing in the master bathroom is corroded and leaking into the basement so we can't use the shower in there until we fix it which honestly hasn't been a priority with all my medical bills happening.

  the level of obsession you have with me is astonishing.
  
  I didn't say something HARMFUL or DISMISSIVE, I used a descriptor. It's just a thing. save your CHILDISH outrage for something important, like the people using slurs.

  Both were different experiences but the first year was more chaotic because it was in an apartment bldg with lots of other students so we had an open door policy and everyone just like, hung out all the time. the second year I was in a house-converted-into-two-apts apartment so we only had downstairs neighbors but I still managed to be the place people just sort of showed up to hang out at

  "
151098,"
   Can you give an example of an omen that would occur for you?
  ","
  it was just- constantly searching for meaning in the weirdest things. Like for instance when I shampoo my hair I stick the loose hairs on the wall of the shower and then rinse them down after I condition my hair. I would look at those loose hair groupings and see objects and symbols that would then supposedly predict my day.
  "
151099,"
   Does the grey cat ever visit you in your dreams and thoughts?
  ","
  not really. When I'm unstable I see him still like the beginning of the summer I had a rough patch and I was triggered out by some rude old man who sneered at me at a grocery store when I was alone and I ended up seeing my cat in the produce section after the man was far enough away
  "
151100,"
   Did you ever have good visual hallucinations and voices talking to you?
  ","
  never good voices. The only voice I've ever heard (auditory hallucination) Is my mother critiquing me or yelling my name.
  
  visual hallucinations, yes some were ""good"". I viewed them as ""omens"" because one of my delusions was that I could predict my future by reading omens. One was a grey cat and he served as a protector and symbolized that I was safe.

151106,"

The only places I go that have separate gender restrooms are very large places like Ikea or the movie theater or the airport or like, a freeway rest stop

  it's just got a high reaction rate with sensitive skin. I'm allergic to it and a lot of people are and don't realize it. They just keep using it in their shampoo and breaking out their backs and necks over and over. the dreaded ""sulphates"" we're learning to avoid in skincare are derived from palm.

  It's really good self care. I also use natural Lush products Herbalism and Imperialis on my skin but I think really it could be anything without palm oil with the same results

  that's great though therapy is so important and if you can learn to manage your own anxiety without meds then you'll be on the road to remission.

  agoraphobia is more like being afraid to leave your house at all but it's definitely a sign of anxiety to feel nervous in crowds
  "
151636,"
   Do you have agoraphobia ?
  ","
  I did but I cured it with exposure therapy over about 2 years
  
  I'd make an appointment with myself to walk to starbucks and back, and then discuss it with my therapist. Then the next week, I'd actually go in and order something to go, and then another meeting and then next time I'd stay a little while, etc in small increments until I was able to go to conventions and deal with downtown crowds even

151639,"
   Like mode disorder, anxiety, panic disorder sometimes but not facing any memory related conditions no memory loss 
But i lose concentration easily and very phobic to diseases but dont facing hallucination or delusions related conditions
  ","
  then I would for sure talk to a doctor if you have panic disorder there are definitely meds for that, I have that also and haven't had a panic attack now in like, at least 2 years.
  
  there's help for anything that could be ailing you. Doctors are leaps and bounds better with mental health now than they were when I was starting out.
  "
151640,"
   Few symptoms are also present in me
  ","
  then I recommend checking in with a psychiatrist and a psychologist and getting that support that they can offer
  "
151641,"
   What symptoms you have ?
  ","
  at the time I was having positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, etc) and negative symptoms (flat emotion, depression, ahedonia, etc) not so much any cognitive symptoms (disordered speech, loss of short term memory, inability to concentrate, etc)
  
  Now that I'm taking anti psychotics and prozac, I only really suffer from cognitive symptoms and rarely negative symptoms.

151651,"
   What‚Äôs the difference between loneliness and being alone? Do you believe that the capacity to be alone is the capacity to love? If you feel a certain feeling, do you just let it be, own it, or you have to distract yourself from it?
  ","
  loneliness is a negative reaction to being alone. The act of being alone is neutral but to feel an emptiness/need for interaction with other living beings is a potential side effect.
  
  I don't see what these things have to do with each other
  
  I just feel things as they occur and try to stay mindful in all things
  "
151652,"
   What are your views on ""forgiveness""? Are you the sort to forgive easily, the sort to give people a lot of chances, or otherwise?

  In theory I'm forgiving, mainly because I just don't want to hold on to that negative emotion
  
  in practice, though, I hold grudges and cut people off.
  
  so, overall, I have no idea what I'm doing really I guess it's case by case

   Your parakeet is so cute! Can you tell us about him üòá
  ","
  thanks! she's a 3 and a half year old american parakeet named Bubo, which is Latin for ""owl"". She has a super strong breeding instinct- to the point of it being a problem- so she's on eggs a lot. She's sitting on 4 eggs right now, and has had 42 eggs total in her short life. Her vet is baffled but we assume she's just so happy with her environment that her instinct is telling her it's a good time to bring babies into the world- even if none of them are fertilized.
  
  when she's not on eggs she's the most loving, companionable little girl. She loves to be the center of attention and she stays with me most of the day on a shoulder or close by.

  looking at your profile you seem very young and very against fat people.

  But not a single one of my health problems has been because of my weight. They've been chronic conditions that would have become prominent at any size.
  
  in fact I only gained weight in the first place after a whole 25 years of being skinny when PCOS became an issue and this is not the biggest I've been- I weighed a lot more than now a few years ago even.

  no it's changed over the years. It started off with just a hotel and a few restaurants attached, for instance, but now is a super complex with several condominium towers, schools, and a large field where festivals and fairs and markets happen. The neighboring area has built up to become a booming seaside town. I'm now loving out in the country a little bit but I can still walk to the mall where I work and go to school.
  
  The mall is as busy and important to this town as malls were in the 80s in middle america. There is a food court with neo lights and standard department and boutique stores, also some medical offices on the edges and a mall clinic. I have spent a lot of time in the back parts of the mall, the storage facilities and the hallways and the long empty corridors past the backdoors of the shops

  ","
  I was very young and stupid and was in a car with two white men. all three of us were completely wasted and there was a drunk driving checkpoint we had to go through. The driver decided he was too drunk to pass and I climbed from the backseat into the front seat while he took the backseat so that I could appear to be the driver. All of this was super obvious. I hit the hazard lights with my foot during the switcharoo so not only were we totally obviously drunk the hazards were on. Somehow though, the cops passed us through? Like, he asked about the hazards and I slurred something about putting them on to let other drivers behind me know to slow down for the checkpoint. he told me to have a nice night and waved us through.

  I have some expensive eyeshadow palettes and I guess they're worth it in that they make me feel ""special"" when I use them but there are a lot of great cheap eyeshadows too (Milani, Essence is getting way better, again Wet n Wild's quality is really good despite the cruelty free issue)

  They are at the top of their power structure, not white people. Your assumptions about race are very Westernized. White people aren't the default top-of-the-power-chain in every part of the world (eyeroll)
  
  Therefore, they feel entitled to talk me up. Like White men in my country. But white men in my country aren't on this website as much so what I literally get, all the time, are middle eastern dudes. Treating me like I'm obligated to give them time because they like the way I look.
  
  You really need to sit down and educate yourself on power structures and what that means and where it intersects. On a global scale.
  
  I'm not saying middle eastern men in other countries, like America, where they are oppressed, are included in this. I'm talking about literally dudes from like Pakistan, with all of their rights and privileges, acting like entitled fucks.

   Wow, are you only jesting about the east coast being swollowed up by the Atlantic or is that true to the extent sand is trucked in?  That must be so expensive and where do they get the trucked in sand from, China?  (LOL)
  ","
  nope totally true.....and the west coast is the opposite- tons and tons of sand washing up from the pacific and loooooooooooong beaches. I don't know where it's trucked in from but VB spends millions on sand every few years
  "
155506,"
   Hahaha, that's funny.  Are the beaches at VB pristine and clean?  Over here in Australia we have very white sand on most of the beaches.  Some sand beaches are like fine powder almost
  ","
  no, it's a yellow sandbox-playtime-color sand that they have to truck in from god knows where because the east coast of the united states is being swallowed back by the atlantic
  "
155507,"
   Yes, you certainly have to know your scuba equipment well to feel confident being down at depth.  We used to do spearfishing and that was more dangerous because of the sharks that would come around sniffing for a feed
  ","
  I used to LOVE open water swimming when I lived in Va Beach. I'd go down to the ocean about 3-4 mornings a week at sunrise and go for a swim then take a nap in the sun before people started coming in. SO I've swam with dolphins definitely and probably also sharks but I never had an incident. I used to like to say ""It's not really swimming unless there's a chance you have to punch a shark in the eyeball""

   Nice fish there Allison.  I do scuba diving occassionally and see many pretty fish.  I have done underwater photography but it isn't the same as actually being down there

  I'm terrified of scuba/diving I love the images people get down there and the ocean is fascinating but the idea of relying on technology to breathe makes me panic

  ","
  where I live in the pacific northwest has more stabbings than shootings for instance. Our local news hardly ever mentions gun violence and when it does, the most probable causes are police-related shootings rather than just random people walking around with guns
  "
155520,"
   But isn't America itself a gun culture?
  ","
  yes but I've found in my travels that some places more so than others.
  "
155521,"
   Sure but I can't see the link between 75% of the town being trained with assault weapons and the occurrance of the shootings.  Apparently the recent mass shooting was done by a government employee and not a military person
  ","
  Look. All I am saying- and please stop reading between the lines, you're overthinking it-
  
  where there are lots of guns, there are lots of shootings. it's gun culture.
  "
155522,"
   Oh, I thought you were suggesting that it's naval personell who are doing the shootings?  If it's not, then why do you mention the navy presence in Virginia Beach with regard to the actual shootings themselves?
  ","
  because guns are ridiculously popular in military towns collecting guns is a regular hobby/lifestyle and 75% of town is trained with assault weapons. They're easy to get and easy to find. Like I said, I was there all week last week and there were literally multiple shootings EVERY DAY.
  "
155523,"
   Are you saying that there's a causal link between the Virgina Beach shootings and the navy bases there?  If so, how are the two linked?
  ","
  no that's not what I""m saying, I'm saying that people who own guns use guns.

155525,"
   What do you mean when you say that Virginia Beach is military?

  there are several major navy bases in va beach area so a large majority of residents are in the military.

155526,"
   Do you think that mass murders are occurring more frequently in America?
  ","
  gun violence mass murders yes. I was there all week and that whole area is just shooting after shooting after shooting and now this, it's horrible. Everyone in that town is military and like has a personal arsenal. Where I live now hardly ever has shootings unless they're cop-instigated because a much smaller percentage of people are gun owners here in the more liberal west
