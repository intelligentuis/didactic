dead and they regret not being kinder or talking to that person while they were alive . it s rather sad actually . you should have respected them while they were alive and treated them well . i think it s mainly because they feel regretful and sorrowful that they didn t treat that person right when they were alive . it s like they will start caring and say oh that person was so great when they re dead but when they were alive they never really cared . we should respect the living and dead as well of course but don t start respecting someone that you didn t respect before just because they re dead or care about them . that s just sad i ve seen that online with the legend chester bennington where people didn t care or even listen to his music before but when he passed people were like he was so talented and such an amazing singer and i just thought to myself wow that s sad you never cared about him or listened to his music when he was alive smh . that breaks my heart . you should care and respect someone when they re alive and living on this world like they deserve that much . it just breaks my heart really .","845370":"and i m going back to sleep","845371":"i like spicy food
