I would typically just stick to our neighborhood. There was one haunted house in the area (that wasn't cute \ud83d\ude13\ud83d\udc7b) that I went to once with my brother and a friend, and then there was also this house who didn't have a haunted house set up but had a small front yard in front of their house and they would make it super spooky and my brother & I used to get scared. The dude I think was some kind of public speaking retiree and he owned a microphone so you could him hear doing his evil laugh and saying spooky stuff from blocks away. every Halloween He has this huge white beard that he would die all black too. He is also a friend of my dad's \ud83d\ude06\n  ","942415":"\n  Sure\n  ","942416":"\n  Wait, so when you say \"exempted in an exam that I cheated in, doesn't that imply that I already did the exam? Bc, I cheated on the exam so I already took it...I'm kinda confused on that...\n  \n  But either way, I'm tempted to say the former bc I would do almost anything to avoid public speaking, and \"presenter\" sounds like public speaking. Plus, I don't really have an issue with cheating on exams... I can't really do it bc of morals I guess, but at the same time, I don't really have animosity for people who do bc I think exams are stupid. If the exams were really just for what they are said to be, which is so that the teachers can see where the students are at, then I would be against it all around, but that's not really what exams seem to really be. Exams in my experience typically give students a numeric score that tells the teacher whether they should pass or fail in their class - simply bc of this number. Rarely are we allowed to retake exams, although as humans, we don't all learn things linearly. Sometimes, we start fully realizing how to do something after the exam and then we have the knowledge but that's not reflected in our grade bc we failed the earlier test. So evidently then, the class is not grading us on what we know, it's grading us on our ability to learn complete concepts in small amounts of time, have significant memorization skills, be obedient and get things right on \"first times the charm.\" It's not very fair bc it's not giving an accurate representation of what students have gained in knowledge throughout a class, yet that's the determinate for whether they pass or not. Then teachers have the audacity to say \"don't cheat bc the only person you will really be cheating with is yourself.\" That's not true bc if you cheat and that gives you the right answer, then you have a passing grade and that's what your future is determinate on. So, that went into a very long vent, but basically, my answer is #1. Although, for the record, I don't cheat on tests....\n  ","942417":"\n  thanks \u2764 I'm just not convinced tho tbh.
