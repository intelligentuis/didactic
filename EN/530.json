i hate failure so thats probably why i made that rule lol","490348":"they are empty . literally no soul , nothing . feels like youre looking a creep dolls eyes or a robot . and ive had many people believe i was wrong but ive always end up right . and i just patiently wait for them to slip up and show the world their true self and im telling you if you just wait , the truth always comes out .","490349":"thank you for making it sound like im being a good person but its honestly selfish . i love studying human behavior and the brain . so the more i learn about the person the better understanding . so it works in my favor . i genuinely am curious about how other perceive things that happen and their point of view and why . so yeah thats probably why it pisses me off .","490350":"we are all connected . people dont understand that we literally are all equal to each other . like scientifically our energy , and our cells yes all our cells made different things but no one whos white gets more cells than someone thats black . no one thats asian has more energy than someone from italy . like our bodies our all connected through energy which makes our energy connect to earth which makes our energy connected to the universe . we have to be connected for everything to work . so yes i believe we are all equal and when i see a person i look into their eyes which makes people really uncomfortable lol because im looking past their skin and features and i want to see within . thats why it takes me seconds to know whether i wanna be around this person or not . theres been so many people ive looked into there eyes and i had to look away cause they were cold as fuck and they always end up being actually psycho lol . anyways , i went on a rant im sorry . its my mind . lol","490351":"my mind is racing a million miles per minute . i have this issue where if someone hurts me or something hurts me and i feel pain in my chest i will go fucking silent and still and just focus on the pain . i will literally sit there punishing myself to feel the pain cause i am terrible . and no matter how many times i think , i need to move and take myself out of this situation . i cant move . i can only move once the pain in my chest has finally left . and now im thinking about how much do you really care about someone if you are repeatedly finding yourself resenting them for things ?","490352":"yeah , and i just laugh and go what ? im such a spoiled brat . lol but i will admit that there are certain life experiences that have made me more grounded for sure .","490353":"they just opened up in this area , so i was thinking of going but the line is insane . so maybe once it calms down if it ever does ?","490354":"omg thank you . thats what i literally tell people . you dont respect someone if you instantly go and talk about them behind their back in a negative way .","490355":"small","490356":"people always say , for how spoiled you are and look youre super humble and down to earth . lol","490357":"awh ! i have to get a new address which i dont have right now .","490358":"i just wish people were better at actually talking to someone about how they feel instead of going to their friends or family and just complain about them and just get support from whatever and then pretend nothing was ever said .","490359":"theres so many . but the ones where they clearly sound like theyve been around me in person but not someone i really hang out with those are the ones im super curious about .","490360":"i dont want to get into it , but im just super annoyed .","490361":"not as often as i used to . i check it here and there but i just need a break from all of that .","490362":"where do you send what ?","490363":"thats the second or third time someone has showed me something or said something about dj khaled . lol and no , im not really a fan .","490364":"i really need to vent . you truly dont know a person until you see or hear what they are like when they think no one is listening . especially when they talk about you and then when they are around you they act and say different things .","490365":"nope , no buts lol","490366":"i know its been awhile since ive seen your name ! glad you are back . what have you been up too ?

the way im thinking about it is if im an explorer and i was set to sail there with the knowledge that nobody has ever been there but what if i think i was the first person but i really wasnt ? i think of all possibilities","490383":"this ought to be good . you have an explanation for why god can just work in mysterious ways but no bid deal a father just lost his whole family in a car accident or the mom was raped and murdered but the daughter was left alive but without a mother . what mystery would god have to do that ? and dont bring another imaginary friend into this , i dont need to hear about how the devil works just as hard as the lord bullshit .","490384":"now how do you know what the land was like before i explored it ? maybe to me its new land but i come across a small village thats been around for hundreds of years ? and in this time maybe the worlds were able to open doors more frequently which made me the alien mother which made me superior and had the villagers build me a castle because i was one of the gods for the stars ?","490385":"all of religion is heretics . today i went on rant , they say god works in mysterious ways and they are so mysterious that we will spend our whole lives trying to find the answer that we will never actually find out meaning that if its so mysterious without any possible explanation of why the fuck bullshit always happens and why god wanted it too then the god we think probably doesnt exist .","490386":"i would be the first to build the ultimate castle .","490387":"well whats the background story ? is this person a stranger or someone ive been dating ?","490388":"no , never . my moms family were buddist and my dads are adventist .","490389":"my least favorite thing is my favorite restaurant closed down cause they owners retired and my heart fucking broke . they made a fortune but didnt want others to have their recipe and now they just sell their stuff in an italian place in la but fuck","490390":"watching youtube . i was watching chaotic evil tik tok videos by far my favorite videos on tik tok .","490391":"because thats where all the beautiful castles are and i would finally be a princess .","490392":"am right now lol","490393":"a couple days ago . when i have a bad day it feels like theres this fog covering my thoughts . i can hardly more . i dont want to move my legs . i dont want to talk . i just end up watching a pointless show to binge .","490394":"i was an overtrained athlete . i basically tried every sport . club teams , school teams , independent training , and sports at home just for fun bmx , skateboarding , throwing knives , boxing , riding horses , swimming . i mostly did cross country , soccer , and volleyball .","490395":"you like me a lot ? awh you should stay in my life .","490396":"ok i miss it too . damn","490397":"in a way , yes . im gonna kinda nerd out so i apologize . we all have chemicals that are just our pheromones . these chemicals are what let us know who we are attracted to and who we are not not just relationship , like friendship , just people we feel comfortable around like when you walk into a crowded room with hundreds of people everyone manages to link up with the people they have the most chemistry with . have you ever wondered why that one person you saw across the room ends up sitting next to you talking to you by the end of the night ? thats not just cause they are interested in you , their body chemistry attached themselves to you and therefore they believe they must like you . so my answer is yes because our brain cant decipher between feelings , it just knows my chemistry mixes with that person must speak and we mistake it all as crush love at first sight when in actually we should look at it more as i will get along with that person i should meet them .","490398":"and what anon ?","490399":"thank you very kind of you","490400":"ash is a crazy kitty . i love her but my god is she nuts sometimes lol","490401":"its not a diary but i have thousands of journals .","490402":"why do you miss work ?
