had no idea what to expect from you guys . you guys are so supportive of our cimorelli music , but i wasn t sure what the reaction would be to my music . i was so scared of putting myself out there . especially with my song running . that was the first song i released . not sure why i decided to start with the most vulnerable one i remember when i announced it was coming out i was soooo nervous and for that whole week before it came out i could barely eat . not only was it terrifying anticipating what people s reactions might be , but at this point in my life i was a very private person . i didn t like sharing struggles , or vulnerabilities with people . especially not to strangers on the internet . i wrote this song when i was with the sole intention of expressing my feelings about the situation i was in . i had no idea how to produce a song and not much of an idea how to write a song . my thought when i finished it was there is no way i am ever realizing this . this is waaayy too personal . years later , my baby was about to come into the world . every song on my ep orange came about the same way . the only thought i had while writing these was this what is the most accurate way i can communicate the way that i am feeling right now ? the response i got to all of these songs was overwhelming . especially to running . it s so humbling to see the support you guys have shown

knew we were coming because they re the ones who sold and provided the tickets and even had the poster of the show up . our name was even written on the theater light thing etc . they knew we had a show that day as well . a mutal friend who works with my sisters boyfriend chad gilbert who is on new found glory he was on tour as well but had to fly home due to a family emergency so please keep in your prayers and thoughts . booked the show for us and we even had payed to use their venue . provided all the information they would need and so on . so we arrive to the venue , its freezing cold . we also had a street team that was given early access passes and special rewards for promoting us spreading word etc . we had to do soundcheck and make sure our equipment and everything was set up , lights worked , tech was all good . we all had to show ids individually , like why ? how do you not know who the band is and when theyre performing etc ? then they refused to let us inside the venue for like minutes left us standing there in the cold . when they finally let us in we got everything set up and sorted with the equipment and so on . meet and greet came around and i believe the doors weren t open on time as well the security was being really rude to members of the fandom that were getting their turns to meet us and pictures etc . telling fans to hurry up as they were handing out letters or whatever . so i was getting really ticked off and just wanted to call them out on it . i feel bad for how many of them were treated like that and its poor training on the theaters behalf .","781484":"if i don t know them or don t want to be high i simply just try to walk away","781485":"yes and yes","781486":"it was a good show the fans were loud and hyped . however there were issues
