When I go to the gym I'm there for an hour and a half or two hours max. I don't bring anything with me besides a waterbottle. I don't want my phone to lug around from station to station. It would probably make me look at it more than doing what I came to do. I don't need added distractions. I don't really have any bottoms that have pockets when I workout. I like being in the moment. Taking a break from whatever devices. I don't need to have a bunch of crap photos of me at the gym to prove a point to people. I don't need to always talk about how much weight i lost either.\n  \n  Also I own 6 different 1stphorm products so it's kind of lame to own all that and NOT WORKOUT. Just because you don't see me doesn't mean shit.\n  \n  I don't ALWAYS need to tell people on here when I'm going to workout or I just did a workout. That shit can get annoying. I'm not always on here every hour on the hour. There can be huge gaps in the hours when I'm not on here. In April, I won't be on much at all.\n  \n  Foodwise i have been pretty good besides the odd Chinese food now and again. You don't always know what I eat unless I get asked about food or something on here. I'm not on a strict diet or anything. Diets don't work for me. Lifestyle change and moderation works for me. Having more protein than other macros helps. Using my 1stphorm products helps. Taking vitamins and shit helps.\n  \n  Do I know what you do 24\/7? No. So i don't get why you *have* to be rude about me doing or not doing x,y, and z. I have admitted that this winter has been shit but that still doesn't change the fact that I'm still bettering myself in other ways. I have still lost a bit of weight.. just not where I want to  be \/ should be. I don't need anyone's negativity.\n  ","545067":"\n  Chicken\n  \n  Christmas\n  \n  Chocolate\n  ","545068":"\n  Hazel.\n  ","545069":"\n  He doesn't bug me that much.

Right!?\n  \n  Um... I guess I feel good. A little content but at the same moment I can't wait for April so I can get a much needed tan. At the gym again. Possibly hike a few mountains. Sunshine... gimme it all! So sick of snow. Pool filled days.\n  ","545076":"\n  Oh\n  ","545077":"\n  I tried teaching\n  \n   @y3110wp1nk13\n  \n  that yesterday and he just didn't understand lol Maybe I wasn't clear enough? Idk.\n  \n  It's whatever. Sometimes it can be fun to share how much of an ass someone is being when they do DNP? Or they stop writing dp and I forget to not answer it then. Like sometimes you need the space to write something back, ya know? It's just easier in most cases. Chances are most DPs are things that don't even need to be private in the first place so it can be comical in that way.\n  \n  But ya.. anyone can do dnp or just go on anon and I'll give more of a longer response... going back and forth on here can be a bit boring if I'm not in the mood or don't care for the topic. I'm here more for the Q&A but conversation can be nice as well.\n  ","545078":"\n  Somewhat. It's fascinating.
