Ive always scored with flying colors in reading, writing, and reading comprehension and i always used to think \"who cares? Id rather be good at singing\" it wasnt until i got older until i realized im really good at captivating my reader with the way i write. Im good at explaining things for all levels of intelligence to understand. Ive also learned that writing is an art form that is dying, because language is dying and technology made it die.

I also dont believe its this happy go lucky story that people try to tell themselves it is, we are his guinea pigs.\n  \n  No, i believe that this after life idea that people decided to believe in is just a way for them to feel better. There are numerous scriptures that say when you die you are essentially asleep, and you know nothing, you feel nothing.
