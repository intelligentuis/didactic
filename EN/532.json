try to be more understanding . doctors tend to make people with mental illness feel like they need to labeled as such and end up feeling crazy and start to believe all they are is their illness","492251":"oh good ! im not the only one","492252":"if hitler won dude omg hitler would be an alien and we would all worship him . i have a theory . . what if the reason why hitler hated jews and was trying to get rid of them is because he was an alien and we had no idea that jews are actually a different species and thats why jews are the only ones that is a culture , race , and religion . thats why they were called the chosen ones jesus was a jew as well and we mistakenly thought of him as the son of god but what id actually he was an alien trying to teach his people . why do jews always end up in high economic careers ? why are most celebrities jewish ? because they are all aliens ?","492253":"im constantly making movie lists lol","492254":"any romantic movie i hateeeee them .

race of people . so by the definition he was in fact successful because he in fact accomplished what he was aiming for . his weapons and experiments didn t just drop off after him , they were continued to be used to create a perfect world by america . . and he successfully murdered million jews im gonna say thats what he was aiming for sooo for someone to be successful they can be a liar , murderer , or cheater . the most successful people in the world are corrupted . the richest man in the world has a picture of hitler and stalin not cause he agrees with what they did because they were successful leaders","492266":"america","492267":"hey whats up ?","492268":"that was creative ill give you that","492269":"right ? i make this point all the time but people always hate me cause they

weapons","492274":"the book i really wanted them to make into a movie they ended up actually doing it mrs . peregrines home for peculiar children . such a great book","492275":"no , its funny cause

based on if i were someone that was inlove with me and try to imagine what they might love about me so i can learn how to love myself . her beauty is like learning , the more knowledge i accumulate , the deeper my passion has grown . whenever i make a dark joke , thats borderline inappropriate , her laugh fills up the room her laugh was crafted out of sunshine . split second the world stops spinning , the clock stops ticking , everywhere around starts to blur , all i see clearly is the way she throws her head back and covers her mouth like she s trying to catch her laughter before it bursts out of her body . i wish i could spend all night telling her jokes , just so i can have her laughter outshine the moon . the way she fidgets with her hands and bites the side of her lip when she starts to get anxious , stopping myself from making our hands intwine and kiss her so she knows shes not alone . he pauses , holding in his breath , stares up into the starlight filled sky , and begins again . you know , she s a really good person , i know what you re thinking there s a lot of good people . she s a good person down to her very core where most for us can feel a little fire burning , hers isn t fire she has sunlight . after time and time again , people are using there fire to burn her , they don t realize she was crafted by an angel sunlight will always burn brighter than fire . he begins to laugh , i am so convinced she s birthed from an angel and a combination of the stars and the sun , that i ve started looking into religion again . i think religion is all bullshit , but , how can you explain finding someone with such purity in a world full of cruelty ? his mother doesn t answer , she knows he was only being rhetorical , so she just smiles at her son . what s even more amazing , is that despite all the pain , caused by others , she still dusts herself off , and gets right back up . the strength , will power , resilience . she will not go down without a fight . sqa","492508":"to have a sense of your feelings","492509":"my bed","492510":"how are you today ? just got informed that there might be a fire . so theres that .","492511":"was very
