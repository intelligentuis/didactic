in my opinion . there s such a culture around alcohol and there s too much acceptance for people to drink every day especially young people . it s disguised as being fun , when really it can quickly become an addiction and a mask for how you feel inside .","264105":"i mean . . . if you can afford it on your own , then you re free to do what you want to do . i understand not wanting to do household chores due to depression , though . sometimes it does alleviate symptoms when you do try to commit to certain tasks , though depending on the person . even if you try to do one small task a day , it ll provide you with a sense of accomplishment .","264106":"i don t have one atm , i think ? at least not to the severity that i used to have .","264107":"i didn t think you were trying to

occupation is in , that doesn t mean there isn t more room for education or improvement .","264122":"i m not challenging you , lol . i ve been conducting research into mental illness since i was a teenager because that s how long i ve had mental health issues . you evidently don t know me very well and you re only basing your opinion of me off of that one solitary response .","264123":"there are also people who don t experience depression , though . to claim that everyone has a mental illness is a bit ignorant and erases the struggles people with mental illness actually face . bipolar disorder is different on several levels , but that s an entirely different discussion , lol . i respect your passion for mental health as a mental health professional , but please do not treat me as if i don t know what i m talking about .","264124":"no , i don t have a specific theme .","264125":"sometimes , but only if they re boneless .","264126":"i d rather always wear pajamas , haha

.","264133":"yeah , but i m not a fan of it .","264134":"yeah , i usually wake up to around additional questions overnight as well as questions i get throughout the day . most of them are shout outs , though .","264135":"i wear glasses .","264136":"november th .","264137":"in my head , especially considering i m alone most of the day and don t really speak out loud when i m alone .","264138":"i disagree even though i m a layperson , i definitely don t think everyone has a mental illness . people may have some symptoms here and there , but that doesn t mean they have a diagnosable disorder . neurotypical people exist all over the place .","264139":"it s been fine , although i mentally feel like sh t rn . everything in me wants to leave work early , but i don t want to waste my pto unless i absolutely have to .","264140":"chicken ceasar salad .","264141":"getting my bachelor s degree , quitting smoking cigarettes , and moving out of my parents house .","264142":"no , that would give me endless panic attacks due to social anxiety .","264143":"someone s race doesn t matter to me , but i m not interested in dating either way .","264144":"sometimes it s good to explain to the person why you don t want to pursue things further , but there are also plenty of times where it isn t worth it to explain and you re better off just ghosting them .","264145":"haha no , i was just comparing my feelings for my ex with the feelings i had for this other person and they were very similar , even though i was younger at the time .","264146":"not really , i ve figured this for a while .","264147":"i also believe i was in love with someone prior to dating him .","264148":"twice .","264149":"it takes a lot of time and patience with yourself . you have to remember you were a whole person prior to meeting them , and you can be a whole person subsequent to leaving them . i understand how difficult it can be , though . i had a hard time moving on from my ex when we broke up .","264150":"i ve always used android phones .","264151":"store bought . i don t make my own juice , rofl .","264152":"english and forensics .","264153":"there are healthy and unhealthy coping defense mechanisms . wanting other people to fear you is very unhealthy .","264154":"drink water , take my medication , and get adequate sleep most nights .","264155":"yeah , that sounds slightly arrogant to me . just because you re a teacher or a professor in a particular subject doesn t necessarily mean you know everything there is to know about that subject especially when it comes to lgbtq , racism , and feminist issues . ideas in those realms are constantly changing and evolving , especially now with the influence of social media . in any case , educators should most definitely take their students ideas and opinions into account because it might even make them look at a subject or a topic in a different light .","264156":"open world rpgs and a few first person shooters .","264157":"no , that isn t normal . it s common but not normal or healthy .","264158":"eh , sometimes depending on if i feel like taking a new selfie and i m happy with the outcome . i m probably going to change it again this weekend considering i m coloring and cutting my hair .","264159":"move out of my parents house when i was finally given the opportunity to do so . i haven t looked back .","264160":"yes , that s healthy .","264161":"my bedroom is my favorite room in the house , although i ve been spending more time in the living room lately . my bedroom is fairly large with a queen sized bed , a desk for my laptop , a tv stand with my television and xbox console and various knick knacks , a bookshelf , and some bedside tables . i want to clean it more thoroughly since i have some clothes laying around . my living room is pretty simple two couches , two reclining chairs , a coffee table , and a television with some side tables . i want to hang more art on the walls .","264162":"i like personalized questions related to mental health , my career education , my hobbies , my writing , politics to a certain extent , and art .","264163":"chocolate chip cookie dough .","264164":"i ve owned xbox consoles for my entire life .","264165":"my own self expectations .","264166":"atlantis the lost empire , treasure planet , moana , and tangled .","264167":"no , i do genuinely love reading . i just haven t had the attention span to finish a book in a few years .","264168":"i would choose to keep black clothing .","264169":"i m more of an early bird , but i have my periods where i m a night owl as well i think tonight is going to be one of those nights . i don t exercise .","264170":"my day has been rather good , thank you ! ! i woke up early this morning so my roommates and i can drive out to pick up the bunny we adopted . afterwards , we put the finishing touches on his enclosure temporary for now , we re going to move his hut and playpen upstairs so he has more room to roam around . then we had breakfast together . i ended up taking , like , a four hour nap in the middle of the day . . . i ve been awake for around . hours , and now i m drinking wine and catching up on my inbox .","264171":"spinach , broccoli , asparagus , and brussel sprouts .","264172":"well , i hope so . i definitely didn t plan on living this long , but i think younger leigh would be happy with the progress i ve made both personally and professionally , especially regarding living on my own and not with my parents anymore .","264173":"i find myself more attracted to people with dark hair , and the length depends on what suits that individual person the most . i do like beards on men , and i really love tattoos on people regardless of their gender . i don t like huge muscles , but everything else is fine by me . i ve been interested in people of different shapes and sizes .","264174":"both , depending on what sort of mood i m in . of the time , i only spend money on what s necessary . but other times , i do impulsively spend money on random things .","264175":"how my mental illnesses affect my every day life .","264176":"yeah , but i haven t played it since i was a kid .","264177":"not really , no . lol . i mean . . . i can dance , but not well at all .","264178":"i love reading , but i haven t finished a book in a very long time .","264179":"i don t like actual coconut or coconut water , but sometimes i like coconut flavored things .","264180":"yeah , i love tacos .","264181":"they didn t .","264182":"i prefer to hear compliments on my writing .","264183":"all of the true crime docu series that i ve seen on there , as well as the show you . i can t wait for season three to come out .","264184":"i ve always wanted to know how to sing very well .","264185":"continue reading , writing , and speaking in english at every opportunity you can get . the best way to get assimilated into a different culture language is to practice it every day .","264186":"that s definitely far from the truth , rofl . either way my ex and i have been broken up for over . years , and he s been in a relationship since then . i m happy for him and his relationship .","264187":"i

games with my friends at night , particularly when we play halo or among us together .","264190":"the makeup i received in the mail a few weeks ago , tbh . it was the perfect match to my skin tone , makes my skin look flawless without being overly heavy , and gets rid of my underye circles completely .","264191":"stick to a routine of going to bed earlier and waking up earlier in the day , even if it might be a slow transition . don t have any caffeine after like pm , eat dinner earlier in the evening , and restrict your screen time at night .","264192":"i wouldn t think that s incredibly rude , no . it s better to recognize that within yourself , knowing that you might say something you regret , and walking away for a moment to collect your thoughts as opposed to saying something in the spur of the moment that you might regret .","264193":"not personally , no .","264194":"i actually don t believe i ve read his work before . i ve read work from nikolai gogol , vladimir nabokov , and a few others i can t remember .","264195":"i think it s extremely manipulative .","264196":"oh wow , i had no idea i was trending . lol . i like the writing and editing aspects of my job the most , particularly when i write magazine articles or press releases that get distributed to the media . i also really love proofreading and copyediting things other people have written .","264197":"i try

have to do that a lot when it came to my own family .","264205":"not at all . i ve always been a bit indifferent to the holiday in general , haha . it s super commercialized and i believe you should show appreciation and gratitude to your partner outside of this particular day .","264206":"no , it isn t .","264207":"i ve been using askfm since or .","264208":"i fear abandonment most of all , particularly from my friends and other people i love . i also don t like enclosed spaces .","264209":"the symptoms of my mental illnesses .","264210":"what is currently making me happy the bunny we

.","264213":"i guess i prefer instagram over facebook . i use instagram a bit more .","264214":"i enjoy smoking marijuana , and i also think it should be legalized for medical and recreational use . it s a hell of a lot healthier than other mind altering substances that are currently legal primarily alcohol , and marijuana is also useful in the treatment of certain medical conditions .","264215":"what i ve been doing at work has been very important , which makes me happy that i ve been chosen to be part of the new developments within the company . other than work , my roommates and i just adopted a bunny .","264216":"yes , i do .","264217":"i m more of a morning person these days , but i do like relaxing at night .","264218":"that s an example of toxic masculinity , and it s extremely harmful to you and men in general . men aren t supposed to be emotionless , strong people they re obviously just as capable of showing emotion as much as any other gender . holding your
