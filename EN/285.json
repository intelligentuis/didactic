Turns out my body is stuck tiny because I don't have enough growth hormones, and my body has fake growth spurts where my metabolism is going really fast, but my metabolism just keeps going faster and faster, so I can eat a ton without ever gaining weight. So many people think that should be a good thing, but it really isn't because I can become anorexic cuz of it, but I don't have to worry as long as I fill myself up good each time I get hungry. The doctor said that it's a good thing I told him that cuz the problem is very rare, and they've yet to come up with a cure for it.
