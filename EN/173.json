be mistaken in your assessment of what constitutes slavery . if a person is fairly compensated in payment then that s classified as a job although work be feeling like straight up slavery sometimes amirite ? in my previous answer i clearly stated that rickshaw drivers must be fairly paid . also , it is both recommended and well within the driver s right to impose a weight limit on their cabs . drivers may refuse to carry someone who exceeds the weight limit . it is the same with animals pulling or carrying carts . here s a very recent article from about an american rickshaw company that

why not . that s a person pulling a cart right ? it s also called a jinricksha bc it s originally from japan if i m right . a good solution to crowded streets where no motorized vehicles or large

m not racist to an anonymous person on the internet . . . this feels oddly like some sort of gaslighting technique . if being racist is a state of mind where you feel superior to someone else based on the color of their skin or their heritage and you put them down for it , then i don t feel i m racist because i don t feel that way about others . i just like minding my own business and trying to spread positive energy . you get out of life what you put into it so why not just try to be kind and happy ?","160179":"no i don t see why they should be outright banned . if there are places where cart horses are being mistreated then there should be either local or state laws enacted to combat that and then the abusers should have their right to own horses revoked and their animals seized . but horse drawn carriages aren t inherently bad or cruel so why not have them at central park and whatnot ya know ?","160180":"it s hard for me to truly feel offended nowadays with so much garbage

you re the same anon who s been spamming about if i m racist or not then imma stop you right there with that last word choice . saying someone is a typical white airhead is in fact racist . i m not

that s what they got .","160183":"not too into screamo or death metal . my best friend growing up was super into it but her music always felt too sharp and grating to my ears . i like showtunes ,

books","160194":"a year and some change","160195":"it s a balance just like everything in life . americans haven t gone soft or whatever , this is now the age of information ! we know so much now and info can be disseminated to so many people a million times quicker than it used to . that can get out of control of course and be used to push extremist ideology but it also means we don t have to stick to rigid social norms and structure anymore . a shift from traditional sometimes racist and sexist ideals has been bubbling up for hundreds of years and it s finally surfacing now in the s . should we kick out asian american citizens because they started coronavirus ? fuck no dude what is this the playground in elementary school ? plus we already tried stuff like that several times in the past and it turned out horribly and nothing was accomplished except people s lives were ruined or they died . for example that s literally exactly what we did during wwii to japanese americans and it s now considered a national tragedy to be embarrassed of . that s exactly what happened to disabled , jewish , gypsy , and black people across europe during wwi and look at the way the world now views germany . that s also exactly what stalin did during the great purge and several other smaller genocides in russia and we now view them as damn dirty commies . all that because of some ideal that leaders thought was right and would cleanse the nation of someone who was impure , dirty , sick , or immoral . long story short everything is a balance . subjugating and separating a group of people because of their ancestry and country of origin is beyond ridiculous . it won t solve anything . i could go on about the further detriments of randomly deporting people of asian descent from the us but this reply would turn into more of an essay tbh so i ll stop here . i just wanna say that this issue has nothing to do with being politically correct or not or being a lib or whatever and everything to do with knowledge , open mindedness , compassion , and understanding of each other and the human condition . why can t we all use our brains and think together instead of squabbling prettily over whodunnit ? all seems a bit silly to me .","160196":"some words come out more southern sounding than others , some words come out pretty neutrally , and some i end up saying with more of

like the way i talk was influenced by that a lot","160197":"we don t . that s pointless and racist . it s only fuel for the fire that s growing in the us with all these nazi white supremacy groups and bigoted world views that have been surfacing . we need to test all our citizens and adhere to coronavirus social distancing guidelines because they ve proven to work in reducing the spread . the whole world is already on board with that but the united states can t seem to get its shit together","160198":"don t care about race . if they like each other then cool it s good they re in a relationship . that s really the only thing that matters . it s no different than any other relationship , everyone s just a person","160199":"no it s just as it is when i m not bleeding . they re called women s sanitary products . look them up","160200":"i m from near washington dc . . . and even if i were from below the mason dixon why would i be attracted to my family ? that s disgusting my dude wtf","160201":"i d totally be a centaur","160202":". . . are you fucking serious . . . . ? never you pervvy anon","160203":"if it were free sign me up ! but i don t have any extra funds atm","160204":"this is one of the last times i jumped . this is my old trainer s horse , bunny","160205":"no not really that hard ! just lots of time lol . it s a labor of love ! brushing , exercising , feeding , cleaning up after them , and monitoring their health is really all it takes . just like with any pet","160206":"kick back and let the world burn humans are going to die out eventually","160207":"i m not so much into reading like i was when i was younger so i haven t sat down with a good book in a long while . i think the longest one i ve ever read was all creatures great and small by james harriet but i m not sure","160208":"yeah definitely . growing up , i saw that girls were always taught to talk about and process emotions with others , that crying was okay , and that it s okay to make mistakes but when i saw boys cry or mess up or get frustrated it was always toughen up , man up , boys don t cry , it ll build character , or don t be a sissy . and now after spending a bunch of time casually hanging out with my boyfriend s friends over the past year or so it s even more apparent . now we re all in our mid s and i still hear them say that normal things like expressing any emotion like love , sadness , fear . . . anything other than anger . . . is somehow gay and bad . i ve heard them call each other little bitches and gayboys and faggots etc . for liking to do activities like art or singing , for liking animals , flowers , certain colors , or certain music . some of them i can honestly reallyyy tell that they re putting up a front . like they re stifling their own personalities so they can conform to some made up social norm that they think is the right way to be . my experience with toxic masculinity has been much worse in the southern us than up north . i guess it s because the people in the south like to teach and embrace more conservative values than people up north tend to","160209":"there are a lot more up front costs if you re going right into buying a horse since you could stand to spend a few thousand for an animal that s well trained and safe to ride . then there s vet , farrier , feed , and boarding bills only if you don t have your own place to keep them which i don t . . . not to mention if you don t have equipment for riding and taking care of them you ll have to get that stuff too so that s a few more thousand right there . if you already have the stuff then it s not too bad . probably a few hundred a month in upkeep and care just lots of money to get everything you need in the first place","160210":"definitely my boyfriend and my family","160211":"kinda a rant but long story short i d have to say girly . . . but the whole thing is fucking stupid imo . here s why the notion of tough guys grosses me out . most tough guys are absolutely consumed in trying to live up to some toxic standard of masculinity that s been forced down on them . dudes get told that they have to appear , act , and speak a certain way in order to be a real man but that s just dumb . people get so caught up in doing what a man should do that they become an absolute shell of a person who s too afraid of looking gay or girly that they don t let themselves actually be themselves . i see people around me end up trying so hard to look and act tough and to man up and be a man that they lose themselves . and guys who are considered girly are usually people who don t care about that ideal of what a man should be and then they just be themselves and therefore that s girly . it really sucks to see men out there who ve never been complimented , or payed attention to , or expressed their feelings instead of bottling it up , for their whole lives so they have to act like nothing bothers them and they re some sort of robot with no feelings . . . that shits a literal tragedy","160212":"own my own horse . having my lease horse was the closest i ve ever come . he was such a good boy","160213":"i think it was easier on me since i started young . if i had started now it would be super hard !","160214":"i honestly try not to . that shit weirds me out","160215":"black with sugars","160216":"yeah i learned german when i lived there when i was young ! when i got back to the us i took it in school for my language requirements too since i already had picked tip a bit and it just kinda stuck with me","160217":"her majesty s royal space knights of glebulon","160218":"yeah a few times","160219":"i don t have a fave pic of myself here s a random one","160220":"shark diving !","160221":"horseback riding ! look at my handsome man","160222":"i like bikinis but one pieces are much better for actual water sports so it depends on what i m going to do for the day","160223":"if not diving then regular jumping in . it s fun !","160224":"what ?","160225":"a long while ago tbh","160226":"i d love to take a few guided tours of the countries surrounding germany . we could use germany as a home base since it s the language i understand the list of and we could drive to places from there","160227":"try to make a case for myself to get out asap and keep my head down so i could get out early on good behavior","160228":"if i weren t already taken i d say it wouldn t be a dealbreaker but it s not something i actively seek out","160229":"hoard it and make more to better my own and my loved ones lives","160230":"right ? i feel like it just started last week ! corona virus ruined everything","160231":"well . . . since it s water it lays flat over the incline bc of gravity lol . i like having water depth options . one end of the pool for wading and standing and one end for diving","160232":"it s do whatever you want man","160233":"just chilled and filled out some job apps . it was pretty relaxing didn t ride too much though and my riding student s lesson got rained out halfway through . . . felt like someone had poured a bucket of water on us ! we were soaked !","160234":"eat them up probably","160235":"i ve never visited anywhere in asia so i d love to see hong kong or tokyo and then some smaller cities along the way around there too . i d also like to go to some places in thailand or peru maybe","160236":"toll booth operator","160237":"hell yeah man","160238":"prolly eat them","160239":"yeah ikea is fun ! it s huge and you can run around in it lol . me and my mom and sister went to an ikea in germany when i was or so . my sis and i had a blast while she looked for cabinets","160240":"days . . . it was baaaad","160241":"it s not that i don t think space is neat . i wouldn t want to go to space because everything and everyone i ve ever loved is here . my life is on earth i like to look up at the night sky and wonder , but actually going there seems unpalatable to me . it s the great unknown and that s so crazy to me ! i want to be a person who learns more about our planet through biology , ecology , and biogeography rather than about space . i ll leave that to the astronauts and aerospace engineers lol . plus , i really wouldn t like blasting off in a rocket ship or plane to get there . i get sick easily haha","160242":"none really . my family moved around a lot because my parents were in the military","160243":"meh monday s are just like any other day of the week . what i really don t like is work lol","160244":"a gradual incline from shallow water , maybe like m , to deeper water that s more like or so m . i wanna be able to dive into the water without hitting my head","160245":"actually learned a bit about the origin of emotion in my biography and animal behavior classes ! it s pretty neat !","160246":"nope i love the earth tyvm","160247":"ooo that sounds so nice !","160248":"in the future yes ! but currently i m not in a financial position to own my own barn","160249":"not currently but i hope to in the future . i ve been looking into equestrian jobs that would pay but they re very competitive","160250":"can t remember","160251":"that really stinks . that s pretty unfair","160252":"much better at listening !","160253":"that s sad for them that they feel like they need to do that . what is france doing in tunisia ?","160254":"no i don t like violence or anger , it s really not my thing . i m usually a very even tempered person . it s very hard for me to become angry tbh . imo people who get angry or violent while drinking it s because they have issues within themselves that they need to solve , not issues with alcohol . alcohol itself doesn t make them act that way , it s their conscious choice to act badly and then blame it on the liquor and say it s all because of drinking . that s true evil in my eyes . when people behave like violent , loud , wild animals it s disgraceful . . . humans are so much smarter than that ! everyone knows that the only person who can control your actions is yourself ! people who act out that way have little self control and self discipline . . . in a way it seems to me like it s a cry for help . nobody who is a happy , kind , caring , person would act that way unless something was wrong or bothering them . if a person can t stay calm and rational while drinking then it seems to me that they re just using alcohol to vent their frustrations instead of dealing with them in a healthy way like talking about it , writing it down , or redirecting the negative energy the feel into something constructive or creative .","160255":"mein lieblingspony","160256":"only if i could guarantee there d be food , breathable air , and water on their planet . and also i d wanna take sandy and cezar","160257":"haha i feel like you just have to try it for yourself . everybody s drunk is different and every alcohol makes you feel a little different . like wine makes me happy and giggly , beer makes me want to be more talkative , tequila makes me want to jump around and dance , and cheap burnett s vodka makes me cry and feel sick","160258":"tell my partner i love him","160259":"haha idk to get drunk for a social drinking event i guess . that s the only reason i d ever drink that lol p","160260":"norco , california","160261":"uh yeah they re all pretty nasty tasting if you ask me . have you never tried them ?","160262":"and i would be your arch nemesis , the rival mob boss from across the tracks . . . nefarious nik , aka silent snake","160263":"lmao no that s kinda silly to me . i don t know how people hit the bottle like that . alcohol tastes so gross ! i d much rather talk about my problems with someone i love , go outside and enjoy the fresh air , go horseback riding , or channel that energy into something creative like art ! i love to draw","160264":"yeah pretty much . i could take it or leave it at this point . i only drink now when we re having a big social event or party . otherwise i just prefer water , coffee , dr pepper , or sweet tea !","160265":"since early middle school probably . around when i was or i think lol . i used to really go crazy with it but now i can barely drink or drinks before i m tired of it . it really lost its charm tbh","160266":"even keel , baby","160267":"that s so weird lol . we usually get a bunch if people together to drive to a field and have a giant bonfire if we want to make an occasion out of it honestly it s pretty fun ! we play music , sing , play games , goof around , and try to keep the fire going while we drink on saturday nights i haven t done that in a while though . haven t had the time","160268":"anything with cookies ! cookie dough , oreo , or cookies cream to name a few","160269":"a saddle on ebay but it never came","160270":"closed minded people who can t see past their own nose","160271":"that s so interesting how our cultures are so different ! i know people here who drink pretty much every day . it s considered a social norm . especially with beer . sometimes i feel like people here drink beer like it s water","160272":"this guy right here","160273":"wish i had myself ! good luck my dude","160274":"totally ! you mentioned drinking as something you considered as bad . i guess you don t like to drink alcohol then ?","160275":"not to sound lame but water ! i m outside a lot so things with too much sugar end up making me feel too hot and tired and slow ! if not water then definitely either coffee , sweet tea , or dr pepper !","160276":"evil deeds ? like what ?","160277":"fear . i m a pretty anxious person . honestly i just take it day by day","160278":"at night i think they can be a little creepy for sure","160279":"earn million . that s be more satisfying","160280":"cool i love forests i think they re so beautiful","160281":"the horse is a mirror to the soul . . . and sometimes . . . you don t like what s reflected","160282":"is tunisia mostly desert and beaches or are there lots of grasslands and forests ?","160283":"no ! poured on me while i was teaching my riding lesson ! felt like someone dumped a bucket of water on me and all the tack was soaked","160284":"i m not muslim but isn t eid mubarak in may ?","160285":"? ?","160286":"that s awesome have you ever traveled to see any white sand beaches ? those are my favorite ! i went to clearwater florida once to go to their white sand beach . it was awesome","160287":"i don t think so . i don t like being dramatic and having a lot of attention on me","160288":"eat , brush my teeth , feed the dog , and then my partner and i watch an episode or of our show","160289":"i dunno dude google this","160290":"definitely ! if people are being inappropriate , creepy , or overly rude for no reason i ll block them","160291":"no just the cities . we went to the turks and caicos islands afterwards instead . what are the beaches like in tunisia ?","160292":"yeah ! i ve been to tunisia once to visit the ruins carthage it was neat ! only spent a few hours there though . it was part of a cruise ship tour","160293":"some days this week with humidity added to the actual air temperature here it s almost the same . so hot ! where are you from ?","160294":"haha well . . . i m sure you ve heard the usa is the laughing stock of the world stage rn . our leadership has taken an interesting perspective on the pandemic response . . . but all in all life has been pretty quiet and mostly unchanged . i live in the south so it s been as hot and humid as ever . it s been c like every single day","160295":"says in my bio lol . i m","160296":"hi ! ask honestly just helps me pass the time . it s a good distraction lol","160297":"acceptance , stability , and access to the outdoors equestrian sports !","160298":"a long while ago tbh . . . i m trying to put my name out there to signal boost my youtube account so i try to ask more open questions . that was the whole reason i made this account tbh youtube nikki rides","160299":"nope i m broke closest i ve ever had to owning a horse was my last lease horse when i was a teen . i know i could afford to buy a horse but i have nowhere i could keep them so i d have to pay boarding fees to someone who had space for them . that s mostly the problem lol . plus feed and medical bills would definitely bankrupt me at this point in my life . but soon in the future i ll be in a position to own ! i can t wait i ve been doing catch rides , training my student and chance , and applying for working student positions at stables near me right now instead","160300":"drive slow , wake up early , turn the volume of everything down really low so i can see better , get crotchety without my coffee , and have a routine that i m stuck in","160301":"the places i ve ridden at and taken lessons from have ranged anywhere from for a hr lesson so it can get pricey ! but i m not charging this student since the horse belongs to his family","160302":"hopefully somewhere out west !","160303":"it s nice going at my own pace . just found out that he s years old instead of like i thought originally . is kinda getting up there in age for a horse . . . i ll have to re adjust my training schedule with him because of that but it should be no problem ! while i m fine tuning chance i ve also taken on a beginner riding student on him too he has his rd riding lesson today around or so ! i hope it doesn t rain he s been making so much progress !","160304":"social media and everyone s opinion of me","160305":"sandy , cezar , chancellor","160306":"sure why not ? if neither party complicate things then it s just the same as a same gender friendship","160307":"yeah ! previously i was a working student at a few hunter barns but right now i m working independently with this horse named chance","160308":"put lots of it away in savings , invest , pay off debt , and set myself up with a modest house and property with a few acres","160309":"like absolute freedom ! riding has nothing to do with brute strength or willpower and everything to do with partnership and trust that s something i really like about it . . . it feels like you re meaningfully connected to the earth and to another being . it s very peaceful and calming to me","160310":"a woman who is down to earth and in touch with herself and others feelings instead of someone who is more focused on material objects and appearances","160311":"don t blame ya ! driving in and around dc is the worst !","160312":"from the last longwood symposium of research and creative inquiry i presented my research findings at","160313":"i drive but no not really any funny stories to tell . i live near washington dc so there s usually lots of traffic , road rage , and arsehole drivers who never signal or look before turning","160314":"my man learning to ride with the","160315":"didn t get anything from them either","160316":"nobody messaged me that but i don t care about coins or fire or whatever","160317":"i try to handle it constructively with walks , art , horse riding , and busting myself with social activities but sometimes it gets to me . not as bad as sandy tho","160318":"you totally gotta do it again if you get the chance ! ! it s one of my favorite things . people get scared cause horses are so big but honestly i don t think horses know how much bigger they are than us lol . most of the time they re just like big dumb happy dogs like giant great danes who still try to sit in your lap lmao . chilling with horses is calming to me on the back of a horse is my happy place","160319":"first a paleontologist , and then a veterinarian ! i d still love to do those things tbh","160320":"it s been about years now","160321":"haha thank you . i couldn t tell if you were joking or not . . . i was half expecting this thread to turn into some super weird questions about some sort of tickling or killing or vore or foot fetish or something if i m honest lol . thanks for being cool","160322":"no i don t like killing . i can t even bring myself to kill bugs . . . it makes me feel bad and gross and guilty even if it s a nasty bug that gives you diseases like a tick","160323":"they re kind , patient , beautiful and strong . the more time i spend around horses the better i feel i can understand them . taking care of them is therapeutic for me . i love to spend time with them and brush them and give them treats","160324":"it makes me angry","160325":"of course i try to project good vibes , be kind , positive , and helpful . . . those are the traits that i hope others see first in me . but honestly if i m being myself and projecting out love and respect and someone still doesn t like it then they can suck an egg idc fuck them","160326":"low key i don t really know haha . i don t watch too many movies","160327":"i think everyone secretly is . people who say otherwise are probs just trying not to get tickled . i hate being tickled","160328":"i

with lots of physical affection thrown in !","160357":"no not really i guess . i ve been to other countries and people s idea of a typical american is usually a fat , unintelligent , lazy , gun toting , environment destroying , money hungry , idiot waving the american or confederate flag behind their pickup truck yelling yee yee ive seen the way people look at us and they re right . . . american culture can be pretty gross i just don t feel like i fit that description after realizing what the world thinks of us . i try to be conscious !","160358":"hard pass . . . here s a pic of my boyfriend

really creepy imo . just being a normal , nice person , and striking up a conversation is always much better . when men say pickup lines to me it s usually in the context of some sort of cat call so it s automatically gross","160367":"all of them !","160368":"yeah hbu ?","160369":"hey there","160370":"sunrise !","160371":"regular grooming and also showering off the sweat dirt from riding and the

still happy","160376":"i majored in environmental science with a concentration in life sciences !","160377":"depends on if it s welcomed constructive criticism or if it s straight up un asked for

lol","160387":"unfortunately yes . when i was about i broke my wrist after being thrown off when the horse tripped . the same year i was kicked in the kneecap by the same horse when he was afraid of a

very fast . . . . so fast , that their bodies can t keep up . racing thoroughbreds often breathe so hard while running in races that their lungs beat harshly on their rib cages during breathing . this can cause internal bleeding of the lungs which can then come out of the nose . since horses aren t physically capable of breathing from their mouths , they can choke and suffocate on their own blood . this is sometimes why you see trainers keeping horses noses way up in the air after particularly hard races to not let the blood flow from their noses","160606":"sure","160607":"idk . i m not interested in thinking about that .","160608":"no i don t think so","160609":"what . . . . ? i guess they d tickle people . kinda in the job title","160610":"not speaking up when i saw someone i

warmbloods and warmblood x s , and some quarter horses and appendixes . i ve been documenting my horse adventures on my yt channel since about if you were interested in seeing any of them ! i was so young back then","160624":"in some cases yes but in some cases no ! hunting endangered or threatened species aka poaching is a cruel disservice to the the animal , the species , and the world ! that should and already is obviously banned . however , hunting plentiful and sometimes overpopulated animal species like white tailed deer , pheasants , or bear for the purposes of wildlife management and for food is actually beneficial to the environment , to the species , and to humans ! my degree is in this field of study so if anyone wants to open a discussion hmu","160625":"i bet she did ! ! in my past experiences , horses have pretty good long term memories for things like that","160626":"dude idk . captive market i guess so annoying","160627":"definitely ! ! horses know the difference between angry and happy human faces and they re great at remembering who s treated them poorly versus who s treated them with kindness","160628":"glad to help","160629":"and horses can sense that fear which in turn can them tense ! they re here animals so when you re scared too they automatically think why are we afraid ? is there a predator around ? should i run away ? i ve always been enamored with horses beauty and strength and size so i guess i can t relate maybe you need to start interacting will smaller horses first so you can get to know their behaviors and body language ? maybe try hanging out with a pony for a while first !","160630":"this might be a google question and i m not google . . . . but to post one pic to you ask wall when someone asks you a question , click the photo button next to the camera to post a photo . don t click the poll option . . .","160631":"i don t think so . horses are so big and powerful that if they don t want to do something we re asking they won t do

mean","160633":"my first crush was my horse trainer named daniel . he was way older than me but i think i just really looked up to him and thought he was handsome and i admired the way he worked with

thanks","160657":"zero unfortunately looking forward to owning at least one or two in the future !","160658":"okay so actually yeah but not from a person of course . one time when i was we were living in germany and my german horse trainer had taken me along with her to show her shire mare at a local competition . i was given a lot of free rein around the show grounds and didn t have a lot of supervision . i kind of didn t understand a lot of what was going on around me since i couldn t understand that much german at the time so i just did what i wanted . i decided i wanted to brush off the horse in the stall she was in and when i was picking one of her back hooves she kicked out and smacked me right in the middle of the forehead with her dinner plate sized hoof and knocked me out cold . that s when i learned not to stand behind the horse when you pick out its feet ! ! not sure how long i was laying there in the straw but i woke up and just decided not to tell anybody and just carried on with what i was doing","160659":"depends on the brand but usually a size or american sizing . can t remember if i have the tall or the regular but i think it s the tall","160660":"um okay not exactly sure what you mean by that but i think have a pretty good idea and the answer is definitively , for the very last time , no ! ! if i get this question again i m gonna scream y all really nasty you know that ? it s an animal","160661":"ahahaha lmaooo yeah actually that did happen to me once when i was picking a back hoof","160662":"thank you ! tbh they don t look that shiny and new anymore , that s an old pic . they re a liiiitle bit more worn out now they re my faves , so comfy !","160663":"hmmm maybe you re right ? guess i ll just remove it","160664":". . . . . . . . . probably ? the last time i felt the need to physically protect myself from another person i wasn t concerned about how loud or quiet i was being about removing myself from a disgusting and traumatic situation","160665":"if this is for a weird fetish thing i m not into it . . . . but of you re interested in knowing about my fave ariat field boots then here ! !","160666":"lmao um no ? but this is primarily an equestrian ask . fm and my hobby and lifestyle are pretty centeeed around equestrian sports","160667":"interesting opinion . i d love to hear more about why you think that ! let s open a calm and civil discussion about it !","160668":"i m not comfortable with giving my personal snapchat to strangers sorry it s all horses anyways","160669":"dude idk","160670":"yeah , so inappropriate . not sure why some people think they can just do that to someone ? ? ? total harassment","160671":"yes of course !","160672":"the sweet gray on my channel , chance , belongs to my boyfriend s family ! i don t currently have a trainer","160673":"horses will explicitly tell us when they re angry . you just have to know how to listen . watch their body language . since horses cannot talk like people can , we need to look for signs like pinning their ears back , having tense muscles , stomping and pawing , kicking , tail swishing , biting , and showing the whites of their eyes","160674":"everybody has their own journey and it will take everyone a different amount of time to learn how to ride horses . it all depends on how many practice hours you put in and how much help you have from a trainer . you really never stop learning !","160675":"depending on what kind of barn you go to , the location of the barn , the level of riding , and the discipline of riding , i ve seen our long lessons go for anywhere from forty through sixty dollars","160676":"yes ! coconut oil can help protect against cracks and extremely dry feet . it is also an excellent natural antibacterial and can help fight against nasty bacteria that can form on your horses hoof . you can put it on the top and the sole of the roof","160677":"lunging a horse is not aggressive . you must be thinking about lunging like the action of springing forward at somebody aggressively like a dog attacking something . lunging is a term for a type of exercise for the horse that involves building muscle by keeping a bend on a circle around a trainer holding a long line attached to the horses bridle .","160678":"it s the most fun activity you can possibly do !","160679":"yes equestrian is a sport . it s even in the olympics","160680":"according to the internet horseback riding is in the top most dangerous sports and is even more dangerous than riding a motorcycle . mind your melon ! wear a helmet when doing dangerous equestrian activities like jumping","160681":"learning to ride involves a lot of muscles in our bodies that were not used to using and has a lot of moving parts . it can be challenging to keep track of all of the things you need to do and even can be challenging just a learn how to relax on a horse . if you decide it is some thing you want to do and you re dedicated enough and have lots of support and help from your trainer and your family anybody can learn to ride a horse !","160682":"it s difficult for me to say if equestrian sports are harder than other sports . all i can say is that horseback riding requires skill , hard work , dedication , and time . at some points it can be very difficult and frustrating ! but so can all other sports !","160683":"a horse with chrome is a horse with white leg markings and face markings","160684":"no ! unlike most other mammals horses lack the ability to throw up . this is because there is a valve in their stomach that is only one way and does not allow food to come back up there esophagus . their esophagus is so long that it would take too long to come out and they would choke on their vomit before it came out of their mouth . horses are also unable to breathe out of their mouths so if they were to vomit they would probably choke from not being able to breathe as well .","160685":"yes , horses are mammals . they give birth to live young , have hair , have warm blood and are able to thermal regulate , and produce milk for their offspring .","160686":"that s a very interesting opinion . i m glad you feel so passionate about the equestrian world . keep in mind that horses are no longer wild animals and humans have made them what they are today . if humans were to disappear from the earth then most horse breeds and individual horses would die without our care . wild horses of today are actually a misnomer . the term should be feral horses , as they are domesticated animals that are considered free range livestock . i m sorry you feel the equestrian world is so bad","160687":"horses are most definitely smart ! it s hard to really gauge how smart an animal is since we can t know for sure what s going on in their heads but horses are known to be able to read human emotions , remember places , objects , smells , and words , and be able to bond with humans socially . we tend to think dogs are smarter because they re pack animals with similar social needs and are much better at distinguishing between positive and negative reinforcement and human emotions , however , this is probably a product of their breeding . humans selectively bred dogs to be better companions , but we selectively bred horses for their athletic and physical prowess , not as companion animals . that s probably why most people would consider dogs to be smarter . however , horses consistently score better on the smartness scale than other domestic animals like cows and house cats !","160688":"yes , i have a boyfriend and his name is sandy !","160689":"no , unlike other domestic animals like dogs and cats , horses are obligate herbivores . their stomachs are not designed to be able to digest any quantities of meat","160690":"yes actually that is true ! if horses lay down for too long , they can cut off their own blood supply to their organs because of how heavy they are . they then die of hypoxia .","160691":"chance eats sweet feed , grass , and round bales ! but he s not really my horse so that s up to his owner !","160692":"i m foot","160693":"yeah several times but most recently after some

learn that there is no such thing as being manly or too feminine . being yourself , likening what and who you like , and behaving like you are the true traits of a real man . enough with the toxic masculinity and pressure to conform into some disgusting , stagnant , repressed version of yourselves !","160701":"nope . i ve been in very few fights . i don t like
