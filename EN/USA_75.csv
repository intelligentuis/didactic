   Do you hate any of your bf/fiance or husband clothing
  ","
  lol, no. my boyfriend actually has a fairly decent sense of style when it comes to clothing.
  "
402305,"
   Are you into old school cinema?
  ","
  no, not really. movies aren't really very important or interesting to me besides a select few favorites.

  hello -- do you have a question?
  "
402307,"
   Did you have a good day
  ","
  yes, my day was rather good !! i had an extremely productive day at work, and then i went to my friend's salon and colored/cut/shaved my hair. :'))
  "
402308,"
   Has this ever happened to you you're tired in the day and wide awake in night
  ","
  yes, that's fairly common for me in particular. if it's negatively affecting you during waking hours, then perhaps try adjusting your diet/water intake, your sleep schedule, etc etc. you may also need to discuss this with your doctor and maybe run some bloodwork, you could be lacking in some nutrients or vitamins.
  "
402309,"
   You ever listen to pure instrumental music? ??
  ","
  a majority of the music i listen to is purely instrumental (whether it's classical piano, or some sort of television, movie or video game soundtrack).
  "
402310,"
   Do you ever argue with your bf?
  ","
  on very rare occasions, yes. we've argued a few times in the past, but it isn't something that happens often at all.
  "
402311,"
   Have you ever gotten waxed before? ? How was it? ?
  ","
  i used to get my eyebrows & upper lip waxed routinely. now i just wax my upper lip myself & tweeze my eyebrows.
  "
402312,"
   Hi Leigh, my psychiatrist prescribed an antipsychotic for me for BPD and I can’t sleep normally! I like I am sleeping but my mind isn’t in deep sleep and it’s affecting me so much. I really want to stop taking it because it’s only been a few days since I started because I want to sleep! My

  (cont) ... Next appointment is in January and I don’t want to wait so long to be honest. Sleep is important to me and i haven’t been able to sleep properly for a few days now. :(

  most medications don't reach their full potential/effect until after 1-2 weeks of taking the medication consistently. although you're having negative symptoms now, it should dissipate within those 1-2 weeks once your body adjusts to having the medication. don't give up on it just yet & wait and see what happens after that time period.
  
  if you're still experiencing these issues after that 1-2 week period, then call your psychiatrist and explain what's going on. you can probably schedule a sooner appointment and try something else.
  "
402313,"
   Do you smile much
  ","
  i smile when something makes me chuckle or brings me joy, but that's pretty much it.
  "
402314,"
   What is the healthiest thing to get from McDonalds?
  ","
  idk, perhaps a salad or something. i don't normally order from mcdonalds (although their coffee is pretty good).
  "
402315,"
   Do you know if it is possible to block a Facebook post so certain people can't see it
  ","
  yes -- when you go to post something on facebook, you can change the privacy settings of that particular post. it's usually automatically set to ""friends only"" or ""public,"" but if you tap on setting prior to posting, you can type in certain friends' names and facebook will hide that post from those particular people.
  "
402316,"
   Have you ever fall asleep in class
  ","
  yeah, i fell asleep during one or two of my college courses, haha.
  "
402317,"
   how many months out of the year is your state frozen (gets snow and cold)
  ","
  it usually gets cold on long island (new york state) by mid-october and doesn't warm up until march or april. it doesn't snow until november or december, though.
  "
402318,"
   Your room looks amazing! Gave me a few ideas :)
  ","
  aw, thank you !! i wanted to make it my little sanctuary, and i think i did a pretty good job at decorating it to my own liking. :'))
  "
402319,"
   Do you wear pyjamas to bed
  ","
  not really pajamas exactly, but i wear tank tops & sweatpants to bed.
  "
402320,"
   What you gaming lately?

  i haven't picked up a controller in a few weeks, tbh. the last game i played was skyrim.

  doesn't seem like she might be returning to ask though, tbh.

402323,"

   You're beautiful

  thank you ~~

402326,"
   do you miss your old room
  ","
  no, my new room is so much more accomodating and relaxing.
  "
402327,"
   is it snowing
  ","
  no, i don't believe so.
  "
402328,"
   go flirt with your housemates and see where that leads
  ","
  ???
  
  why would i even consider that? lmaoo. they're my friends and i obviously have no interest in them and never will.
  "
402329,"
   PAP your favorite monument of your city.
  ","
  someone ask me questions & sh*t because i'm wide awake and cannot sleep worth a sh*t. ://
  "
402330,"
   what's hurting you atm
  ","
  nothing at the moment. i've had the weekend to relax and recharge.
  "
402331,"
   Not yet hope it won't get that bad
  ","
  only time will tell, LOL. i've already developed back pain over the past four years alone, so who knows what will happen in the future.
  "
402332,"
   Would you ever want to see a chiropractor
  ","
  if i had excruciating pain, then maybe. my body pain isn't that bad, though.
  "
402333,"
   Would you  ever try acupuncture
  ","
  probably not. i don't have an interest in it.
  "
402334,"
   do you like garlic smell
  ","
  it doesn't sway me one way or another.
  "
402335,"
   is there real onion in it or just flavor
  ","
  idk? i've never made it before, lol.
  "
402336,"
   do you like french onion soup
  ","
  yes, it's pretty good. i've only had it on a few occasions, though.
  "
402337,"
   Do you like Taco Bell?
  ","
  yeah, but i rarely order from taco bell. when i do, i usually get a veggie power bowl.
  "
402338,"
   is it misogynistic if I put on a *boys rule* shirt on my 1 year old?
  ","
  no? that seems pretty harmless to me.
  "
402339,"
   How was your day
  ","
  my day was all right. i woke up feeling pretty terrible, continued working on freelance assignments, and then went to a doctor's appointment in the afternoon. my friend came over for a few hours and we chatted for a bit. i just heated up some dinner and i'm going to shower when i'm done.
  "
402340,"
   Do you often binge watch?
  ","
  occasionally, yes. i've been binge watching the x files again, haha.
  "
402341,"
   opinion on yoga? do you do it
  ","
  i've tried yoga a few times, yes. i always felt good afterwards.
  "
402342,"
   Which celebrity would you like to be for one day and what would you do?
  ","
  aw, wow -- thank you guys for 100,000+ likes and 6,000+ followers !! :'))
  
  ask me more questions in the meantime ~~
  "
402343,"
   When was the last time you watched the world go by? No phone, laptop, tin can w/string, etc. nothing to connect you around?
  ","
  honestly, it's been quite a few years. i believe the last time i spent a few hours or a majority of the day without my phone was 2-3 years ago when i took a vacation to montauk, new york. i left my phone in the motel room while my boyfriend and i traveled into town to visit various shops and the brewery.
  "
402344,"
   Do you think you’re smarter than someone who drop out of high school?
  ","
  my answer to this question is a bit similar to the previous question posed to me about intelligence -- there are many different forms of intelligence, and book smarts is only one type. even if i have a higher level of education than someone else, it doesn't necessarily mean that i'm ""smarter"" than them.
  "
402345,"
   Where is a place you can go to find peace and quiet?
  ","
  quiet bookstores, the docks by the ocean or the bay, and coffee shops.
  "
402346,"
   What is your happy place?
  ","
  my bedroom would have been my first answer, but since i already answered one of your questions with ""my bedroom"" as an answer, i'll say that dwelling anywhere in nature is also a happy place of mine. :'))
  "
402347,"
   Do you think someone is stupid if they don’t have a good grammar?
  ","
  not necessarily, but it does make sentences incredibly difficult to read when they're all run on words with no breaks in between, lol. i know plenty of people who don't have a firm grasp on grammar, and there are many different forms of intelligence.
  "
402348,"
   is it rude to reject a gift? I don’t like accepting them coz I feel I own them and I have to do something for them.
  ","
  in most circumstances, it is rude to reject a gift -- especially if the person has all good intentions for getting you that gift. it's perfectly fine to be grateful in the moment and then perhaps talk to them later on about how you feel as if you don't deserve the gift or that you feel as if you owe them a favor, though. in most cases, they'll be understanding and reassure you that they gave you the gift out of their own free will and you don't owe them anything.

402349,"
   Dp ?❤️
  ","
  thanks, dude.
  "
402350,"
   do you think you miss living with your parents?
  ","
  definitely not. it's been a breath of fresh air living on my own without the stress of being around my parents 24/7. i finally gained control of my own life, and the freedom is so liberating.

"
402352,"
   Hi! How do you do? How was your sunday? What's your mood? I wish you a nice day and a good week ✌?
  ","
  hello ~~
  
  i've been better mood-wise, not gonna lie. this weekend has been hard for me for a variety of reasons, and i had a psychiatry appointment this afternoon so i was honest with my doctor and told her how i've been feeling over the past month or so. she ended up increasing the dose of my medications and added a new pill to the mix. ://
  
  still not sure how i feel about it all, but i'll see what happens after i begin taking everything.
  "
402353,"
   bed is too small
  ","
  uh, it's a queen-sized bed. lol.
  "
402354,"
   how is the light purple
  ","
  uh... it just is? lmaoo. i don't exactly know the science behind it.
  "
402355,"
   Post a pic of someplace peaceful
  ","
  my bedroom is one of the most peaceful places to me. ♡
  "
402356,"
   is your boyfriend aware when you’re angry?
  ","
  sometimes, if i feel like letting him know how i'm feeling.
  "
402357,"
   Do you lash out on people when you are angry? I’m specifically talking about the BPD anger since I have it too and I am curious!
  ","
  i don't lash out at people, no. i have a bad habit of internalizing everything and directing anger towards myself, which results in self-destructive behavior.
  "
402358,"
   Do you think it is easier to be a man?
  ","
  in terms of sexism, then yeah -- men benefit from sexism because men are in a position of power over women. the system helps them, not hurts them like it has done to women over the course of centuries.
  
  however, being a human being is multifaceted and it's impossible to say whether someone has it harder than someone else, based on things such as sex, race, orientation, gender, religion, class, ability/disability, etc etc. we're all composed of varying factors that both aid us and hurt us, so it's impossible to objectively say if it's ""easier"" or ""harder"" to be someone else.
  "
402359,"
   what about periods pain? lmao
  ","
  not everyone who is female gets periods, so it wouldn't be an accurate statement. and not every person's period pains are the same -- some people aren't in pain at all, while other people are in excruciating pain.
  "
402360,"
   What’s the hardest thing about being a female?
  ","
  coping with rampant sexism perpetrated by not only men but also the internalized misogyny put forth by people of the same sex.
  "
402361,"
   Have u followed a bad advice? Which one? What happened?
  ","
  i don't generally ask for advice, so it's hard for me to follow bad advice when i don't welcome advice from others in the first place.
  "
402362,"
   Are you tempted to buy stuff when you see them on sale? Do you spend more money in person or online?
  ","
  no, it doesn't tempt me at all. i only purchase things when necessary (or if i *really* want them, lol), so even if something is on sale, it doesn't necessarily mean that i need it at that moment.
  
  i spend more money in person, but that's attributed to things like bills, gas, food, coffee, etc etc.
  "
402363,"
   Would so buy you a round of shots/beer or your choice of adult beverage if I could - the reason I asked your age -
  ","
  ah, that's interesting. this is assuming, of course, that i actually drink alcohol.
  
  (which i do, but it's not wise to assume that everyone is interested in drinking.)
  "
402364,"
   Hey beautiful how old are you ?
  ","
  as my bio indicates, i am 28 years old.
  "
402365,"
   Would you say you're still learning about life
  ","
  yes, i believe everyone is learning and growing from the day they're born until the day they die.
  "
402366,"
   taking aim at a person’s punctuation, or lack of it, is often classist. and just plain pathetic. do better
  ","
  i'm quite aware. thank you for raising awareness of this dilemma.
  "
402367,"
   how many inches
  ","
  i don't remember, i purchased the television like two years ago.
  "
402368,"
   what brand and make is your TV
  ","
  it's a samsung smart tv. not sure what the model is or anything.
  "
402369,"
   Would you be able to run the New York City Marathon
  ","
  definitely not, lmaoo.
  "
402370,"
   Would you class any of your co workers idiots
  ","
  i don't really know most of them well enough to consider whether or not they're stupid, lol. we don't work together on most projects -- on the contrary, most people have their own projects that they work on, so our paths never coincide.
  "
402371,"
   Are you a people person you enjoy being around people or do you like being alone away from people
  ","
  i don't like being around people most of the time. being around others drains my energy, and i require extensive alone time in order to recharge.
  "
402372,"
   Who killed the Dead Sea?
  ","
  hello friends ~~
  
  i have an empty house and no plans, so keep me entertained with your questions. ?
  "
402373,"
   I hope it ain't a roller coaster I like how you dress and all not trying to be funny anything like that but hope you didn't take it the wrong way
  ","
  your lack of basic understanding of punctuation is astonishing. regardless, i'm not pregnant. i'm just fat. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  "
402374,"
   Why were you in a bad mood
  ","
  i have a habit of thinking too deeply about the things going on in my life and then succumbing to a very negative mindset about virtually everything in my life.
  "
402375,"
   Wow you look really good with that all wonder where you going to wear next time not trying to be funny you look good with that outfit are you pregnant
  ","
  well this was certainly a roller coaster of a message. LOL.
  "
402376,"
   Last time you were in a bad mood
  ","
  last night. it isn't an unusual occurrence for me.
  "
402377,"
   You are gorgeous
  ","
  thank you ~~
  "
402378,"
   What happened?:/
  ","
  nothing that i feel comfortable discussing on askfm, tbh. it isn't really a big deal anyway and i'll get over it eventually.
  "
402379,"
   How are you?
  ","
  i'm not doing so well, but thank you for asking regardless.
  "
402380,"
   No yoy don't get it .
There isn't any restriction on you . All the matter i'm a doctor and giving american licence ""USMLE"" and if i marry of any american and get visa it will help me so much . I won't hurt you or need any something els
  ","
  ... wait, are you literally asking me this for real? LMAOOO.
  
  oh my goodness -- please, find another method by which to practice medicine than by asking complete strangers on the internet to literally marry you. this is beyond redic.
  "
402381,"
   Why ?
  ","
  i simply would feel uncomfortable agreeing to such a proposition. there are more productive ways to help others if they require help, such as redirecting them to resources and other methods of aid. i wouldn't want to compromise my own freedom and happiness.
  "
402382,"
   Yup. 
If you can help someone by marrying him for a while without any sort of real relationship like sexual life etc.. 
Can you accept that. 
I'm sorry for my weak language but i'm a foreigner.
  ","
  no, i wouldn't be willing to do that for someone.
  "
402383,"
   Hey
  ","
  hello -- do you have a question?
  "
402384,"
   What is the most popular sport in your country?
  ","
  either baseball or football, i could imagine.
  "
402385,"
   I hope there is a time someday that you can get your spark back and return to art in the future. It can be so therapeutic.
  ","
  i don't really have much intention to return to art, tbh. i'm a writer most of all, and writing is much more therapeutic to me than art ever was.
  
  thank you, though -- i really appreciate your words !! :'))
  "
402386,"
   Why do you think you gave up on making art? I'm a portrait artist myself but for 3 years I stopped due to stress.
  ","
  i didn't have the passion for it anymore, and i also didn't have the time anymore. after i graduated from high school and went to college, i focused all of my attention on creative writing. then things slowly started going downhill in my personal life, i eventually moved states, and i picked up a full-time job outside of attending college classes. there simply was no time left.
  "
402387,"
   Are you a person who forgives easily?
  ","
  no, i'm not a person who forgives others easily. i have a tendency to hold grudges and dwell on things people have said or done wrong to me in the past.
  "
402388,"
   What are your plans for over the Christmas holidays? :3 If you don't celebrate Christmas, what will you be doing? ?☃️
  ","
  allegedly i have the week off from work between christmas day and new years day, and i honestly have *no* idea what i'll be doing, lmaoo. i haven't had an entire week off from work in literally years.
  "
402389,"
   When you were a kid or teenager what were you obsessed with? What were your greatest interests in life? :)
  ","
  when i was a teenager, i was very much more into art and painting than i am today. i appreciate good art these days, but back in the early 2000s, i painted and drew prolifically and was very much involved in the art scene.
  
  i was also much more interested in music back in those times compared to today. although i still love music and listen to it every day, when i was a teenager i was addicted to linkin park's music and lived and breathed their music and influence in my every day life. i read up on their history and life stories, joined forums, made friends through their website, etc etc.
  "
402390,"
   do you believe in zodiac sign influence on one's personality? do you try to understand your partner by reading up their zodiac traits? would you avoid dating or marrying someone because of their zodiac sign being incompatible to yours?
  ","
  i believe that some people's personality traits coincide with the traits of their zodiac sign, but it isn't a universal thing. there will always be people who won't match up to what their zodiac sign ""says"" they should be, so i don't really place much value in astrology.
  "
402391,"
   would you go to an ex’s family member’s wedding, if you had been close to their family?
  ","
  it depends on how the relationship with that ex ended, and how close i am to that ex today. if there's any doubt that it may be awkward for me to attend the wedding since my ex will be there, then i probably wouldn't go. however, if my ex and i are on good terms (i.e. talking), then i see no reason why i shouldn't go to celebrate the occasion.
  "
402392,"
   Do you like a cold pillow
  ","
  yes, i love cold pillows.
  "
402393,"
   rdy for thanksgiving?
  ","
  not really, no. i'm not really looking forward to thanksgiving this year because it's going to be with my family, and they've been insufferable since i moved out.
  "
402394,"
   Is it easy or hard for you to trust people
  ","
  it's very difficult for me to trust people. i don't trust others right off the bat, and it takes a while for me to get to a point with a person where i can genuinely say that i trust them.
  "
402395,"
   what are some of your favorite shows to have playing in the background just for noise effect?
  ","
  they're usually shows that i've seen a hundred times before, lol. if i'm doing something and need background noise and i don't feel like putting on music, then i'll put on a few episodes of the x files, how i met your mother, supernatural, ghost adventures, bones, etc etc.
  "
402396,"
   When you are in a bad mood, what make you feel better?
  ","
  if i'm in a bad mood, there normally isn't much i can do to make myself feel better. :/ i usually just ride it out until the next day. with respect to that, sleep sometimes gets rid of the bad mood to some degree.
  "
402397,"
   Do you always shop smart at Black Fridays? Are you planning to shop this year?
  ","
  i don't ever go shopping on black friday. i would rather not deal with the ridiculous crowds of people. i prefer waiting until cyber monday instead, that way i can shop from the comfort of my own home.
  "
402398,"
   i disagree tbh. its still as commonplace, it just takes different forms
  ","
  i never thought about it that way before, tbh. i'll have to do some more research on contemporary racism and how it manifests itself.
  "
402399,"
   what’s the answer tho?
  ","
  i'm honestly not sure, LOL. i haven't weighed myself in months.
  "
402400,"
   racism is still very commonplace. right here on this very website Lyndsey used the word “ch*nk” unashamedly and then tried to place the victim when called out on it :/
  ","
  yes, i wholeheartedly agree with you. racism is *still* very common and seen every day, unfortunately. however, it certainly isn't as commonplace as it used to be decades ago during the early to mid 20th century.
  "
402401,"
   Have a bf?
  ","
  yes, i'm currently in a relationship.
  "
402402,"
   not everyone sees things the same way. what point are you trying to make?
  ","
  i was saying that if you guys want to poke fun at my weight, then at least be consistent with what you're all pointing out, haha. i just thought it was amusing that two different people thought two utterly different, conflicting things.
  "
402403,"
   What about red velvet cake can you make that
  ","
  i never tried before. i wouldn't be able to make it from scratch, that's for certain.
  "
402404,"
   Can you  bake desserts
  ","
  yeah, i can make simple desserts like cupcakes, muffins, and cookies. lmaoo.
  "
402405,"
   Which cities would you like to visit around the world?
  ","
  london, madrid, rome, moscow, and mykonos.
  "
402406,"
   Do you workout in any way?  How often? ??
  ","
  i haven't exercised in a while, but i used to walk on the treadmill at least 3 times per week.
  "
402407,"
   When it came to assignments in school, were you one to crunch like right before they were due? Haha
  ","
  sometimes, but it depends on what was going on in my life at the time. in high school and parts of college, i did procrastinate a lot. however, towards the end of my college years, i learned time management and how to effectively complete my assignments with the little time i had without cramming them in towards the end.
  "
402408,"
   Photo in private?
  ","
  uh, no? lmaoo.
  
  you can see photos of me in my profile pictures on here, and i also post photos of myself occasionally when i feel like it.
  "
402409,"
   Are you a night owl or a morning person? ?
  ","
  i used to totally be a night owl & stay up late every night, but these days i'm more of a morning person. i get most of my chores/work done in the morning so that i can relax by the time the afternoon comes.
  "
402410,"
   Have you ever been in a car where the airbags got set off
  ","
  no. honestly, my airbags *should* have gone off when i got into one of my first big accidents, but for some reason they didn't.
  "
402411,"

  yes, i believe that a lot of people have the capacity to change and grow apart from their oppressive/problematic views. if they recognize that what they believe is wrong and actively work on bettering themselves to be more inclusive, then they can eventually get to a stage where they're not racist/sexist/etc etc. anymore.
  
  obviously it's quite difficult, especially if that person was raised in an environment where being racist, for example, was ingrained in them from a very young age. but i still believe it's possible. humans are entirely capable of growing and adapting themselves.

  ","
  (cont) ... I get my eyebrows or nails done. I don’t know, like there is this part of me that is protecting myself. Could be fear or intuition, or both. I’m constantly getting so anxious and these thoughts are making me feel so restless. I want to be vulnerable with them and share stuff but this person In my head holds me back. I always relied on my intuition and they are almost always right and something just tells me I can’t fully trust them. I want to be able to be vulnerable or share stuff but I...can’t. I can’t be like that. And I really don’t like that about myself, but my childhood Probably contributes to this. And it doesn’t help that my mother just told me to not trust them so much because we always need to keep a part of ourselves secret so people won’t take advantage of us. My mother’s intuition is always right about people and I know I shouldn’t be doubting my best friend. But I don’t know. I’m so lost so confused, don’t know who to trust. I only feel this way about them but not about my other friend. So this makes me even more suspicious of them and time believing this is my intuition. This honestly makes me want to cut them off like right now but I’m so so confused. I just keep thinking they are putting on a REALLY good act and acting like they are my best friend but deep down they are laughing, always wanting information out of my mouth so they can use it against me. My doctor says this is related to BPD. please help. Not sure if you can relate.
  
  --
  
  tbh, i can sorta relate but this happens between me and most people i consider friends, not just one person in particular. i'm a very paranoid sort of person so i'm constantly questioning other people's motives and whether or not they're actually my friend or they just feel bad for me and put up with me because they're afraid of what i would do otherwise. it's so isolating, and as a result, i cut people off without warning.

  the biggest positive change i've made recently was moving out of my parents' house into a house that i'm currently renting with two roommates. my parents' house was a very toxic environment and deteriorated my mental health, and it was very  difficult for me to pull myself out of depressive states in that sort of environment.
  
  since moving out and establishing my own life and routine, i've been much happier, more content with myself, more productive, and almost looking forward to waking up in the morning.

   How to cure depression
  ","
  depression can't really be cured, but you can most definitely go into remission for depression. the best way to overcome depression and/or cope with your illness in a healthy manner is to seek out professional treatment, i.e. psychiatry or therapy. however, everyone who struggles with depression is different so there are different modalities of treatment tailored to everyone's unique situation.

  ","
  i suppose the most obvious answer would be the ab*se i endured for most of my life. it completely re-arranged my methods of thinking and my personality, it re-wired connections in my brain, and it kick-started my struggle with mental illness. childhood development is crucial to how someone behaves as an adult, and because i was overcome with ab*se at such an early age, it's affected every aspect of my adult life.

  in current times, yes. i can't say the same for myself in the past, though. prior to getting treatment for my mental health, my mental illnesses were at an all time peak -- coupled with a significant amount of stress i was enduring earlier in my life. i was obsessive and insecure, and i crossed boundaries that i shouldn't have crossed.

  having support from friends and/or family is a great means by which to overcome self-doubt. i mean, self-doubt can be inevitable for some people but it's certainly validating when you have trusted people around you who are rooting for you and confirming that you're doing well.

  no. when it comes to presidential elections, the popular vote doesn't matter. and as far as politics are concerned, most politicians just say what they believe civilians want to hear and once they're in office, they either change their views or put forth their own agenda, or both.

  i mean, i have my location on my phone on at all times for google maps & whatnot, so evidently i'm not too concerned with information of my whereabouts being broadcasted to big corporations like google.
  
  if someone wants to harm me, then so be it. they're going to find out this information one way or another anyway regardless of data companies' efforts to track me if they wanted to hurt me so badly. people have done it in the past without technology, they can easily do it again.
  "
402678,"
   But the fact that other people are constructing a profile of you that you may not agree with must surely be concerning to you? Like, what if such personal information about you is shared or sold to someone who doesn't have your best interests at heart in some future scenario?
  ","
  it isn't concerning to me, no. if companies are constructing a profile of me based on what i spend my money on and which websites i visit, then all they're going to learn is that i enjoy eating food, drinking alcohol and coffee, paying necessary bills, and perusing social media.
  "
402679,"
   But the data companies are collating information about you so as to sell it on to third parties who construct a profile of who they think you are without your informed consent

  honestly, it's been years since i went a full day without using my phone. :/ the last time i remember doing so, i was on vacation and decided to disconnect entirely for the day. it was a freeing feeling, but it also made me anxious knowing that a family member could potentially be trying to get in contact with me in case of an emergency.

402681,"

  acceptance of people who struggle with mental illness. there have been advancements somewhat in recent years regarding awareness of mental health and its importance, but there is still so much taboo and stigma surrounding mental illness -- especially complex disorders, like personality disorders, schizophrenia, dissociative disorders, eating disorders, etc etc.
  
  i wish it was more popular for people to actually read into the different mental health diagnoses and take the proper steps to support their friends and family who struggle with those issues.
  "
402687,"
   What is your idea of a romantic evening?
  ","
  i'm fairly easy-going when it comes to romance, and i believe romance is more of a feeling than it is a place or an event. as long as you're emotionally intimate with someone, even the smallest instances can be romantic. i would be more than happy with an evening with my significant other where we have a candlelit dinner together and talk about everything going on in our lives.

  "
402690,"
   What are you proud of but never have an excuse to talk about it?
  ","
  i'm proud of my boyfriend & close friends for overcoming significant hardship in their lives and emerging from the other side as beautiful, hard-working human beings. i don't ever really talk about it enough, and really i should tell them that i'm proud of them more often.
  "
402691,"
   If you could choose a different time period and place to be born, when and where would it be?
  ","
  i've never really had a genuine answer to this question because i believe that, despite the injustices in today's times, common era is much more accepting than it has ever been in the past. it would be a disservice to me and people similar to me if we lived in a previous time period because things such as being gay, trans, mentally ill, etc etc., were considered taboo and/or a sin.

402692,"
   What's the craziest thing you have seen happen at a prom or at a college party?
  ","

  "
402693,"
   Should there be more spaces at work for solitude, and not just for collaboration?

  depending on the type of company it is, yes. office environments are largely places for solitary working with instances of collaboration, but other environments such as retail or food service do require a lot of collaboration in order for the dynamic to work.

   what's the secret to your long relationship?
  ","
  there are a lot of components that go into a long-term relationship ; communication, trust, a little bit of luck, having the ability to be silly with one another, viewing your partner as your best friend, emotional chemistry, etc etc.
  
  personally speaking, we essentially grew up together between the ages of 17 to now (and we've known each other since we were 16). we've endured heartache together. loss together. grief together. addiction together. celebrations together. marriages together. all of the facets of growing into one's own and maturing were spent with one another, and for some people it doesn't work out, but by luck it worked out for us.
  
  every relationship is different, though. what works for one couple may not work for another. you just have to listen to your partner, your intuitions, and your own heart and go from there. it's difficult at times, and love definitely is not enough to continue moving forward.

  ","
  my greatest passion is perhaps helping other people, being relateable to other people so that they don't feel as isolated. i channel this passion through advocacy and writing (poetry and prose). it helps give purpose in my life and convinces me that there might be a reason for me to be alive.
  "
402706,"
   ? I once had a friend who believed passionately that you should never give up your own bed for anyone. 
? If you have an overnight visitor who had travelled far to reach you, would you lend them your bed if there wasn’t a spare? Or make up a couch/floorspace for them as best you can?
  ","
  tbh, i've always felt really weird about sharing or lending my bed with others besides my significant other. i'm a private person for the most part, and i feel like it's a bit intrusive on my privacy for a person to be sleeping in my bed (i can't really explain it, it's weird).
  
  however, i would be more than happy to make them comfortable on the couch or on one of the chairs in the living room that lean all the way back with a foot rest. there are a lot of cozy pillows and blankets in the house.
  "

   What’s the last thing you saw that broke your heart and felt emotional about it and why?

  yes, that's considered verbal ab*se (and emotional ab*se too). no one deserves to be in such a relationship and if you have a way out, you should try to escape. you deserve so much better than to be belittled and called names by someone who is supposed to love and support you.

  ","
  i don't believe it's necessarily rude, but depending on your tone, it could be interpreted as insensitive. if your friend is in an ab*sive relationship, it's not that simple to just break up with their partner. in addition, it's quite obvious that she's in a very rough spot right now -- perhaps you should have prefaced your statement with ""i'm sorry you're going through this, but here are my honest thoughts on the matter.""

  they're comfortable with the idea because it works best for their situation, and they simply want to be in that situation. not everyone *has* to work or earn money, and if a family can thrive off of one income, then there's really no real reason why both partners have to work.

  i'm against spanking children. if you're physically disciplining a child and they're too young to understand why, then they don't know why you're hitting them and all you're teaching them is violence. if you're physically disciplining a child and they're old enough to understand why, then there's no reason why you can't simply talk to your child and explain why their behavior was wrong.

402876,"
   Opinion on gay marriage and adoption and gay pride ?
  ","
  people deserve basic rights and basic respect regardless of their sexual orientation. gay couples should be allowed the opportunity to adopt children just like straight couples are. gay pride is a beautiful thing, and gay people have been oppressed for ages so it's only right now for gay people to have the opportunity to express pride in themselves and for being able to live how they truly are.

  does anyone else experience bursting, overwhelming euphoria for like 2 seconds amid the normal hopelessness & sadness that they feel, like their heart is overcome with fullness and satisfaction. but once you acknowledge or become aware that you're feeling this way, it disappears as soon as it appears and suddenly everything comes crashing down again. you question whether it even happened at all, and when you try to recall the feeling, you're left with an emptiness.
  
  it happens to me on occasion, and it just happened again five minutes ago. as if my insides were bursting at the seams with a bright, white joy, euphoria bordering on mania. and as soon as i realize what's happening, it destroys itself within me and i feel crushed with the weight of what might have been.

  this mindset is honestly so toxic to yourself, and i used to feel the same way towards myself. i didn't, and to some degree still don't, believe that my feelings are justified based on the ab*se i experienced because i think so many more people have it worse off than me.
  
  however, it's a toxic way of thinking and it only hurts you. it doesn't matter if someone has it ""worse,"" what you went through is still ab*se and it still affected you, and you also didn't deserve it. you're justified in not forgiving your parents for hurting you. they did you wrong to an extreme.
  "
402881,"

402882,"
   Is it ok to not forgive parents if they wronged you?
  ","
  you don't have to forgive anyone if someone has wronged you -- just because someone is family, it doesn't mean you're obligated to forgive them.

   What is your idea of a great holiday or vacation?

  going to a destination that's equally relaxing as it is interesting. having a casual repertoire, but also enough time to explore and do whatever it is you want at the spur of the moment. i like when there's little to no responsibilities on a vacation, and you can do whatever you like in that present moment.

   Growing up I was always taught that ""we should never discuss politics or religion with strangers"", what is your opinion on this? Do you discuss these topics or prefer not to?

  luckily i don't get them much anymore (probably because people realized i don't tolerate it), but s*xual questions in general are the most irritating to me. simply because i don't understand the purpose of them, and why in the hell they would believe that someone would actually answer them seriously.

  an obvious answer is any sort of ab*se, including verbal and mental ab*se that includes gaslighting or any other form of manipulation. however, relationships should also be free from anything that restricts an individual from being 100% themselves, and ideally your partner should support you in all of your endeavors and not judge you. if your partner is preventing you from doing something you love then perhaps it's best not to even be with them.

  obviously the decision to break up is ultimately up to you. but keep in mind that a relationship can't thrive if it's only hurting your mental health or well being in general, and it's unhealthy to stay in a relationship that hurts you.
  
  love can only take you so far. you can love someone but if their feelings and presence in your life don't motivate or inspire you, or if you feel they're making you worse, then you need to really weigh the pros and cons of being together.

   That's neat!! That's what my Pixel 1 did too. It took I think 6 scans.
  ","
  yeah, i was used to the galaxy s7 which i think only scanned it maybe once or twice. it always gave me an issue depending on which angle i would use my fingerprint to unlock my phone or sign into certain apps, and then it would lock me out if i didn't get it *just* right. it was aggravating.
  
  but the s10 is so much better, i'm really happy with the phone.
  "
403203,"
   I was reading about the specs on the camera and it seems amazing! My one point of curiosity is the fingerprint scanner. Do you have any issues using it since it's in the screen with that phone?
  ","
  there haven't been any issues with it at all, actually, even with the screen protector that i'm using. one thing i noticed that was different from the other galaxy phone i previously had was that the fingerprint scanner was *much* more comprehensive. instead of scanning your fingerprint once, it scanned it like 12 different times to pick up every groove. it was ridiculously interesting.

  it depends on how bad of a day i'm having, because it can range from being able for someone to cheer me up to me not being consolable at all. however, on the ""better"" days, my boyfriend usually cheers me up pretty well.

  the last time that i took a risk was yesterday, when i asked my HR manager about yearly pay raises. my two-year work anniversary was this week and i was curious about whether or not my company implements yearly reviews, and i was also hesitant to ask her because i didn't want to seem pushy.

403235,"
   in your opinion, is it a good idea for a woman to decide not to pursue any higher education after hs and instead rely on her future husband to support the family? or is it better to get some sort of degree as a back up? would you support your daughter if she made that choice?
  ","
  depends on the situation. having a college degree isn't a necessity and it doesn't necessarily mean you'll find a good job, but i would encourage everyone to challenge themselves and continually learn, whether they want to do that through college or taking up another endeavor.
  
  i don't think it's fair for a person to rely solely on the hope that their future spouse will provide for them, but if the case happens where your current spouse makes enough money to support the entire family then there's nothing wrong with staying home.

403319,"
   What one thing do you need to do next?
  ","

   well you know well that some people DO claim to be transgender as a fad and it's bad for AUTHENTIC trans people, they do harm and spread the negative connotation that being trans is just a ~phase~.
  ","
  eh, there's a big difference between pretending to be trans because you think it's ""trendy"" and then going through a transitional phase where you believe you may be trans but then realize you're cis.
  
  i believe it's important to make that distinction, because some people are confused about their gender and it takes some experimentation before they come to know who they truly are. those sorts of situations don't take away from actual trans people, though.
  "
403382,"

  tbh i'm feeling fantastic after moving out of my parents' house. i can actually live my life the way i want to live it without getting negativity or unwarranted comments from people such as my mother, and it feels nice to come home, sit down, and do whatever chores i need to do without someone prying into my life, bossing me around, and judging me.

  ","
  my pronouns are they/them and i'm a non-binary person.
  
  i've always felt weird about my own gender, and i remember even from a very young age i didn't identify with being a girl or a woman. i was uneducated on trans identities because of the era, so people just basically called me a ""tomboy."" i didn't learn about being non-binary or genderfluid until a few years ago, so ever since then i've tossed around a few labels that weren't within the gender binary to describe myself.

  it looks like the only person trying to be edgy here is you, lmaoo.
  
  grow up yourself -- another person's gender isn't any of your business so it's useless to occupy yourself with the happenings of others, especially total strangers, lol. instead of being twisted about my gender, perhaps you can channel that energy into something more productive.

   Friends that truly love you, sometimes more than a brother or sister can be considered as a family?

  i feel like toxic friendships are just friendships that bring out the worst in you or don't serve you to some capacity. ab*sive friendships, on the other hand, are ... well, ab*sive. an ab*sive friendship is usually always toxic, but a toxic friendship doesn't necessarily mean it's ab*sive.

  "
403466,"
   What if they ignore you. Not responding to your last message. Is that the sign?

   They want to break up but leave you confused, no? “To leave you alone,” does that mean they just wanna give you that space and time and not bother at that moment or actually break break up?
  ","
  like i said, that's something you would have to ask them outright. it could mean different things to different people. you won't know their intentions unless you ask them.
  "
403468,"
   And they would say, “I love you but if you have your doubts then it’s best to just leave you alone.” What does that mean to you? Is that a break-up line?
  ","
  that sounds like they want to break up, but that's something you would have to ask them outright.
  "
403469,"
   If your partner said “i have doubts about what you really feel idk maybe i’m just fucked up and it’s my brain telling me,” how would you feel? would that make you feel shitty and enough reason to break up?
  ","
  their perception of my feelings and how i actually feel would be two different things in that scenario. it wouldn't be reason to break up, but i would ask them why they felt such a way and what i could do to ease their mind. it could be possible that perhaps i was taking advantage of the relationship or taking the relationship for granted without realizing it, and that i should do more to show my love and appreciation.

   What are the most important lessons you’ve learned in life?
  ","
  -- if someone isn't putting the same effort into a friendship/relationship as you, then perhaps it isn't worth continuing. you should respect yourself enough to know if someone is taking advantage of you.
  
  -- life is unfair and things will happen that you don't deserve to happen to you. it's best to simply deal with these situations because if you question them relentlessly, you'll never come to terms with what happened or move forward.
  
  -- your own happiness and tranquility is important and you shouldn't invest time or energy into things or people that do not serve you. take time out of each day for self care and understand that you can only do so much in one day.

403475,"
   How can I help a friend who’s mentally ill but refuses to seek a professional help? He’s in a very bad situation.
  ","
  there isn't really much you can do in that situation, unfortunately. if a person is unwell, they have to want help in order to truly better themselves. you can't force someone to seek professional help if they themselves are not ready to admit that they need help. it has to be on a voluntary basis.

  depends on what he's saying to his ex, lol. if he's still being romantic with his ex or leading her on in any way then yeah -- that's unfair to both the new girlfriend as well as his ex.
  
  but if he's still friends with his ex because they didn't leave on bad terms, then i don't personally see the problem with him talking to his ex. it would only become an issue, i believe, if he's skipping out on quality time with his girlfriend to talk to or hang out with his ex or generally being dishonest.

  i do feel needed by some people in my life, all in different ways and some in bad ways and others in good ways. for those who express a need to have me in their life because my presence enriches it, then that makes me feel comforted and loved.

  like i said, communication is key. if you need to know the answer to something and if you're close to the person in that way then it's best to ask them.
  "
403513,"
   but i’m curious. would you call it a rebound when the guy was the one breaking up with the girl, meaning he wanted to find a way to get out of the relationship?
  ","
  correct me if i'm wrong, but i was under the impression that a rebound relationship was one in which someone enters in the effort to make another person jealous.
  
  even if the man wanted to end the relationship in order to pursue someone else, if he's not doing it solely to make his ex jealous then i don't think it qualifies as a ""rebound."" he's just being honest with his feelings.

403514,"
   this is true and that makes sense. how do you know if someone is a rebound? could you give me some hints or ideas?

  ","
  depends on the individual, because it could go either way depending on the nature of both the previous and current relationship. some people have the capacity to be interested in others shortly after a breakup while others don't, so there isn't really a ""right"" answer to this question.

403573,"
   how do you cheer him up when he’s upset?
  ","
  he's a very difficult person to cheer up because when he's upset or angry, he feels it completely and it's all he can think about. however, i find it's best to just discuss his feelings with him and try to rationalize whatever he is feeling. he sometimes asks if his emotions are valid or if he's overreacting and i'm always honest with him.

   Give us an idea or a solution to a problem you care about.
  ","
  there's so much stigma against men who have mental health problems, moreso than the stigma against women most of the time. due to toxic masculinity, men are conditioned from an early age to suppress their emotions and not talk about their feelings, otherwise they're considered ""weak."" it's honestly a terrible thing to do for yourself health-wise and can lead to more problems in the future.
  
  one idea that can help is to simply talk about this stigma more and encourage the men in your life that it's okay to show emotions, it's okay to discuss feelings, and if they're struggling with mental illness, it's valid to seek help and there's nothing wrong with that. there's such a high rate of s*icide among men in today's society that something needs to be done, it's seldom talked about.

   In your opinion what’s the best way to change someone’s harmful views/opinion about racism? They are very close to me

  to preface this, i will say that it's very difficult to change someone's mind about racism if they're racist themselves. often times, they were raised in a racist environment and their feelings toward people of other races is ingrained in them from a young age.
  
  one of the best ways to try, however, is to simply educate them. present them with facts and figures, point out their harmful views/opinions, and reiterate that you do care about them but you don't want them to be hateful towards others simply because of their race.

  everyone agrees with that too, especially my boyfriend and my best friend and my therapist. they all say this is going to probably be the best thing for my mental health at this rate and perhaps i can finally begin to heal.
  
  i'm sorry you've dealt with ab*se too and that you can't move out yet, but you should always keep your eyes on that goal because it *will* happen eventually and you'll be much happier and freer as a result. that's what has always driven me, the idea of freedom.

   for this, if someone especially a loved one was acting irrationally or over reacting about something, can be their fault or not, how would you think you would go from there? Like I’m a very honest person, I do not want to hurt their feelings but I want them to learn and see from another perspective?
  ","
  i feel the same way as you, and i honestly believe that one of the better ways to go about the situation would be to wait until they have a clearer mind and then perhaps talk to them about your honest feelings. sometimes people have to ""sleep on it"" in order to feel rational and calm again, and also sometimes it only adds fuel to the fire when you're being honest with someone in the heat of the moment because they may construe it as you criticizing or invalidating them.
  "
403615,"

  this is perhaps one of the sweetest messages i've ever received. thank you so much !! while there are still a lot of struggles with my life rn, i also believe that i've improved somewhat over the past year especially with respect to work and my personal life (i.e. finally moving out and quitting smoking).
  
  i hope that moving out will finally provide me with a clean slate and i can only improve more from there. i need a sense of independence and not being restrained by my family, and it's going to be amazing to finally live my life without judgment from my family and doing things that i actually want to do without kickback.

  yes, i'm sure everyone does this from time to time. for example, displaying empathy for a person just to save face when you know that they're overreacting or being irrational, particularly if you know they'll just get more upset if you express that they're acting so. there's a time and a place for everything, and sometimes people need reassurance instead of the blunt, honest truth from time to time.
  "
403617,"

  i agree with this for the most part !! however, i think that all relationships come with some degree of stress because everyone will have struggles and challenges that they will have to overcome. you're experiencing life with that person by your side, so there will no doubt be times when there's miscommunication and you get stressed or angry with each other. what matters is that you both communicate with each other effectively and resolve issues.

  when the final layout was revealed before we put the magazine online, my supervisor emailed me and said that she was immensely proud of me for not only taking on the responsibility with dedication, but for carrying on the torch and excelling with it. she said she was impressed with my ability to juggle both the writing aspects and editorial aspects of the project to create a nearly flawess edition and that i surpassed all expectations.

  however, i do believe it's important to not take your work home with you, for lack of a better phrase. meaning, it's useless to stress about work when you're not at work, and you should only dedicate your time thinking about your job when you're actually there.

   what about your parents? did you forgive them?
  ","
  no, my parents are perhaps the only exception. i don't forgive them, but i don't hold a grudge against them either. i've accepted the fact that what happened to me has happened, but forgiving them for what they've done would be equivalent to me essentially telling myself that it was okay or acceptable, and i don't believe that to be true at all.
  "
403633,"
   What are your views on ""forgiveness""? Are you the sort to forgive easily, the sort to give people a lot of chances, or otherwise?

   What’s the difference between loneliness and being alone? Do you believe that the capacity to be alone is the capacity to love? If you feel a certain feeling, do you just let it be, own it, or you have to distract yourself from it?
  ","
  loneliness doesn't necessarily mean that you're physically alone -- you could be surrounded by people but still feel lonely because it's an internal feeling of isolation and sometimes hopelessness. it's a feeling of despair, where you feel disconnected from others and solitary in your thoughts. simply being alone, on the other hand, isn't necessarily a negative thing and a lot of people do enjoy their time away from other people.
  
  i don't really believe that comfort with being alone has any correlation with the capacity to love, although it may have ties with self-love as you're expressing a comfort with being by yourself and doing things in accordance with your own needs and desires.
  
  personally speaking, if i'm feeling lonely then i try to figure out why it is i'm feeling that way and also reach out to either discuss those feelings or at least distract myself from feeling lonely. i rarely get lonely these days, though, particularly because i feel like there's always something for me to do and i have a strong support system.

  ","
  i don't really know what i'm waiting for, tbh. i feel like i am waiting for something, but i really have no clue what it could be. there's always this feeling of something impending and that i won't know what it is until it eventually happens.

403638,"
   Do you hold a grudge?

  honestly, i don't care enough to hold grudges anymore. it just ends up hurting me in the end, and it does nothing to the other individual, so why would i hold onto negative emotions when the only person it affects is me?

   What’s the best way to deal with your younger sibling from making bad choices such as druugs? They are 18. I have tried to talk them about it but they hate me for just giving them an advice and cut me off. We were super close and this breaks my heart.
  ","
  i understand your frustration. unfortunately, there isn't much we can physically *do* to deter our loves ones from resorting to dr*gs or alcohol and whatnot, we can simply offer them tips and advice so that if they do decide to try them out, they'll have the knowledge they need to be responsible and safe.
  
  it's ultimately their decision, especially considering they're adults at the age of 18. but hopefully they do have the sense to be safe and not bite off more than they can chew if they decide to try dr*gs.

  "
403645,"
   Leigh, have you been on birth control? If yes how was the experience? I heard good and bad reviews, mostly bad, now I’m scared to try it but want to be safe.
  ","
  yes, i was on birth control for quite a few years when i was younger beginning at the age of 17. my experience was mostly negative, tbh. i was on the pill first, and it caused weight gain and triggered my depression to worsen (which is actually very common but people seldom talk about it).
  
  after i was tired of the pill, i switched to the patch. the patch honestly wasn't much better & it significantly lowered my libido, which sorta ... defeats the purpose.
  
  however -- don't let this deter you, because everyone's bodies are different and just because i had mostly negative experiences doesn't mean that you will too. unfortunately, you won't really know how your body reacts until you try it first.

  over the years, i've learned to become more persistent and vocal about my goals and needs. i used to be quite timid in the past, but i realized that i wouldn't get anywhere if i was too afraid to speak out. when something is bothering me, i communicate. things have appeared much clearer ever since i made that transition.
  
  however, some things haven't changed very much. i'm still anxious as all hell when out in public, particularly in crowded places, and i avoid stores as much as i can. i avoid phone calls as much as i can. i'm still very much an anxious critter despite being in treatment.

  ","
  i think it's ridiculous that people are given priority over others simply because of their occupation, especially since she's a former cop. you're not any better than anyone else because you're part of law enforcement, and the amount of favors & pardons cops receive in the justice system when they break laws themselves is asinine.
  "
403695,"
   what is your opinion on women who say “i trust my spouse, i just don’t trust other women around them.”?
  ","
  i think it's ridiculous, because that means that those women *don't* actually trust their partners if they believe that their partner can be wooed by another woman who's trying to seduce them.
  
  relationships are a two-way street, regardless of the type of relationship it is. if someone is flirting with you or trying to get into your pants, you have two options: accept or deny the invitation. just because someone is into you does not mean you should accept or encourage their behavior. everyone has their own individual mind.
  "

  i'm not well versed in the case at all, but i believe the verdict is justified. she went into someone else's apartment (which she somehow thought was hers?) and k*lled someone. facing up to life in prison seems absolutely appropriate.

  insecurity within themselves, whether they're insecure about who they are, how their life has played out, or their environment. people also have a tendency to attack things that they do not understand, especially if they were raised in a household that had a very strict, narrow perspective on certain issues and didn't allow the children to express themselves adequately.

  it's okay to sit down and rest. it's okay to take a day off of work or school every once in a while if you're feeling burnt out. your body is telling you to slow down, and it's perfectly okay to listen. in our driven society, everyone is always running at full speed and we need to understand that it's normal and healthy to slow down or even stop temporarily.

  "
403740,"
   Ever write poetry about us anons?? If so I want to see it
  ","
  lol, no. most of my poetry has to do with my feelings and mental health.
  "
403741,"
   So it was not  Courtney or it was it her?
  ","
  i have no idea what you're talking about.
  "
403742,"
   If you are fully capable of having kids of your own why not have kids of your own?
  ","
  i'm not fully capable of having kids of my own, lol. i don't have the financial or mental stability for children. plus, i don't even think i want any.
  "
403743,"
   Does your bf want kids?
  ","
  he's undecided, he likes children but he isn't sure if he wants kids of his own.
  "
403744,"
   Hello how are you?
  ","
  i'm fine, although quite distracted from my work and i'm very frustrated. there have been construction workers at my house since 9am, redoing and repainting our chimney & it's right next to my window so everything is so noisy. then my mother's friend and her two children came over for an hour, so the children were screaming the entire time.
  
  now the children are gone, and the construction workers seem to have taken a break or maybe are done ... so perhaps i'll finally be able to finish my assignment. lmaoo.
  "
403745,"
   Why do people have so many kids? And how were you smart enough to avoid this mess?
  ","
  well, for one -- i don't believe i even want children to begin with. secondly, other people aren't dumb for having children, lol. if they're a good parent, then who cares.
  "
403746,"
   I'm pretty sure a lot of states have the age of consent under 18 too lol. But the parents would have to allow it/not press charges I think, if they found out.
  ","
  this is true, i was only basing it off of my understanding of new york's age of consent, which i believe is 17. i don't know what most other states are.
  "
403747,"
   A snipe is a half smoked cigarette that someone throws away. If someone is desperate enough for a cig they pick up the random discarded cigarette and smoke it...so??  Ever smoke a snipe
  ","
  lol, no. i've always had my own packs of cigarettes when i smoked.
  "
403748,"
   Ever  smoked a snipe ?????
  ","
  i've never heard of that term before.
  "
403749,"
   I'm not day drinking alone sobi need you okay?
  ","
  you're an adult and can handle yourself, i'm sure.
  "
403750,"
   I think you are day drinking today???
  ","
  no, i'm drinking coffee.
  "
403751,"
   1) Have you ever felt the need to take a “social media detox” from here or any other site? 2) If you have, did you find it was of any benefit to you?
  ","
  i've surprisingly never felt the need to take a break from social media over the years, tbh. social media is more of a way for me to relax and escape from my everyday life, as well as vent and connect with other like-minded individuals.
  
  the more that i think about it, if anything the only social media site that was harmful to me was probably tumblr because i followed blogs that were enabling and i noticed it kept me in an unhealthy frame of mind. i haven't used tumblr in over a year, though.
  "
403752,"
   Wbu you & your bf?
  ","
  i can't really fathom an ""ending"" to begin with, so i can't make a determination as to whether our ending will be happy or unhappy.
  "
403753,"
   Why you don’t like it?
  ","
  their food tastes bad to me, lol. they're too greasy and every time i've had any sort of fast food lately, it's irritated my stomach.
  "
403754,"
   I can't stop thinking about....?
  ","
  i can't stop thinking about moving out in two weeks.
  "
403755,"
   Do you believe in happy ending?
  ","
  some happy endings do exist, sure. it would be unrealistic to expect one for everything, though.
  "
403756,"
   Do you love McDonald’s burgers? How often do you order from them?
  ","
  i can't remember the last time i ordered from mcdonalds, lol. i don't like their food.
  "
403757,"
   Doesn't it appear in the source menu?
  ","
  i'll have to look next time i turn my tv on, lol.
  "
403758,"
   Does your tv have a usb port?
  ","
  idk, i never bothered to check. i assume it does because it's a smart tv.
  "
403759,"
   Thanks. Which do you use more,liquid soap or regular soap?
  ","
  i've used both, but liquid soap is just easier and i like the variety of different soaps you can buy from places like bath & body works. although, lemon-scented soap is perhaps one of my favorites.
  "
403760,"
   I’ll ask about the soap fragrance.Do you like soap with fragrances or without fragrances?
  ","
  i like soaps with light fragrances, nothing that's too perfume-y or overpowering.
  "
403761,"
   May I ask your marital status ?
  ","
  i'm in a relationship.
  "
403762,"
   Let's say you have unlimited resources, what are the first 2 things you'll do to make the world a better place?
  ","
  enforce much stricter gun regulations in the united states, and ensure that everyone in the world has free or affordable health care and adequate access to that health care.
  "
403763,"
   Have you been worrying about anything lately?
  ","
  i have generalized anxiety disorder. ""worry"" is my middle name, lmaoo.
  "
403764,"
   Do you ride trains or subways often?
  ","
  no, i drive everywhere i go.
  "
403765,"
   When it comes to buying things, do you prefer to buy from name brands or generic brand? Or does it not make a difference?
  ","
  most of the time, the generic brand of products work and/or taste just as well as the name brand of the same thing, so i buy the generic version since it's usually much cheaper.
  "
403766,"
   Did you break a heart? How did you feel afterwards?
  ","
  i'm sure i have at some point, but it's never been made explicitly clear to me.
  "
403767,"
   How are you?
  ","
  i could be better, but i also could be much worse as well. i don't feel as angry as i did yesterday, but that's always apt to change as the day goes on.
  "
403768,"
   i didn't look it up but it seems it's all dolls for people of color! somehow that annoyed me as white wasn't an option *i'm brown* shouldn't it realy consider everyone?
  ","
  i don't know what websites you're looking at, but the gender neutral dolls that i just saw were of both white people and people of color.
  
  as an aside, i think it would also be great if they expanded the gender neutral options to disabled people as well.
  "
403769,"
   Opinion on cancel culture?
  ","
  eh, for the most part i believe that you can simultaneously enjoy something that's ""problematic"" while also pointing out that said thing or person is problematic.
  
  however, cancel culture has also progressed now to the point where it's a bit ridiculous. i heard on the radio the other day that a reporter investigated a person who was doing a charitable deed and found tweets from when this person was 16 years old where he exhibited racist views, and so the reporter publicized it and suddenly the person's endorsements were taken back -- just because of a few tweets he sent when he was a dumb teenager.
  
  in instances like that, i think cancel culture is ridiculous because we're *all* done problematic things in our lives. we're no better than anyone else.
  "
403770,"
   Do you believe there’s 3 sxx? Female male and inter sxx.
  ","
  from my understanding, i don't think intersex is considered a third sex because it's more of a genetic abnormality that ranges in characteristics of either male or female internal and/or external parts and functions. for example, an intersex person may have both female and male gonads or a different range of chromosomes, and their sex hormones may differ from what's typically seen in those who are male or who are female.
  "
403771,"
   Do you know how to be subtly passive aggressive?
  ","
  i'm usually fairly blunt and honest, so i've never had a reason to really be passive aggressive.
  "
403772,"
   Have you seen the news about gender neutral dolls? What did you think of it from the nb perspective?
  ","
  i just looked it up briefly because i never heard about it before, but they seem to be a terrific idea. it's always good to have more inclusive representation, particularly when it involves children, and i like that they're being mindful of children whose gender identity doesn't align with what's stereotypically seen as ""typical"" in today's world.
  "
403773,"
   As a guy, I wouldn't be comfortable if a transman was next to me while I was using an urinal. Instead of saying men/women bathroom why not use basic biology and call it male/female bathrooms? Or even better: individual bathroom. Problem solved.
  ","
  i honestly don't understand the fear that people have of trans people, it truly gives a new level to the term ""transphobia."" you wouldn't be able to distinguish if the person next to you is trans or cis, and it makes me wonder if this is a genuine concern for cis people that they're afraid they're sharing the bathroom with trans folks.
  
  i agree that there should be more gender neutral bathrooms, it would simply make things easier for people, especially those trans people who honestly do not know which bathroom is ""best suited"" towards them.
  "
403774,"
   you’re devoid of being able to critically analyse anything. of course that was a hypothetical situation, say it was someone’s else kid, would you feel safe if they share a bathroom with said person? I’m concerned about the safety of kids
  ","
  i understand your concern, but it's focused in the wrong places. a large majority of trans people aren't out to hurt other people, and the bigger threat to children would be cis people going out of their way to hurt them. a trans woman using her correct bathroom isn't an indication that she's out to hurt a child, because that's very discriminatory and transphobic to assume so.
  
  in the event that ab*se would take place, a simple bathroom sign wouldn't deter a criminal from doing what they want to do. it's not as if a p*do is going to look at the women's bathroom sign & say ""well this is the women's room, i can't go in there."" lmao.
  "
403775,"
   would you feel comfortable if your daughter was followed by a big muscular male who identifies as a woman to the bathroom?
  ","
  i don't have a daughter. i don't really see how someone's stature and muscles have anything to do with their gender, either way.
  
  you sound overly concerned with what's in other people's pants, like what i just described. it's a bit bewildering.
  "
403776,"
   funny how you’re not addressing issues of peeping lmao
  ","
  no one asked me about that, so why would i address it? that usually only happens with cis people anyway, a lot of cis people have a very unhealthy concern with what's in other people's pants.
  "
403777,"
   what about non binary like you?
  ","
  whatever bathroom they're most comfortable using.
  "
403778,"
   What is your opinion about people who keep in touch with someone during school, study or work, and then in their free time, on weekends, holidays, after finishing education or after work completely break off contact with people whom they until recently called friends?
  ","
  sounds like they've just moved on with their life, tbh. it's incredibly common to not keep in touch with people from school or work after you've moved on to something else, you're not going to remain friends with everyone you come across in life.
  "
403779,"
   Do you think it's safe that parents raise their kids with the idea that they can do (achieve) anything?
  ","
  yeah, i think it's important for parents to encourage their children to chase their dreams and if they work hard enough, then they can achieve whatever they set their mind to. however, this is also coming with the understanding that failure is inevitable and you shouldn't be deterred from your goals if you fail the first few times.
  "
403780,"
   Do you think there would be less crime if there were more police?
  ","
  i really have no idea, lol. i do know that if someone wants to commit a crime then they're probably going to find a way to do it one way or another, though.
  "
403781,"
   To which bathroom should trans go to? Females or males?
  ","
  trans men go to the mens' room & trans women go to the womens' room.
  "
403782,"
   I was referring to the house you're moving to with two guy housemates situation
  ","
  considering they're both capable adults, they're more than capable of cleaning up after themselves, lol.
  "
403783,"
   Have you driven anything bigger than your car?
  ","
  no, i've only driven small cars.
  "
403784,"
   Was it your mother or father who chose your first name?
  ","
  i honestly have no idea. i never asked them.
  "
403785,"
   Do you use video call ?
  ","
  i've only ever video called my boyfriend once on snapchat, lol.
  "
403786,"
   Can you ride a bicycle?
  ","
  no, i was never taught how to ride a bike.
  "
403787,"
   How would you feel about cleaning after other people?
  ","
  nope, i could never be involved in a profession like that.
  "
403788,"
   Do you like Lilly Singh
  ","
  the name sounds familiar, but i don't think i know who that is.
  "
403789,"

  ","
  1991, because i'm turning 28 in november.
  "
403790,"
   What did you order?
  ","
  jerk chicken. it came on a bed of pasta with mushrooms and asparagus.
  "
403791,"
   What were you LIKE back in 1983?
  ","
  considering i'm only 27 years old, i wasn't alive back then.
  "
403792,"
   Atari had Mario brothers???
  ","
  apparently so, it came out in 1983.
  "
403793,"
   What's your fav atari 2600 game?
  ","
  either mario brothers or space invader.
  "
403794,"
   You hang out with people from work on your days off? Omg I can't seeing those people on weekdays. Was it a girl or a guy
  ","
  lol, it was my female coworker and her husband. i don't mind seeing a select few of my coworkers outside of work, although i've only ever hung out with two of them on the weekends.
  "
403795,"
   I got a little too lit and passed out earlier. Hbu
  ","
  i finished most of my work and grabbed dinner with my coworker. i just got home a little while ago.
  "
403796,"
   You listen to the radio?
  ","
  yeah, i listen to the radio every morning and evening on my drive to and from work.
  "
403797,"

  ","
  of course, it's on the radio all the time.

  "
403800,"
   Why are you angry? Did something happen?
  ","
  yeah, a few things have happened today which have really gotten under my skin and bothered me. i thought i would feel better if i took a nap & then restarted with a fresh perspective, but i've been feeling dreadful ever since i woke back up.
  "
403801,"
   What are your strengths?
  ","
  i don't particularly believe that i'm a strong person (mentally, at least ... although physically, i'm very weak too).
  "
403802,"
   Do fitnes) it can help you to feel good :)
  ","
  i can barely get out of bed rn, let alone leave the house and go to the gym. i appreciate the sentiment though.
  "
403803,"
   Why wait? Do it now?!
  ","
  i just said, it's because i have zero motivation. lol.
  
  i'm honestly just sad and frustrated and angry. i just took a nap and all of these emotions came flooding back and i feel terrible all over again.
  "
403804,"
   How many Gb or Tb is an Xbox?
  ","
  you can choose which one you want, i believe. i think i purchased the 1 TB Xbox one console a few years ago.
  "
403805,"
   Were you prescribed xanax?
  ","
  no, i've never been prescribed xanax before.
  "
403806,"
   What's up?
  ","
  i'm laying in bed, and i have a few things i need to do but no motivation to actually get up and do them.
  "
403807,"
   Have you tried ginseng as an energy drink?
  ","
  i'm sure i've had energy drinks that had ginseng as an ingredient.
  "
403808,"
   Which year was your favourite birthday? Why?
  ","
  i don't remember much anymore. they all have meshed into one giant blob, at this point,
  "
403809,"
   How is journalism related to democracy?
  ","
  i don't have the slightest idea.
  "
403810,"
   What happened to the word ""bae""?
  ","
  as far as i'm aware, some people still probably use it.
  "
403811,"
   Describe yourself in three words.
  ","
  unstable, creative, driven.
  "
403812,"
   What's one grocery item you always need on hand?
  ","
  cold cuts, probably.
  "
403813,"
   What’s your opinion on slut shaming?
  ","
  i never saw the purpose of slut shaming because someone else's sex life isn't your business, lol. if someone decides to have casual sex, then that's their decision. if it doesn't personally affect you, then i don't really see the reason to waste time and energy on it.
  "
403814,"
   What’s your opinion on cheating?
  ","
  i think it's generally a terrible idea, obviously. if you're with someone and you don't want to be with them anymore, you should have the maturity to talk to them about your feelings instead of going behind their back and cheat on them with someone else.
  "
403815,"
   How can you deal with people who judge you for getting an abortion?
  ","
  you have to remember that it was your decision & your decision alone -- not theirs. you have control over what you do with your body, and something as personal as abortion isn't up to the decision of anyone else besides yourself.
  
  if someone is judging you for having an abortion, then it doesn't matter what they think at the end of the day. you did what was best for yourself at this time, and that's all that matters.
  "
403816,"
   Are you still with your bf or are you finally available?
  ","
  i'm in a relationship, yes. even if i was single, that wouldn't mean that i was available.
  "

   What if I decide to day drink? Would you just do it also so we can giggle about it and chat all day or?
  ","
  that's great if you want to day-drink as long as you're responsible about it. i won't be participating, though.
  "
403818,"
   Are you day drinking today?
  ","
  no, i rarely ever day drink unless it's a very special occasion.
  "
403819,"
   Why did you help a poor defenseless boy that lost his mother back in 2012 and promise to take care of him yet only to completely turn your back by 2019???

  no, but i've been listening to video game soundtracks a lot lately.
  "
403821,"
   Do you ever think of hanging it up?
  ","
  i have no idea what you're referring to.
  "
403822,"
   Do you like to act spontaneously or plan things? And do you have plans for your weekend?
  ","
  i answered this same exact question earlier this morning. however, to sum it up -- i prefer to plan things, but not very far in advance. most of my current plans have been rather spontaneous, being devised and then enacted within the same day.
  
  as for my weekend plans, i've been working all morning and i'm also planning on cleaning, doing laundry, and packing later today. i'm probably going to do the same thing tomorrow as well.
  "
403823,"
   Is it ok to check on my ex if I was the one who broke up with them? I have no intention of getting back but I feel bad for breaking their heart and I know I’m stupid but I slightly miss them.
  ","
  like, do you mean talking to them and making sure they're okay or just checking up on them on social media?
  
  i think it depends on the situation. if you two ended on good terms, then it isn't unreasonable to talk every once in a while. however, this also comes with the risk of complicating emotions again or resurfacing feelings, which gets confusing. missing your ex is normal, unfortunately, but you don't want to hold them back or hold yourself back especially when you know you both can be happier without each other.
  "
403824,"
   Do you think your boyfriend is perfect?
  ","
  no. nobody is perfect, we're all humans.
  "
403825,"
   lmaooo if you don’t think you’re wrong then you don’t mean it
  ","
  i agree with you. if you apologize without admitting fault and without changing your behavior, then the apology is meaningless.
  
  you're misunderstanding me, though. when i was younger, i was fully convinced that situations that were not in my control were still my fault. apologies were demanded out of me, and because i was convinced that i was in the wrong, i berated myself and apologized profusely. it's taken me years to understand that those situations were not my fault.
  "
403826,"
   What do you like about ASKfm?
  ","
  i like answering questions, especially when people feel comfortable enough with me to ask me for advice. i also enjoy reading my friends' answers and getting to know them better.
  "
403827,"
   Have you ever liked someone else while being your bf? Be honest

  i've found other people attractive, but i've never been romantically interested in anyone else while dating my boyfriend.

   Trying what?
  ","
  kudos for trying to make sense, lol.
  "
403829,"
   wow so when you actually apologize to someone you don’t mean it?
  ","
  quite the opposite, actually. when i apologize, i mean every single aspect of that apology, even when i'm not wrong. it's taken me years to realize that i wasn't actually wrong in those scenarios.
  "
403830,"
   Or is it your will which is why you won’t, makes you look funny cause you’re in a relationship for no reason
  ","
  this makes absolutely zero sense. kudos for trying, though?
  "
403831,"
   Ya but girls have something heavenly which you’ll never give
  ","
  you're absolutely correct, i've ascended straight from hell itself.
  "
403832,"
   Are you an apologetic even when you aren’t wrong?
  ","
  unfortunately, yes. i've been conditioned into apologizing for situations that weren't my fault to simply put an end to the situation entirely because i knew that if i fought back, it would just make things more difficult, even if i knew i wasn't in the wrong.
  
  i've gotten much better at standing up for myself over recent years, but i still have that apologizing behavior instilled in me, and my first instinct to pretty much anything is to apologize profusely.
  "
403833,"
   What’s the best way to deal with bullies in school?
  ","
  talk to your parents about the situation so that they can sit down with the other children's parents and school administrators to find a solution to the problem.
  "
403834,"
   What's the weirdest fight you had with someone over the internet?
  ","
  i honestly don't remember, i'm sure i've had plenty of weird arguments with anons over the years, though. lmaoo.
  "
403835,"
   Don’t you think they will be different in person? It’s easy to hide aspects of your personality online.
  ","
  it's easy to hide aspects of your personality in-person as well. a person will only reveal about themselves what's most comfortable to them, whether that's online or in person. and i personally believe that everyone is a wee bit different in person compared to online anyway, simply because there's a slight disconnect between how someone can express themselves through text versus expressing themselves verbally.
  "
403836,"
   How did you love her when you haven’t met? How was that possible?
  ","
  you don't need to meet a person face-to-face in order to love them. when you talk to someone often and get to know their personality, their interests, their opinions, and just in general how you two connect together, that isn't something only reserved for people who meet IRL.
  
  i love many of my online friends and i care about them deeply. just because i haven't met them face-to-face doesn't make my love for them less valid.
  "
403837,"
   Do you still love her?
  ","
  well, as a friend -- yes. we don't talk that often anymore, but we do talk via snapchat occasionally.
  "
403838,"
   Which is the best age to marry?
  ","
  the ""best age"" depends entirely on the individual, as well as the couple, and there isn't really an ideal age that can be universal for everyone. for some people, it's in their early 20s. for others, it's not until much later in their lives.
  
  really, the best age to marry is the age where you feel most comfortable with your partner and can envision and look forward to spending the rest of your life with that person.
  "
403839,"
   Have you ever loved someone you have not met?
  ","
  yes. when i was a teenager, i had an online friend who i talked to every afternoon after school. we began talking when i was in middle school, and i didn't actually meet her in person until my first year of college. we grew to become best friends and i genuinely loved her, even though we didn't meet in person until years later.
  "
403840,"
   Do you ever get jealous of your friends?
  ","
  i was very jealous in the past of my friends whose lives seemed more ""put together"" than mine was, but eventually i realized that most people put up facades to give off the impression that they're stable when they're really not. you simply don't know what someone else is actually going through so it's useless to judge.
  "
403841,"
   What do you refuse to pay for?
  ","
  lottery tickets. i've never purchased lotto before and i've never seen the point in playing lotto because there's a high probability that you'll never win, and often it's just a waste of money.
  "
403842,"
   Says the one who will never love anyone
  ","
  uh, are you talking about me or the anon? lmaoo.
  
  if you're referring to me, then quite obviously this is not true considering i do love many people.
  "
403843,"
   What you do you love most though?
  ","
  i love them all equally. when you're in love with someone, their looks and personality and intelligence sorta mesh into one entire entity and you love them for everything that they are, not just parts of them.

  i'm more apt to pick brains over physical beauty, particularly because beauty only goes skin-deep and it isn't an indication of how your relationship with a person will play out. you create chemistry with someone over how well you two relate, your shared interests, etc etc., and that isn't something dictated by beauty standards.

  tbh, it sounds like you're hanging out with the completely wrong crowd of people. you're absolutely right in that jokes about mental illness, the lgbt+ community, and s*xual assault are very wrong. it's detrimental to those communities to use trauma and typical mental health symptoms as ""jokes"" or to portray them in a light where people don't take it seriously.

   What is the quality you most like in a person?
  ","
  i really value honesty and humor in my friends. if you can't be honest with yourself or those around you, then you're simply putting on a facade and not portraying your true self, and that leads to insincerity and confusion down the road.

   How do you raise your self-confidence?
  ","
  i don't really believe raising self-confidence is something you can simply do by following a few steps. it takes years of self-realization and understanding your own needs to really develop good self-confidence, and tbh, i'm not even halfway there yet.

  my love is unconditional to a certain degree, but i still do have boundaries when it comes to relationships and friendships. although i love my boyfriend unconditionally for the most part, i would not continue the relationship if he was acting ab*sive towards me or didn't respect me. you have to value your own needs and well being too.
  "
403939,"
   How to stop comparing myself to people? I get so insecure and I feel like a failure when I see younger people than me being so smart. An example is the girl who recently and a speech about the climate change. I really felt like an idiot instantly.
  ","
  ugh, i understand this all too well. sometimes i see people much younger than me who are so much more accomplished, or even people my age who recently received their doctorate degrees, and it makes me feel terrible about myself.
  
  however, you have to remember that you are your own individual and everyone's paths are different. just because someone is making an impact at a young age or has a different life that you yearn for doesn't mean that you are invalid. try to utilize these feelings to push yourself to do better, learn better, improve yourself.

  -- white people cannot experience systemic racism.
  
  -- most diet trends, especially the keto diet, are extremely unhealthy.
  
  -- circumcision is barbaric and is just another form of genital m*tiliation.
  
  -- alcohol use is too normalized in today's society. binge drinking until you black out is very unhealthy, alarming, and can lead to addiction down the road.

  i don't really know much about children in general, but i do believe that learning how to cook should start early. i was never taught how to cook as a child, and it's something i've unfortunately brought with me to adulthood.
  
  i think by the age of 12 or 13, a child should know how to cook basic meals. if there's ever an emergency where a child needs to cook because a parent is absent, it's important for them to know how to at least make themselves dinner or possibly do the same for younger siblings.

   What advice would you give to someone who is struggling with their self-esteem?
  ","
  this is difficult for me to answer because i also struggle with self-esteem issues, although they have gotten a lot better over the years.
  
  to someone who is struggling, it's important to remember your worth and make sure to focus on your own happiness instead of downplaying your needs to satisfy the needs of others. contrary to what you probably believe, your own comfort and satisfaction is of the utmost importance and you deserve every good thing that will be coming to you. you will have good days and bad, but remember that the bad days do not define you.

  to whom i appreciate ;
  
  i appreciate you because you've exhibited patience with me during the roughest moments of my life, as well as undying support and the willingness to learn more about me to understand my mental health. i appreciate you because you've gone out of your way to ensure my happiness and comfort on multiple occasions, and you understand my need to be alone at certain times. i appreciate you because of the trust instilled between us after much trial and error. i appreciate you because you've continued to give me faith and hope even when times are bleak, and you instilled in me a sense of confidence that i never had before.

   How do you move on from someone you love !
  ","
  it depends on the individual, because different techniques work for different people. it does take a lot of time, patience, and an ability to ""find yourself"" again after exiting a relationship, and that timeline is also different for everyone.
  
  focus on yourself first and foremost, because your own well being and needs are most important during this stage of your life. surround yourself with friends and family, work towards accomplishing your goals, and continue doing things that bring you peace and passion.
  "
404050,"

   Ugh I’m so scared every time. Any advice on how to deal with this or see if she’s a real friend? Am I overthinking or?
  ","
  i honestly believe that you're over-thinking this. i understand your paranoia and hesitance to trust people because i'm the same exact way, but you also have to try to force yourself to look at this situation rationally. if she doesn't exhibit any tell-tale signs of being ""fake"" other than what your anxiety is telling you, then there's really no basis upon which you could make the assumption that she isn't a real friend.
  
  it would be different if you've caught her in lies, caught her back-talking you, or something similar to those things ... but if your only reason to believe she isn't being real with you is because you just *feel* that she's fake, without evidence to prove that, then that isn't a sound basis. trust me, it took me years to realize that my own paranoia isn't indicative of how people actually are, but it's an unfortunate truth.

  idk, i've always believed that people are just naturally introverted or extroverted, or at least somewhere in between. no doubt, their traits may have also been influenced by environmental factors growing up, in which a person is conditioned into behaving a certain way out of fear. but for the most part, i believe it's something innate to a human being.

   If you’re talking to someone and their always lying to you at what point do you just end the relationship but let them down easy

  i don't really think it's necessary to let them down easy, if all they do is lie to you. they don't deserve to be let down easy because chances are, they know what they're doing to you and they simply don't care. for most people who do this, it's somewhat of a power trip, and that isn't fair to you.

  you're perfectly valid in not wanting to send full body shots if you dislike your body, and honestly i don't see any reason why he wants to see that anyway when you've clearly sent him other photos of yourself. the fact that he's being so impatient with this makes me wonder if he has another motive behind it (but that's just me, i'm a paranoid person by nature).
  
  it's obviously up to you if you want to continue your friendship/relationship with him. but if he's going to keep acting like this towards you, then that's very toxic and unhealthy.

  three of my coworkers and i take breaks at the same time, and out of all of us, only one of them smokes cigarettes. the rest of us vape. it doesn't make me want a cigarette, though.
  "
404145,"
   It's even harder to quit smoking if you drink coffee, the smell of hot fresh made coffee in the morning increases my need for a smoke, lol. Coffee and cigarettes complete each other or when I'm consuming alcohol. They're just inseparable, haha.
  ","
  UGH, YES. honestly, for me the best thing in the world was waking up on a saturday morning with a hot cup of coffee and a cigarette outside on my back patio. it was my reason for getting out of bed in the morning.
  
  i actually tested myself two days after quitting by going to the bar with a friend and seeing if i could last drinking alcohol without having a cigarette. i didn't have anything on me except my vape, and i timed my vape breaks to four minutes (and i think i only took two vape breaks).

404148,"
   Are you tempted to eat more since you don't smoke? My father, a former heavy smoker for 30 years, said when he craved cigarette, he would just eat something, like a fruit or a snack, haha.
  ","
  quitting cigarettes has honestly made me SO FREAKING HUNGRY. i didn't think it was true that people got hungrier when they quit, but for a solid 5-6 days, i was insatiable. that's why a lot of people gain weight when they quit smoking, since smoking does suppress the appetite.

  these days, i don't really get high anymore except on very rare occasions. i only drink once per week and i don't get blackout drunk anymore like i used to. i've calmed down a lot and i don't obsess over things anymore, and i've learned how to accept situations and let them go for my own peace of mind.

  depends on the age, but either way i don't think i would be fully comfortable with the idea of them drinking at all. but i would much rather have them be informed and feel comfortable enough to talk to me about them potentially drinking instead of them rebelling and hiding the fact that they're drinking from me, because that only leads to worse behavior and danger down the road.

   If you ever go back does it have to be salary pay
  ","
  having a salary would be nice, LOL. but i worked in management when i worked in retail, there's no way in hell i'm ever going back to that.
  "
404262,"
   Something i think is you keep it 100 and when you are the boss- You do not put up with excuses. Do the job or accept the punishment. You are amazing
  ","
  yeah, that's pretty much how i used to work. now i'm not in a management position anymore, which i'm absolutely fine with. it was stressful and i wasn't getting paid nearly enough for what i used to do.
  "
404263,"
   When you assign tasks-- do you condone anyone who does not like the task given
  ","
  i basically used to tell them to suck it up, lmaoo. no one likes working, but a job is a job. you're not going to like the tasks given to you, but they must be done. to neglect the task at hand is going to negatively affect every other operation.
  "
404264,"
   The way I do it is 
1) Ma'am/ Sir can you follow me---- At my job we go into an elevator going up means you got the job--- going down means nope. I love being able to do interviews because. i think you would make a great boss--- you are a great leader
  ","
  i've supervised people in the past, and although initially i was uncomfortable with managing others, i slowly became more confident in my role and liked delegating tasks to people and watching my employees succeed.
  "
404265,"
   Do you think that is a slap in the face though escorting to the exit pretty much them seeing its a no
  ","
  i believe it's better to be forthcoming and tell them outright that they didn't get the job, tbh. escorting someone out of the building without indicating why is a bit harsh, unless they were acting out in some way.
  "
404266,"
   Would you care if you were escorting a person out the door and they cried that they did not get the offer for the job? as in them knowing its a no based of being escorted outside?

  "
404271,"
   Do you think being strict though turns employees off? because no one likes a zero tolerance boss.
  ","
  like i said, a manager should be strict but also understanding. if a manager is simply strict and will not understand each person's individual situation, then yes -- that definitely turns people off and severely lowers morale.
  "
404272,"
   i love your name
  ","
  thanks, me too.
  "
404273,"
   Do you think managers own an explanation to someone though of why they cut there hours
  ","
  yes, the very least they can do is tell their employee the underlying reason behind why. people rely on their hours for money obviously, and when hours get cut, it can really hinder someone.
  "
404274,"
   Do you think you would be a zero tolerance type boss though?Like no cell phone use, lateness etc
  ","
  i would be strict, but i don't think i would be unreasonable. however, if someone is chronically late or they're using their cell phone so much that it's impeding on their work, then yeah i would definitely call attention to that and bring up the issue to HR.
  
  you have to keep in mind that we're all human, we make mistakes, and no one is perfect. if someone doesn't normally use their phone, but you notice that they're on their phone a lot one day, then they likely have a justifiable reason behind it. same with being late or being absent from work.
  "
404275,"
   Do you think you would ever accept a mgmt positon

404300,"
   How did you start smoking?
  ","
  i honestly don't remember exactly how. i started smoking my freshman year of college, i think it was due to stress and my roommate smoked at the time too. i just picked up the habit.
  "
404301,"
   Did you make your research? As far as I’m aware there aren’t many studies regarding vaping
  ","
  that's why i said it's inconclusive. vaping has only been around really for 11-12 years, i think.
  "
404302,"
   isn't vaping equally unhealthy? so i heard
  ","
  it's pretty inconclusive. all of the news reports about people dying from vaping actually had THC oil in their system, not just the regular nicotine vapes. so people are misunderstanding that left & right and assuming all vaping is bad.
  
  vaping is a much better alternative, particularly for those quitting cigarettes. there aren't nearly as many chemicals, toxins, and carcinogens if you compare them to cigarettes from my understanding, and you can choose the level of nicotine and steadily decrease as you go.
  "
404303,"
   lol you make me wanna quit! been a smoker for well over 10 years, smoking 30 cigs per day, my poor lungs... but at the same time I'm afraid to quit, it calms me
  ","
  i feel that, man. i smoked since i was 17 years old, initially it wasn't many but then i gradually increased to smoking a pack a day. the calming factor deterred me too, that was a main reason why i didn't quit sooner.
  
  however, i've been vaping here and there instead of smoking cigarettes as a transitional thing, and it's been helping a lot.
  "
404304,"
   How are you?

  ""good morning"" texts, seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile, having the first cup of coffee of the day, smelling the crisp scent of autumn and winter, having campfires, receiving positive reinforcement re: my writing and ability to work, forehead kisses, and writing something i'm proud of.
  "
404309,"
   Were you popular in school, or were you a bit of an outsider?
  ","
  i wasn't popular by any means, so i was somewhat of an outsider. however, people still knew who i was because of my artistic background & i was actually voted ""most artistic"" of my graduating class.
  "
404310,"
   What pain is harder for you: physical or spiritual?
  ","
  emotional/spiritual pain is much harder for me to deal with. i can handle physical pain just fine because i know most pain is temporary, but because i feel emotions so deeply, i can be in emotional pain for weeks on end with no relief in sight.
  "
404311,"
   What can make you laugh in an instant?
  ","
  the show it's always sunny in philadelphia. regardless of how i'm feeling, that show always has me cracking up.
  "
404312,"
   Arty folk! How do you feel you developed your own artistic style, or is that something you’re still actively working towards? Any tips are hugely appreciated. If the q isn’t applicable, feel free to use as a filler/delete ✌?✨
  ","
  i'm going to answer this in terms of writing, since i don't really draw or paint much anymore. however, my artistic voice in my writing and sense of style has been developed over the course of like two decades, since i've been writing from a very young age. what has helped me hone my voice is the adoption and experimentation of other writers' voices over time. when i was a teenager, i would read books and try to implement the author's voice into my own writing, and then branch off from there.
  
  even now, it's something i actively work towards. although i have a more refined sense of style and voice in my writing as an adult, i do question it sometimes and editing your work is more important than writing the first draft itself.
  "
404313,"
   What is the most important thing you have learned in life?
  ","
  let go of things that don't serve you. above all else, your top priority in life should be your own health and wellness, and it becomes toxic to hold onto negative feelings and people, as it hinders your own progress. there's nothing wrong with letting go of people who perhaps once served you in the past, but don't anymore. not everyone is meant to be in our lives indefinitely.
  "
404314,"
   How’s your Sunday? Is your day better than yesterday?
  ","
  my day has been fine, considering i've only been awake for two hours. i'm planning on finishing up the work i started yesterday. i *was* going to go to the drug store to get my passport photo taken, but i'm really not in the mood to get dressed and leave the house today.
  "
404315,"
   I love how thick your hair is, do you take supplements or it runs in your family?
  ","
  it's genetic, actually. my father's side of the family has always had really thick hair (it's the italian side of me).
  "
404316,"
   Have you considered turning off anon?
  ","
  why would i turn off anon? that would eliminate half of my question base, rofl.
  "
404317,"
   If a guy friendzones a girl and breaks her heart don't u believe he's such an asshole? why wouldn't he give her a chance?
  ","
  people are not obligated to date someone simply because they're interested in them. if you're not interested in dating a person, then you have every right to turn down the date, regardless of the reason why.
  
  also ... the ""friendzone"" isn't actually a real thing.
  "
404318,"
   these anons are so quick to judge and throw hate, i'm amazed at how patient you are, i wouldve cussed them out then block then
  ","
  they don't bother me, tbh. if they're too insecure and cowardly to hide behind anon, then why should i invest my own time and emotions into their responses? it's pointless and wasted energy.
  "
404319,"
   Did he know about it? What was his reaction when he first knew?
  ","
  i don't remember his first reaction, that was so many years ago. but yes, he did know and actively did try to help me stop.
  "
404320,"
   Stfu you don’t have an eating disorder. this is a mockery for people who are actually struggling.

  "
404321,"
   Anyway in 26 December of 1991 the great Soviet Union has dissolved. How did your parents feel? If they had any care for politics though
  ","
  they probably didn't know and/or care because that was only one month after i was born, so they were probably preoccupied with taking care of me and my brother.
  "
404322,"
   What do you mean by disordered eating?
  ","
  i've screwed up my metabolism because i only usually eat once, sometimes twice, per day on most days -- especially when i'm going through some sort of emotional crisis. there's no routine to my eating habits, and i fluctuate between not eating anything at all and then binge eating.
  "
404323,"
   Did he help you to stop?
  ","
  actually, yes. i seldom talk about this because i know the topic is very triggering for some people, but if it wasn't for him, i wouldn't have had the motivation to stop SHing. he showed me that he gave a sh*t, meanwhile others didn't, and my interest in him gave me a reason to recover.
  "
404324,"
   Were you SHing when you met your bf?
  ","
  yes, we met when i was 16 years old. i didn't stop SHing until i was 17 or 18 years old.
  "
404325,"

  yes, i am a 1991 baby.
  "
404326,"

   do you think products that are mandatory to our everyday life should be free such as pads, tampons, glasses, and contacts? 
explaining your reasons.
what other products not listed do you think fit into that category?
  ","
  i don't believe they should be completely free, but they *should* definitely be way more affordable. pads, tampons, and sanitary wipes should be less expensive than they are now, and not taxed at all. in addition, things like glasses and contacts and eye examinations all fall under health care, and health care in general should be far less expensive than it actually is. honestly, half of the reason why i haven't seen my eye doctor in almost four years is because the cost of the examination and cost of my glasses and lenses is way too pricey.

  it depends on the day and on my mood, haha. i'm pretty much an open book, so i like talking about everything from my relationships to my hobbies to music to politics to my education/career, and everything in between. i also strongly advocate for mental health awareness, and i enjoy educating people on misconceptions of mental illnesses.

   Are my friendships and relationships doomed to fail if I can’t fully trust them and always thinking they are thinking something bad about me so I sometimes withhold information from them, even insignificant ones? Like I get so anxious when my best friend or anyone ask me where I went or what I do -
  ","
  (cont) ... Etc? My psychiatrist says it’s normal for people with BPD to feel this way but it still hurts me so. I feel bad for distrusting them but my heart and brain says I can never fully trust anyone. It’s exhausting and frustrating to know that the only people you can talk about your deepest feelings are Yourself and the people on internet that don’t know your identity because that’s the best way to protect yourself.
  
  --
  
  i understand how you feel. honestly, i don't believe they're ""doomed to fail"" or anything extreme like that, but nevertheless, you do need to work on the underlying causes of your distrust in people and work on bettering your relationships. you're only hurting yourself in the long run because a lack of trust isolates you, particularly in relationships where you should feel comfortable trusting a close friend or partner.
  
  you mentioned a psychiatrist, but do you see a therapist? i believe therapy would be helpful if you don't currently have counseling.

   do you think its possible to be in a relationship where the other person is really nice and adores and loves you but you just can't feel attracted to them in a romantic way?
  ","
  it's possible, yes. in fact, it's likely quite common.
  
  however, that doesn't mean it's right or okay. most people deserve to be with someone with whom their feelings are shared. a relationship is not balanced or healthy if someone feels stronger than the other, i.e. one partner being romantically involved but the other not being romantically involved. if you're not attracted to your partner romantically, then that's a conversation that you two need to have. you shouldn't settle for your partner if you don't love them on a romantic level, that's unfair to both of you.

   To what extent do you think it is acceptable for employers to take their employees mistakes out of their wages? (Wetherspoons is one of the many who still do this)
  ","
  i believe that's completely unacceptable. you should be compensated for the hours you provide to your work, regardless of whether or not a mistake was made. we're only human and mistakes are bound to happen (lord knows i've made a hell of a lot of mistakes during my career).
  
  if a mistake is bad enough, then obviously that warrants an HR visit, a write-up, a stern talking-to, or even termination. but to take that out of a worker's weekly wages is a bit extreme, imo. people need money to survive, and most people live paycheck-to-paycheck.

  yikes, sorry it took me three days to respond !! i have so many questions in my inbox. :/
  
  tbh, i agree with you -- i understand why she was upset in general at the prospect of the subject matter, but i don't believe that she's all that justified to be upset *with him* in particular just for answering her question honestly.
  
  in addition, just because someone supports an idea or thinks that it might be interesting doesn't necessarily mean that those ideas or events are going to even happen. relationships are a two-way street, and obviously she's quite uncomfortable with the prospect of that event happening -- therefore, it would never actually happen since there needs to be consent from both sides. like i said, i understand why she would be bothered by the *idea* of it, but in practical terms, there's nothing to be upset over because it won't actually happen.
  
  i hope this makes sense. lmaoo.

  these days, that's rare. you don't see children playing outside in the streets anymore unless a parent is with them. you don't see anyone walking outside anymore. i don't know if it's simply because times have changed or also in recognition of the danger that has increased in the area, ranging from things like robberies and break-ins to drunk drivers and whatnot.

  my boyfriend is attracted to men, women, and non-binary individuals (much like myself). it isn't feminine nor masculine, it's simply a part of who someone innately is. no one chooses their sexual orientation.
  
  we have both been in relationships with men and women in the past, and it does not bother either of us (and ideally, it shouldn't bother anyone at all). to be bothered by someone's past sexual history if they were with the same sex or gender is pretty homophobic.

   Leigh, I want your personal opinion on this. An acquaintance of mine thinks I'm classist because I said I don't have the same amount of respect for someone who has a low income job (such as washing cars, delivering pizza, etc) as I do for a doctor or a businessman). Is it classist?
  ","
  yeah, i would say that's classist of you to believe. someone's work or income level isn't an indication of who they are as an individual, and simply speaking, some people have more privilege than others especially in terms of professional opportunities. a pizza delivery driver deserves just as much respect as a doctor, not only because their profession does *not* define them, but also because you simply do not know the path someone's life has taken for them to get to that point.
  
  the pizza delivery driver could actually be working 3 jobs to keep their family afloat, and you simply would not know it. the doctor could have experienced privilege their entire life and fell into their profession because they were graciously provided a loan and didn't have much trouble affording their career path.
  
  not to mention, it's *so* much more difficult now to afford proper schooling than it ever was in the past. people used to be able to work a summer job and afford college the following semester ; these days, that's literally impossible. so all of these things have to be taken into account before you pass judgment on someone for having an entry-level or minimum wage job.

   I really love how balanced this answer is. Becoming aware of toxic and problematic behaviour stemming from my own mental illness has been a major part in learning to manage it, for me.

  yes, i very much have experienced the same thing re: my own mental illnesses too. it's difficult coming to terms with the fact that *you* may be the toxic/problematic one, even if those behaviors do stem from having mental illness. however, just because we're mentally ill doesn't mean that our toxic behavior is justified, and we need to be held accountable for ourselves just like anyone else.

  ","
  this is one of those gray area ordeals, unfortunately. generally speaking, it's wrong to ditch people simply because they're mentally ill. *however*, if that person's mental illness is causing them to act out in toxic behaviors and they're not taking responsibility for their actions or thoughts, then they should be held accountable regardless of whatever illness they have.
  
  generally speaking, mental illness is not an excuse for poor behavior. if your friend who is mentally ill is incessantly negative and it drains everyone around her, then perhaps she does need to be spoken to about perhaps seeking help (or seeking more intensive help if she's already in treatment). there's a difference between being depressed and trying to live life to the best of your ability, and being depressed and not putting any effort into making your situations better.

  ","
  oh my ... you are quite confused, my friend.
  
  non-binary is a gender identity. it essentially means that i do not identify as either of the gender binaries (""man"" and ""woman""), my gender exists in between. it's part of the transgender spectrum.
  
  your gender identity is not correlated with your sexual orientation. you can be trans or non-binary and be heterosexual, or homosexual, or bisexual, etc etc. personally speaking, i *am* bisexual but it doesn't have anything to do with my gender.
  
  to address the third part of your message -- no, being bisexual does not affect my current relationship. it isn't a personal indication that my partner ""cannot please"" me, bisexual simply means that i find more than 2 genders attractive. once i'm in a relationship, i'm fully committed to that person. (also, my boyfriend is bisexual too.)

  one of my coworkers is pretty hostile and snaps easily, and she snapped at me and one of my other coworkers the other day. we were outside on break & my one coworker was smoking a cigarette (meanwhile, me and my other coworker vape now). a random woman asked us if we had a lighter so that she could light her cigarette, so me and my vaping coworker said no. we then said, ""hey other coworker, do you have a lighter she could borrow?""
  
  instead of offering her lighter, my coworker mumbled under her breath and said, ""you shouldn't be offering my sh*t to other people"" and gave the woman a really nasty look before hesitantly offering her lighter. she was genuinely annoyed that we asked her if she had a lighter on her to help this woman. i should have spoken up and been like, ""dude, wtf?"" but i didn't want to escalate the situation, so i said nothing.

   Are you usually up this early on a Saturday?

   rant about anything:
  ","
  in light of the news articles debuting recently about vaping, i've honestly been so angry lately because of the misinformation that has been spreading regarding the difference between regular nicotine vaping & THC cartridges. while we don't know enough about vaping to conclude whether or not it *will* give a person lung disease, the articles about being people hospitalized as of late all have one thing in common: they smoked THC vapes prior to being hospitalized.
  
  however, most people are reading into this and assuming that *all* vaping is going to k*ll you, when that isn't the case. ever since these stories have emerged, i have been questioned relentlessly by both family and strangers (yes, complete strangers!) about my decision to vape. coming from the perspective of a 10-year moderately heavy smoker, i know that vaping isn't a fix-all. but, it's a hell of a lot better than me smoking a pack of cigarettes per day. i'm getting more push back about vaping than i ever did about smoking cigarettes, ironically.
  
  i've been cigarette-free for six days, since last sunday, and i already feel 100x better than when i was smoking cigarettes. i don't have horrible, gut-wrenching coughs anymore. i can breathe regularly. i can smell EVERYTHING. i feel lighter, not foggy or cloudy. it's remarkable.
  
  but yes, i still vape. and no, i don't plan on vaping ""forever."" but in light of these news stories, there should be more concern over the fact that legislators are apparently so quick to ban vaping products instead of putting stricter laws on cigarettes themselves, which kills literally millions of people. the system is backwards.

  i'm so sorry you're going through this. :/ my eyesight isn't that bad, at least i don't think it is, but i understand the fear that you're going through. i would most definitely feel the same way, and my eyesight gets worse every year as well (which isn't helped by the fact that i haven't gone to the eye doctor in like 3.5 years).
  
  are there *any* treatment options you can consider at this point? you said corrective lenses won't completely help, but maybe there's some surgical stuff you could look into? i'm not really well versed on this type of thing.

  so, today is world s*icide prevention day. even though it's trending on social media to post about s*icide prevention, mental health awareness, and advocacy, ideally this should be *every* day. i'm thankful that there are such strong individuals sharing their stories; however, we need to face the facts.
  
  -- 800,000 people d*e by s*icide worldwide each year
  
  -- s*icide is the second leading cause of de*th for 15-24 year olds
  
  -- lgbt youth are 3x more likely to attempt, compared to youth who are straight
  
  -- black, latino, native american, and asian people who are lgbt attempt at *much* higher rates
  
  -- s*icide is 4x higher in men than women, and this is largely due to toxic masculinity and the de-emphasis of mental health awareness in men
  
  in addition, mental health advocacy and s*icide prevention isn't *solely* about raising awareness of stigma and various disorders. we also need to enact affordable, accessible behavioral health care. there are so many people who struggle because they cannot get help, whether it's because they do not have access to care or they cannot financially afford care. this has to end.
  
  s*icidal ideation does not discriminate, it holds no prejudices, and it can afflict anyone. chances are, you know someone who is either struggling, has attempted, or has completed s*icide. we all need to begin taking mental health more seriously, and not just when celebrities take their own lives. this needs to be constant.

  "
404597,"
   so i recently met someone online by chance and we've become very close in the last two weeks or so. i didn't anticipate we'd be friends at all and i kinda made up minor details abt myself at first just to sound a little more interesting but then i ended up lying to him abt where im from (1)
  ","
  and certain details abt my appearance. i did it to seem more interesting and intriguing and i know it wasn't right but we're becoming closer and closer and he has shared a lot w me and is wanting to see pics of me and whatnot. i have some i would provide if i hadn't have been dishonest. if i send some now, he'd know i lied. i feel dumb and i really regret it. what do you think i should do? im embarrassed to tell him now.
  
  --
  
  honestly ... it's best to be totally honest with him, especially if you two are becoming close and you see this going further (whether in a friendship way or otherwise). explain to him how you were feeling and that you were insecure with yourself, and you felt the need to make yourself more interesting to capture his attention. that maybe he wouldn't have been as interested in you if you were just being yourself. it's important that you do apologize and tell him that you know what you did was dishonest, but you don't want this to change his opinion of you.
  
  i understand your fear, though. i would feel the same way if i was in that situation, but if i'm thinking about it from his perspective ... if you explained the reasoning behind your actions and acknowledged that they were wrong, i don't see why he wouldn't give you another chance at furthering the friendship.

404598,"
   Do you think bullying can motivate self improvement? Why / why not?
  ","
  no, bullying is generally very harmful towards children and decreases self-esteem and confidence levels. it teaches children that they're ""not good enough"" or that they should conform to societal or gender norms just to fit in with everyone else. efforts toward self-improvement come from a place of understanding your own boundaries and being motivated to be better for yourself, not for the benefit of others.

   People are idiots and simply don't see mental illness as a valid medical condition. It has to do with your brain and it's chemical imbalances, your genetics, or how it's responding to abxse, neglect, or trauma. Faith can help but it can't replace psychiatric treatment or cure illnesses.

  i definitely wouldn't be annoyed, but i would be a tad bit suspicious, especially if we were close friends and talked frequently. it would mean that they still feel too uncomfortable around me in order to reveal who they are in most cases ... *or* they're pretending to be someone they're not for some ulterior motive.

  i believe that children are entitled to *some* privacy, but definitely not complete privacy because that's just a recipe for the child to get into hazardous activities. at the same time, however, too little privacy can be extremely overbearing for a child and leads to them acting out of rebellion because they feel constricted and caged, so to speak. there has to be a healthy balance, and you must also trust your child to a degree as well.

  personally, exercise has never helped my depression and if anything, it has only made it worse because of my own self-expectations and self-image. i normally don't have the physical energy to even get up and exercise to begin with.

404649,"
   Is the idea of human intimacy losing appeal? For example, nobody 'makes love' anymore, instead we f***. If this rings true with you, do you think this casual view of intimacy is a good thing, or do you find it to be a bit on the degenerate side?
  ","
  i partially agree with this notion, but i also disagree. i believe there's a large hook-up culture, but honestly, it isn't anyone's business what someone does with their s*x or romantic life, especially if they're having s*x casually and it's their decision and their decision alone.
  
  human intimacy is still going strong, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's losing an appeal simply because people are given more freedom with their bodies and desires. we're all simply learning to listen to ourselves, do what's best for ourselves, and live our own lives free from judgment.

  ","
  no, and i prefer it that way.
  "
404745,"
   Why do people smoke?
  ","
  it's an addiction like most other addictions. perhaps the smoker got into smoking initially because of peer pressure or they were looking for a quick ""escape,"" but nicotine is one of the most addictive chemicals out there and quitting cigarettes is very hard for most people to do.
  
  coming from the perspective of a smoker myself, i like the relaxation that cigarettes give me even after all of these years. i've slowly been resorting to vaping, though, because smoking cigarettes is an expensive habit and i'm not ready to 100% quit yet.

isn’t even the cost of living a rip off for what you get too ? i remember us talking about it awhile back that like a 1 bedroom run down studio apartment can be up to $1,200+/mnth?
  ","
  that's the main reason why i've been cutting down & resorting to vaping, tbh. :/ it's way too expensive to be a smoker.
  
  and yeah, when i was looking for one bedroom studio apartments for myself a while ago, hell even basement apartments, they averaged around $1200-1300/month. at least now with the house i'm renting with my friends, i pay *much* less than that since we're splitting rent three ways.
  "
404800,"
   If something happens to you who's your ""go-to"" person to tell, someone you trust ?
  ","
  my boyfriend. i tell him everything that bothers or upsets or angers me, and he's always been a terrific support system. he knows how to rationalize and validate my feelings while also bringing me back to reality if perhaps i'm acting dramatic or irrational.
  "
404801,"
   idr which part of NY he was in, but a pack of cigarettes was like $12 there versus $5.75 here and our lowest gas price rn is $1.93 so i only imagine how high yours is ?
  ","
  a pack of marlboros on long island is between $10 and $11. in manhattan, they're $14.
  
  as for gas, it depends on which station you go to but it's anywhere between $2.50 and $2.65.
  "
404802,"
   not to mention, things in NY are like twice as expensive than they are in a lot of other states from what Dan has told me.
  ","
  yeah, everything from gas to milk to cigarettes to food items and hygienic care. i've never lived in another state before (besides massachusetts, but i was a student), but from my understanding, the prices are inflated here more than most other states, and people simply don't get paid enough to keep up with the cost of living.
  "

  i use my debit card to buy groceries. i only ever use my credit card on big purchases or if i'm buying something online.

404804,"
   why dont your bf move out then he wont hv to pay rent and grocery if he dont live there
  ","
  moving out and paying for rent and utilities would cost a hell of a lot more than the rent he's paying now plus the groceries he buys.
  
  trust me, if there was a way we could currently do it, then it would have started happening already. i'm not putting my life on hold and staying home with my parents simply because he can't move out yet. i need my own place.
  "
404805,"
   I think these people also have no idea how expensive NY can be
  ","
  yeah, i bet if i lived anywhere else i would have been able to afford my own place years ago when i was paid less money at my old jobs. new york is one of the most expensive states to live in.

404806,"
   so adult kids should be able to live rent free at their parents when they're in financial need yet these same kids wont help their parents out in their needs

  that's a different scenario entirely, lol. ideally, if someone is living rent free they should have the conscience to contribute in other ways, especially if the parents are in need of assistance.
  "
404807,"
   but if hes paying rent why pay for all grocery? gee you're lucky your parents cared enough to let you live rent free
  ","
  it sounds illogical, but that's the way it's always been. he stopped fighting it a long time ago.
  
  honestly, i don't believe that a child should have to pay to live in their home with their parents, it's part of your parental duties to care for your children even if they are an adult. plus, i would have rather moved out years ago instead of putting up with my family's bullsh*t for all of these years. i'm finally escaping.
  "
404808,"
   why does he pay for his familys grocery and cant he get a cheaper car
  ","
  it's his way of contributing, and its honestly always been that way. he just bought a new car (well not new, it was a few years old when he got it) so he's paying the car payments on that. i still have a few thousand left on my car myself.
  "
404809,"
   like what extra bills
  ","
  his car payment is higher than mine (although his car insurance is a tad lower than mine), he pays rent at home, and he pays for most of the grocery shopping for his family. he also pays more out of pocket for medication every few weeks, among other things.

  "

  looks are somewhat important because you want to be physically attracted to the person you're dating. however, attraction ultimately does come down to personality and the chemistry you have. if you don't have similar interests or can't converse with each other, the relationship may not last long.

  ""get over it.""
  
  it's incredibly invalidating, especially in the context of mental health where someone feels depressed, anxious, angry, etc etc. people cannot choose to feel the way that they feel, and it isn't productive to tell someone to simply ""get over it,"" and if anything, that makes those feelings worse.

  i don't take new years resolutions seriously, so i don't bother making them. if you resolve to do something with your life, you really shouldn't wait for the beginning of a new year to begin doing it. if you have the ambition and drive, you should work towards it as soon as you're able to do so.

  "
404849,"
   Would you rather quit your idea or stick to it, if everybody is against it?

  i think it depends on the reason why they're against the idea in the first place. sometimes we don't realize that something is a bad idea until another person talks to us about it from their own perspective. you may think it's a terrific idea, but viewing it from other people's points of view is helpful in ultimately making a decision.

   if anything you'd probably drink less since on your own type thing, don't have to deal with all that etc good luck in the meantime
  ","
  yeah, that's exactly my thinking as well. i mainly get the overwhelming urge to drink because she gets under my skin, and i go out as a means of simply not being home. by living on my own, i won't have that stressor in my life anymore.
  
  thank you, though -- i appreciate it.

  ","
  sitting alone in my room with mellow music playing; having the first cup of coffee of the day; listening to the rain and thunderstorms outside; sleeping in until at least 9:00am; seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile; having deep conversations with friends; being in a clean room after spending time cleaning and organizing it; and writing something creative and being proud of it.

   What's the last thing to piss you off (if its ok to say)
  ","
  my mother and i got into an argument yesterday morning. she claimed i drank too much alcohol (even though i severely cut down my drinking from a few months ago), and she said that she doesn't want me to move out because then she won't be able to keep an eye on me and know when i'm drinking.
  
  it really angered me, mainly because i'm a grown adult and she doesn't need to keep tabs on me anymore. i can make my own decisions, but she's trying to exercise control over my life at any possible moment.
  "
404855,"
   can you ever be able to completely cut off your parents for good?
  ","
  i would have no qualms over cutting off my parents completely from my life. my father isn't terrible, so i would likely stay in contact with him, but my mother has ab*sed me my entire life and i have no reason to remain in contact with her.

  i would rather have perfect abs, haha. i have no desire to be noticed by anyone besides my boyfriend.

404857,"
   Where do you really want to travel?
  ","
  virtually anywhere, haha. i want to visit my best friend in new hampshire. i want to go camping in upstate new york. i want to take a cross-country road trip and visit yosemite, redwood national park, and the badlands. i want to see europe (particularly italy, spain, and croatia) and visit new zealand and australia.

  yeah, definitely -- as long as they obviously take care of those dogs properly.

   Do you like high heels?
  ","
  no, i cannot stand any sort of heels. i can't walk in them and they're very uncomfortable.
  "
404861,"
   Do you personally find it offensive or rude when someone (can be family/friends/strangers) ask you if you took your medication when you are mad/sad?
  ","
  depends on their tone of voice. if they say it in a nasty way, then yeah i take offense to that. however, if they're saying it in a concerning way then i don't mind it at all. sometimes i do forget to take my meds and it makes my depression worse.

   do you judge people that wear religious clothing
  ","
  no, not at all. it's simply an expression of their religion.
  "
404868,"
   how much do you judge a person by their appearance ? ?
  ","
  i normally try not to judge by appearance, but i will have some sort of judgment towards you if i know you have the capability of dressing nicely and you forego your physical appearance and/or hygiene. obviously this isn't the same case as when someone is struggling, though.
  "
404869,"
   who/what is your biggest style inspiration ? ?
  ","
  i really like cozy, autumn styles -- with big, soft sweaters, striped and plaid cardigans, ripped skinny jeans, knee-high boots, scarves, beanies, etc etc. i like the colors and patterns of autumn clothing the most.
  "
404870,"
   what belief do you have that most people disagree with ? ?
  ","
  i'm not sure if this is an unpopular opinion or not, but i'm against circumcision. i think it's the equivalent of female g*nital mutilation and it's completely unnecessary in most cases. parents do it for cosmetic reasons and there are so many risks involved.
  "
404871,"
   what is the strangest habit you have ? ?

404879,"
   I’m sorry to hear that. ? it’s actually showing in your answers. Sh*t relates to work?

   You think is right that inmates in prison is forced to work when they are in prison?
  ","
  yes, i believe it's a productive use of their time and it gives them something to focus on while they're serving their sentence. being idle for too long is unhealthy for you, both physically and mentally.

404881,"

404883,"
   What's the most difficult choice one has to make?

  idk, i think it differs for each person. i think it's difficult to decide whether or not to part ways with someone or something that you genuinely love, but it's toxic for you.
  "
404884,"
   How are you feeling? You said you weren’t feeling good
  ","
  i'm still not feeling the best. there's a lot of sh*t going on in my life rn, and it's gotten me feeling rather discouraged and down. i feel a bit better today than i have in the past week, though. i'm just trying to take each day at a time.
  "
404885,"
   Do you think someone’s loser if they are 30 and still live with their parents?
  ","
  i don't use the term ""loser"" because i'm not 12 years old.
  
  to answer your question in a serious manner, though, it depends on why they're living with their parents. every situation is different, and some people need to live with their parents for emotional, financial, or physical reasons (sometimes related to health). however, if someone is living with their parents and they're not contributing to the household or actively looking for ways to move forward, then i think that is a bit concerning.
  "
404886,"
   Do you live mostly in the now or does your mind go from past to future mostly?
  ","
  lately i've been focusing more on the future, but i do think about the past on occasion. i try to live in the current moment, but sometimes it's difficult given my anxiety and whatnot.
  "
404887,"
   What are your favourite kind of questions to answer? What kind of questions would you like to receive MORE of?
  ","
  i like questions that are personalized to my own life, such as questions about my education, my career, my hobbies, my relationships, my mental health, etc etc.
  
  i would like to receive more questions related to those subjects because answering generalized spam can get boring at times.

   How much care do you give to your hair in the morning?

  the only thing i do to my hair in the morning is brush it to get the knots out.

   You don’t remember your childhood tho. Make up your mind

  the entire experience is exciting to me, haha. the pain isn't so great obviously, but the minute the tattoo gun turns on, i'm so amped and in the zone.
  "
404894,"
   Say you were training someone then you heard that this person may take over your job and replace you would you give a proper training or would you take the opportunity to sabotage the training to keep your job?
  ","
  i definitely wouldn't sabotage the training, haha. i would want to give that person the best resources to do their job correctly and efficiently. it would only hurt me in the long run if i didn't train them correctly.
  "
404895,"
   What do you do differently as a senior editor from when you were a regular editor?
  ","
  i'm in control of the entire magazine project, from editing the features to keeping track of clients and their revisions that they send in. right now, we're in the pre-production stages of layout and the graphic design team just finished laying out the pages. i have to go through the pdf on monday to check for any mistakes.
  
  in addition, i have a writer who works beneath me and writes the magazine features (in the past, i was the one writing the features beneath the previous senior editor). i've been training her for two weeks now.
  "
404896,"
   how long can you hold a grudge ?
  ","
  i don't tend to hold grudges because they wind up hurting me more than they hurt the other person.
  "
404897,"
   What is your favorite thing about summer?
  ","
  i like going down to the bay, listen to live music, and watch the sunset.
  "
404898,"
   How are you, honestly?

  ","
  my bills, lmao. particularly my health insurance and my student loan.
  "
404902,"
   Same, I find the friend zone thingy really disrespectful and it's mostly used to belittle someone, to portray them in a bad light. People are not obligated to reciprocate and that doesn't make them bad. Also, these people are acting as if friendship isn't valuable.
  ","
  i wholeheartedly agree with you. you're not a bad person if you don't reciprocate feelings, you're just simply looking for something or someone that isn't the person asking you out. it isn't usually anything personal, but those who advocate for the friendzone make it super personal, like it's a personal insult to them and they view themselves as irresistible.
  "
404903,"
   what impression do you try to give when you first meet someone ? ?
  ","
  i try to give off the impression that i'm an open-minded and tolerable person, someone who can be trusted and is always willing to talk when necessary.
  
  instead of that impression, i usually accidentally give off the impression that i'm awkward af because i don't know how to behave in social situations. lmao.
  "
404904,"
   is there an article of clothing you own that you’ve kept as some type of keepsake over the years? what is the story behind it? ?
  ","
  no, i don't have emotional attachments to my clothing or even most of the items that i own. i routinely clean and throw things away or donate them because i don't like having junk.
  "
404905,"
   Friendzone?
  ","
  i don't believe the friendzone exists, tbh. it's just a term salty people use when they're rejected by someone they're interested in, and they can't let go of the fact that not everyone is either looking for a relationship or not everyone wants what you're offering.
  "
404906,"
   What would be the perfect gift for you?
  ","
  money, pls.
  "
404907,"
   What makes someone powerful?
  ","
  self-reassurance and the knowledge that one's power comes from within. once you realize that you're the only person stopping yourself from achieving your goals, you're unstoppable.
  "
404908,"
   What's your opinion on that dating notion that some people are considered ""out of your league"" ?
  ","
  i don't really agree with the concept -- we're all human beings, we all have things that make us strong and vulnerable, and it's unhealthy to put people up on a pedestal like that.
  "
404909,"
   Are you gonna sage your house when you move in?
  ","
  no, that seems unnecessary, lol. i'll probably light a candle the first night, though. i want to buy a pumpkin pie candle, lmaoo.
  "
404910,"
   Are crime shows your version of gossip?
  ","
  i don't really understand what true crime has to do with gossiping, haha. the two aren't related.
  "
404911,"

404913,"
   What is your dream travel destination?

  "
404914,"
   Do you prefer rivers, lakes or oceans?
  ","
  i prefer the ocean, although admittedly it does scare me a bit. i only ever swim in calm waters because i don't want the current to grab me and cast me out to sea.
  "
404915,"
   Who do you trust most in your life?
  ","
  i trust my boyfriend the most. whenever i have a problem or if i'm struggling with my mental health, he always knows what to say in order to make me feel better.
  "
404916,"
   What are you really curious about?
  ","
  other people's goals, ambitions, and passions. i think that you can truly get to know someone by discussing those types of things, and everyone has a different perspective of what they want to accomplish in life.
  "
404917,"
   Do you tend to listen more to male or female singers?
  ","
  i listen to more male singers than anything else. although there are a few female-fronted bands that i love, like florence and the machine, in this moment, and otep.
  "
404918,"
   How important is positivity in Life?
  ","
  i think it is rather important to maintain some degree of positivity in life, yeah. i believe that people should have realistic approaches to situations, but having positive thoughts definitely helps others work towards and succeed in their goals.
  "
404919,"
   What would you change in this World?

  i would eradicate all forms of oppression and discrimination (i.e. homophobia, transphobia, ableism, racism, sexism, etc etc).
  "
404920,"
   What kind of movies do you enjoy the most?
  ","
  i like psychological thrillers, dark comedies, and gritty action movies.
  "
404921,"
   Chocolate cake or chocolate ice-cream?
  ","
  i don't like either because i'm not a big fan of chocolate. i prefer vanilla.
  "
404922,"
   Are you a forgiving person
  ","
  depends on the severity of what someone did to hurt me. i've forgiven people in the past, but these days i'm much less forgiving toward people who have hurt me.
  "
404923,"
   Do you believe everything happens for a reason?
  ","
  no, not everything happens for a reason. i don't believe in destiny or fate, and i believe some things happen simply because it was a domino effect or just coincidence. to say that everything happens for a reason discounts the traumatic experiences that some people have, as well.
  "
404924,"
   What's the best relaxation technique?
  ","
  it depends on the individual, because some techniques work for some people and not others. personally, i like laying down in a cool, dimly-lit room with calming music playing.

  some of my tattoos don't have a particular meaning. i have two friendship tattoos, a tattoo dedicated to my passion for love, a yin yang dedicated to my passion for music, and a band logo to represent how much that band has helped me, among others.
  
  most of my tattoos weren't terrible painful, except for the back of the calf and my ribcage. those were pretty bad, haha. the easiest tattoo was the one on my shoulder blades and my forearm wasn't bad either.

  ugh, yes that's the absolute dream rn. it's currently 75 degrees fahrenheit where i live, which isn't terrible because it was up in the 80s and 90s only a few weeks ago. but i do love when the temperature is in the 50s and 60s, especially when it's a bit cloudy.
  "
404936,"
   Do you think it should be free?

  i don't really know about it being completely free since i'm sure there's some labor that goes into making a passport for someone. it should be more affordable, though.

404942,"
   Which is the craziest makeover you've ever had?
  ","
  i don't really consider any of my ""makeovers"" to be crazy, particularly because i don't really like the use of the term crazy to describe ordinary things -- it's stigmatizing towards those with mental illness.
  
  however, i think the most drastic change was when i cut off all of my hair into a very short pixie cut during my senior year of high school and bleached it to a very light blonde. before that, my hair was to my shoulders and it was brown.
  "
404943,"
   How old were you when you shaved your head for the first time?

  i wasn't very young at all, i only started shaving my head maybe 3 years ago. that would have made me 24 years old.

  lol, for real. and this conversation all started because an anon (idk if it was the same one or not) said it was gross to have to clean a bathroom that other people have also been using.
  
  like ... i've been cleaning my bathroom for years, and i share that bathroom with my parents and in the past with my brother too. after a while, it doesn't phase you anymore.
  "
404947,"
   I hope this isn’t too personal or sensitive. But does your mental illness ever make you feel scared to reproduce? Like I don’t think I want kids, but some days I do. When I do, I’m sad. Because the chance of my kids having depression/anxiety/BPD scares the hell out of me.
  ","
  i understand this completely, and i do sometimes feel the same way. however, even though there are *some* genetic components to those mental illnesses, it's also a product of a person's environment. if or when you have children in the future, if you provide them with a loving, understanding, and open home then that decreases the chance that they'll develop mental health problems. give them the life that you weren't given when you were growing up.
  "
404948,"
   Most houses now a days have like one or two main bathrooms with showers and stuff and then you might have one or two little en-suite with a toilet and sink. Unless you’re lucky to find an affordable place, good luck getting 2+ full bathrooms. Anons on crack.
  ","
  yeah, when i was house-hunting there were a few houses that had 1.5 or 2.5 bathrooms (the 1/2 being the en-suite you just mentioned), but they were super expensive. there's really no reason for us to get a house with more than one or two bathrooms, considering there are only three people living in the house and we're all never going to be home at the same time.

  it's ... just a bathroom. and as you get older and begin cleaning your own bathroom, you don't get phased by the gross sh*t you see. obviously if the situation is extreme and i find my friends pissing all over the place, that's a conversation that needs to be had, lol. but otherwise, it's a normal part of life and living with other people.

  this is a ridiculous notion in my situation. i've known my friends for 10 years and i trust him with my life (and he feels the same towards me). if i wasn't comfortable with the situation, then i simply wouldn't have signed the lease. in addition, it says a lot about your friendships with people if you don't trust them not to assault you.
  
  furthermore, assault is never the victim's fault, so to place blame on a person by saying they're ""inviting"" the event is extremely toxic and problematic.

  i also struggle with anger, but it's more internalized than external, if that makes sense. i direct my anger towards myself and self-destruct, rather than explode on other people.
  
  as for how to handle anger and emptiness ... honestly, it's useful to learn mindfulness and grounding techniques. it won't be an overnight transition obviously, but there are books you can buy regarding mindfulness and how to apply DBT to your life if you can't see a therapist. i've had one book in particular in my amazon shopping list for months now, ""the dialectical behavior therapy skills workbook"" by dr. matthew mckay. it has really good reviews.

   what is a huge stigma regarding mental health that you believe should be abolished? ?
  ","
  tbh all stigmas against mental health should be abolished.
  
  however, i believe the biggest stigma that exists is this notion that all mentally ill people are a danger to society and should be treated with hostility and caution. particularly when it comes to complex disorders (i.e. personality disorders or psychotic disorders), there has always been a tremendous stigma stating that these people are ""dangerous"" or capable of doing harm to another person.
  
  however, studies have shown that mentally ill people as a whole are more of a danger to *themselves* than anyone else, and most mentally ill people could never imagine hurting another person in their life, friend or stranger. the stigma that we're all dangerous is extremely hurtful in itself and further pushes mentally ill people away from obtaining the proper help they need.

  have you sat down and talked to him about this yet? it's definitely a conversation worth having, especially considering you were under the impression that you two were exclusive to one another. you deserve to know the truth, and to be perfectly honest, i wouldn't want to personally be with someone who isn't honest enough to tell me about them developing feelings for another person before they go ahead and act on those feelings. that's a pretty sh*tty thing for someone to do.

   Ah I am not in the us if that makes sense! The laws are different in my country, they say I will get “kicked out” if they found out I didn’t disclose my medical conditions fully! That goes for all the schools here. :(
  ","
  oh wow, that's terrible. :/ as if your medical conditions have any factor on whether or not you're a good student. i know plenty of people who completed college despite their medical conditions, both physical and mental, and just because you're diagnosed by a physician with a disorder doesn't mean you're not qualified to be a student.
  
  in this case, i suppose you have no other choice but to disclose your mental illnesses to your potential schools. however, depression and anxiety are extremely common disorders, so i honestly don't see them giving you a hard time about them. and if they do discriminate against you because of your medical history, that isn't a school you should want to be affiliated with anyway.

  yes, i was the toxic and bad person in other people's lives a long time ago. i was a party animal, insatiable, and completely and utterly selfish. i did things that aligned with my own desires with little regard of other people's feelings, and a lot of others got hurt along the way. after i grew out of that phase of my life, i lost a lot of people.

  for example, i've cried over perfectly happy songs before. i've cried over my coffee spilling on the way into work. i've cried over situations that don't even pertain to me but because i could empathize with the other person. however, it's extremely difficult for me to express emotion with ""big"" events, like at funerals and such. it takes me about a week to process those emotions, which makes me feel like a sh*t person because everyone else in the room is crying and i'm sitting there emotionless. :/

   Could a healthy life style improve your mental health? I know if you are ill, only medication and therapy can truly help you, but does a healthy life style (i.e diet, hydration, physical exercise and being surrounded by positivity and good things) make it feel better?
  ","
  it varies depending on the individual. for some people who are mentally ill, having a healthy diet and exercising does improve their mental health as a result (there are also studies showing the inter-connection between your ""gut"" health and mental health). personally speaking, i do feel better when i'm on a routine, and if i'm somehow off of that routine, then i struggle as a result.
  
  the same cannot be said for everyone, though. just because a few people's mental health is aided by diet and exercise and positivity and whatnot doesn't necessarily mean it will work for everyone who is mentally ill. each person is unique, so treatment modalities will differ depending on each person's background, resistance to medication, openness, past experiences, support system, etc etc.

  i've honestly never heard of a school (i'm assuming college or university?) asking about medical conditions. i don't recall any of the colleges i applied for asking about my medical history, so idk if it was simply those colleges or it wasn't a thing at the time.
  
  this involves privacy laws and HIPAA and whatnot, so i don't know the answer to your question. i can only assume that you're under no obligation to disclose your medical history, physical or mental, but this is something you should discuss with either a law professional or a school counselor.

405084,"
   Do you think if both people in a relationship suffer from depression that it is doomed to fail? Or do you think they might be more understanding of each other?

  depression is not a character flaw, so no -- a relationship is not doomed to fail if both partners have depression. i believe that in some cases, people might be toxic for one another if they're not actively trying to help their own mental health and are using it as an ""excuse"" or a ""crutch"" for bad behavior. but in most cases of couples with mental illness, it just fosters understanding and empathy.

  not so great the past few days. i've been depressed, so i've rotated between feeling completely numb and then crying my eyes out. i've been sleeping too much and drinking too much. i haven't taken my medication. i haven't eaten. i hope this is just a passing episode because i can't cope.

   What do you think separates infatuation from 'real' love?
  ","
  when you're infatuated with someone, it's normally surface level attraction. real love, on the other hand, is much deeper and intimate than infatuation. you're in love with who a person is on the inside, you strive to help them achieve their goals, you hurt when they hurt, you celebrate when they celebrate, etc etc.

405176,"
   What scares you (in a relationship or in life)

  ","
  putting myself out there in terms of renting a house, even though i didn't know the first thing about renting a house to begin with. i had to do a lot of research to see what's a good, affordable price and what isn't, what features i should be looking out for, etc etc.
  
  it's paid off because i did find a place to rent, and we're moving in october. i'm excited but also hella nervous.

  "
405182,"
   Have you ever been unintentionally responsible for breaking up a relationship?
  ","
  sorta, yeah. when my boyfriend and i initially met, he was in a long distance relationship with someone else for about a year or two. after we began talking routinely, he developed feelings for me and broke up with his girlfriend in order to ask me out on a date.
  
  there's no animosity between anyone involved, and i'm actually good friends with his ex. we talk sometimes on instagram.
  "
405183,"
   When you go out to dinner to you usually order an appetizer? How about dessert?
  ","
  i'll order an appetizer if i'm feeling extra hungry, but most times i just have a single meal. i'll usually order spinach artichoke dip if the restaurant has it.
  
  i don't order dessert. i'll usually only order coffee.
  "
405184,"
   Are you a creature of habit or you like stepping out of your comfort zone?
  ","
  i'm mainly a creature of habit, and the times i've stepped out of my comfort zone were when i had to do so out of necessity. stepping out of my comfort zone increases my anxiety because i don't like the unknown, but sometimes it is necessary to do so for your own progress and/or survival.
  "
405185,"
   How do you usually react, when somebody is shouting at you?
  ","
  i usually burst out sobbing and my anxiety skyrockets. i can't handle when other people are angry and yelling, it's a major trigger of mine.
  "
405186,"
   Did you ever run away from home?
  ","
  no. i wanted to when i was a teenager, and i even packed my belongings and was writing a note, but i realized i had no place else to go.
  "
405187,"
   biggest pet peeve?
  ","
  my biggest pet peeve is when people talk over me when i'm in the middle of speaking, because it shows that they clearly weren't listening to me and don't care about what i had to say. i find it very disrespectful and rude.

  "
405192,"
   What's your temper like
  ","
  i'm usually very calm, grounded, and easy-going. sometimes i'll sink into episodes of rage, but it only happens if i've been suppressing feelings of anger for a long time and they explode after one small thing happening.
  "
405193,"
   What question do you ask yourself a lot?
  ","
  i often ask myself ""what's the point?"" especially when i'm going through a depressive episode. things sometimes seem so meaningless to me.
  "
405194,"
   Even if he cheats on you?
  ","
  it would depend on the context, i suppose. there are different levels to cheating, but he's my best friend first and foremost as well as my boyfriend. i value our connection together and i'll always support his dreams and goals.

  "
405196,"
   eggs or cereal for breakfast?

  i prefer having eggs in the morning for breakfast. it's much healthier for you, in moderation at least, and the protein is good for you. cereal is basically empty carbs.
  "
405197,"

  abandonment by my loved ones. i'm terrified that people are suddenly going to get fed up with me and leave me.
  "
405198,"
   Worst drug to use?

  pretty much all of them besides marijuana. i've seen the devastating effects illegal drugs can have on people, particularly heroin.
  "
405199,"
   do you like having alone time with him?

  yes, i really value the times we spend when we're together. we have a chance to sit down and talk and laugh without fear or judgment, especially when it comes to catching up on each other's lives outside of our relationship.

  a cheese stick, or hummus and carrots. i also have spinach dip in the fridge, but i haven't been in the mood to eat lately.
  "
405202,"
   What was the last bad decision you made? What impact did it have and how did you manage to overcome it?
  ","
  i probably shouldn't have gone out to drink when i was in a horrible, depressed mood the other night. it numbed me for the time being, but i felt guilty and anxious when i woke up the following morning.
  "
405203,"
   do you have a boyfriend?
  ","
  yes, i do.
  "
405204,"
   Are you afraid of the dark?

  i'm not afraid of the dark, but i do feel more comfortable with some sort of dim light on so that i can see my surroundings.
  "
405205,"
   one person who has never betrayed your trust?
  ","
  my best friend. she has always remained loyal and honest with me, even during difficult times.
  "
405206,"
   what do you like doing on your own?
  ","
  relaxing and recharging. i'm around people all day long while i'm at work, so when i'm home i prefer to be alone. i usually just sit down, watch some television or a movie, drink coffee, or listen to music while laying down with my eyes closed.
  "
405207,"
   Could we be friends!? And communicate via Wattsapp
  ","
  no. i'm not interested in making new friends, and i don't have whatsapp.
  "
405208,"

  pretty much all the time. as i've gotten older, i've really connected with the comfort of being in solitude.
  "
405209,"
   Yes,I have! Could we talk in private!
  ","
  no, i don't talk privately to people from askfm unless they're a good friend already. if you have a question, you can freely ask it here.
  "
405210,"
   In general do you tend to move on quickly or does it take more time?
  ","
  i have a tendency to move on quickly from things and people. once i'm done with a person, i move forward from them without looking back. i only really cut people out of my life if they've proven themselves to be toxic or bad people, so at that point then i'm already finished with them.
  "
405211,"
   What has been the highlight of your summer?
  ","
  i haven't really done any fun or extraordinary activities this summer at all, i've been mainly focusing on work, making money, and taking steps toward bettering my mental health. i suppose the highlight has been finding the perfect house to rent, as well as my promotion at work.
  "
405212,"
   What does comfort mean to you?
  ","
  comfort is relaxing in my bedroom wearing sweatpants and an old tee-shirt, lighting a pine-scented or pumpkin pie candle, drinking hot coffee or tea, and watching a compelling television show or docu-series. ambient lights are lit around my room, giving off a faint blue or amber glow, and my himalayan salt rock lamp is glowing in the distance.
  "
405213,"
   Would you rather go to a music festival, have fun and sleep in a tent, or stay home, watch TV series and have some tasty snacks?
  ","
  these days, i would much rather stay home with my boyfriend or a close friend, watch television together, and eat delicious food. i used to love to party and be around other people, but i don't have the energy for most of those things anymore.
  "
405214,"
   What's more important - inner or outer beauty?
  ","
  inner beauty is much more important than outer beauty. it's great if you're attractive on the outside, but that doesn't determine who you are as an individual, your interests and hobbies, your personality, or how well you connect with other people. when you're in a relationship, in particular, that person is going to like you for your personality and your passions. physical beauty is superficial and temporary when it comes to interpersonal relationships.
  "
405215,"
   If you could be anyone in the world who would you be and why?
  ","
  you simply don't know what is going on in someone else's life unless you walk in their shoes. i wouldn't want to be anyone other than myself because i wouldn't know what someone else's life entails on a deeply personal level. even though i have my flaws and struggles and downfalls, i wouldn't want to take that risk.
  "
405216,"
   Can you share a useful tip for dating?
  ","
  just be yourself when going out on dates with new people. if you put up a fake persona, then your date is going to get the wrong impression of you. you shouldn't change your personality to appeal to the other person, because if they're the right person for you then they're going to like you for who you are.
  "
405217,"
   Which activities or hobbies make you lose track of time?
  ","
  playing video games -- at least, it used to. i haven't played video games in a really long time, i just don't have the drive or attention span anymore.
  "
405218,"
   Low esteem is when you think you're not good enough for something. High esteem is when you think something is not good enough for you. Agree or Disagree?
  ","
  i disagree to an extent. i think having high self esteem is a good thing, and it doesn't necessarily mean you believe things aren't good enough for you. having high self esteem means you know your worth and you don't want to settle for anything less than you deserve.
  "
405219,"
   What did you believe was true while growing up but found out you've been wrong all this time as an adult?

405222,"
   Do you often forget to do something despite several reminders?
  ","
  no, if i set a reminder for myself then i'm usually good at remembering what i need to do. in addition, if something is important enough then it almost never leaves the forefront of my mind until i'm done doing it.
  "
405223,"
   How quickly have you fallen in and out of love?
  ","
  i fell in love with my boyfriend after a few months of dating him. the quickest i ever fell out of love was almost immediately after i broke up with my ex-boyfriend when i was a teenager. he was just a scummy person and when i realized that, i broke up with him and moved on fairly quickly.
  "
405224,"
   Have you ever had a pregnancy scare?

405225,"
   What do you notice when you walk into someone's home for the first time?

   thoughts on people of double face?

  do you mean people who are two-faced or hypocritical?
  
  if so, then i think it's sad that they have to put on a fake persona in order to exist in the world. ideally, people should act like themselves and put forth their genuine selves on the outside. those who are two-faced are often hypocritical or trying to appease the masses by being something that they're not.

   Let's talk tattoos! How many do you have and what was your first one?
  ","
  i actually have seven tattoos & i'm planning on getting my eighth tattoo sometime during the winter months. my first tattoo was a yin yang -- i have each side of the yin yang on my shoulder blades, and i turned them into a bass clef symbol as well to represent the duality of music and how it balances me. i got it when i just turned 18 years old.
  "
405235,"
   Is it ever acceptable for a partner to tell you who you should or shouldn't be friends with? Why/Why not?
  ","
  i don't believe that's acceptable, no. your partner should not have the authority to dictate what you can and cannot do in your life, including which friends you choose to keep. in rare cases, such as in the case of having friends who are ab*sive or just bad people, i think it's fine for the couple to talk about why they don't want their partner to be friends with them, but overall if it's just the partner exhibiting controlling or manipulative behavior, i don't believe that's right at all.

   What are your thoughts on the phrase, ""legality does not equal morality"" in regards to the age of consent being 18? I've heard this argument being applied when it comes to ""barely legal"" teens being in relationships with significantly older adults which many still deem creepy or predatory in nature.
  ","
  i agree with ""legality does not equal morality."" just because a teenager is legal in terms of the age of consent, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's okay or healthy for a teenager to be in a relationship with someone who is significantly older than them. i also agree that the adults who are in the relationship are usually predatory in their intentions, because there's obviously a reason why they cannot find someone to date in their own age bracket. it's just suspicious and concerning.

405342,"
   But it's logical to see and understand the potential negative consequences of a situation in order to counter them with a particular strategy for success

  this is accurate. but there's a difference between logically looking at something and seeing all of the potential angles, and then expecting the worst out of situations (where often times you don't see positive aspects of the situation at all).
  "
405343,"
   Like, does your negative thinking give you some kind of positive payoff?
  ","
  lol, unfortunately it does not (that would be very convenient, though).
  "
405344,"
   Sure but why the tendency towards thinking the worst about situations especially when you are able to rationalize in your own mind that it may not be the case?
  ","
  it's just simply how some people are, it isn't a conscious choice to overthink situations. if that was the case, then most people certainly wouldn't purposely choose to think the worst of situations, lol. for myself personally, my anxiety disorder causes me to overthink and come to irrational conclusions. for others, it doesn't necessarily have to be a mental illness thing, it could just be part of who they are as a human being.
  "
405345,"
   What do you mean by the worst out of every situation and can you give an example?
  ","
  if someone is expecting the worst of a situation, that means that they expect every negative outcome to happen. for instance, if a person develops a cough and they have the tendency to expect the worst, they may actually convince themselves that they're sicker than they actually are, maybe with bronchitis or pneumonia, instead of just thinking it's an insignificant cold.
  "
405346,"
   Does your depression cause you to see the negative side of things mostly?
  ","
  no, depression mainly affects my actual mood and the way i view myself. if i'm looking at the negative aspect of other things, it's generally due to my anxiety and my anxiety's way of expecting the worst out of every situation.
  "
405347,"
   Is your depression stronger than your will for happiness and contentment?
  ","
  well, yeah. depression is a disorder and it isn't just a state of mind, so that will always override my own will to live if i'm in a wave of depression.
  "

  you're correct -- it isn't different from others in a general sense, but considering what we've gone through, it would most definitely tear some other people apart. that's just realistic.
  "
405423,"
   Have you experienced true love?
  ","
  yes, i'm currently in love with my boyfriend and i believe it to be true love. we've withstood significant struggle together that normally would tear some other relationships apart, but we've only grown stronger.
  "
405424,"
   Do you believe in star signs?

  somewhat, but i don't invest as much faith in them as some others. i find researching star signs and astrology in general to be very interesting, but i don't really believe in that sort of thing.

405425,"
   what is the place that makes you feel peaceful and happy  the most!
  ","
  my boyfriend's house. i feel at home there, at most peace with myself and my surroundings. there's no criticism or judgment there and i can be myself 100 percent.
  "
405426,"
   what do you do when everything is falling apart around you!
  ","
  uh, have massive panic attacks and breakdowns, stumble into a drunken stupor, and obliterate myself completely until i have enough sense to reorganize myself and try to build myself up again.
  "
405427,"
   Are you a very ambitious person?
  ","
  yes, i'm quite an ambitious person (when i'm not going through a depressive episode at least). i normally surpass whatever goals i set for myself.
  "
405428,"
   Are you superstitious at all?
  ","
  no, i'm not superstitious by any means. i find them to be interesting though, especially with respect to their historical contexts.
  "
405429,"
   Have you ever travelled first class
  ","
  no, i've only ever been on a flight four times (two to get down to austin, texas, and two to get back to new york). it happened within the same week, lol.
  "
405430,"
   Do you have any noise canceling headphones
  ","
  no, i don't own those.
  "
405431,"
   Which is the most beautiful place you've ever seen?
  ","
  upstate new york (catskill mountains).
  "
405432,"
   Where do your bad thoughts go when you're high?  Like maybe they are pushed further down inside your psyche and are gaining strength to lash out when you least expect it?
  ","
  lol, no. at least not for me personally. it may happen to other people, but personally speaking the thoughts are simply subdued because i'm living in the present moment. it has no bearing on their intensity after i've sobered up.
  "
405433,"
   Biggest regret
  ","
  the way i behaved towards certain people in my past, the harm i inflicted on them cannot be undone and i've already come to terms with the fact that i'm the villain in a lot of people's stories and will not be forgiven.
  "
405434,"
   Do you watch cartoons? What is your recent favorite one?
  ","
  the only cartoons i like are adult-oriented cartoons, like bob's burgers, bojack horseman, rick & morty (although i've only seen a few episodes), and big mouth.
  "
405435,"
   What's the point of living a life and doing good things when ultimately everything dies anyway and no one remembers?
  ","
  the act of doing a good deed isn't meant to be remembered eternally. you should be doing good deeds to help people in their current moments or for their future, for *them* to remember and feel thankful during the time that they're alive.
  "
405436,"
   Why are people averse to being alone with their thoughts?
  ","
  it can be for a variety of reasons, tbh. some people's thoughts scare them or they're toxic to their well being, especially in the case of mental illness.
  "
405437,"
   Do you like feeling fuzzy in your mind?
  ","
  no, i like remaining cognizant of my surroundings. i only get fuzzy-minded when i'm *too* high or *too* drunk.
  "
405438,"
   Can you describe the feeling of going from sober to getting high?
  ","
  it's different for everyone. for me personally, because of the strain i smoke, it happens gradually and my anxiety eases over time and i become quite content with my life and where i am in that present moment. my feeling of mindfulness increases and i'm valuing my time at that second as opposed to worrying about the future or dwelling on the past.
  "
405439,"
   Do you think being busy all the time is a way people distract themselves?
  ","
  yeah, definitely. when you're too busy doing things throughout the day, whether they're your chores or your work or whatever else, you don't have time to be alone with your thoughts.
  "
405440,"
   Do you like being high?
  ","
  i wouldn't smoke marijuana if i didn't like the feeling of being high, lol.
  "
405441,"
   What is the classic Newyorker stereotype?
  ","
  i think one of the biggest stereotypes that are actually true is that new yorkers are *always* in a rush. we don't stop to talk, we just do what we need to do and move on to the next thing we need to go. and if something is going slower than planned, you're going to have a lot of people complaining about it.
  "
405442,"
   Does your mind ever feel fuzzy?
  ","
  only when i'm high.
  "
405443,"
   Can you feel yourself getting older?
  ","
  sometimes, yes. for example, i can't stay up past like 1:00am anymore without feeling absolutely terrible the next day.
  "
405444,"
   Is there such a thing as a typical New Yorkian?
  ","
  lol, we're generally referred to as ""new yorkers,"" not ""new yorkians."" but yes, there are definitely stereotypes revolving around those who live in new york.
  "
405445,"
   Are you attracted to strong male bodies?
  ","
  lol, no. i'm not physically attracted to much of anything these days.
  "
405446,"
   Is it possible to stay friends with a person you have loved before?
  ","
  i think it varies depending on the individual. some people find it easier to revert back to a platonic relationship than others, and not every relationship is the same. there will always be some relationships that cannot exist outside of a romantic context for one reason or another, and instead of remaining friends, it's better for both people to remain separate.
  
  generally speaking though, it is definitely possible. i loved my best friend in a romantic context while we were dating as teenagers, and even after we broke up we remained close friends.
  "
405447,"
   Is it important for you to be remembered after you die?
  ","
  personally, i don't think it's very important. i believe it's more important to have a substantial impact on others in a positive light while you're still alive.
  "
405448,"
   What's more important for you,  to have a pretty good looking head or to have a good looking body?
  ","
  are you talking about someone's face versus someone's body? lol.
  
  in that case, i would probably go with face. i'm more attracted to people's faces than their bodies to begin with anyway, and the face expresses a lot more than someone's body does. however, i've never really put *too* much emphasis on someone's physical attraction and what i find attractive is varied depending on the individual.
  "
405449,"
   Are you eco friendly
  ","
  for the most part, yes. i recycle whenever i can and i use refillable bottles instead of plastic bottles.
  "
405450,"
   How many hours a day do you listen to music?
  ","
  i listen to music on the drive to work and on the drive home from work, so that equals out to roughly 2 hours per day. i also sometimes listen to music when i'm home for about an hour or so as well, but it isn't every day.
  "
405451,"
   Do you believe in miracles?
  ","
  no, not particularly. i just believe in chance and coincidences.
  "
405452,"
   Do you like America's anthem?
  ","
  it isn't something i particularly care about.
  "
405453,"
   Do you think you're often misunderstood?
  ","
  yeah, i feel like i'm misunderstood a lot when i try to discuss something that's on my mind. i can't express myself verbally very well, so often what comes out of my mouth isn't necessarily what i mean to say. in addition, some people find it hard to follow my thoughts because they're usually bouncing all over the place.
  "
405454,"
   Do you think you've had an easy life
  ","
  no, my life hasn't been very easy (however, there are obviously people out there whose lives are much harder than mine). i've always tried to make the most out of what's been given to me, though, and i've always persevered regardless of what i've endured.
  "
405455,"
   Do you hate your boss and your co workers
  ","
  if i hated my boss and my coworkers, then i wouldn't be at this job anymore, lol. i'm actually very close to my supervisor, and there are 2-3 coworkers whom i care about a lot.
  "
405456,"
   Do you have Embarrassing dreams and do you have a trick to stop them from happening?
  ","
  i don't have embarrassing dreams. lately i've been having nightmares more than anything else.
  "
405457,"
   do you like colourpop
  ","
  yes, i own a few colourpop products and i like them a lot. i have a decent number of their lippie stix and a few eye shadows.
  "
405458,"
   do you like milani brand
  ","
  i haven't tried their products since i was 20 years old, but i don't remember liking milani very much. their products were cheap, not pigmented at all, and didn't stay on very long.
  "
405459,"
   Are you okay?
  ","
  yes, i'm fine. i cried again 10 minutes ago too. :/
  
  long story short, my boyfriend has been raising two big tanks of fish for the past 2-3 years. he has no choice but to give them away now and his heart is hurting because those fish are his babies, and he needs to find them a good, reliable home. i cried because i feel so terrible and at a loss at what to do for him. i wish there was some way i could help, so i've been asking everyone i know to see if they know trustworthy people who can adopt fish. i haven't had any luck so far. :/
  "
405460,"
   Do your co-worker complain or make remarks about your hygiene?
  ","
  lol, no. i'm a hygienic person, so there's no reason for them to complain or make remarks.
  "
405461,"
   Do you feel any kind of antagonism towards someone nowadays?
  ","
  no, i don't usually feel that strongly towards a person (except for maybe two individuals in my life). if i don't like someone, then i don't involve them in my life at all.
  "
405462,"
   How was your day?
  ","
  my day was fine. i was training a new employee all afternoon, so that took up a majority of my time. i was extremely nervous to meet and train her, but she seems like a very intelligent, kind person. also, her writing is excellent which is a nice change from what i'm used to seeing when i have to train new employees, lol.

  ","
  honesty and communication. if i'm doing something wrong or i'm hurting others, i want my friends to be real with me and tell me what i'm doing. i don't want to befriend people who will sugarcoat the truth or put on a facade around me. i also value deep communication in that we can have stimulating conversations without judgment or fear.

   Was your diagnosis of BPD a slow process? Like taking a few sessions or did your doctor immediately diagnosed you with it?
  ","
  it took quite a few months, any sort of personality disorder isn't generally diagnosed right away (unless perhaps in a hospital setting, i've seen some people get diagnosed with BPD right after they've been admitted to the hospital).
  
  i was initially referred to a psychiatrist for treatment of depression and anxiety, which were diagnosed by my general physician, but after the course of many sessions she diagnosed me with BPD. there's a lot of trial and error involved in that sort of diagnosis, as well as methods of elimination. many personality disorders overlap in symptomology, so it takes a long time to really determine what the root diagnosis is.

   Thanks. He keeps being dismissive and vague whenever I ask for more detail about his future plans and it's pissing me off because I'm trying to be serious. He also said he makes perfectly enough and whether we're rich or poor shouldn't matter (I find that somewhat naïve) (1)
  ","
  (cont) ... I just don't have high hopes anything will change. Just starting off in my career, I'll be making a little over $60,000 a year and I don't want to be with someone who makes significantly less than that. Call me old fashioned but I'd like to be able to stay at home with my kids for a bit. And I don't like the idea of being the sole breadwinner of the family, I feel like a man should provide that stability, especially with him being older than me too.
  
  --
  
  he sounds like he has a lot of maturing to do, tbh. it's true that money *shouldn't* matter, but it ultimately *does* matter, especially when you're making less than a livable wage and cannot afford to move out of your parents' home. you're correct in that he says he makes enough to support you, but he cannot even support himself with $20k/year. that's lower than the poverty threshold.
  
  it sounds like you and this man simply don't match up in terms of career ambitions and overall life ambitions. you're also extremely young -- you will eventually find someone with whom you mesh completely, whose goals replicate yours and lifestyle complements yours too. just focus on your education rn, that's what is most important.

  (cont) ... better? Yes but I don’t know who I am without my depression and anxiety. I don’t feel like myself without my thoughts. She thinks I also might have personality disorder. But I am scared she won’t take me seriously if she sees that I have gotten better. I don’t know whether I’m just an attention seeking bitch or do I really just want to find comfort in my thoughts? I feel so out of control knowing I don’t have an actual personality.
  
  --
  
  lol, i feel this 100 percent unfortunately. it's such a drab feeling when we've lived with mental illness for so long that we literally don't know what to do with ourselves when we're on the road to recovery. we know we're getting better, but the concept is so foreign to us that we want to retreat back into our depression huts and sleep in our own sadness.
  
  you're not attention seeking for feeling this way (and attention seeking isn't necessarily a bad thing either). what you're feeling now is very common for people who are undergoing mental health treatment, actually. your psychiatrist should treat you well regardless of where you are in recovery, and they shouldn't discount your feelings simply because you're progressing toward better health. if you find your psychiatrist *is* treating you differently, then you need to find a new doctor.

   I've been seeing this guy for 4 months and he's 7 years older. I'm a college sophomore going to school for nursing. He makes like $20,000 a year at 27 living with his family and has basically no plans to go to school or get a decent job. He said he wants to save up to go to art school (1)
  ","
  (cont) ... which is expensive and not even a well paying field to begin with, and then ""make millions like davinci and live in Paris"". I couldn't believe how naive and ridiculous he sounded, but he was dead serious. Am I shallow or wrong for not wanting to continue our relationship? He and I have both discussed living on our own and having children. I'll be starting my career making decent money by age 23 or so, and I feel like the future with him is bleak rn. He told me he makes enough to make me happy and I'm like... You can't even support yourself. Lmao. It's really sad.
  
  --
  
  i don't think that's shallow, but i do understand both aspects of the scenario. on the one hand, you want someone who has the drive to better themselves and be able to fully support themselves, both emotionally and financially. especially if you throw in future plans, like building a future together, buying a home, and starting a family. if he has the ability to go out and get a decent job and live independently, he should ideally do just that.
  
  at the same time, however, money isn't *everything* even though it is a large part of who we are and how we define ourselves. there would hypothetically be nothing wrong with you working and him staying home and making commission off of his artwork, for example, as long as you both can afford to live that way and provide fully for your family.
  
  overall, i think it's something you have to talk about with him more deeply. he's not going to be the ""next davinci"" or whatever, and he has to understand that people still need to make a living in order to survive in this life. whether that's by him supporting you while you work and doing everything he can to make you comfortable, or by both of you contributing financially.

   If someone treats you differently after they find out you have an illness/disabilty that says a lot about their character. It's not as if people chose to have them - I'm p sure no one did. Lack of empathy disgusts me.
  ","
  lack of empathy & a lack of openmindedness -- even if you don't understand something, you should try to open your mind to learning new things and adapting to them instead of outright refusing to understand something because you're too proud or arrogant to admit that you were either wrong or don't know as much as you think you do.

  i don't have disabilities, but i do have mental illnesses and i've had people treat me differently after i confided in them that i had those illnesses due to their preconceived notions of what people with those illnesses are portrayed to behave.
  
  it used to bother me, but it doesn't make a difference to me anymore. if someone wants to be in my life, they should accept me for who i am. i'm not going to hide myself just because a person refuses to understand. i don't have room in my life for people who will judge others based on what something else has told them to think instead of experiencing it for themselves.

  LOL, the good ole ""snowflake"" defense. i haven't heard of people using that terminology in *such* a long time.
  
  nevertheless -- no, i don't believe you're too sensitive, depending on the context of the jokes at least. if the comments are flat out poking fun & bullying someone else's physical appearance, then i believe it's natural for you to be angry or upset (especially if it's about something a person cannot change).
  
  the only exception i can think about to that sort of thing is if the person is making fun of themselves for their physical appearance, or if someone is the butt of the joke in a group of friends but they're not bothered by the comments whatsoever. in those cases, then i don't really see the purpose in being emotionally invested or upset over the situation.

  i.e. if my boyfriend cheated on me, i would likely break up with him. we've progressed so far in our relationship and have been dating for so many years, it would be so detrimental to our relationship if one of us became unfaithful (and did everything else that comes with being unfaithful, i.e. lying and whatnot). it would signify that one of us is obviously not as invested in the relationship as the other, and that sort of one-sided relationship is unfair and unhealthy.

  i haven't been to the beach since last summer. which is surprising, considering i live 20 minutes away from the beach.

  definitely not. no matter what time i wake up, i always feel like i'm scrambling to get things done.
  "
405678,"
   Which quality in a partner do you dislike the most?
  ","
  arrogance. i could never be someone who was arrogant and also only thought about themselves.
  "
405679,"
   What kind of music calms you down?
  ","
  quiet indie music, like bon iver, the postal service, and iron & wine.

405681,"
   What is your goal for the next 24 hours?
  ","
  take a shower, lmao. i haven't showered in a few days, which is an indication that my mental health is getting worse, so i'm forcing myself to take one tonight because i know it'll make me feel better.

   Explain how being aware that we don't have total free will means that  we  obviously do have some free will I don't understand
  ","
  even if you believe your thoughts and experiences ""control"" you, you still have the free will to recognize that and put effort into not allowing those things to control you. it's part of the act of mindfulness, being cognizant of your thoughts, feelings and past experiences and leveraging those things in order to truly grasp control of your life in its entirety.
  "
405686,"
   Do you prefer to be behind the camera or in front of it?
  ","
  i much prefer to be behind the camera instead of in front of it. i feel uncomfortable with my appearance and i hate most photos taken of me, unless they're selfies.
  "

   What’s the worst physical pain you’ve ever been in?
  ","
  getting my ribcage tattooed, lol. it was white hot, searing pain that made me sweat all over and see stars.
  "
405688,"
   How quickly do you jump to conclusions about people?
  ","
  i try not to jump to conclusions about people in general. the truth is, you simply do not know someone because you haven't lived their life or experienced what they have experienced, so it would be ignorant to jump to a conclusion about a person without knowing every detail of their story.
  "
405689,"
   Do you trust people easily?
  ","
  no, i don't trust people easily at all. most people have to prove their loyalty (for lack of a better term) before i feel like i can trust them.
  "
405690,"
   What worries you the most about your country?
  ","
  honestly, the prevalence of mass shootings and overall gun violence. it appears that literally nowhere is safe and they could happen at any point in time without warning. it's terrifying.
  "
405691,"
   Do you believe that global peace is attainable?
  ","
  this may be pessimistic of me to say, but no. i don't believe global peace is attainable, especially in today's age. there are too many people in power who are ignorant to other people's opinions and controlled by corporate greed, where they believe their way is the ""right"" way and nothing else matters.
  "
405692,"
   What is the most important change that should be made to your country’s education system? ?
  ","
  i don't know if it's the *most* important, but i definitely think that more funding should be allocated to music and arts programs in school districts. in addition, there should be more comprehensive s*x education and mental health classes, particularly in junior high and high schools.
  "
405693,"
   It's not true though each person is controlled by their own brain and life experiences
  ","
  that isn't related to destiny or fate, though. in addition, you're not controlled fully by your thoughts or experiences if you're cognizant of their impact on your behavior and thought patterns. you have the ability to change your thought patterns and how you perceive and act upon situations.
  "
405694,"
   What always sounds like a good idea but never actually is?
  ","
  going out for a drink on a weeknight when i have work the following morning, ugh. it's appealing at first because most places are usually quiet on the weekdays (i hate going out on weekends), but then i feel absolutely horrid the next day.
  "
405695,"
   What do you think about vegetarians?
  ","
  i don't really hold an opinion about a group of people like that, lol. what i think about a person ultimately depends on their own individual behavior and opinions, not their diet or lifestyle choice.
  "
405696,"
   Has a last second unforeseen incident caused you to miss something you were looking forward to?
  ","
  yes, it's happened on numerous occasions. most recently, it happened today. my boyfriend and i had plans to see each other tonight when he gets out of work, but his best friend came into work clearly upset and needing to talk something through. my boyfriend asked if i wouldn't mind if he grabbed a beer with his best friend instead, so i told him to go be there for his friend.
  
  i was looking forward to seeing him, but his best friend is clearly in need and my boyfriend's time will be better spent by his side tonight.
  "
405697,"
   Do you believe in destiny, fate or free will?
  ","
  i believe in free will out of those three subjects. i think every person has their own ability of free will, and that destiny is just a romanticized notion so that people don't feel guilty about things not working out the way they think they would.
  "
405698,"
   What do you like to do on a rainy day?
  ","
  on rainy days, i enjoy sitting in my room with quiet music playing, a candle lit, and ambient lights dimmed. it's very peaceful to me, especially with the backdrop of the sound of rain hitting the house/street.
  "
405699,"
   How much do you think heartbreak  changes a person? for better or worse.
  ","
  i don't believe you can really quantify something of that nature because everyone experiences love differently, including the depth of that love to begin with, so it's difficult to determine how *much* it can change a person. some people may be changed mildly, while others more intensely.
  "
405700,"
   Do you believe evil should be shown mercy???
  ","
  i don't believe in good v. evil, so i don't really have an opinion on the matter. if someone is a terrible person, though, and has committed atrocities like mass m*rder or r*pe, i don't believe they should be shown any mercy whatsoever.
  "
405701,"
   Do you believe that there is any truth in the saying, ""we never forget our first loves""?
  ","
  yes, i believe there's truth in that statement. our first love sets a foundation for how we view love, whether we're conscious of it or not. we're either comparing our subsequent loves to that love or we sometimes even feel as if our first love was ""the one that got away.""
  "
405702,"
   Do you feel like you get the credit you deserve?
  ","
  most of the time, no. however, my job has been doing a great job at affirming my worth and establishing credit in my name for all of the hard work i've been putting into my projects. it's a nice change from what i'm used to regarding jobs, as all of the jobs i've had in the past took advantage of their workers and never gave positive reinforcement.
  "
405703,"
   When was the last time you allowed yourself to truly relax and just live in the moment?
  ","
  last sunday, actually. after my friend and i completed the real estate application, we went out to lunch together and ordered delicious food and drinks. i felt like i was truly relaxed and living in the moment because we had just completed a monumental step in the renting process, and we deserved to have a good time afterwards.
  "

  "
405711,"
   What is your biggest addiction?
  ","
  nicotine is my biggest addiction/dilemma at the moment. i do desperately need to cut down on smoking, not only for my own health but also because of how much money i'm laying out on cigarettes each week. i would save a lot of money by quitting smoking.
  "
405712,"
   When, if ever, was the last time you went on a date and was it some place nice?? ??
  ","
  my boyfriend and i went on a date to a restaurant a month or so ago. we hardly have the time to go on legitimate dates these days because our schedules conflict so much, so it was really nice to be able to go out and indulge on good food and drinks together.
  "
405713,"
   ""Women age like milk, men age like wine."" Do you agree with this? Are older men more valuable when dating than older women?
  ","
  i don't believe you can make a general, blanket statement like that regarding an entire demographic of people because it's inaccurate. someone's worth or value isn't determined by their physical looks, either.
  "
405714,"
   Pro and cons of where you live
  ","
  pros ;
  
  -- there are always things to do, whether in town or on the beach. most places don't close until super late, especially during the summer. you're extremely close to both manhattan and wine country.
  
  cons ;
  
  -- everything is super expensive. the cost of living is too high for most people to deal with, and as a result, most people end up moving to other states.
  "
405715,"
   What teacher in school made the most impact on you and why?
  ","
  my forensics teacher during high school had the most substantial impact on me. he was the most ""real"" teacher i had during those years, and he confessed his shady past and ability to persevere and overcome his personal demons in order to get to where he is today. i've always had a lot of respect for him, and i even contacted him later while i was in college when i had a personal problem that i couldn't solve on my own.
  "
405716,"
   Do you enjoy spooky stories? Be it campfire ghost stories, creepy pastas, or conspiracy theories.

405718,"
   Have you ever had a 'paranormal' experience?

  i told my coworker that i was nervous about my new position at work and told her what it entailed (i have to have my photo taken and write an editor's letter for the publication i'm in charge of). she got *so* happy for me and reaffirmed my value, and it made me smile knowing that someone believes in me like that.
  "
405722,"
   Is cheating justified if the woman in the relationship has a low s.ex drive therefore her husband is unsatisfied, but still is not willing to get a divorce solely due to that?
  ","
  no, cheating is almost never justified unless someone is in a dangerous or ab*sive situation, and the only way for them to escape their partner is by being intimate with someone else (it normally goes much deeper than that, though).
  
  if your partner has a low libido and you're not satisfied with them on a s*xual level, then you need to talk to them one-on-one about how to treat the problem or overcome it in different ways. if it's something that you two cannot agree on, then the best thing to do is break up. cheating plays no role in this situation.

  "
405725,"
   Do guys like short girls or not?
  ","
  i was under the impression that there's a stereotype regarding men and their ""preference"" for shorter women. shorter women are generally seen as cute, quaint, and petite. taller women, on the other hand, are seen as ""intimidating"" for some reason.

  aw, thank you. :'))
  "
405745,"
   What's wrong with having a big ego?

  when you have a big ego, it means you have an inflated sense of self importance and have little regard for those around you -- primarily because you believe *your* feelings are much more important than those of others.

405755,"
   Who's stealing your questions?
  ","
  i haven't asked questions in quite a long time.
  "
405756,"
   In general, let's say someone you really love wanted to break up to have time to fix their mental health and focus on their life because they felt they had an unhealthy mindset that was unfair in the relationship. Would you just move on if they weren't ready to be with you or wait/keep trying?
  ","
  this isn't something i can give a general answer to because it ultimately depends on the relationship. for example, some people may find it better to move on entirely while others may benefit from waiting for their partner (well, ex).
  
  it's something you have to sit down with your partner and discuss beforehand so that you're both on the same page.

  no need to be sorry, that wasn't what i was implying by any means. a ""lack of"" something simply means they don't have something, it's just my verbiage.

  i don't believe you need dysphoria to be trans, no. most people who *are* trans do have dysphoria, though, for various reasons that are personal to them. you definitely do not need to have surgery in order to be valid as trans, either.
  
  personally speaking, i have moderate dysphoria, especially when it comes to my chest. when i lose more weight and have less of a tummy, i want to buy another binder that fits me better. the one i have now is way too small.

  ","
  hate is a very strong word -- if someone *hates* children, then i would assume that they feel quite strongly about the mere presence of children, regardless of who that child is. i think it's fairly unreasonable because you haven't gotten to know that child at all and not every child is the same.
  
  however, i do understand feeling weird about children because you don't know how to communicate or relate to them. that's very much the boat i'm always in.

   what do you think about aromantic/asexual people being excluded from the lgbt+ community?
  ","
  i've always been indecisive on this issue because i've heard viewpoints from both perspectives and see valid points from each. however, i think i more agree with the viewpoint that aromantic/asexual people aren't necessarily part of the lgbtq+ community.
  
  being aromantic/asexual means you simply do not feel attraction toward other people, whether romantically or sexually. it wouldn't really fall on the lgbtq+ scale because it's a lack of attraction, not an attraction that differs from the ""norm."" however, i do also believe that there is discrimination and misunderstanding of people who are aromantic/asexual because it's something that hasn't been studied or discussed often.

  personally, i like knowing a few days in advance about plans. however, most of my plans are rather spontaneous, i.e. determined within a few hours of the plan happening rather than days or weeks.
  
  sometimes i don't know if i'm up to doing something until the day it's happening, which is why i'm so spontaneous with making plans with friends. i'll usually ask people if they're available the same day or night, and if they are, then we'll plan something then. if not, it isn't a big deal to me.

  yes, i have. i've been jealous of friends for reaching more milestones in their lives prior to me reaching the same milestones. things like graduating from college on time, attending graduate school, getting engaged or married, buying a house, having children, getting promotions at work, etc etc.
  
  eventually, i realized that jealousy is a useless and harmful emotion and that everyone goes through life at their own pace. instead of feeling jealous of my friends, i taught myself to be genuinely happy for them because of their achievements. just because they achieved something doesn't mean that my achievements thus far are worthless.

  the worst thing about traveling is other people who may make the experience terrible, haha. i also hate how much it costs to travel these days -- even going to upstate new york, it accrued a lot of money just in fees and tolls, and i didn't even leave the state.

  even if i did help my boyfriend financially, it wouldn't make his bills suddenly disappear. he will still have to pay for them next month, and then the month after that, etc etc.
  
  when you're in a relationship, you support each other through difficult times. if he was in a severe bind and needed money (and also asked me for it), then i would have no issue helping him financially, if it's something i could afford as well. this isn't the case right now, though.

  besides, there are more ways to help someone other than giving them financial assistance. just because i don't have the money to lend to him doesn't mean i don't help him in other ways.

  honestly, i normally don't say ""hi"" to my friends at the beginning of the conversation. i just jump right into what i want to tell them, lol.

   Is it worse to be insensitive or to pretend to care?
  ","
  i believe it's worse to pretend to care about something that you genuinely don't care about. in my own personal experience, it's incredibly easy to distinguish when someone honestly doesn't give a sh*t about something and are just pretending to care about it, which makes the situation that much more aggravating.

  (cont) ... and the thing is.. i don't even like white guys?? so I feel like I'll never find love again that was unconditional and so patient and kind like his and also be able to get what I ultimately want. i just hate it so much. i sound nuts and idk what to do, I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't. :(
  
  --
  
  it's ultimately your decision then. perhaps you're simply young and things like this mature as you mature yourself, and eventually you will grow out of these feelings because they'll seem meaningless to you over time.
  
  however, i can only venture a guess. i don't know you or your ex or anyone in between, but i do know that things always feel much more extreme right after a breakup than any other time. you may just need to give yourself room to breathe.

   hey so a while back i told you abt me having anxiety abt having children with my bf bc they won't look white enough or have the features i want and well,, i tried so hard to fight it but i ended up breaking up with him after discussing it and it not going away and haunting me (1)
  ","
  (cont) ... and basically now for weeks it's been me being ok and then him texting & calling me & begging me to get back together then me realizing im in love with him but also realizing i cannot force myself to go back knowing ill have SO much anxiety & then also kicking myself in the behind for losing someone I love over something so dumb but I literally can't bring myself to go back to him. it'll be the same thing all over again & I'll feel horrible but I still love him & he texts me daily and makes it so hard for me to move on. I've been trying to focus on my life and improving my mental health and everything and this is such a big distraction idk what to do :( I'm so torn and it makes me wanna commit su**cide. Please give any advice you can or input thanks :(
  
  --
  
  if you don't want to get back together with him (regardless of your reasoning), he needs to know that. texting you daily and begging you to get back together with him when he knows you two broke up is terrible, and he *needs* to learn those boundaries. it doesn't matter if he still loves you or not -- if he loves and respects you that much, then he has to respect the fact that you don't want to date him anymore. he has to do what's in your best interest & his best interest.
  
  you'll find someone you can be 100% comfortable around, to the point where you won't even question race or ethnicity because you're so deeply and utterly in love with them. this boyfriend might not be that guy for you at the moment, and that's perfectly okay.
  
  you need to fully commit yourself to yourself and your health, your mental health is your number one priority rn. i suggest you talk to your ex about him being overbearing/clingy so that you don't have that guilt hanging over you, and then you can work on yourself and moving forward.

   Thank you for this reply! Actually I have spoken to her about this before, but it was more like “I feel like I don’t mean to you as much as you mean to me” but I just threw it in as I was talking to her about my depression and anxiety. Well and she was a little speechless. She was like “ehh, uhh”
  ","
  (cont) ... etc a lot and it just made me even more paranoid than ever. I am quite positive now she’s tired of my bullsh*t but is just being nice about it. Well I didn’t feel better after that honestly but she tells me she will be there no matter what and I honestly don’t believe her that much. And it doesn’t help when I go online and search friends and depression together and a lot of people is saying maybe they are just being nice and don’t want to here too much stuff about negative stuff. Well I’m naturally negative because I have MDD and anxiety but now I don’t even talk to her much about it anymore. We just talk a lot about her problems now which I’m okay with, but she doesn’t even ask me “how are you doing” when we met. Just once sentence and it would have made me better but now I’m in this endless loop of thinking everyone is out to get me. It sucks. Just wanted to rant honestly.
  
  --
  
  no worries, ranting is very healthy & it's good to get all of this out of your system. i 100% feel this hardcore, though ... like, to basically all of my friends. i feel like i'm always there for them, but then i feel guilty if i were to ever bring myself up, and they don't question it either, which makes me feel really forgotten & helpless. idk.
  
  you're right, it is an endless cycle. we want friends that care for us, but we're afraid to ask them to care more for us if we're feeling neglected because we don't want to lose them entirely, and then the cycle repeats over and over. then we become afraid that they're just putting up with us because they feel bad for us or pity us, and that makes it 100x worse. ugh.

  that's something only you can decide -- i can't make that determination for you, considering i don't know you or your father or your father's relationship with this woman.
  
  you should try to have a conversation with him about this first, though, if you haven't already. express that you're his child and although you two endured hardship after your mother passed away, he's still your father and you still want him to be present in your life. explain that he says he wants to have a close relationship, but his actions speak otherwise. however, when you do talk to him, try not to get accusatory or else he might respond negatively to it. try to keep an open mind, and maybe he will as well.

And I’m not sure whether I can even bring this up to her lol I know she will probably be like “wtf???” Or get mad a little even if she says she won’t since it seems like I don’t trust her. Well I don’t fully trust anyone to begin with even her tbh since i have been through a lot. But please help.
  
  --
  
  honestly, i'm going through the same exact thing right now. one of the things that truly suck about having mental illness and anxiety is that we always question the validity of our interpersonal relationships, especially when one thing happens that sorta sets it off (like your friend not asking how you are).
  
  i understand it completely, and like i said, i'm going through the same thing with a friend of mine as well. i never brought it up to her because of your same worries -- i don't want her to think i'm being ungrateful, or that i don't trust her, etc etc. it's such a weird and awkward situation to be in because we don't want to make the situation worse since *we* care about the friendship so much.
  
  unfortunately, i don't have much advice to give other than advising you to try to talk to your friend about these feelings, but in a discrete and kind way so that she doesn't think that you're questioning the friendship itself (if that makes sense?). maybe ask an open-ended question like, ""hey i know this may be forward, but what do you think of our friendship? is there anything i could be doing better as your friend?""
  
  that might open up a conversation to get you two on a better page. but take my advice with a grain of salt -- i don't know you or your friend, so naturally i don't know how she would react to such a conversation.

   not to mention, because healthcare is privatized thanks to republicans, it's treated more like a business and is extremely corrupt, hence big pharma. people should not profit off of people getting sick and dying. the fact that this is even still a debate blows my mind.

  i 100% agree with you on this. insulin for diabetics is a prime example of this. my boyfriend was on novalog for *years* because it was the type of insulin that helped him the most, and suddenly his insurance company decided not to cover it anymore and forced him to take humalog instead, which has not been ideal for his diabetes. it's too fast-acting.

   a couple years ago i was driving and witnessed a man on a motorcycle get hit by a car. he survived, thankfully, but the first thing he said was ""i can't afford the ambulance"" which was sickening to think about. people should not be penalized for being sick or needing care. it's a human right imo.
  ","
  ugh, that's terrible but unfortunately *so* common. an ambulance is an extra $3000 (i think?) tacked onto whatever medical bills you accrue while you're at the hospital, which is so ridiculous. even new mothers who have just given birth have medical bills, and it's also so outrageous how they have to pay extra to have skin-to-skin contact with their baby after birth, which is so important in the beginning stages.
  
  i agree with you that health care is a human right, it's necessary to our survival. even myself personally, i pay so much money for not only my own health insurance, but also for my psychiatry visits, therapy sessions, and medication, all of which contribute to my mental health and overall my survival. and i'm lucky that i found facilities that accept me because so often insurance companies don't even cover behavioral health care.

  i'm not too well versed on the specifics of free health care, like what exists in other countries, but health care in the united states should definitely be much more affordable. it's ridiculous how much money a person pays into not only health insurance but also doctor visits, ER visits, and hospital stays despite the fact that they do have health insurance.
  
  it's a backwards system, because a lot of people end up going into massive debt from expensive medical bills, which further deters them from seeking out more medical care.

  i've taken the 16 personalities test quite a few times, and i always get the result of INFJ, also known as ""the advocate."" i find it's fairly accurate to me personally, but i don't know if it's accurate for other people.
  
  either way, i don't really take personality tests like those seriously because they're just out of fun to perhaps find out more about yourself. i'm also sure that people can be a combination of many of those 16 personalities.

   What is the most important thing in a relationship?
  ","
  communication, and perhaps more importantly, comprehension. if there's no comprehension in a relationship when you *do* communication, then what you're communicating will fall on deaf ears.
  
  relationships work off of a foundation of trust and communication, and you will not be able to clearly know each other's intentions or where they stand without talking to them without fear or judgment.

  ","
  that's entirely up to the person, and it goes on a case-by-case basis. some people may feel closure by forgiving those who wronged them, while other people have no intentions of forgiving their enemies or ab*sers, etc etc. there's also nothing wrong with choosing not to forgive someone, no one is obligated to forgive someone else if they wronged them, as long as the person has their own safety and wellbeing in mind.

406096,"
   Yes, that's precisely what I was thinking. It sounds ludacris, and even if a girl was flirting with him, I doubt she would be that overt about it. And who asks a random jogger if they wanna hang out tonight? The setting doesn't even make sense lmao. Tbh he's not even THAT stunning anyway.. (1)
  ","
  (cont) ... I asked him if he made it up and if he did to accomplish what exactly and he says I have no reason to lie & it happens often, well not often but when I go jogging.. so I pretty much told him what I told you but just longer and he said I'm glad you're doing that for yourself & don't force yourself. But I still feel the need to distance myself from him bc idk, I'm just super annoyed with him. I experience emotions stronger than most ppl too so perhaps it bothers me a little more than it should.
  
  --
  
  your feelings are totally valid, and honestly i would feel the same way re: cutting him off or distancing yourself from him. however, i also feel emotions more strongly than most people too, lmaoo.
  
  even if it *was* true when he's telling you, then i don't see the purpose of him even telling you those things unless he wanted to show you that he's a loyal boyfriend. it would be perfectly acceptable for those things to happen since you are on a break, but i see no reason why he should tell you this unless he had an ulterior motive.
  "
406097,"
   should I report him to the police? im afraid he'll hurt me
  ","
  that's entirely up to you. if you're afraid for your safety, then try talking to friends or family to get their support. if you live with him, find out if there are shelters for victims of ab*se or stay with someone you know so that you're in a safe place in order to leave him. your safety is the priority here.
  
  i also just want to tell you to keep in mind that most cases of r*pe don't work out in favor of the victim, unfortunately, in terms of legal things. it's unfortunate and so wrong but it's the truth. it may turn out worse for you unless you have physical proof of the incidents. either way take care of yourself. i'm always here for you.

  it doesn't matter if he's your boyfriend or not, it's still r*pe and it's utterly wrong. you deserve better than that, i hope you understand this. especially if it's affecting your mental health and self-esteem. i'm so sorry you're going through this.

   how i want to know if someone really really love me or not?. because i'm always like being ignored when ""he"" comes to me.

  honestly, the best way to figure out if someone is interested in you is to simply ask them and be honest about your feelings. sit them down and tell them how you feel, and then inquire about whether or not they reciprocate those feelings. if they don't, then at least you have that closure and can move on from them to pursue something/someone else.

   My bf & I are on a break for certain much needed reasons (let's just say to work on my mental health) & it's been difficult for him to accept so I've been handling it as delicately as possible & reassuring him but I feel pressured by him to jump back into things straight away when I'm not ready (1)
  ","
  (cont) ... It's been going on for a while & it's only draining me & making things worse. I told him we may end up together again, we may not. So the other night he sends me a text saying while he was out jogging, he supposedly encountered a woman who told him he was ""hot af"" & asked if he wanted to hang out. To which he replied he has a gf at home (we don't even live together) and she said oh she won't mind. And he goes yes she will, I love her & things aren't well rn but I'm only for her. And the girl says omg I wish I had a man like you you're an angel, see you around. The story sounds like bs to me.. What do you think? I feel like he made it up in another attempt to manipulate me into jumping back into his arms again in awe, even though he said it apparently happens everytime he goes out jogging & he's shared a story with me like that before. So yeah, I was angry & jealous so but I'm also questioning the validity of the story so it backfired on him. Now I just wanna cut him off tbh. I'm just annoyed with him but I'm worried I might miss him down the line. What do you think I should do? Thx sorry this was so long! Appreciate it
  
  --
  
  no worries about the story being long !! it helps me understand things more clearly. i just want to preface this by saying i don't know your boyfriend, so i don't know his personality or if he's the type of person to fabricate stories like that. however, upon reading this for the first time, it *did* sound to me like he made that jogging story up to sorta ""prove"" to you that he's a good, loyal boyfriend. i can't exactly imagine a woman randomly stopping her run to tell a stranger that he's attractive. most people i know take their exercising seriously and don't want anything to do with other people when they're jogging in public.
  
  however, i understand you feeling annoyed by this because i would most definitely feel the same way if i was in your circumstance. depending on how close you two currently are, would it be appropriate you think for you to ""call him out"" on his behavior? basically saying, ""did you make up that story in an attempt to prove your loyalty and win me back?"" depending on the person, it may not be a good idea but it's just ... something to think about.
  
  either way, there needs to be communication between you two. i know you said that you told him that you two might not get back together, which is good, but it doesn't seem like he really understands that. if you haven't tried already, perhaps try talking to him about these things again and if he tries pulling the same sh*t then maybe think about leaving. nobody should try to guilt you back into a relationship, that's wrong and manipulative.

  ","

  "
406202,"
   if you were to write a book what would it be about?
  ","
  i already have an idea for a book, so i'm not going to specifically say the plot or what the characters are like. however, it's going to have general themes of life & death with biblical undertones, as well as addiction, mental illness, underground crime rings, social inequality, and violence.

  i don't believe i'm really worth knowing. i'm not a terribly interesting person, i'm quite boring in terms of my professional and social lives, and i'm just an average adult in their mid-to-late 20s who's just trying to get by.
  "
406252,"
   How do you treat people who can do nothing for you? ?

  it's funny you ask this, because last night i was looking up different bed frames, desks, and closet organizers for when i move into an apartment, lmaoo.
  
  i would definitely need new furniture because what i have is pretty old and some things are broken. i would like everything to be the same color palette because right now they're a combination of black and white, and it bothers me.

406273,"
   In recent years more & more people have become aware of intersxx & trans people existing. Hence the term ""pansxxual"" being used more by younger generations and ""bisxxual"" used more by older gens. I'm pan but I don't see bi as excluding either intersxx or trans folk but some do. What's your opinion?
  ","
  i believe that everyone ultimately has their own definition of what bisexual entails, solely due to the ""controversy"" revolving around the difference between bi and pan. it depends on what a person is really most comfortable identifying as, in my opinion.
  
  i believe personally that bisexual means you like two of more genders, but not all (whereas, pan means all genders). i personally identify as bi because i don't believe i'm attracted to all genders, and it feels most comfortable to me. i'm also of a somewhat older generation as well, though.
  "
406274,"
   WHAT WAS THE LAST THING THAT MADE YOU HAPPY
  ","
  my good friend texted me a link to an apartment available for rent, and it meets all of our criteria of what we're looking for. he just put in an application for the apartment and included my email address as a reference, since i'll be moving in with him, so hopefully we hear back !!
  
  it isn't terrible at all, and it's within an amount i believe i can afford on a monthly basis. we just don't know if utilities are included in the price, so we're going to have to find that out before ultimately making a decision.
  "
406275,"
   In what ways do you push your body's limits?
  ","
  exercising is perhaps the only way i push my body's limits, haha. i've been trying to push myself harder on the treadmill every week or so, which has been increasing my stamina greatly. the only thing i dislike is that it makes me feel so sore the following day.
  "
406276,"
   How do you spend the majority of your free time?
  ","
  i don't really have much free time, unfortunately. i normally try to catch up on social media, but i also like to see my friends and my boyfriend as often as i can.

   How’s your weekend been? Anything you’re looking forward to this coming week? ✨
  ","
  my weekend was fine. saturday wasn't so great, but sunday was a lot of fun -- my best friend's husband had a birthday party on sunday, so i went to the house early in order to help them set up for when people came over later. it was fun to just sit, relax and drink while talking to people whom i haven't seen in quite a while.
  
  after everyone left, i helped my best friend clean up and then i was home by like 9:30pm.

   What do you think about Franklin Roosevelt?
  ","
  i don't have an opinion on him. i don't know anything about him.
  "
406279,"
   What is your opinion about same gender relationships?
  ","
  considering i'm part of the lgbtq+ community, i'm 100 percent in support of gay relationships and marriage. there's no reason why a person should not be allowed to date or marry someone who's the same sex or gender as them -- thinking that being gay is ""wrong"" is an archaic form of thinking that has no place in 2019.
  "

  "
406282,"
   Is it contradictory that a vegan wouldn't eat an egg but would be in favour of abortion?
  ","
  uh, no? abortion has nothing to do with veganism. abortion is all about the right to choose what occurs within someone's own body (bodily autonomy). veganism, on the other hand, is a lifestyle choice revolving around the desire to help the planet and animals by not consuming or using products that are animal-derived.
  "
406283,"
   What do you do to comfort yourself whenever your sad or upset?? ???
  ","
  i normally vent to my friends and/or boyfriend about what's upsetting me, just so i can get their opinion and they can comfort me or rationalize my feelings. sometimes they validate what i'm feeling so that i feel less alone with my thoughts.
  
  i also have a few unhealthy coping mechanisms, but talking to people is perhaps my healthiest.
  "
406284,"
   Some people wear shoes that are too tight in order for the pain and uncomfortability to distract them from their thoughts, worries, concerns etc. What's your opinion on this? Do you think it's smart or ridiculous? Would you ever do this?
  ","
  that honestly sounds extremely unhealthy. using pain as a coping mechanism isn't good and can lead to further unhealthy coping mechanisms in the long run as well. it could possibly develop into self-injurious behavior because after a while, the initial pain won't be enough and the person will crave more.
  "
406285,"
   How are you?
  ","
  i'm doing fine, just exhausted from a long day at work and intensive therapy session. i'm debating on either staying up and continuing orange is the new black, or going to bed super early.

   How many times can a guy ask a girl out before it is considered harassment?
  ","
  if the man doesn't take ""no"" for an answer after the first time the woman says ""no,"" then i would consider that to be harassing. it's disgusting how some people won't accept no for an answer and think that by ""trying harder"" they can somehow win a person over. if someone says no to you the first time, then accept it for what it is and move on.

   How’s the health system in America?
  ","
  i can't compare it to any other country's health system because i don't know much about them, but i personally think the american health care system is flawed. a lot of people cannot afford to see doctors or buy medication, especially if they're of a low class status, which only exacerbates their conditions and puts them in greater debt when something terrible happens to their health. it's a backwards system.
  
  that's assuming insurance covers things, as well. insurance can choose not to cover something if they don't feel it's necessary, and most of the time they only cover a quarter of the actual cost.

  i loved my first girlfriend, despite the fact that we were young, and i was heartbroken when we broke up. it took me a while to get over her, and we didn't speak for two to three years. eventually, i became interested in other people and that helped me overcome those feelings because it taught me that she wasn't the only person for me in my life.

  honestly, i don't remember. lmaoo. i suppose it was within the first year, though. i was infatuated with him from the very beginning, but after enduring significant hardship together, we became much closer and i realized i was in love with him.
  "
406355,"
   I wish i was as brave as you to go through all those different hairstyles :) And i wish i had a stylist as good as yours haha
  ","
  i never really thought of it as a matter of bravery. it's just something i enjoy doing because i always hated having regular, brown-colored hair. i've been coloring my hair since i was 12 years old.
  "
406356,"
   I mean men in their 30s and beyond dating girls under 21 (but over 17).

  "
406357,"
   Do you think those older men are predators?
  ","
  depends on how old they are and how young the women they're dating are. if they're a child, then obviously they're a predator.
  "
406358,"
   That seems like a nice idea haha. You must have a really good stylist btw...
  ","
  yes, i do !! her work is amazing, she's the one who also colored my hair pink, purple, and blue within the past year.
  "
406359,"
   High heels or tall boots. Which do you prefer for winter?
  ","
  i prefer wearing knee-high boots in the winter. i don't even own high heels because i can't walk in them and they're uncomfortable.
  "
406360,"
   But why do you think? It creeps me out
  ","
  perhaps because older men are likely more mature with their lives put more together. most women, from my understanding, aren't interested in younger men because they have a tendency to be immature and aren't ready to settle down.
  "
406361,"
   Even if it's a little orange, it looks great. Are you going to let your hair grow a lot? Or will you cut it short again?
  ","
  my original intention was orange, so it's all good. i'm in the process of growing my hair out, but keeping the sides shaved.
  "
406362,"
   I love your hair. Red looks great on you
  ","
  thank you !! it's actually more orange at this point, the red has been washing out quickly.

  ","
  my boyfriend and i once went on a date to a park on the north shore of long island. it's a long hiking trail that goes through various fields, woods, and eventually leads up to bluffs and a beautiful beach. we spent the day there, and it was absolutely gorgeous.

406365,"
   A topic that you would like a novel to disscuss:
  ","
  i like books with darker themes, particularly revolving around crime, addiction, and death. my ideal book would be one that discusses the importance of mental health within its characters and deals with subject matters such as drug or alcohol addiction, mental illness, the importance of platonic and romantic relationships, underground crime rings, and vengeance.
  "
406366,"
   What would you most like to do if money were no object?

406368,"
   Swimming pool, river, lake, sea, ocean - where do you prefer to swim?
  ","
  i don't go swimming and don't particularly like it, but if i had to choose between those options, i would likely choose a lake. the ocean is too chaotic for me, and i would be afraid to get pulled out to sea. i've never liked swimming pools and rivers aren't deep enough for me, lol.
  "
406369,"
   Are you for or against the idea of getting revenge on someone who has wronged you?
  ","
  these days, i'm against the notion of seeking revenge. holding onto those kinds of negative emotions hurts you more than anyone else, and it's healthier to try to accept what happened, move on with your life, and try to make the best out of the bad situations.
  
  when i was younger, i was completely all for seeking revenge, but that was during a time when i had a lot of anger within me towards basically everyone and lashed out often. i didn't realize until later on that it was unhealthy for my mental health.
  "
406370,"
   What is one thing you used to fear that you aren't afraid of anymore?
  ","
  when i was younger, even as a teenager, i was afraid of the dark. i always thought something was haunting me and would attack me in my sleep, and my imagination would go wild. i always needed some form of light in my bedroom at night.
  
  these days, i love sleeping in absolute darkness and the darkness doesn't frighten me anymore.

  -- lately, i've learned that the only person you can genuinely rely on is yourself. if you need to do something, you have to do it yourself otherwise it will never get done, especially done the way you would like it to be done. most people are unreliable.
  
  -- since music is considered a form of art, i've been listening to a lot of video game soundtracks lately and came to the conclusion that my favorite video game soundtrack is from halo 2.

  ","
  ugh, that sounds aggravating. honestly though -- you can't take those kinds of opinions into consideration, especially since everyone has a different idea of what ""attractive"" is. if you think he's average-looking and not ugly, and you're also incredibly attracted to his personality, then *your* opinion is the only opinion that truly matters. everyone else in your life is going to have to simply accept that. ideally, they should have your happiness in mind.
  "
406381,"
   do u think looks are important in a relationship or personality matters more
  ","
  looks are somewhat important because that determines your *physical* chemistry with one another -- however, what it ultimately comes down to is the meshing of your personalities. if you're dating someone based solely on their appearance and you don't have mental chemistry between you, then the relationship is going to be shallow and short-lived.
  
  relationships work best when there's communication, understanding, the existence of similar interests or goals, and support/encouragement. all of these things tie into people's personalities.

   Do you think you can be with someone who has never fully gotten over their ex and will probably never?
  ","
  personally speaking, no. i don't believe i would be able to be in a relationship with someone who isn't fully over their ex. when someone isn't over their ex and is dating someone new, they're likely going to compare their new relationship with their old one, instead of judging their current relationship as it is.
  
  it isn't fair to either person involved, and when you're still emotionally attached to an ex, you're not allowing yourself to put yourself fully into your new relationship. there's going to always be a part of you held back, questioning the validity of the relationship. it might not even be a healthy relationship after a while.

  nothing is 100 percent certain, so no. however, it's also unhealthy to focus on the future like that in terms of relationships as well. if you're with someone and all you can think about is that one day you'll eventually break up, you won't allow yourself room to enjoy the present day with that person.
  "
406433,"
   I need your input, I recently broke up with my bf. He still loves me but I don’t. Is it ok to buy him or wish him a happy birthday?
  ","
  i don't know the nature of your relationship with him, but if there's an imbalance there (i.e. he still loves you but you don't return the feelings), going so far as to buy him a gift may give off the wrong impression. you don't want to do something that might suggest that you two are still an item, or give him false hope.
  
  however, you can care for someone while acknowledging that the relationship didn't work. you just have to be clear with him that you don't have any intention of dating him again, but you still wish him well.
  "
406434,"
   Why? They aren’t inappropriate if they are just questions
  ","
  just because something is a question doesn't automatically mean it isn't inappropriate, lmaoo.
  
  questions can most definitely be inappropriate or intrusive. especially if someone is asking anonymously, it means that they're ashamed to show their face while asking that question since they wouldn't want people to know who they are otherwise. that's an indication that what they're asking is borderline inappropriate.
  "
406435,"
   Do you ever worry your SO will find someone better? Someone nicer, funnier, more loving, someone more better looking? Someone who will appreciate them more?
  ","
  no -- if that were to happen, it would have happened already. the few times a person would find someone who's ""better"" than their current partner would be if they're already unhappy in the relationship. if they were happy in the relationship, they simply wouldn't view other people in a dating context like that.
  
  you also have to keep in mind that relationships are built off of a foundation of trust. you have to trust that your partner won't run off with someone else, and if that's something you actively fear, it may be an indication that you don't trust your partner as much as you think you do.
  "
406436,"
   Is it inappropriate to ask someone on anon s*x*al questions?

  the more that i think about this question, the more that i realize that if i continue to wait, then nothing will get done. there are certain things in my life that i've been waiting on for the ""perfect moment,"" but in reality, we must do what's necessary regardless of the timing if we want to make any real progress. life doesn't wait for you, so we shouldn't wait for opportunities to present themselves. we must make those opportunities for ourselves.

  i don't believe in the generic definition of soul mates, no. generally speaking, soul mates refer to two people who are romantically ""made"" for one another, their chemistry is unstoppable and there's nobody else in the world that meshes with you other than that person.
  
  i don't believe in that at all. i believe that there could be dozens of people who fit you, your needs, and are in the same stage of life as you are. in addition, soul mates don't necessarily have to be romantic partners -- they can be platonic friends, unwavering friendships that provide the utmost support and encouragement in your life.

  -- my family used to have a german shepherd for around 10 years. we got her when i was a pre-teen and she passed away when i was in college. she was the most beautiful dog.
  
  -- i used to know how to play the guitar, ukulele, and keyboard when i was a teenager. my ultimate dream was to become a professional musician. my first tattoo when i turned 18 was a bass clef symbol turned into yin and yang symbols on each of my shoulder blades -- to represent the duality of music.
  
  -- when i was in high school, i was a prolific painter. i mainly painted in acrylics, but i also enjoyed oil painting and watercolor. i won awards for my art and my work was hung in a museum and at town hall.
  "
406457,"
   Where would you go if you were going on a first date?
  ","
  my first date with my boyfriend was to a restaurant, and then we saw a movie together. i normally wouldn't recommend seeing a movie as a first date because you can't talk and get to know the person you're dating, but the outing we had to the restaurant beforehand was incredible and we really got to talk. :'))
  
  on our second date, we went to the beach together. we found an area of the beach that used to be a dock for small boats, and it sorta became our ""spot."" we layed on the beach and listened to music for the entire day, which is something that really drew our relationship closer because we're both so passionate about music.

  ""girl interrupted"" by susanna kaysen.
  
  it was the first book that introduced me to mental health & mental illness, especially with respect to depression and borderline personality disorder. a lot of what kaysen wrote about resonated with me on an intimate level, and it was what first led me to question my own struggles with mental health. the book really opened my eyes to what i was dealing with and how what i was feeling wasn't ""normal"" or healthy.
  "
406461,"
   Do you believe in love?
  ","
  yes, love is one of the few things that i *do* believe in. love, whether it was among me and friends or me and my boyfriend, has inspired and motivated me to keep pushing forward even when i felt that there were too many obstacles stacked against me.

  "
406464,"
   Are you happy with the amount of information in your head?

  no, i don't believe i'll ever be happy with the information i know. there's *always* room for growth and endless opportunities for education, and there's no limit as to how much we know or are educated on. i believe education is so important, and even if someone isn't in school or university, they should find opportunities to expand their mind.

  "
406468,"
   Potentially controversial question, what are your thoughts on the ""body positivity"" movement?
  ","
  i believe the body positivity movement started out as a great ideology -- the idea that we should all love our bodies regardless of societal standards, because most people have ""unconventional"" body shapes, scars, disabilities, etc etc., and we shouldn't be judged on those things.
  
  however, in recent times, i also believe the body positivity movement has become jaded because of a lot of rhetoric involving fat positivity. this ideology puts forth the notion that we should accept ourselves even if we're overweight/obese, and essentially not do anything to help ourselves.
  
  being overweight/obese is a major health concern -- it can cause problems with the skeletal system, it can affect our cardiovascular system, and it can wreck havoc on simply the way our bodies function. it's not healthy to be overweight/obese, which is why physicians always recommend diet and exercise to those who do fall into the overweight/obese scale.
  
  being overweight or obese isn't something that should be glorified, in my opinion. if you're putting your own health first, then you should acknowledge that there's a problem that needs addressing. the fat positivity movement seems to sweep all of that under the rug, from my understanding. you can certainly be body positive while also attempting to lose weight, but the problem with body and/or fat positivity is that often those who promote it don't acknowledge that being overweight or obese is extremely risky and unhealthy.

406475,"
   Do you think it’s healthy to remain friends with your exes?

  depends on the nature of the relationship and why/how you broke up. it's going to be different case by case. there will be some exes you can remain friends with without a problem, but there will also be others with whom you cannot maintain a friendship -- whether it might be because of resurrection of old feelings or its just toxic to both of you.
  
  if this is a question you're pondering to begin with, perhaps its better if you keep your distance from your ex. at least in the beginning. i find that most people need time to move on and find themselves outside of their former relationship before they can feel confident enough to allow that person back into their lives.

  hello -- do you have a question ??
  "
406501,"
   heard of it?

  yeah, i've heard of it before. one of my friends loves it, lol. i just never watched it.

  no, i've never watched it before.

   share a picture!!
  ","
  here's another selfie ;
  "
406504,"
   Thank you for the recommendation! I've heard of colour pop, but never looked into it. Will have a browse. My eyeshadows I always have to layer loads to get any pigment XD so it would be heavenly to get high pigment for once haha
  ","
  that's honestly the only reason why i like using ""high quality"" makeup products, they end up lasting for a very long time because you're not layering at all. i usually only have to put one layer on as a base, then a second layer if i want a smokey eye or more dimension.
  "
406505,"
   you look so cute and pretty here wtf
  ","
  aw aw, thank you ~~

406506,"
   assuming you're both single that is
i mean the guy is a billionaire and very successful why would u turn him down
  ","
  he's a disgusting human being, in my opinion. lmaoo. there's more to people than the money they bring home, i would never date or marry a person simply because they're successful financially.
  "
406507,"
   I want them, but the palettes are quite pricey aren't they? Other than mac foundation, I get all my eyeshadows in drug stores because its cheaper XD
  ","
  they're expensive, but they last for a long time and the colors are very pigmented. i used to buy drug store makeup, but it simply isn't up to par with the other products i've used, like too faced (which as you can tell is my favorite brand, lol).
  
  i do suggest colourpop cosmetics as a cheap alternative, though !! their makeup is pretty great and they're very inexpensive.

   would you marry Donald Trump?
  ","
  obviously not.
  "
406509,"
   What’s your favorite spot in the city where you live?
  ","
  there aren't any spots that i enjoy in my neighborhood/town. i usually go to other cities in order to enjoy different things, whether they're state parks or beaches or bars and restaurants. there's this one park on the north shore of long island that's absolutely beautiful and i always enjoy going there.
  "
406510,"
   What's the worst place you have ever been to?
  ","
  there's this one club in town that my coworker dragged me to one day a few months ago, and i had a horrible time. the drinks were overpriced and not that great, there were people everywhere to the point where i could barely walk around, and the music was so loud to the point where i couldn't hear people talk.
  
  the club scene is definitely *not* my scene, i would much rather go to a quiet bar or coffee house to see my friends.
  "
406511,"
   What can’t be bought with money?
  ","
  ultimately, happiness. happiness comes from within us, within our joys in life and ability to be grateful and content with who we are and who we surround ourselves with. although we can purchase things that lessen our worries and give the impression of happiness, it's artificial happiness that only lasts for a brief period of time.
  "
406512,"
   Name one virtue and one vice that you have?
  ","
  my one virtue is that i'm compassionate towards people in need and especially towards animals. my one vice is alcohol -- i have no self control when it comes to drinking.
  "
406513,"
   Which movie do you think is overrated?
  ","
  most romantic comedies are stupid and overrated.
  "
406514,"
   How do you deal with unpleasant tasks? Do you complete them at once or put off until the last moment?
  ","
  when it comes to tasks that i don't like doing, i normally try to do them first to get them out of the way in order for me to spend my time on the things i actually enjoy. if i put them off until the last minute, then i'm going to spend that time worrying about those tasks until i have no choice but to do them.
  "
406515,"
   Do you consider yourself a creative person?
  ","
  yeah, i would say i'm rather creative. i like to write creatively, as well as paint and draw and take photography.
  "
406516,"
   Pizza hut or Dominos?
  ","
  i like dominos much better than pizza hut. although, i've never had pizza hut other than the mini personal pies that they have at the drive thru, lmao.

406520,"
   It’s obvious you’re using a filter lmao
  ","
  you're correct, you can see the stars on my head lol.
  "
406521,"
   wtf you're so pretty! i'm honestly shocked you don't wear eyeliner though, either you have great lighting or your eyelashes are hella thick at the root lmao
  ","
  aw, thank you !!
  
  i guess it's a combination of both ?? i used the natural lighting from my window in my bedroom. i also have really thick natural lashes, i've always just worn thickening mascara instead of putting on fake lashes.
  "
406522,"
   Vans or converse?
  ","
  i wore converse constantly when i was a teenager, haha. however, i really want a pair of those harry potter vans that just came out -- the slytherin ones look beautiful.
  "
406523,"
   Your makeup is stunning! ✨ I need your eyeshadow-applying skills aha, not sure whether it’s my skin type or something, but eyeshadow instantly melts off my eyelids ??
  ","
  aw, thank you so much !!
  
  have you tried using an eyeshadow primer ?? i've never needed it before, but it could help !!
  "
406524,"
   Have you ever been told you looked like someone often? If so, who did they think you looked like?
  ","
  people have often told me that i look like lady gaga.
  "
406525,"
   Do you prefer looks or personality?
  ","
  looks are great and all, but any sort of relationship (romantic or platonic) are based on the meshing of people's personalities. you can like someone for what they look like, but if that's the only reason you're their friend or partner, then the relationship is going to turn sour quite quickly.
  "
406526,"
   How do you get rid of stress and negative energy?
  ","
  if i'm feeling stressed out, i try to take a night for myself and relax in bed with ambient lights on, my himalayan rock salt lamp on, a candle lit, perhaps a cup of coffee in my hand, and something enjoyable on tv.
  "
406527,"
   ""Uncultured swine"" is a term used against those uneducated on a matter or who haven't experienced something for themselves yet. But what's the first thing you think of when you hear ""uncultured swine""?
  ","
  honestly, i view the term as something said in jest or in an ironic manner. i don't believe i've ever heard someone use the phrase in a serious tone, lol. however, when i hear the phrase ""uncultured swine"" i usually think about people who not only are uneducated on matters, but who are also refusing to educate themselves too despite knowing that they don't know what they're talking about.
  "
406528,"
   What's the most ridiculous this someone's gotten upset/annoyed at you for recently?
  ","
  my mother got upset with me because i told her that me and my friend have been looking to rent a house together with two or three other friends. she doesn't believe it would be good for me, for whatever reason, even though moving out of my parents' house is my number one concern right now due to my mental health.
  
  honestly, i think it's because she doesn't want me to move out since i'm essentially a caretaker to her, along with my father. she would be losing a person in the house to do things for her that she can't do for herself, and i think that's what upsets her.
  "
406529,"
   What do you love the smell of?
  ","
  gasoline, freshly cut grass, the crisp smell of the first snowfall, rain, pina coladas, firewood, jasmine, patchouli, dragon's blood incense, and roses.
  "
406530,"
   Oooh I've been wanting that for ages! I use peachy colours by far the most, for eye makeup. And I'm a sucker for a fruit scented shadow haha. I have a blush that's scented with plum.
  ","
  i do the same, i don't like using outrageous colors because they don't suit my face very well so i stick to neutrals, like peaches and browns and occasionally black. lately i've been using too faced's pumpkin spice palette, which has a lot of great matte and shimmery neutral colors.
  "
406531,"
   Which is your favorite TV show?
  ","
  i have a lot of favorite television shows, but lately i've been obsessed with it's always sunny in philadelphia. it's always made me laugh super hard.
  "
406532,"
   Who was the last person whose phone number you added to your contacts?
  ","
  one of my coworkers, a few weeks ago. she had to change her phone number because she was getting riddled with calls and texts from an ab*sive ex.
  "
406533,"
   Oooh is it peach scented?
  ","
  yes !! it smells delicious. i also have their sweet peach eyeshadow palette, which also smells of peaches.
  "
406534,"
   What is something you have always wanted to try?
  ","
  i've always wanted to try zip-lining, even though the concept sorta scares me. it looks like a lot of fun, though.
  "
406535,"
   I need to buy me some of that setting spray XD
  ","
  lately i've been using too faced's peach mist mattifying setting spray. it works really well.
  "
406536,"
   You're so pretty! I'm envious that your make up looks that good after sleeping with it haha. I'd look like a raccoon if I did XD
  ","
  aw, thank you ~~
  
  i don't wear eyeliner, and my mascara is waterproof. i also use a lot of setting spray so that my makeup doesn't budge, lmaoo.
  "
406537,"
   Post a picture of your wakeup face!
  ","
  i woke up from a nap not too long ago, does that count ?? lmaoo.
  
  (also don't mind the makeup, i fell asleep in it last night.)
  "
406538,"
   Can you suggest some good dark comedies?
  ","
  heathers (my favorite), american psycho, the cable guy, shaun of the dead, red, seven psychopaths, and fear and loathing in las vegas.
  "
406539,"
   What questions do you usually ask when you want to get acquainted with someone?
  ","
  if i'm getting to know someone for the first time, i'll usually ask them basic questions first, like their education and their career. then i'll delve deeper, asking them about their passions in life, what they want to do with their life, and where they see themselves in 5 years' time.
  "
406540,"
   How much attention do you pay to the leaderboards on Ask? Have you ever been at the top of the leaderboard in your country?
  ","
  i've checked the country leaderboards on askfm a few times, but it isn't of much interest to me at all. apparently, i'm #53 in the united states. i'm also #8 out of the people on my friends list.
  "
406541,"
   What’s today’s plans?
  ","
  well, i *was* planning on going to work, having a productive day at work, coming home and relaxing in front of my television. however, i woke up feeling completely sick and didn't have a good sleep despite laying down for 10 hours straight, so i ended up calling out of work.
  
  i feel a bit better now than i did this morning, but it wouldn't be worth it to go into work now considering it takes me about 45 minutes to drive there and it's near the end of the day. so i'm just on my laptop, listening to music, and drinking a sh*tload of water to flush out my system.
  "
406542,"
   People often talk about how social media is ""ruining"" our lives... But what are some positive impacts that you think social media, or technology as a whole, has had on our lives?
  ","
  i've been involved in the internet since i was a young child. when i was a pre-teen, i didn't have many IRL friends, so i resorted to the internet to find like-minded individuals who had similar interests, and as a result, i befriended a lot of people that way. i posted on public forums related to my interests, especially music and writing, and i still talk to many of the friends i made through those sites.
  
  social media and the internet as a whole has allowed people to expand their friend pool, finding acceptance and caring people if they're lacking that in their real life. i probably wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for the friends i made online when i was a teenager. they shaped me into who i am and instilled in me a sense of hope and confidence.
  "
406543,"
   Do you believe that world peace could ever be achieved?
  ","
  this may sound cynical, but no. we as a human species are prone to greedy and selfish behavior, which unfortunately is what propels most leaders to the top of their field, particularly in politics. the general public also has a close-minded way of looking at things, especially in america, and believe that their way is the best way and won't accept anything other than what they think to be right.
  "
406544,"
   What's something you want to be better at by this day next year?
  ","
  by this time next year, i would like to have better control over my mental health, particularly with respect to my impulsivity and addictive tendencies. i need to develop better self control when it comes to certain things in my life.
  
  in the same vein, i also want to establish more self-confidence and overall be a better person in my own eyes. i want to get my life in order and accept more opportunities, especially traveling.
  "
406545,"
   What are you gonna do with them?
  ","
  the only thing askfm has done with respect to spending coins is offer these stupid backgrounds to answers, of which i'm not a fan. i don't like having backgrounds to my answers, especially considering my answers are on the longer side.
  "
406546,"
   What's something you're worse at now than you were when you were younger?
  ","
  singing, LOL. i used to have a pretty decent singing voice when i was younger, but somehow it dwindled as i got older and now it's absolutely terrible.
  
  that doesn't stop me from singing, though. i still belt out songs in the car while driving home from work.
  "
406547,"
   What's something you're better at now than you were when you were younger?
  ","
  writing in general, including my understanding of grammar, development of characters, and writing style. i've finally developed a ""voice"" when it comes to my writing and know how to pull a reader in and keep the text interesting while still putting my point across. i can describe things in detail without sounding flowery, which is something i am incredibly guilty of doing when i was younger.
  "
406548,"
   Damn, this is interesting 
Most girls usually go with rom-com like FIOS or AWTR.
  ","
  i don't know any person (not just women) whose favorite movies are those movies, lmaoo. i've never seen either of those movies, tbh.
  
  i prefer gritty action films, thrillers, and dark comedies.

  i'm not doing so well. i'm still sick from yesterday, so i ended up calling out of work this morning, which honestly makes me feel terrible. i don't like missing work because my assignments pile up and i'm terrified that i'm going to get fired for missing work, even though i haven't called out in months.

406573,"
   Part1. Sending this out now bc in the last few days a few people have gotten offended or acted out of character or odd about my spam questions. I don't always agree with what's being stated in my spam, it's just something to make you think and open your mind. If I do agree, I often state that.
  ","
  (cont) ... If you don't like how I word things, then please try to consider the fact that I follow many people who have to use Google translate to answer my question, people who don't speak English as a first language and people from all areas of the globe. But also, I tend to word things however I'm comfortable doing so. I'm not ""mansplaining"" to women if I explain something in a spam question for everyone, I'm not ""trying to be the alpha male"" if I explain something to a man. I'm just explaining things to everyone for the sake of those who have a more difficult time understanding. If there's ever a time where you're uncomfortable with how I send out my spam, it can very easily be arranged for me to unfollow you and stop sending you it. All you have fo do is say rather than being a complete arse about it. I felt like this needed saying bc of some of your answers lately. Anyway, to those who understand why I send things out the way I do, thank you for being amazing people and I'll get more spam out to you again soon. But If anyone wants to be unfollowed, now's your time to say bc I'm unfollowing people r/n. This is a dead site, it's not that deep.
  
  --
  
  i totally understand where you're coming from, which honestly is half the reason why i stopped sending out spam questions to a bunch of random people a very long time ago. i would get aggravated at people's responses (or lack thereof), and they would often come at me personally even though i merely asked a question, not gave my thoughts on the topic.
  
  it's ridiculous that you even have to make this disclaimer. like you said, this is a dead site & it isn't that deep. however, i would really appreciate it if you *did* continue sending me questions, because i do like your questions a lot even if it takes me a while to answer them since they make me think. :'))

  the best compliments i can receive are compliments on my writing. it makes me so happy when someone likes or appreciates my writing style, especially when they can relate to my words.

  i prefer winter over summer. i like the cold weather.

   Would you rather have no internet or no cell phone?
  ","
  i would rather have no internet. i existed with a cell phone without internet access when i was younger, so i could certainly do it again, lol. at least it gives me a way to still communicate with my friends through phone calls and text messaging.

   What makes you who you are and not someone else?
  ","
  my personal experiences growing up and how they've impacted me and further influence my behavior. no two people are alike because everyone experiences life in different ways, and our thought patterns and behavior are ultimately shaped by our formative and current experiences.
  "
406601,"
   Ever heard of Crash Bandicoot?
  ","
  of course !! it used to be one of my favorite video games when i was a child.

406602,"
   Have you ever blamed someone for acting against you during a paranoia episode ?
  ","
  i don't recall directly accusing someone of acting against me, but i definitely have had those thoughts quite strongly and have expressed them to other people instead of the person i think is wronging me.
  "
406603,"
   You don't type with uppercase letters?

  no, it's faster for me to type without capitalizing letters/words/etc etc. i don't care much about my grammar on social media.

   Ok, I tried to let them know this over text, and they were reluctant to really accept it but it was whatever. They kept calling me and I picked up (I guess I still miss the convos) and now I feel like we're back to square one and they won't accept it, and it's making it harder for me.
  ","
  (cont) ... They keep saying they'll never love someone else like they love me they'll never be able to move on, they'll always be mine, etc. And I really don't know what to say, I feel guilty.. It's making it difficult for me to move on and making me more attached. I don't want to just cut him off and ignore him forever but I'm just unsure what to do. Sigh. Sorry for bothering you with this.
  
  --
  
  you're not bothering me at all, don't worry about that. i'm sorry you're in this predicament, because it sounds awfully difficult especially because you still care about them to a degree and don't want to hurt them (which is totally understandable).
  
  on the one hand, cutting them off might help them to move on, but on the other hand, it probably will hurt them. especially if they believe you're the only one for them, they likely won't accept anyone else's affection for a long time. in the same vein, staying their friend might also further encourage them to try to pursue you.
  
  honestly, time can only tell. i would try to set some boundaries and keep your distance, perhaps keep reminding them that you're not interested anymore. if *you* find someone else and they wind up knowing that you're dating other people, perhaps it will help them move on.

   Many people coexist with animals that they're not educated enough on. For example I know someone who had 30 hamsters in the one hamster home when they're solitary animals and should be kept alone. What's the biggest carer foul you've seen someone make with animals?
  ","
  i'm in a bearded dragon group on facebook & there are so many posts of ignorant and uneducated people adopting (or purchasing) bearded dragons without doing their research. they end up placing two bearded dragons in the *same* enclosure, when that's an extremely dangerous thing to do.
  
  bearded dragons are solitary creatures as well, and because of their assertion of dominance or submissive behaviors, it can cause a lot of trouble if they're in the same enclosure. one dragon can steal the heat from other or they could flat out attack each other, even if in the beginning they *seem* fine. it's only a matter of time.

   how many cheat days can you have while dieting
  ","
  i've never really been on a formal diet before, so i honestly have no clue. i would venture a guess and say once per week or once every two weeks ??
  
  i'm a bit uncomfortable with the entire notion of ""cheat days,"" however. the right diet won't feel like you need to ""cheat"" on your diet because you would ideally feel much better on that diet than if you were to eat junk and fast food.

  chester bennington's passing. the two-year mark of his passing was on july 20th, and i cried listening to one of linkin park's songs. i also found a few ""memories"" on facebook where i was talking about how much he and his music has meant to me over the years, and it made me quite emotional.
  "
406672,"
   Which is worse, being too hot or too cold?
  ","
  i absolutely cannot stand the heat, so being too hot is much worse for me. also, apparently certain SSRIs decrease a person's threshold for tolerating heat, which could also explain why i cannot stand the heat anymore.
  
  i would much rather be cold. it's easier to layer up than anything else.

406675,"
   How do you deal with the lame haters?

   Wha do you think is the key to finding happiness in your life ?

  you have to create happiness in your life, it doesn't simply just come to you. if you wait around for happiness to occur, then you'll be waiting for the rest of your life. you need to actively do things that fill you with joy, follow your passions and ambitions, and do things outside of your comfort zone. you need to experience life to its fullest.

  that phrase really angers me, for some reason. it seems invalidating and ignorant, especially in the context of mental health. positive thought patterns have to be re-learned through a lot of therapy, so it isn't something people with mental illness can just do automatically.

  just because your religion says that being gay is ""wrong"" doesn't mean you have to follow that way of thinking. we still have free will, and we can believe in a god or higher being while also being critical of religion for putting forth such notions as being anti-lgbt.

  it's honestly really difficult these days to afford college, especially if you're choosing to pay for each credit as you go. your best bet is to take out a loan to pay for tuition, that way you can pay off your balance after you graduate -- at that point, you can dedicate yourself to a full-time job and do monthly installments.

  we're not married yet because we're not financially ready to be married and have a wedding and whatnot. we also don't live together, and we want to have that independent experience before delving into marriage. we're not in any rush at all, it isn't a priority to us.

  yeah, although it was mostly online. i never advertised it in my real life, so i never felt kickback from being bisexual. i've only become more open about my orientation over the past five years or so, but people are much more accepting now than in the past.

  yes, the lyrics are one of my favorite aspects of most songs. they can make or break a song, in my opinion. i have the utmost respect for musicians who are also wonderful writers.

  i definitely don't agree with the idea that i'm strong, but it's something i'm actively working on (self-esteem and such). i've overcome some obstacles during my life, but i've struggled greatly with them too.

406797,"
   When did you realize you are bi?  Was it hard to come out?  Struggling!
  ","
  i realized i was bisexual when i was 11 years old. i've dated both men and women since then, which sorta solidified my sexual orientation because i noticed that i felt the same towards them.
  
  it wasn't difficult for me to come out, at least to my friends, because many of my friends are also bisexual or gay. i didn't tell my family, i think they at least figured it out while i was still a teenager though. it's never been a topic of conversation in my family.

   Is disappointment worst than hate?

  yeah, i definitely believe that disappointment feels worse than hatred. if someone hates you, then that's more of a ""them"" problem than a ""you"" problem, because that person is holding onto that negative energy, not you.
  
  someone being disappointed in you, on the other hand, feels so much worse -- particularly when it's a loved one or a friend.

  meeting with upper management at work. i had to go to a meeting with the COO of the company last friday, and my anxiety skyrocketed the entire morning before i had to meet with her. i'm always terrified that i'm not going to portray myself or my thoughts in the correct way. i'm also afraid that they're going to criticize me for my work performance.
  "
406803,"
   What do you find more irritating.... Incredibly rude, or incredibly ignorant people?

  i find that rude people are also very ignorant, so rude people are definitely more irritating since they portray both traits. in some cases, they're aware of their behavior as well, and the fact that they actively choose to be a rude or bad person is aggravating as well.

  that's really discouraging, so i completely understand where you're coming from. you have to remain committed, though. i haven't lost weight recently and i kinda plateaued, but i think it's because of my monthly period cycle and i'm always going to weigh more before and during my period, probably because of water retention ?? i'm not entirely sure.

  yeah, i experience the same thing. it's difficult for me to lose weight, which is why i've only lost 12 pounds in two months.
  
  you should try to weigh yourself in the morning before you eat, i find that it's most accurate to have sorta a ""baseline"" weight. also, you have to remember your weight fluctuates each day as well depending on what you've eaten and how much activity you did.

  ","
  that's great !! i used to go to the gym, but i found it difficult to actually get there and work out because i have anxiety and couldn't get myself to drive there a lot of times. especially after my best friend moved away, we used to attend the gym together and i wasn't as dedicated when i was by myself.
  
  two months ago, however, my family allowed me to take the treadmill that we have in the house and move it upstairs so i can work out in peace. it used to be in my parents' bedroom, and i never wanted to work out there because my father is always in the bedroom. but ever since i got that privacy, i've been working out consistently.

   Anything you've been wanting to tell everyone?
  ","
  i've only mentioned this briefly in the past because i didn't feel comfortable going into the details of it, but i'm in the process of working on an alcohol dependency and decreasing my use of alcohol as a coping mechanism. i went from drinking 4-5 nights per week to only drinking once per week, and instead of getting blackout drunk like i used to get, i limit myself to three drinks at the most.
  
  it's something i'm pretty proud of, even though people don't know about it, and i'm also embarrassed to admit that it was/is a problem. everyone in my life was worried about me and it took me a long time to acknowledge that it was an issue in my life. but i'm working towards recovering.

406822,"
   Do you ever feel like the world is against you? When you feel that way, how do you cope with it?

  yeah, sometimes so many things go wrong at once that it feels like something in the world is preventing me from achieving much or being happy. it makes me feel hopeless and at a loss of what to do, and it's pretty discouraging.
  
  when i'm feeling this way, i try opening myself up to my boyfriend and friends in order to receive support and encouragement. they have a good way of motivating me and making me see the positive side of things so that i can continue moving forward.

  the question asked how i would like someone to tell me if they liked me. i took that in a romantic context, so i responded that it would be useless for someone to tell me that because i'm not single.
  
  i can see the confusion, though. i honestly didn't even think of the word ""like"" in the way you're describing, that's a friendly platonic way of liking someone as a friend. usually when people say they like you, they mean that they have feelings for you.

  yeah, toxic feminity exists and it's not talked about as often as toxic masculinity. toxic feminity is tied into the traits of toxic masculinity, in which the standards of a male-dominated system are upheld by women ascribed to that system. this is classically seen in women, particularly white women, who put other women down for expressing themselves via s*x and other things that challenge the notion of a subservient woman.

  sometimes, but i generally disagree with waiting for something good to happen. if you want something to change or something great to happen in your life, you have to actively seek it out and work towards it. nothing is going to happen if you just wait around and wait for life to hand you an opportunity. you have to make them for yourself.

   What is the difference between being alive and truly living?
  ","
  being merely alive is simply existing for the sake of existing. it's going through the motions of your life with no real reason, motivation, or purpose -- you're existing solely because it's easier to stay alive.
  
  truly living, on the other hand, is living your life with a sense of purpose, dedication, and motivation to improve yourself and those around you. you take the opportunities presented to you and run with them, instead of just going through the motions. you control your own destiny and do things that genuinely make you happy, whether it's indulging in hobbies or taking trips. you're experiencing life to your fullest extent.

406883,"

406886,"
   Do you think that experiencing pain has a certain lesson to be learned?
  ","
  yes and no. i don't believe there's any ulterior motive behind pain, like the belief that pain solely exists to teach us a lesson. there isn't always a rhyme or reason for things to happen, they just simply happen because we're human and mistakes are bound to be made, tragedies are bound to occur, etc etc.
  
  however, we can make a conscious decision to learn from the pain and move on from it.

  he looks at me with a blank stare and he goes ""...why are you reading me the password? i thought you needed it."" so i went, ""no, i thought *you* needed it."" and he replies, ""... why would i need my own wifi password? i live here!"" then he checks my phone and goes, ""the wifi password you have written down isn't even the right password."" lmaoo.

  i don't think you're an as*hole, but you definitely need to talk to them regarding their messages, because they seem as if they're trying to guilt you into dating them again. you have to tell them that their messages of ""i miss you"" and similar things aren't going to change the fact that you two broke up, and they're only putting you in an awkward position because you're not getting back together and you're trying to move on with your life.

   If I go to a private psychiatrist & just pay the 200 it'll take to get seen and/or prescribed meds do you think that's smart since all of them won't call back/take my insurance? If I need therapy too I can just find a therapist. Hopefully it only takes one visit to get that all done.
  ","
  going to a psychiatrist isn't a one-time thing. you're likely going to have to pay that $200 appointment fee every time you return to that doctor, because most doctors won't refill medications until they follow up with you with another appointment. for example, my psychiatrist prescribes me three-month supplies of my medications and i see her every three months to refill those scripts.

  my addiction to cigarettes, on the other hand, obviously has a lot of negative consequences healthwise. smoking causes a plethora of health problems, including asthma, emphysema, cancer, etc etc. i've been slowly cutting down on the amount i'm smoking, but i do want to quit eventually.

  i think it's a good way to find a potential partner, but it also has its dangers as well. people using dating sites should always be vigilant and careful around the people they're planning on meeting.

  "
407004,"
   Is it wrong to say biological men cannot get pregnant no matter what?
  ","
  i mean, if someone's sex is male then they don't have ovaries or a uterus in order to make pregnancy happen. so yeah, that would be accurate to say that people whose sex is male cannot get pregnant.
  
  however, i'm not exactly an expert or even a novice at biology, especially when it comes to genetics and chromosomes and whatnot. i know there are several different combinations of chromosomes that determine someone's sex, but i don't know those exact combinations.
  "
407005,"
   What was your favorite and least favorite year of your life?
  ","
  my memory is a bit hazy, so i can't really distinguish between different years of my life, especially the earlier years like when i was a pre-teen and teenager. i've become more content with my life as i've gotten older, though, and i think that largely has to do with the improvement in my mental health.

  ralph lauren's polo black cologne reminds me of my boyfriend during our partying phase when we were 19-21 years old. he wore it all the time, and it smells of endless partying, reckless decisions, living life in the moment, laughter, and nostalgia.
  "
407009,"
   What are three things that bring you joy?

  i felt elegant when i went to my cousin's wedding a few weeks ago, haha. i dressed up fairly nicely for it and my makeup was on point. it also helped that my boyfriend dressed super nice and professional as well, we looked great together.
  "
407012,"
   How would you describe the sound of your voice?
  ","
  sorta neutral -- not too high pitched, but not deep either. it can get raspy at times, and i don't really have much inflection in my voice either so it can sound a bit monotone.
  "
407013,"
   What's the last thing you did in order to ""improve"" yourself?
  ","
  cut down on smoking cigarettes & drinking alcohol for my own health. i used to drink alcohol 3-4 times per week, and now i only drink maybe once per week instead. i've also been using my vape more often at work instead of smoking cigarettes.

407015,"
   how did you last reward yourself?

  i went to 7-11 and bought myself a large iced coffee for making it through the entire workday without leaving early or crying in the bathroom, lol. i wanted to leave early so badly because i was so overwhelmed, but i felt like i had no choice but to stick it through.
  "
407016,"
   What is your busiest day of the week?

  "
407017,"
   Under what circumstances do you block people on social media?
  ","
  i normally block people if they're repeatedly sending me messages that i'm uncomfortable with, i.e. trying to solicit inappropriate conversation or pictures, praising me, being condescending to me, downright trolling me, etc etc.
  
  i rarely block people on social media as it is, but it has happened on a few occasions.
  "
407018,"
   Can you keep a baseball bat as a weapon in your car in NY?
  ","
  a baseball bat isn't classified as a weapon since it's used for sports, from my understanding. on that note, i don't believe it would be illegal to keep one in your car.
  
  if you wrapped spiked around it or put nails in it, then obviously that's hella illegal lol.
  "
407019,"
   Do you have a favorite track?
  ","
  lately, i've been listening to the soundtracks from the video games destiny 2, skyrim, and halo 3. i also like the soundtracks from harry potter & the cursed child, game of thrones, and lord of the rings.
  "
407020,"
   What habit that others have annoys you most?
  ","
  chewing with their mouth open, or talking over other people while they're in the middle of speaking. both of them drive me absolutely up the wall.
  "
407021,"
   Are you sure they aren't just trying to make helpful suggestions to try and make things easier for you or help you make informed decisions by offering other options?
  ","
  no, that isn't the case. i would be more receptive if that was the case because i'm generally open to suggestions. but this, in particular, is coming from a person who doesn't care about anyone besides themselves and is only trying to dictate what i should and should not do because it gives them a sense of control.
  "
407022,"
   Are you obligated to inform your employers that you are leaving the state/country?
  ","
  like ... on a vacation ?? if that's the case, then you're not obligated, no. as long as you request the time off beforehand (whether it's PTO, vacation, or unpaid hours) then it shouldn't make a difference what you're doing outside of work.
  "
407023,"
   What do you do to sleep comfortably
  ","
  what's comfortable to me when i sleep really does depend on the particular night, because sometimes it feels better to be in one position, while other nights it feels better in other positions.
  
  sometimes i sleep best on my side with one leg up and the other leg straight out, while other times i sleep on my back.

  people are always so quick to blame the victim, it's disgusting.
  "
407026,"
   I've seen the term femicide associated with this. Do you think it's the appropriate term in this context?
  ","
  i'm not sure if he k*lled her because she was a woman or solely because she rejected him. femicide, from my understanding, normally refers to a gender-based crime where someone murders or hurts a woman simply because she's a woman.

  honestly, whenever i go out with a friend at night, i'm fearful to a certain degree. my friend is a bit timid & she relies on me to fend men away, and i cannot tell you how many times i've thought ""is this going to be it?"" after politely telling a man that we aren't interested in talking to them.
  
  *thankfully* nothing has gone wrong yet, i've never been threatened by a man but i think that's also because i'm a regular and i know the bartenders are on my side regardless of what happens. but i've also had men get so angry that they stop drinking their drink and completely leave the bar.
  "
407056,"
   amen! online communities like “incels” who are made up of men with extreme personality issues who naturally women would be wary of are a prime example of people who would do something like this. they literally despise women for not giving them s*x like they're owed it instead of being decent people.

  ","
  the sad truth is that she definitely was not the first and definitely will not be the last, and until we collectively as a society begin teaching young boys and men to respect women, the problem is going to progressively get worse.
  
  and before anyone comes at me with the whole ""nOt aLl mEn"" sh*t -- just because it isn't *all* men doesn't mean it isn't an enormous problem in society. the society we live in favors men, it's a violent patriarchial beacon of nonsense, and until more people begin accepting that and realizing things need to change, things won't get better. women's lives are constantly at risk just because they *exist* and it's horrible.

  ugh, this sh*t makes me physically sick. rest in peace, bianca.
  
  this shows that violence against women is still a *huge* problem. this is why women are forced to be so hypervigilant when virtually doing anything -- women are taught to be wary, while men aren't taught that their behaviors are wrong. this is why women are still so terrified to say ""no"" to men, regardless of what they're saying no to or why they're saying no. it's absolutely despicable and disgusting that this sh*t still happens.

  all of the happy moments of my life have been vacations i've gone on with my boyfriend, whether it's also with friends or just the two of us. there was one trip in particular that was really fun; we went to montauk, new york, for the weekend with no repertoire and basically spent two days doing whatever we wanted to do. we went to the brewery, cute little restaurants, down to the beach, etc etc. our hotel room had an amazing outdoor patio that overlooked the ocean.
  "
407090,"
   What is your favorite waste of time?

  my favorite way to waste time is browsing the internet & answering questions, lmaoo. when i don't have anything to do on the weekends, i normally use the internet on my laptop and listen to music, particularly in the mornings.

   what do you prefer
Food or sleep
Or both???
  ","
  well, obviously both. however, i only really eat food because it's necessary for my survival and there are only maybe two or three foods that i really do enjoy eating. i mostly drink liquids all day long.
  
  sleep, on the other hand, is one of my favorite hobbies.

  yeah, i would say that i'm fairly sensitive (thanks, BPD). not so much when it comes to strangers, because in those cases i couldn't care any less, but when it comes to my friends and boyfriend, i'm very sensitive to their actions and what they say. i have a bad habit of taking what they say rather personally, and then i dwell on it for a long time.

  i got my own laptop when i was 17 years old.
  "
407108,"
   What color dominates your wardrobe?
  ","
  probably black, lmaoo. i have a lot of darker-colored clothing because i feel they look best on me, like black, navy blue, dark red, gray, dark green, etc etc. i have a few floral and multi-colored tops, but those are also darker in color. i only own maybe one or two white shirts.

  "
407110,"
   What is your biggest achievement
  ","
  i consider my biggest achievement to be graduating from college. i was struggling with some mental health issues during my college years because i wasn't in treatment, and i was also dealing with a lot of interpersonal conflicts that made it hard to cope. however, i still graduated magna cum laude with my bachelor's degree.

  "
407114,"
   Are you a sentimental person? Do you tend to hold onto things from your childhood?
  ","
  i'm only sentimental about pictures and other things that my boyfriend has given me over the years, especially letters. i have all of his letters saved and sitting on my desk in my bedroom, and i read them occasionally when i'm having a bad mental health day.
  "
407115,"
   Who was your idol when you were growing up?
  ","
  chester bennington. when i was a teenager, he and his music were sources of solace and comfort, and during times of crisis, he made me feel less alone.
  
  rest in peace, buddy. ?
  "
407116,"
   Is a home really a home when your loved ones are gone?
  ","
  yes, you can still consider a place your home even if you don't have loved ones living with you. your living space shouldn't be defined by the people in it, you need to create for yourself where you feel most content and comfortable. there are millions of people who live alone and consider their houses/apartments their genuine home because they're comfortable there moreso than anywhere else.
  "
407117,"
   In your opinion, how can Ask be improved?
  ","
  askfm can be improved if they update and fix the reporting/blocking system, or at least took people's complaints more seriously. i've noticed that the moderators of this site end up banning people who didn't do anything wrong, but accounts who harass other users stay active infinitely.
  "
407118,"
   What's the best comfort food?
  ","
  for me, my favorite comfort food is a delicious burrito bowl, something warm that satisfies me with various flavors and makes me full and content when i'm finished. i like carnitas and tofu as my source of protein, and i usually ask for white rice and black beans. sprinkle that with some salsa, guacamole and sour cream, and my heart becomes full. lmao.
  "
407119,"
   Are you spiritual or religious in any way? If so, how?
  ","
  i'm not really spiritual anymore, and i was never religious, even though i grew up in a religious household.
  
  however, i will say this -- i place more faith in the earth and science than anything else, and i do feel intimately connected to the earth and the environment. it's inspired me more than anything else.
  "
407120,"
   What's your main rule in life?
  ","
  ""if you're going through hell, keep going.""
  
  i follow that rule religiously because it motivates me to continue trekking onward even when faced with certain obstacles. you won't be able to emerge from the other side if you don't keep progressing forward.

407122,"
   Which element of nature do you feel most ""connected"" to– air, earth, fire or water?
  ","
  i've always felt the most connected to the earth, even though i'm actually a water sign. i feel most at peace when i'm surrounded by plains and forests and trees in general, and i find enrichment when i sink my feet into the bare earth or sit down in the grass.
  "
407123,"
   What do you wish someone taught you a long time ago?
  ","
  i wish someone taught me that you can still care about someone and understand that you can let them go at the same time because you recognize that your friendship/relationship isn't healthy.
  
  i've held onto too many friendships because i thought that because i cared about them, it meant i should continue being their friend, even if the friendship was unhealthy and toxic to my well-being. i would constantly put them first before my own needs and they wouldn't put the same effort into the friendship, which made me feel empty and taken advantage of.
  "
407124,"
   Would you rather spend the rest of your life with a sailboat as your home or an RV as your home?
  ","
  i would *much* rather spend the rest of my life living in an RV !! as long as all of the plumbing and electricity works, lol.
  
  idk, i just think it would be wonderful to be able to travel whenever i want and park the RV in various campsites and whatnot. it would be an enlightening experience.

  why did you ask me the question of the day? lmaoo.
  
  i don't really have the privilege to experience holidays, both in the sense of a national holiday or a vacation. regardless, i wake up around the same time every morning, which is around 7:15-7:30am. occasionally, i'll sleep in until 8 or 9am, but that's rare.

   Could You Live Without The Internet?
  ","
  i probably could if given no other option. when something that we think is integral to our lives is taken away from us, we as humans naturally adapt to those changes. it would be weird at first to not have the internet to entertain me, but eventually, i would resort back to other hobbies and adjust accordingly.

  "
407133,"
   Do you own any band merch or movie merch? If so, what? ????️
  ","
  i used to own *tons* of band merch, but i've donated most of them over the years simply because i never wore any of the tee shirts anymore. they were honestly just taking up space in my wardrobe, and although i felt sentimental about them because a lot of them were from concerts and whatnot, they had no real use to me.

  my favorite games include skyrim, fallout 4, assassin's creed: syndicate, far cry 5, the bioshock series, halo 3, GTA V, minecraft, ultimate chicken horse, layers of fear, outlast, life is strange, the wolf among us, and many more.

  friendship means that you have a personal connection with another individual, where you love (platonically) and support each other through both triumphs and struggles. at the same time, the friendship should not be idolized and each person should feel comfortable enough to call attention to toxic or problematic behavior.
  
  i don't have a lot of friends, and tbh, i'm questioning my friendship with one friend in particular whom i've known since i was 19.

   god, i'm actually going thru the same thing here trying to find decent places that will actually take my insurance. it's so discouraging. my mother actually said the same thing, that most companies won't cover it cuz they know it's a “scam” too lmao. i have no faith in our healthcare system.
  ","
  i'm so sorry you're going through this too. it *is* discouraging, but the best thing to do is keep trying, because if you stop trying then you won't get the help you need and deserve. it's so difficult to find places that take your insurance, but you should also keep in mind that even if a place doesn't take insurance, they may be able to help you on a sliding scale.
  
  also, oh jeez @ your mother. it isn't a scam, it's honestly because mental health isn't taken as seriously as physical health concerns and there's so much misconception revolved around even ""simpler"" mental illnesses like depression and anxiety. the same can be said for basically any invisible illness, too.
  "
407163,"
   Ugh that sounds terrible:( I hate myself for being like this. & I hate how it seems like we have little support even when seeking help, like the mentally ill don't matter.
  ","
  i won't lie -- it *was* terrible in the beginning, especially considering how i was feeling during that time and how hopeless i felt because none of the medications i tried worked for me. but my former psychiatrist was amazing, she worked with me and saw me every 2 weeks and even gave me her cell phone number to make sure i was okay.
  
  you're right, though -- it's so difficult to find help and support with mental illness, especially when behavioral health care isn't taking seriously with a lot of insurance companies because they're somehow not deemed as ""necessary"" medical complaints. it's absolutely absurd.
  "
407164,"
   Does it make you feel better when someone tries to comfort you and tell you “someone’s having it worse”?
  ","
  lol, no. that's actually pretty invalidating because that person isn't acknowledging your complaints or actually trying to help you. if they genuinely cared, they would listen to you and support you, perhaps offer some advice or solutions, instead of brushing your concerns off by saying ""others have it worse off than you.""

  in the beginning, i was planning on k*lling myself. i went to my general practitioner and they prescribed me an antidepressant and gave me a referral to see a psychiatrist that was in my network. i had to call like 5 different places in order to find a psychiatrist who was (1) taking my insurance, and (2) had availability and taking new patients.
  
  eventually after about two months or so, i found a psychiatrist in a counseling center who was taking on new patients and who was affordable because she took my insurance. i began seeing her and she diagnosed me with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder after maybe the third visit or so (the first visit was really just an intake evaluation). she prescribed me a different antidepressant because the one my general practitioner prescribed me wasn't working. and it just went on from there -- since that time, i've tried perhaps 10+ different medications to find a combination of meds that work for me.
  
  try not to lose hope. it's 100% worth it to seek out help, and it does suck that it takes a while to find someone who suits you. but your health is important.

  i disagree with the notion of ""allowing"" your partner to have certain friendships -- i find that to be rather controlling. ideally, your partner should be making their own conclusions regarding their friendships, even in terms of exes, and even if you disagree you don't exactly have the right to dictate the friendships your partner has.

  i don't know -- maybe i'm just irrational and overthinking it, but i do care about the friendship more than most other things and i'm somewhat attached to her. i've tried not contacting her for a while to see if she contacts me first & she never has, and then i give in and text her because i care too much.

  one bad habit that i have that i need to overcome is drinking alcohol, particularly as a way to mask my emotions. i've developed somewhat of a dependency on alcohol, but i wouldn't consider it a full-blown addiction because i'm not physically dependent on it.
  
  it's something that has actually caused a rift in my relationship and my boyfriend is very worried about me, but i have a habit of having zero self-control and acting out on impulse. it's really difficult for me to control myself when alcohol is available.

   There is a ""half your age plus 7"" rule that many people use when determining if an age gap is decent between them and a potentially younger partner.

  i honestly find taxidermy to be incredibly interesting !! i've always wanted to own a taxidermied animal, i find bizarre or odd things like that to be appealing.

   Are morals objective or subjective?
  ","
  this may be an unpopular opinion, but i believe that morals are primarily subjective. there may be an objective baseline that exists, but it's generally pretty vague and there's a lot of gray area in between. people base their morals on their upbringing and religion, among other things, so each person's idea of what's moral vs immoral will be different.

407212,"
   How do you feel about gay conservatives?
  ","
  people have the right to believe what they want to believe as long as those beliefs don't infringe upon the rights of other groups of people, particularly disadvantaged or oppressed groups.
  
  there's nothing inherently wrong with being conservative, it's honestly just the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, etc etc., conservatives who generally give the political leaning a bad name.

  i spend the majority of my free time on the internet, sadly enough. however, it's what relaxes me the most so i justify it in that respect. sometimes when i get home from work at night, if i have no other responsibilities, i'll log onto askfm, twitter, and facebook on my laptop and browse the internet for an hour or two.

   Studies have shown that the morals of a country's citizens are more often than not based on that country's leading religion. Even for the country's agonistics and atheists. Dogs even know they've done wrong when they chew shoes. But apart from religion, where do you believe we get our morals from?
  ","
  besides religion, i believe that most people learn morals from their family upbringing. what we're taught as young children is integral to our development growing up, especially in terms of morality and our distinction between right and wrong.
  
  if we're taught from an early age that something is ""wrong,"" then that will carry through to adulthood and eventually be passed onto the next generation of children.

   What’s the difference between bpd and bipolar? I tried searching the internet but they seem to be similar? Please enlighten me!
  ","
  they're actually somewhat similar, so i can see where you would get confused. however, BPD is a personality disorder while bipolar disorder is a mood disorder.
  
  some other distinctions ;
  
  -- bipolar disorder is categorized by two phases, mania and depression. BPD, on the other hand, can have a range of emotions (however, you *can* also experience some types of mania and also depression with BPD).
  
  -- bipolar disorder is primarily a chemical imbalance, while BPD is correlated to life events. i.e., an outburst from someone with bipolar disorder might just be related to their ups and downs, while an outburst from someone with BPD is a direct result of an environmental condition.
  
  -- BPD has a wider range of mood changes, i.e. anxiety, irritability, anger (which can borderline on rage), sadness, emptiness, dissociation, etc etc. bipolar disorder, on the other hand, is diagnosed after experiencing at least one two-week episode of mania (or hypomania) and then depression.
  
  -- episodes in bipolar disorder are much more longstanding than episodes in BPD, i.e. bipolar mania episodes can last 1-2 weeks or longer while episodes in BPD can last from minutes to days.

  my neighbor's house, leading down into his backyard and driveway. the tops of trees from properties of the surrounding neighbors. the main street with other people's cars parked in front of their respective houses. power lines.
  
  my room faces the west, so it's nice sometimes when the sun is setting because the amber glow cascades through my window and reflects off of my walls. it brightens everything up and it's rather beautiful.

  i've been fine -- not so great, but not so terrible either. the past two weeks have been rather rough for me emotionally, so i've at least been trying to channel that negative energy into positive coping mechanisms, i.e. cleaning extensively.
  
  i wish i took a ""before"" picture of my bedroom prior to deep-cleaning it, because it's remarkable how much of a difference i made within the span of two weekends. that, at the very least, makes me feel good.
  "
407270,"
   Were your family or friends shocked that you picked up the habit when you came home?

  my family didn't find out until a few years later because i wasn't living with them when i did end up picking up habit back up again. when they did find out, though, they were albeit disappointed but accepting -- my mother smoked for 20+ years, so she really didn't have the authority to say much.

  experiment, if you're able to do so, and see where your feelings lead you.
  
  being confused about your sexuality is rather normal though, so don't fear that you're ""different"" or something is ""wrong"" simply because you're questioning yourself. it's a normal part of life that most people go through, tbh. the best thing to do, in any scenario, is to look at yourself with an open mind and see where your feelings take you.

   How do you deal with the pain of missing someone? ?
  ","
  if there's no way for you to reach out to that person, then i always find it best to discuss your feelings of longing and/or grief with someone else who understands how you feel or what you're going through. it can provide incredible validation to hear from someone else that they genuinely empathize with your feelings and you're not alone.
  "
407277,"

  "
407278,"
   How and when did you pick up the habit of smoking? Did anyone introduce cigarettes to you or?
  ","
  i was introduced to smoking cigarettes when i was in my first year of college, actually. my roommate smoked, and the few friends i made when i lived in massachusetts smoked as well. i picked up the habit from them, not necessarily because of peer pressure but because i was going through significant mental distress and i figured it would help me calm down.
  
  i actually quit for one year in between my freshman and sophomore year of college, because i had moved back to new york at that point and couldn't smoke because the legal age to smoke where i live (19) is higher than the legal age in massachusetts (18). however, after i turned 19 i started buying my own packs again.
  "
407279,"
   Do you eat out or eat home cooked food for lunch and dinner?
  ","
  i do both, depending on my mood that day. i normally bring lunches to work with me so that i don't have to spend money on a meal, but occasionally i'll buy lunch on wednesdays because it's ""sushi day"" at the cafeteria in my office building.
  
  as for dinner, most of my meals are home-cooked but occasionally my family and i will order takeout.

  yes, ab*sive friendships are absolutely real, and they're not nearly as talked about as much as ab*sive relationships are. regardless of whether the relationship is romantic or platonic, there always needs to be boundaries set and mutual respect between each person. it's perfectly valid and okay to cease friendships with people whom you believe are being manipulative, ab*sive, etc etc.

   Do you think people who lack in punctuation can ever be good writers? Any tips on how they can improve themselves?
  ","
  well, ""good"" is really subjective -- so one person may believe they're a good writer while someone else may not, regardless of their knowledge of grammar. obviously you can't judge someone's skills in writing based solely on their social media presence, you would have to look at their academic papers and whatnot to get a true idea of their grasp on punctuation.
  
  regardless, there are plenty of ways a person can improve themselves. normally reading how-to books with respect to writing correctly can be very helpful, as well as practicing writing and having someone nearby who can be an editor.

  ","
  i didn't watch the video, but i'm assuming it was about a bunch of parents fighting in the middle of the park, right ??
  
  if that's the case, then i think it's highly immature and inappropriate. not only are your own children watching you behave this way, which is further setting an example for them, but you're being watched by every other child and family in the park. disneyland is supposed to be a family fun, children-oriented theme park, so i think any sort of fighting is completely unnecessary and embarrassing.

   Is it possible for a person to be too cheerful?

  yeah, i definitely believe so. if someone is *too* cheerful, then there's the potential that their optimism overshadows realistic outlooks on life, and they're basically living in an illusion as opposed to facing reality.

  no, i don't judge people's pasts. my boyfriend has a checkered past himself, and i understand that he's a different person now and what's in the past is staying in the past. people make mistakes and learn from them, and as long as they recognize their behavior was hurtful and make amends to be a better person, then that past doesn't matter to me.

   education or indoctrination ❓  there is an ongoing debate about whether or not to introduce LGBT+ relationships & s*xual/gender identity as part of elementary school curriculum. two states have officially required this & 600 children were withdrawn from a birmingham (UK) school in protest. thoughts?
  ","
  i don't know much about elementary-aged children to begin with, so my opinion may be a bit uninformed. however, i believe lgbt+ relationships and gender identity should be introduced into curriculum during the middle school years, like around the ages of 10-14 or so. they're old enough at that point to understand what they're being taught and also to understand their own emotions and feelings toward the subject.
  "
407401,"
   Is it normal to NOT want my parents or family to know anything about my life, or attend any events/graduation/ or follow me on social media? basically anything? I don’t know I’m just very uncomfortable and embarrassed of them, my mother was abusive and dad did a lot of shit so that could be related?
  ","
  it's quite common for ab*se survivors, actually. you were hurt by their actions, and perhaps even traumatized by them, and so as a result, you want to shut them out of your emotions, life, events, etc etc., because that shows vulnerability and you don't want your well being to be compromised again.
  
  i'm the exact same way. i don't key my family in to any aspect of my life at all, i'm shut off from my family emotionally, and i don't tell them anything about what's going on in my life besides big events (i.e., me getting my new job two years ago). i'm also very uncomfortable around and embarrassed by my parents, particularly my mother, so i totally empathize with your situation.
  "

  the original rainbow flag should do the job just fine, lol. there are also flags for being gay, bi, lesbian, trans, non-binary, asexual, etc etc. i just personally believe the original rainbow flag encompasses everything.
  "
407403,"
   It basically consists of some new colours, maybe you could google it? I don’t really know how to explain it sorry!
  ","
  is this the one?
  
  seems like, according to google, the black and brown lines represent marginalized communities, and the rest of the new colors represent the trans community. i think it's good that it's more inclusive, but i also believe it's a bit unnecessary since they have their own flags as well.
  "
407404,"
   I saw that they is an updated pride flag. Do you think it should be updated? Or stay the same?
  ","
  i didn't know about this. what did they update about it?
  
  i think it's fine the way it currently is, with the normal rainbow scheme. there are plenty of other flags for other orientations and identities. i believe the rainbow flag jut encompasses everything and is the ""umbrella"" flag for the entire lgbt+ community.
  "
407405,"
   Do you think it’s good for parents to try to educate their children about genders at a *young* age? Isn’t it too much or confusing for them at the age?
  ","
  i think it depends on the child, really. i'm not exactly well versed in children or child education, but i believe that perhaps they should be taught at around an ""older"" age, like 7 or 8 years old. or if the child expresses a gender identity that differs from their sex from an early age, they can be taught about gender at that age as well.
  "
407406,"

  my day has been going well. i woke up around 8am, made myself a cup of coffee, and ran a few errands before anyone else in the house woke up. after i came home, i made myself an iced coffee & since then, i've basically been listening to music and browsing the internet.

  ","
  yeah, one of my friends from middle school, who introduced my boyfriend to me when we were in high school, ended our friendship after my boyfriend ended his friendship with her boyfriend (i hope this makes sense, lol). my boyfriend and her boyfriend were best friends, and when their friendship ended, she decided to cut me off entirely with no reason or explanation.
  "
407414,"
   Would you leave your home country and learn a new language, culture etc for the one you love?
  ","
  i believe so, yes. if my boyfriend wanted to move to cuba, for example, i would be more than willing to learn spanish and cuban traditions. i already know a little bit of spanish through interacting with his family and have experienced a bit of the cuisine through my boyfriend's grandmother, and it would certainly be a learning experience to witness those traditions first-hand.
  "
407415,"
   What does true friendship mean to you?
  ","
  true friendship, in my personal opinion, is having a friendship where both people care about each other equally and reach out during times of need. there's no vying for the other person's attention or affection, and you both can be 100 percent yourselves around each other. you can talk to your friend about almost anything going on in your life without fear of ridicule or judgment, and vice versa.
  "
407416,"

407417,"
   Do you believe there's a deep state type government in the USA ?
  ","
  i just looked up the term ""deep state,"" and i don't really understand it very much but it generally seems like it refers to the collusion of government officials with influential people in various industries to put forth policies and ideas whose true intentions are hidden from the general public?
  
  if that's the case, then yes.

   As someone who is diagnosed with depression, I think it is near impossible to help someone who *doesnt* want help or refuse to change something, however small in their life to recover. Do you agree?
  ","
  i wholeheartedly agree. years ago, although i struggled with depression, i basically didn't want to help myself because i thought i was so deep in the hole that there wasn't any worth for me to seek out help. it ended up making my mental illness worse, and i really didn't realize that until it was almost too late.
  "
407421,"
   Do you think you can escape from being negatively biased against a community if you've been bred and fed all your life with prejudice ?
  ","
  some people can break out of those negative thought patterns, yes. it takes a lot of self-talk, soul searching, and acknowledgment that your thoughts are toxic in order to really get over your own prejudice. it's entirely possible to break free from problematic perspectives against communities (whether it's the lgbt+, black, asian, or spanish communities, etc etc.).
  
  i think it's easier when people are younger, because when you're older it becomes so conditioned within you that it's difficult to really escape from those prejudices.
  "
407422,"
   Are pale skin attractive to you?
  ","
  if i like someone, it's regardless of their skin color. my boyfriend has light skin despite the fact that he's spanish.

407423,"
   What is the best way to advise my depressed friend to practise sport? I mean, I can't tell her :"" Yous should exercise"" or something like that? it's the worst I can say, right? Do you have any ideas?
  ","
  she's going to have to *want* to exercise in order for her to begin exercising -- you can't force someone to do something they don't want to do. and generally, people with mental illness react negatively to the stereotypical response of ""exercise will help!""
  
  sometimes exercising takes away the depression temporarily, but it isn't a cure-all. if anything, it's something that distracts people with mental illness from their feelings. it doesn't actually help or cure the depression. however, everyone is different.
  "
407424,"
   Good or bad, what is the most common thing that other people say about you?
  ","
  most people comment on how colorful and great my hair is, haha. i can pull off nearly any color or combination of colors, and a lot of people indicate that they're too afraid to color their hair a funky color.
  "
407425,"
   Be honest, what is one thing that you judge people harshly for?
  ","
  smoking cigarettes or marijuana around children. i believe it's irresponsible for people to do both, especially regarding smoking cigarettes because of the severe health risks associated with second-hand smoking.
  "
407426,"
   Do you think that men are more rational and women are more emotional?
  ","
  no, i believe that's a common misconception that arises out of a patriarchal society where women have always been seen as ""in hysteria"" and men were revered for being the logical, rational type to make the greater decisions.
  
  in reality, women and men are equally as irrational, and men are actually just as emotional -- this also stems from toxic masculinity, because men have been conditioned to suppress their emotions because it's seen as ""weak"" for men to show emotion.

  there are actually a lot of physical cues to tell if someone is lying. a few of them are ;

  -- verbal/non-verbal contradictions, i.e. someone nodding while saying ""no"" or looking off to the side while speaking.
  
  -- hiding their mouth or eyes while speaking.
  
  -- gulping or swallowing before answering a question or speaking.
  
  -- hand-to-face activity, i.e. picking at the lips, scratching the head, pulling on the ears, etc etc. it means their anxiety has been triggered.
  
  -- adjusting their shirt, fixing their glasses, playing with their hair, or wiping sweat off their brow.

  honestly, most of the time i dream about work, lmao. which is absolutely terrible but i guess it means that it's taking over my life.
  
  i actually had a dream the other night that my coworker and i went to a party together, and she asked me to grab a gun from her car and keep it in the back of my pants in case anything bad happened. i was hiding it from people, obviously.
  
  when i woke up, i told my coworker about the dream & she looked up what it means, and apparently hiding a gun in a dream means that i'm suppressing feelings of anger. which ... isn't really untrue, haha.
  "
407433,"
   Biggest regret?
  ","
  in general, i try not to regret things in my life. i believe that it's useless and harmful to focus on past events and wonder what you could have done differently, because there isn't anything you can do to change them now. you can only accept them for what they are and move on.
  
  however, one thing i do sorta regret is beginning self-h*arm. i was 11 years old and finally stopped when i was around 18 years old. it took over my entire teenage years.

  all of my favorite vacations involved the trees, mountains, fields, rivers, etc etc. my boyfriend and i used to travel to upstate new york often & i absolutely loved the atmosphere, the nature, the fresh air, and the starry night sky (which you can't see where i live).
  
  i like vacations where you don't have a specific repertoire, you can do whatever you want whenever you want to. i find that having a lot of vacation plans is really overwhelming and you don't really get to enjoy the freedom and spontaneity of being on vacation.

   What makes you immediately dislike a person?
  ","
  arrogance -- believing that they're better or higher-up than other people because they have money, or are attractive, or own a nice car, or have a nice job, etc etc. no one is inherently better than anyone else and it's sickening and unappealing when a person believes they're entitled to more things than others.

  i don't really think it's a good thing to judge people in general without knowing them personally first. in the case of askfm, i think reading people's answers may give off the impression that we ""know"" someone, but really people only post what they *want* to post and it often isn't a full representation of who they really are.

  aw, thank you !!
  
  when i was much younger (like my early teen years), i would sort of adopt rowling's writing style but create my own stories, which at that time was mainly fan fiction. i also read a lot of stephen king's books and anne rice's books & enjoyed their descriptive style, so i also tried adopting those styles and emulated them in my own writing, during a time when i was trying to find my own unique voice.
  
  eventually i branched out from adopting other people's styles, and as i got older, my writing matured. i still don't have an established voice per say because my style does change slightly depending on what i'm writing, but now i definitely know how to write things according to my own perspectives while maintaining my own voice.

book vs kindle vs audio books

  i need to read books because alongside the voice in my mind reading the words to me, i need the physical act of seeing the words on the page in front of me in order to really grasp the material. audiobooks don't translate well to me, it's difficult for me to follow.
  
  i also don't like reading books on kindles and other screens, it hurts my eyes after a while.

   that’s not just where you live, that’s pretty much everywhere. i dislike the attitude, which is wrong btw, that those who cant pay their bills just arent trying hard enough. if you dont want to date a person who doesnt have a good, steady income thats your perogative but dont imply poor ppl should -

  i wasn't implying that those who can't afford to pay their bills in general aren't trying hard enough. i was inferring that i wouldn't be interested in dating someone who couldn't pay their bills, and they weren't interested in doing any better than that. i wasn't making a general statement about poor people, it was localized to one specific situation.
  
  however, i do understand what you mean and agree wholeheartedly. i also come from a background where i didn't make enough money to pay my bills either when i was much younger, and it had no reflection on my work ethic. i was just in a sh*tty job with a sh*tty situation at the time.

  unsuccessful people, on the other hand, are people with no real drive or motivation to better themselves. they're just sorta existing or they take advantage of those around them.

   Yes that’s exactly how I feel like. I have been in a breakdown many times, and sent distressing messages, but she sees and never replies. She told me before herself that she cares, she just doesn’t know how to reply. But honestly i would have preferred her to at least say something.
  ","
  (cont) ... Oh and also sometimes I think I might have to let them go. Probably not but the thought has definitely crossed my mind. But I have no one except for them and I am scared I might make the wrong choice, I don’t know. Not replying to my texts during a breakdown kind of says something, to be honest. When she had a breakdown and all sorts after work I met her and bought her ice cream and all even when I had work the next day. I’m not boasting, definitely isn’t my intention, but when it comes to me, I don’t get anything and I thought I have cut of all people who I didn’t want in my life already.
  
  --
  
  ugh, i feel this hardcore. i also empathize with the notion that you don't want to be alone because they're all that you have. i don't have many friends at all, and if i were to cut them out of my life, then i would have no one except my boyfriend (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but i need friends too).
  
  it's wrong of her to not respond at all when you're having a breakdown or even just a bad day. even though she says she doesn't know how to respond, i agree with you that at least acknowledgment of the messages means something.

  ","
  (cont) ... & that is envisioning how my kids will look like w/ him. this sounds terrible, but i'm worried they won't be cute enough. i mean i know they'll have light skin & maybe ""good"" hair (not too coarse), but not light eyes & it bothers me they won't appear white enough. i know it's wrong to be so shallow & i should look beyond the physical but i can't seem to shake the feelings of disappointment. it's rooted in a lot of insecurity & my own personal beauty standards. what do you think i should do, do you have any advice? thx :(
  
  --
  
  well, first thing -- it's good that you recognize that your thoughts are wrong and they're possibly rooted in your own insecurities and beauty standards. that's the first step in acknowledging negative thought patterns and reversing them, or getting over them to create more positive thought patterns.
  
  honestly, it doesn't surprise me that you feel this way. there's such stigma and discrimination against black people and latino people, especially when they have biracial children and your hope that your child appears white is just a product of that stigma. you're afraid that they're going to be discriminated against or teased for being a mixture of black, white, and latino.
  
  but, you have to eventually realize that when you become a mother, your child(ren) will be the most beautiful things to you. perhaps you simply need to mature more, but coming from my experiences with my friends who have kids, any insecurity regarding their appearance disappears after they're born because you develop such an intimate connection with your child during pregnancy. at that point, you just want to provide what's best for them.
  
  as for what to do ... there really isn't much for you to physically do in this instance. it's just a matter of you thinking about why you have these thoughts to begin with and try to work on overcoming them.

  i don't really think it's these days, i believe it's always been that way with people and relationships. a lot of people are either afraid of or not interested in commitment.
  
  as for your situation, depending on how close you are and/or how long you've been dating, perhaps you should tell your partner how you feel. just because it's long distance doesn't mean the relationship is less valid.

  my coworker lied straight to my face about feeling sick in order for her to leave work early. she claimed she was vomiting in the bathroom at work, but when my other coworker went there to check up on her, she was leaning against the wall just looking at her phone. she didn't wash her hands or her face, which is normally what someone would do had they been vomiting like she said she was.
  
  it was a beautiful day outside & all morning she was complaining that she didn't want to be at work and all she wanted to do was go in her friend's pool. so me and my other coworkers (a few of us are in a group chat together) think that she lied just so she could leave early and hang out with her friend.

   Also I can’t talk about this to my best friends cause I already told them a million times already, I’m convinced they are tired of it.

  i understand that too, about the whole best friend thing. honestly, my best friend and i have drifted apart ever since she moved to another state, and i don't tell her anything about my family and struggles because i either don't want to burden her or i feel like a broken record, always complaining about the same exact thing over & over again.
  
  as for your second statement -- you seem like a beautiful, compassionate person and i guarantee that you will find love one day. you're young and you have your whole life ahead of you, and there is definitely someone that exists who will accept you for all that you are, struggles and all.

   It does help, thank you so much. It’s just very disheartening to have to deal with the same people who were toxic when you were young as an adult, in the same place where it all happened. I’m sure my life would be 100x better if I could get away. Thank you for hearing me rant.
  ","
  ugh, i feel this completely. i'm also looking to move out but it's nearly impossible considering how expensive everything is around my area (i live in new york). my therapist, my boyfriend and i all agree that my mental health would be 100x more stable if i lived independently and didn't have to deal with my family on a daily basis. i could finally be in control of my own life and do things on my own time without having to worry about my family judging me.
  
  also, no problem at all !! i'm glad i was able to help. just remember that i'm always here if you need to rant, we're in very similar situations so i sympathize completely. xx
  "
407577,"
   how can you explain to a friend you love she needs to change
  ","
  this is a pretty difficult situation to be in, so if you're currently experiencing this, then i empathize with you. :/
  
  really, you're just going to have to be upfront and honest with you. space out a time where you two can both sit down and have a discussion, and then explain to her what she's been doing, how it's been making you feel, how it's (possibly) been hurting her or you or the people around her, and provide support for her if she's willing to recognize these patterns and change.
  
  be sure to identify that you don't think anything less of her or that you don't want to be her friend anymore. tell her you care about her immensely and that's why you feel the need to have this conversation. you want what's best for her.
  "
407578,"
   how do you respond if you being teased about your body?
  ","
  it depends on who's trying to tease me about my body. most of the time, i try not to let it bother me because ultimately other people's comments are worthless and insignificant. if they don't like the way i look, then good for them -- they're not in control of my body or live in it every day, so their opinion is ultimately invalid.
  "
407579,"
   Is it possible to be in love with two people at the same time?
  ","
  yes, i believe that's possible. look at polyamorous people, for example -- they date and love multiple people at the same time, which leads me to believe that a lot of people have the capability of distinguishing various forms of love and applying them to different people in their lives.
  
  you can be in love two different people for two very different reasons. humans are naturally complex creatures, and love isn't necessarily reserved for only one person in our lives.
  "

   - (please answer here thank you)
  ","
  i'm so sorry you're dealing with this. :/ honestly -- i've endured the same exact thing my entire life, so i understand completely how you feel. i also feel like i walk on eggshells around my family, particularly my mother, because she can change at any given second. she gives off the impression that she's a kind person, when really she feigns for sympathy 24/7 and turns everything around to be a pillar against her. it also doesn't help that she's physically disabled, because that means my father and i have to do everything around the house for her, which includes her barking orders at us constantly.
  
  in the beginning, i didn't deal with it well at all. i'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and BPD. for a very long time, i turned to self-h*rm to deal with my problems and attempted s*icide a few times. even though i'm clean from SH now, i still have urges every day and i've relapsed every so often. as i got older, i turned to drugs & alcohol. i'm still battling with my dependence on alcohol because it was only very recently revealed to me how much of a problem it was. needless to say, my coping mechanisms aren't healthy.
  
  however -- therapy and medication has helped me a lot. not only in dealing with my moods and whatnot, but also for developing coping mechanisms and changes in thought patterns related to what i'm going through with my family. talking to a therapist about what happens at home has been really beneficial to me, and if it's possible for you, i suggest you do the same. it's integral to find someone who listens. understands, and is on your side.
  
  i hope this all helps. xx

  no, that would absolutely be counter-productive. yelling at a child isn't going to make them learn a lesson, it's only going to encourage them to act out more. ideally, sitting down with your child and explaining to them why their behavior is wrong or dangerous and how it can affect them, and also providing support if necessary, would be the best course of action.
  
  however, every child is different. what works for some may not work for others. from my personal experience, getting yelled at as a child only made me more volatile, aggressive, and careless. it taught me that i couldn't trust my parents so i completely shut myself off from them.

  simply put, you will not be able to have a successful, longstanding relationship with someone unless you understand that you need to actively work on improving yourself -- otherwise the other person will become frustrated, because people are supposed to grow together. by not helping yourself, you're doing not only yourself a disservice, but also those around you.

  ","

  "
407614,"
   Do you think you're civilised
  ","
  yeah, i know what's appropriate and what's inappropriate in social and professional settings.
  "
407615,"
   Would you  ever like a statue of yourself
  ","
  definitely not, lmao. that seems really vain.
  "
407616,"
   Great! Somehow i could guess that you do. Neon lights could make such a amazing beautiful atmosphere. Such a special romantic and nostalgic party kind of atmosphere!
  ","
  nah, i like them because they're relaxing. i usually put some string lights on, turn off the overhead light, and light a candle at night to relax while i watch netflix.
  "
407617,"
   On average, how many hours a day do you think that you spend on social media?
  ","
  not many at all. sometimes i'll scroll through social media in the morning when i'm sitting outside waiting for 9am to roll around, but most of my usage happens after 6:30pm and i'm only on sporadically. i spend most of my time answering questions on askfm, actually.
  "
407618,"
   What is one positive change that you have recently made in your life?
  ","
  i started working out like a month or two ago, and i've also cut down on the amount i drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes.
  "
407619,"
   How often do you feel empty?
  ","
  not very often these days !! usually i skip between feeling nothing & then feeling everything and then some, but lately i've been pretty content with everything.
  "
407620,"
   What do you think about Neon lights?
  ","
  unless this is referring to something in the media that i don't know about, i'm going to assume you mean neon-colored light fixtures. in that case, i like them a lot. i want different colored strips and bulbs for my room, haha.
  "
407621,"
   Phone Call or Text?
  ","
  i'd rather call my boyfriend on the phone, but text everyone else. lol.
  "

  ","
  no, i've never used a porta-toilet before.
  "
407623,"
   What is the most important thing u have to do daily?
  ","
  take my medication. i skipped my meds for like four days in a row once, and i was absolutely miserable, s*icidal, and borderline self destructive. my medication keeps me stable for the most part.
  "
407624,"
   this is terrifying (and one of my biggest fears lol), I'm glad your okay. I'm lucky to have never been in an accident, but my older brother was in a 3-car one at one point. a deer was involved as well and it had exploded all over the road. he only had minor injuries but that scarred him for a while
  ","
  honestly, i have really bad driving anxiety and that's partially because of the accidents i've been in. no matter how cautious i am, i know that i can't control over drivers so i'm always on high alert.
  
  i also have a really bad story about a car accident my boyfriend was in, but i don't want to scare you guys more, lmao.
  "
407625,"
   It's surprising that you missed the club. But you used to party a lot didn't you?
  ","
  i threw house parties when i was 19-20 years old, yeah. i never had a desire to go to the club -- i don't like loud music in small spaces, crowds, or dancing.
  "
407626,"
   So what were you when you used to get drunk, get in nightclubs, you were skinny and all of those things?
  ","
  i never went to nightclubs either, lmao.
  
  during those days, i was a delinquent or criminal, and a borderline alcoholic. i drank every night of the week, did illegal things with my friends, and somehow found a way to work & go to college at the same time. there was nothing ""punk"" about it and it isn't something that should be idolized.
  "
407627,"
   Have you plans for future ones? If so what do you want to get :)
  ","
  yeah, i'm planning on getting a writing quill on my right forearm, as well as a traditional style dagger on the back of my right arm.
  "
407628,"
   How many tattoos do you have? ?
  ","
  i have seven tattoos.
  "
407629,"
   Oh. Does it suck to not get to play with each other as much as you want to?
  ","
  it's a little inconvenient but we've gotten used to it. gaming isn't a priority, it's just something we all do for fun when we have the spare time.
  "
407630,"
   Really? You guys might be popular on YouTube or something if they’re that entertaining lol
  ","
  haha, it's something we've always discussed but never went through with it. and especially now it would be virtually impossible -- we rarely get to play all together these days due to everyone's conflicting work schedules.
  "
407631,"
   That’s bad ?and scary.. i kept my composure and was calm but inside I was freaking the fuck out
  ","
  i totally understand that, that's happened to me every time i've gotten into an accident too. most recently, a work van rear ended my car and pushed me 20 feet forward, totally destroyed the back of my car.
  
  the other bad accident i was in happened quite a few years ago, some old man drove right through a stop sign without stopping and i didn't have enough time to swerve out of the way, so i ended up t-boning his car and totaled my car as a result.
  "
407632,"
   Oh ok. Do y’all live stream your game plays?
  ","
  nah, we don't stream. we've always talked about it though -- especially when his friends are involved, the gameplay and conversations are always hilarious.
  "
407633,"
   Oh ok. What does iced coffee taste like? I don’t drink coffee myself though. And nice. What games are you planning on playing? 

And oh ok.
  ","

  "
407634,"
   I had a scary day today ?read the 5th question down with the picture for the answer it was bad ??
  ","
  lol, it happens sometimes. i've been in accidents every now & again, as well as my best friend and my boyfriend. my best friend actually had a similar experience -- she was driving down the parkway and her tire completely blew out, which made her swerve and hit a guard rail. thankfully she was fine.
  "
407635,"
   How fast are you at running
  ","
  i haven't actually ran long distance in a *very* long time, lmao. i go in short spurts and then go back to power walking.
  "
407636,"
   PAP of your best friend!
  ","
  i don't post pictures of my friends or family on askfm, sorry.
  "
407637,"
   Oh ok. How’s your day going? 

Oh and do you like comedians?
  ","
  my day has been fine. work went by relatively fast, thankfully, and i've just been relaxing by scrolling through my questions & drinking an iced coffee. i'm planning on playing video games with my boyfriend tonight when he gets home from work actually, so i'm looking forward to that.
  
  i don't really watch or listen to comedians, although i do appreciate comedy. george carlin used to be my favorite.
  "
407638,"
   Do you read children's books, even though you're an adult?
  ","
  no, not at all. even when i was a child, i read either YA or adult novels (not *those* kinds of adult novels, ya fools).
  "
407639,"
   Goodbye June and hello July. What was good in June for you and what are you looking forward to in July? ?
  ","
  june was great because...
  
  -- i got my hair re-colored & shaved.
  
  -- i went to my cousin's wedding, which was hella fun.
  
  -- the publication i've been working on since march was printed, which excited me because my name and writing is in the publication.
  
  i'm not really looking forward to much in july, because i don't have anything really planned. however, i have the 4th of july off from work so that will be nice.
  "
407640,"
   What kind of animal represents you?
  ","
  i always thought wolves represented me quite well. i've always felt a bizarre, otherworldly connection to wolves from a very young age, which is the reason why i have a wolf tattoo.

   If you did a trust fall when you fall backwards who would you trust to catch you
  ","
  i mean, i *would* say my boyfriend -- but he's definitely the type to let me fall like 75% of the way down before catching me as a joke, lmao. depending on how hard the floor is, of course.
  
  otherwise, i would say one of my coworkers with whom i'm close. she's a genuinely nice, trustworthy person who wouldn't play games like that & she would definitely catch me.
  "
