different perspective","594478":"ok so i m not much older than you lol i m . so basically i would say to find out if he likes you is go out to dinner again and i would say just give him a hug as a thank you but hug around the waist with your head resting against his chest and just look up at him and make it somewhat obvious that you want him to kiss you to find out . you may need to lean into it at first so he knows that it s ok for him to do so","594479":"yea so more than likely he probably wants to move the relationship forward but he doesn t exactly know if you re ready . so if you really wanted to test it i have a few options . but just before i list those options how old are you ?","594480":"i would agree that he probably does like you in this case . i mean does he offer to go out or do you offer him to come out with you ? if he offers then respectively he could just be nice paying for you because he gave you the invite . however if you invite him out and he still insists he pays for you then he most likely is into you .","594481":"answered","594482":"it depends . if you re a guy and want to know if a girl is into you then look at body language . most likely the girl will be smiling a lot , laughing at the things you say even though they may not be that humorous , they twirl their hair when talking to you , blushes when she talks to you . for a girl who is trying to find a guy that s interested in her then look at the guy body language . is he open armed or closed arm , is he smiling at you whenever you re talking , keeping great eye contact , shaking a little because of nervousness . these are some signs that i noticed from my experience .","594483":"both . but it depends on the situation . if the girl likes a guy but the guy is oblivious to it the girl should make the first move , opposite way around then the guy should make the first move . if they both know they each like each other than preferably the guy should make the move but either guy or
