Its researchers discovered that 30 seconds after one starts watching TV, the brain automatically begins to producealpha waves, a modified state of consciousness. The viewer goes into a trance-like mode, a type of lighthypnosis. All their attention becomes concentrated on the screen, while the rest of their environment is ignored. Inthis semi-conscious state, they become highly susceptible to the messages contained in the programs, especially the commercials, which are created especially for that purpose\n  \n  Read more at\n  \n   http:\/\/www.wakingtimes.com\/2014\/02\/26\/brain-washing-social-control-programming-kill-your-television\/#5HeJ3TAFoqkMcOLS.99\n  \n","640459":"\n  Yeah i know but im watching isnt as harmful as whats on tv.\n  ","640460":"\n  Westerners spend four plus hours a day, the equivalent of two months a year, or nine years in a lifetime, being hypnotized by a television screen without being conscious of the effects this activity has on them.

The central theme is the same throughout: divide and conquer. The techniques are quite simple: short circuit the natural tendency of people to cooperate for their survival, and teach them to form teams bent on domination and winning. Sports has always had a role as a key distraction that corrals tribal tendencies into a non-important event, which in modern America has reached ridiculous proportions whereprotestswill break out over a sport celebrity leaving their city, but essential human issues such as liberty are giggled away as inconsequential.
