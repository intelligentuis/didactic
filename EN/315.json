obligated to tip them on top of that . however , every time my family has had groceries delivered to the house , we tip the delivery person in cash because it isn t guaranteed that they ll actually see that prefigured tip in their pocket .","291376":"that s disgusting . that s literally incest , lol .","291377":"i mean , i honestly would apologize if i was in your position . it doesn t necessarily matter if you believe the portrait is accurate to a tee , he spent time and resources to surprise you with a personalized drawing . portraits are incredibly difficult to draw coming from the perspective of someone who is a former artist , and if the lips and eyes were the only inaccurate traits , then he probably did a terrific job at rendering the portrait .","291378":"i like personalized question the most . don t get me wrong , the spam i receive is usually great but it s also wonderful when people take the time to send me questions that directly pertain to my life , my interests , my experiences , etc etc .","291379":"i rarely get to see the stars at night , so naturally that is much more beautiful to me .","291380":"that s wonderful and all , but i already gave you my response . it s a resounding no .","291381":"i appreciate your interest in my profile , but i respectfully decline . i have no desire to talk to people privately .","291382":"hm , apparently a magnate is a wealthy or influential person . neither of which describe me , lol . i am neither wealthy nor influential .","291383":"yes , i trust him completely with sensitive information . he knows my passwords well , most of them at least ? i don t really remember , and we have also gone on errands to our banks with each other . obviously we don t know each other s bank account numbers by heart or anything , but if i needed to send him to the bank to deposit or withdraw money , i wouldn t have a problem doing so .","291384":"neither . i grew up middle class , so while we did have enough money to get by and weren t technically poor , we also were not rich by any means either .","291385":"oh my . . . you are quite confused , my friend . non binary is a gender identity . it essentially means that i do not identify as either of the gender binaries man and woman , my gender exists in between . it s part of the transgender spectrum . your gender identity is not correlated with your sexual orientation . you can be trans or non binary and be heterosexual , or homosexual , or bisexual , etc etc . personally speaking , i am bisexual but it doesn t have anything to do with my gender . to address the third part of your message no , being bisexual does not affect my current relationship . it isn t a personal indication that my partner cannot please me , bisexual simply means that i find more than genders attractive . once i m in a relationship , i m fully committed to that person . also , my boyfriend is bisexual too . if you have any other questions , feel free to ask ! !","291386":"my boyfriend perhaps makes me laugh the most out of anyone in my life . he s legit the only person recently who has made me laugh until i cried , lmaoo .","291387":"i don t personally believe that s true . i m not that old , and i know plenty of people who began having kids at an older age than .","291388":"not usually , no . however , i ve vetted my list of friends greatly over the past few years so i honestly only keep around friends with whom i m comfortable and can converse with easily . occasionally , we ll have moments where we don t have much to discuss which is normal , but i don t get bored of them or the conversation .","291389":"i can foresee myself getting married , yes . i m still undecided on children , which leads me to really think that perhaps i shouldn t have children at all .","291390":"i ve been virtually every color except for green , but i really enjoyed having blue hair recently . i also feel more like myself when my hair is purple .","291391":"i

have a question ?","291395":"yes , i believe that s important . just because you don t personally have children doesn t necessarily mean you won t be around children ever , and it s better to remain knowledgeable about a topic rather than ignorant . there is absolutely no downside to being educated about a topic , even if you think it won t serve you in the immediate future .","291396":"an astute observation , but nevertheless wrong . lol . i haven t purchased a hoodie since probably last winter , and i also seldom wear makeup so there s no reason for me to buy makeup either .","291397":"oh wow , i totally forgot to post an update , lmaoo . it kinda . . . fixed itself ? after staying up until like am wednesday night researching how to fix it , i ended up just getting frustrated and turned the phone off entirely for the night . when i turned it back on when i got up thursday morning , it appeared . . . fine . it hasn t given me any problems since . i don t know if perhaps one of the hard resets or clearing caches eventually worked after i gave my phone time to settle down , but regardless i do need to buy a new phone because i don t want that happening again .","291398":"the majority of my money goes toward bills , unfortunately . as for regular spending money , most of my extra cash goes towards coffee , lol .","291399":"communication is one of the most important qualities in a relationship . if you cannot communicate your feelings to your partner , then the relationship will not go far . alongside communication , relationships also need a foundation of trust and honesty .","291400":"it depends on who you follow are friends with on both facebook and askfm . both of my feeds are fairly active , so it s difficult to really compare the two sites .","291401":"i discontinue friendships with people when i notice that the friendship itself draws more energy out of me than anything else . when the person doesn t consider my feelings or ask how i m doing , if they focus on themselves more than anyone else , and or if the friendship is toxic . i don t continue with friendships if i find that i cannot trust that friend , and a friendship with me will not last if i catch you in blatant lies .","291402":"those who find it hard to apologize normally have a difficult time seeing that they re wrong about a situation , or they perhaps don t want to come off as weak even though apologizing is no indication of weakness or strength . i ve always been the type of person to apologize profusely , lol . even when something isn t necessarily my fault , i have a habit of taking blame .","291403":"my family celebrates xmas . my heritage is partially jewish , but we ve never followed any jewish traditions and i was raised catholic .","291404":"no , he s completely free from nicotine now . he used the nicotine patch to quit smoking .","291405":"i m already not looking back . just seeing my bank account after this past week is motivation , lol .","291406":"glad to see someone who personally understands . i was honestly feeling terrible on thursday cold sweats , headaches , nausea , and dizziness . thankfully that was the only day that i felt horrible , though . the past two days have been great .","291407":"yeah , i definitely agree . what even sets this situation further is that she went so far as to delete my other coworker off of facebook impulsively because of this situation . that was like , two days ago . i guess she s been dwelling on it ever since , because she went up to my other coworker and was like , hey so after the lighter thing , i deleted you off of facebook . i just friend requested you again , just a heads up . like . . . wut .","291408":"there isn t really anything that i ve refused to pay for . if i need something or want something badly enough , then i ll pay for it .","291409":"like i just discussed with another anon just now , there s no clear cut way to dress like a woman or look like a woman . clothing isn t gendered it s just marketed towards different sexes , my feminine presentation has no correlation with my gender , and someone else s ignorance does not define my gender . regardless of how you view it , it isn t going to change who i am . re the magazine my coworker snapped this shot of me on wednesday , it isn t a photo or a selfie that i randomly chose , lol . he brought his camera into work and we had a mini photoshoot in the office building .","291410":"yes , i wholeheartedly agree . most people just don t understand or want to accept trans non binary people for who they are . it isn t surprising to me at this point anymore i ve always presented myself on the more feminine side although not necessarily by choice , which makes ignorant people question my gender .","291411":"i can assure you that although you may have a preconceived notion of what a woman is supposed to look like , it doesn t change the reality of my gender being non binary . likewise , normalcy is subjective . honestly , having a natural color hair isn t normal to me , lol . the color faded extremely fast , so i m looking into coloring it again soon .","291412":"? ? ? i m still non binary , that s never going to change . it s also in my profile , alongside my pronouns .","291413":"existing .","291414":"yellow roses .","291415":"one of my coworkers is pretty hostile and snaps easily , and she snapped at me and one of my other coworkers the other day . we were outside on break my one coworker was smoking a cigarette meanwhile , me and my other coworker vape now . a random woman asked us if we had a lighter so that she could light her cigarette , so me and my vaping coworker said no . we then said , hey other coworker , do you have a lighter she could borrow ? instead of offering her lighter , my coworker mumbled under her breath and said , you shouldn t be offering my sh t to other people and gave the woman a really nasty look before hesitantly offering her lighter . she was genuinely annoyed that we asked her if she had a lighter on her to help this woman . i should have spoken up and been like , dude , wtf ? but i didn t want to escalate the situation , so i said nothing .","291416":"sometimes , depending on how much sleep i get the night prior . i think i fell asleep by pm or midnight , so i woke up at am naturally . i would have gone back to sleep , but i m honestly not even tired .","291417":"in light of the news articles debuting recently about vaping , i ve honestly been so angry lately because of the misinformation that has been spreading regarding the difference between regular nicotine vaping thc cartridges . while we don t know enough about vaping to conclude whether or not it will give a person lung disease , the articles about being people hospitalized as of late all have one thing in common they smoked thc vapes prior to being hospitalized . however , most people are reading into this and assuming that all vaping is going to k ll you , when that isn t the case . ever since these stories have emerged , i have been questioned relentlessly by both family and strangers yes , complete strangers ! about my decision to vape . coming from the perspective of a year moderately heavy smoker , i know that vaping isn t a fix all . but , it s a hell of a lot better than me smoking a pack of cigarettes per day . i m getting more push back about vaping than i ever did about smoking cigarettes , ironically . i ve been cigarette free for six days , since last sunday , and i already feel x better than when i was smoking cigarettes . i don t have horrible , gut wrenching coughs anymore . i can breathe regularly . i can smell everything . i feel lighter , not foggy or cloudy . it s remarkable . but yes , i still vape . and no , i don t plan on vaping forever . but in light of these news stories , there should be more concern over the fact that legislators are apparently so quick to ban vaping products instead of putting stricter laws on cigarettes themselves , which kills literally millions of people . the system is backwards .","291418":"honestly , at this point i just want to be in a position where i m both emotionally and financially stable , with an unmatched level of independence that i ve never experienced before . i don t necessarily care about professional success or awards or personal milestones , i just want to attain a position where i m genuinely happy with who i am .","291419":"i would get a writing quill on my right forearm ! ! it s the next tattoo that i m planning on getting . i already know how i want it to look and i do have an artist in mind .","291420":"aw , thank you","291421":"cont . . . optometrist said my myopia increased by degrees in a span of a year . i m so scared , literally so scared i may be blind one day . please help . i m so sorry you re going through this . my eyesight isn t that bad , at least i don t think it is , but i understand the fear that you re going through . i would most definitely feel the same way , and my eyesight gets worse every year as well which isn t helped by the fact that i haven t gone to the eye doctor in like . years . are there any treatment options you can consider at this point ? you said corrective lenses won t completely help , but maybe there s some surgical stuff you could look into ? i m not really well versed on this type of thing .","291422":"i prefer listening to music on spotify or youtube . spotify is reserved to actual songs , while i like playing classical music compilations on youtube i . e . video game soundtracks .","291423":"probably , up until i get tired of it . i ve had half of my head shaved for maybe over a year at this point , and i have no intentions of letting it grow out yet .","291424":"every day . i drive to and from work , and then i normally have some errands to run either during the week or sometimes on the weekends .","291425":"my natural hair color is pretty boring , and i ve never been a fan of it . which is why i always dye my hair , haha .","291426":"thank you it s a bit boring to me , but eh . i can t be bothered to color it again rn .","291427":"i made a moving out to do list a few weeks ago and i ve steadily been crossing off things on it as the weeks go by .","291428":"i don t know anyone like me regardless of their gender . most people are completely unique in that they re shaped entirely by their environment both growing up and currently . even if some people have similarities , no one is identical .","291429":"yeah , there s nothing wrong with that . i trust him to not be disloyal to me , and it s perfectly fine and normal to have friends of a different sex gender than you . i go out with one of my friends who s a man pretty often .","291430":"i don t generally play online games .","291431":"i appreciate the support ! !","291432":"yes , i haven t smoked since last sunday .","291433":"thank you ! !","291434":"lol . this type of sh t has happened to me way too many times to count .","291435":"a few weeks ago , i went to a brewery with a friend . security checked my id before we went in and said , thanks , enjoy ! so me , being the awkward piece of sh t i am , automatically replied , you too ! ? ? ?","291436":"lol . god speed , my friend ! ! please remember to hydrate too .","291437":"you were definitely not in the wrong ! ! romanticizing or fetishizing sh is so disgusting and horrible , and the only people who go out of their way to ask someone to see their cuts are people who get off on that sh t . you had every right to cop an attitude with him .","291438":"i was in school , that s the only thing i really remember .","291439":"caffeine , and i m slowly trying to overcome my addiction to nicotine .","291440":"i just go by leigh , although some people from my past still refer to me as lee .","291441":"you asked me one question the rest were just random stories about your life that i had no response to . i have questions in my inbox , so a simple how are you ? isn t really high on my priority list .","291442":"yes , i do trust her but we don t talk very often anymore . it isn t anything done on purpose or has a negative light to it , and i don t have hard feelings toward her at all . we just grew apart slightly after she moved .","291443":"the only phone numbers i memorized are my own number , my parents cell phone numbers , my home number , and my boyfriend s cell phone and house numbers .","291444":"i trust my boyfriend the most out of anyone , as well as perhaps of my close friends .","291445":"financial stability , emotional stability , and probably another tattoo .","291446":"at the moment , i m really digging pink by two feet . https www . youtube . com watch ? v ka s xrrdo","291447":"eventually , yes . it s an easy transition for me instead of quitting cold turkey .","291448":"i didn t dye it blonde , no . this is just what the orange red faded into when i initially colored my hair orange red , i bleached and toned it . the blonde you re seeing now is simply the lack of hair dye .","291449":"it s definitely been a hard adjustment , considering i smoked for years . i ve been vaping instead , but i m still going through nicotine withdrawals since i don t vape as much as i used to smoke cigarettes .","291450":"the official photo of me that s going in the magazine .","291451":"lol , definitely not . which is very unfortunate , because if i could sing well then i definitely would have pursued music .","291452":"it usually only takes me minutes to get ready every morning .","291453":"lately , i ve been really happy for two reasons my name , writing , and picture are being published in my job s quarterly magazine ever since i was promoted to senior editor . i wrote my own editor s letter for the preface of the magazine , which is going to be seen by potentially hundreds thousands of people . i recently quit smoking , and i m on my fifth day of being cigarette free .","291454":"no , the way a person s teeth looks has nothing to do with who they are as an individual .","291455":"ju on the grudge . after i watched the american remake , i found and watched the original japanese film it scared the sh t out of me , lol .","291456":"i don t know if it was the first horror movie i ever saw , but i do have vague memories of watching child s play when i was very young .","291457":"the majority of my money goes toward my bills . other than that , i probably spend most of my spending money on coffee .","291458":"last night ! ! my boyfriend and i had a few drinks at his house , listened to music , and watched silly youtube videos together .","291459":"my office had a moment of silence yesterday to recognize those who have fallen and those still suffering from . i don t remember where i was , though . i was in like fifth grade or something .","291460":"regardless of someone s sex or gender . i notice a person s smile and hair first .","291461":"heathers , american psycho , the shining , i am not a serial killer , the lord of the rings trilogy , the punisher , the crow , and girl interrupted .","291462":"uh , like a supermarket ? lmao . yeah , most weeks .","291463":"i don t really know much about the flat earth theory besides the fact that it exists and a lot of people believe in it , lmaoo . obviously i think it s wrong and there is more than enough scientific evidence to prove the earth is round or rather , spherical round .","291464":"lol , all of my bosses have been terrible aside from my current boss . my direct supervisor is the most understanding manager i ve ever had .","291465":"i ve actually mentioned it quite a few times , haha .","291466":"jefferson airplane s white rabbit .","291467":"i don t really care about their marketing techniques . red bull keeps me awake during grueling days at the office , and it helps me focus on staring at a computer screen for hours per day .","291468":"no ? well , technically i failed two classes in mass communications during my freshman year , but that was due to depression substance ab se more than anything else .","291469":"communications , professional writing , and english literature .","291470":"no , i m pretty sure those commercials were always on in the united states too . i haven t watched regular television in years , though , so i don t know if they re still on .","291471":"lol , yes i did . i remember those commercials used to be on all the time when i was in college , and then the red bull truck would stop on campus and give everyone free red bulls .","291472":"i actually didn t end up drinking it , i was feeling really dizzy and nauseous today .","291473":"lol . yeah , after my initial message no one accused this anon of sending you questions . you were just speaking about anons in general on your page .","291474":"if you re talking to morgan at this point , then please hurl your insults on her page . this has nothing to do with me , lmao .","291475":"i hope those anons never become parents .","291476":"i was going to say , i didn t think you spanked your children to begin with , but i wasn t entirely sure . if anything , i thought it was a topic of past years , not a reflection of the current times .","291477":"you re entitled to your opinion . if you have a question about potty training , then perhaps you can ask svspicion since morgan isn t your cup of tea .","291478":"seems like someone is salty because cajundoxyy didn t answer their question in the way they expected her to .","291479":"it means that they like flower crowns . there s no deeper meaning behind it .","291480":"you can ask cajundoxyy or svspicion ! ! they re both terrific mothers .","291481":"it isn t something i particularly seek out on strangers , but i do enjoy my boyfriend s behind .","291482":"i prefer to be alone regardless of whether i m depressed or content , haha . i really value my alone time because i seldom have time to actually sit down and be by myself .","291483":"i bought a red bull on my lunch break at work today .","291484":"i believe she did , yes .","291485":"are you talking about brittanie ? she doesn t use askfm anymore , she hasn t in a while .","291486":"she s physically disabled and bed bound . my father and i do all of the household chores , all of the errands , most of the cooking , and we have to bring her the things she needs everyday . she doesn t leave the house .","291487":"i sh ed for eight years , so yes .","291488":"lol . . . it s a long , drawn out story . my mother essentially says she s supportive , but everything she s been saying and doing indicates to me that she wants me to stay home to take care of her . which honestly , i feel guilty putting all of that responsibility on my father now , but i need to live my own life .","291489":"men can wear whatever they want .","291490":"i trust my bank , but i m not sure about any others .","291491":"because i ve only ever made enough money to get by , so i saved everything i could .","291492":"i m honestly not the best person to talk to regarding this , unfortunately . i either feel everything or absolutely nothing at all , and most of my friendships that have ended were due to me severing ties and completely detaching myself both physically and emotionally . there have been a select few friendships , here and there , where they were the ones who initiated the distance . . . but honestly , it didn t feel like anything to me . i have a habit of jumping from one person to the other , so when that one person didn t contribute to my life anymore , i invested my time into someone else . it obviously isn t the healthiest thing to do , but that s just my history .","291493":"it doesn t make a difference to me , tbh . i prefer my answers to be without a background , but i don t care about how other people choose to answer their own questions .","291494":"yes , i just stopped smoking cigarettes three days ago and i switched over to vaping instead . which is kinda ironic , considering all of the news articles out now describing how unhealthy vaping is . it makes me mildly concerned , but honestly , there was an even greater risk of me developing a fatal illness when i was still smoking cigarettes . through the various articles that i ve read , it appears that the vast majority of the cases of people becoming ill were due to thc cartridges sold off the street , which makes sense because no one truly knows what s inside of those .","291495":"i m not entirely sure that i ever stopped , tbh . my rational brain tells me that i ve definitely improved since those days , but there s always a side of me that berates me and tells me that i m still the same manipulative as hole that i ve always been .","291496":"i m pretty good at saving money , especially considering it s something i felt like i always had to do during my life .","291497":"definitely not , lol . it literally just became available in the united states last week , and i have zero intentions of using it .","291498":"if i have to get a new phone , i ll probably get the galaxy s depending on the price . i mean . . . i probably should get a new phone anyway considering i ve had mine for over three years , but eh .","291499":"well , i wish i could have spent the day drinking . maybe i would have dealt with the past two hours better than i have been .","291500":"i have absolutely no desire to use an iphone , lol . i ve never owned an iphone before , and i honestly don t even want a new phone . i just want my current phone to work correctly again .","291501":"been through some bad shit , i should be a sad b tch . who woulda thought it d turn me to a savage ?","291502":"i m doing great terrible all at the same time . today was a pretty decent day up until i got home . my phone hasn t been working correctly for the past like two hours , and now it won t even stay on the home screen for more than seconds without restarting itself . i tried everything minus a factory reset . i got so frustrated that i just turned the entire thing off , bought an alarm clock , and called it a day .","291503":"lol wut . i don t even know what this means .","291504":"lol , definitely not .","291505":"ugh , i m sorry . there s really no way you could have continued living that friendship in a lie , though . it would have just built on top of each other eventually and caused even more pain . i m sorry things didn t work out .","291506":"i check it every day .","291507":"yeah , there s a stigma against being fat overweight obese in general , to the point where people who are fat are discriminated against solely due to the size of their bodies , in a medical , personal , and professional sense . people who are fat as labeled as gross or lazy automatically , even when that isn t the case for some fat people .","291508":"sure , it s the same thing as ignorance is bliss .","291509":"yes , insomnia or trouble sleeping is a very common symptom of depression and anxiety .","291510":"i m not a fan of her music , no .","291511":"because he can t afford it . i already discussed this with you guys last week , lol .","291512":"i honestly don t remember , it was years ago . probably due to stress .","291513":"lol . y all are never satisfied . he used to smoke himself , so obviously he wouldn t force me to quit . that s ab sive behavior .","291514":"of course not , he has never cared about whether or not i smoked cigarettes especially considering he s an ex smoker himself .","291515":"i use a smok novo , which is a fairly popular brand .","291516":"no , i ve never had a surgery before .","291517":"we don t talk regularly or anything , but we have each other on other social media .","291518":"lol , no definitely not . just because someone decided to stop using askfm doesn t mean they re not alive anymore .","291519":"uh , i ve never tried on a wedding dress before .","291520":"yes , they re one of my favorite bands .","291521":"i have a vape that i ve been using instead of smoking cigarettes . don t worry , everything is safe legal , i only buy from reputable smoke shops whose products are regulated .","291522":"my day was fine nothing out of the ordinary . i got a significant amount of work done , but i m exhausted so i m probably going to head to bed early tonight , especially considering i have to get up extra early for work tomorrow .","291523":"i think it depends on the quality of the item . even if you use it frequently , it may seem worth the price , but you also have to take into consideration the wear and tear , if there s a warranty , etc etc .","291524":"my benefits are decent , and i have no complaints . i really need to get myself to an optometrist , though . i haven t gotten new glasses in like four years .","291525":"scroll through social media , listen to music , and play video games .","291526":"i don t watch horror much anymore , but my favorite has always been the original texas chainsaw massacre from the s .","291527":"incessant lying , cheating , being ab sive both physically and emotionally , and not respecting me .","291528":"i don t go to restaurants often enough to have a favorite . if anything , it would be texas roadhouse or olive garden , lol .","291529":"i already found true love .","291530":"pinot grigio white wine or greenport s leaf pile pumpkin beer .","291531":"yes , that s correct .","291532":"i quit smoking two days ago .","291533":"i prefer white wine over red wine .","291534":"i ask questions to people whom i follow . i follow them because i like their answers , so those people aren t boring to me .","291535":"around month . that s partially the reason why i decided to quit .","291536":"i ve been at work all day , bruh","291537":"travel somewhere you ve never been before ! ! it s good to have different experiences and experience different cultures besides your own .","291538":"i love taking photos , i m very much into photography . here s an amateur photo of last night s sunset .","291539":"i don t discuss my sex life on the internet .","291540":"my back hurts , but i don t really consider that an injury .","291541":"seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile , having a fresh cup of coffee in the morning , receiving positive reinforcement and feedback particularly on my writing , going out for drinks or coffee with friends , playing video games , and reading a book that i can absolutely escape into .","291542":"uh , does sending them memes count ? lol .","291543":"i haven t really encountered any lgbt person like that personally , but i do know that they exist , lol . there are some lgbt people who gatekeep the community or have internalized homo transphobia , which is really harmful to the lgbt community as a whole .","291544":"eventually , yes .","291545":"lol , clearly you know nothing about either mental illness or being trans . i suggest you do some research on being transgender non binary before spouting asinine remarks like this .","291546":"hours cigarette free .","291547":"i don t believe in past lives . and being trans or non binary isn t an illness , so there s no such thing as getting professional help for it . being trans shouldn t be seen as something you need to fix .","291548":"yeah , definitely . being non binary has really been detrimental to my health and perspectives on myself because of the dysphoria i experience mostly body . my body has never felt right to me , i have extremely feminine characteristics and it makes me really uncomfortable . being cis would be a blessing . i wouldn t have that dysphoria .","291549":"i don t personally believe so , no . however , other people may think differently depending on their own personal experiences .","291550":"oh my god , lol . that s hilarious . i mean , both ? i can t even fathom drinking ranch because that s gross , but i ve definitely licked the inside of the cup clean before . no shame .","291551":"honestly ? yes , lol . i like supernatural , but i haven t watched every season . after a while , it just got super confusing .","291552":"big , giant y a y . i love ranch on everything . on french fries . on sandwiches . on pizza . on cheeseburgers . yum .","291553":"i took the pottermore test , once a few years ago and again maybe last year . came up with slytherin each time .","291554":"i m years old .","291555":"everything ! ! i love the changing colors of the leaves , the seasonal food and drinks , halloween , the cold weather , and wearing sweaters and boots .","291556":"this weekend went by too fast . i don t really have plans for this week besides packing my things slowly . i only have one month before i move into the new house so i really need to begin organizing my things .","291557":"it used to be chain smoking , but obviously i m trying not to do that now . alcohol also makes me feel better but that s also a very unhealthy choking mechanism . i ve been trying to release my anger through video games lately .","291558":"i was never really into fandoms besides possibly harry potter , lol . i do like supernatural though .","291559":"slytherin .","291560":"i m not sure if i want children or not . if anything , i would only have one child .","291561":"uh , it isn t fall yet . technically , it s still summer .","291562":"i m a very heavy sleeper , haha . i don t wake up easily at all .","291563":"if you don t support someone who s lgbt then you simply don t respect them . being lgbt isn t a choice and if you don t support a group of people simply because they re gay or trans , then there is no respect there at all .","291564":"it doesn t matter if the younger person seeks the older person out . it matters that the older person doesn t have the sense to deny that younger person s advances , considering the significant age gap , difference in maturity levels , difference in life plans and goals and milestones , etc etc . any relationship is a two way street . just because someone is interested in you doesn t mean you have to say yes .","291565":"i never connected with most people my age and gravitated toward the older crowds . i dated an year old when i was which was horrible and he was a creep . even now , my coworkers with whom i m close are in their late s and early s . the coworkers who are my age are just irritating to me .","291566":"i have noticed that , yes . i was one of those people at one point in time .","291567":"like i said before , my mother previously had a son . then she met my father and decided to have a child with him .","291568":"no , i ve also never gone so far as to actually hate someone i didn t really know . there have been friends who i thought were intimidating or mean prior to becoming friends with them though , lol .","291569":"i honestly have no clue .","291570":"scorpio .","291571":"infj .","291572":"poeta poetry . lunam moon . they have latin roots , so i just sorta mashed the two words together to mean something akin to poetry of the moon .","291573":"eh , tired . i finished all of my freelance work , cleaned and dusted and vacuumed the house , scrubbed the bathroom top to bottom , ran errands , and did two loads of laundry . it isn t really much in the grand scheme of things , but now i m exhausted and my back hurts a lot .","291574":"and certain details abt my appearance . i did it to seem more interesting and intriguing and i know it wasn t right but we re becoming closer and closer and he has shared a lot w me and is wanting to see pics of me and whatnot . i have some i would provide if i hadn t have been dishonest . if i send some now , he d know i lied . i feel dumb and i really regret it . what do you think i should do ? im embarrassed to tell him now . honestly . . . it s best to be totally honest with him , especially if you two are becoming close and you see this going further whether in a friendship way or otherwise . explain to him how you were feeling and that you were insecure with yourself , and you felt the need to make yourself more interesting to capture his attention . that maybe he wouldn t have been as interested in you if you were just being yourself . it s important that you do apologize and tell him that you know what you did was dishonest , but you don t want this to change his opinion of you . i understand your fear , though . i would feel the same way if i was in that situation , but if i m thinking about it from his perspective . . . if you explained the reasoning behind your actions and acknowledged that they were wrong , i don t see why he wouldn t give you another chance at furthering the friendship .","291575":"no , bullying is generally very harmful towards children and decreases self esteem and confidence levels . it teaches children that they re not good enough or that they should conform to societal or gender norms just to fit in with everyone else . efforts toward self improvement come from a place of understanding your own boundaries and being motivated to be better for yourself , not for the benefit of others .","291576":"if someone wants plastic surgery , they should have the freedom to get it as long as they re an adult . not everyone is happy with their given bodies , and there s nothing wrong with wanting to alter the way you look so that you can be happier with yourself .","291577":"that s very kind of you to say . thank you","291578":"i have my boyfriend best friend , and perhaps two or three friends who i talk to regularly . i m also close with three of my coworkers .","291579":"he used to smoke , but he recently quit three months ago . he s part of the reason why i want to quit too , it s inspiring . he went from smoking nearly two packs per day to zero cigarettes per day . i ve been out of breath a lot , there s heaviness in my chest , and my sinuses constantly bother me . i have a horrible cough in the morning when i wake up before i have a cigarette too .","291580":"oh hell no . hahah .","291581":"no ? i ve known they re unhealthy since i started smoking at the age of , lol . it s been almost years that i ve been smoking . i can feel the effects of it on me already , and it s only going to get worse with time . i also don t like the fact that my boyfriend can smell smoke on me , which means so can other people , and i think it s inconsiderate .","291582":"cigarettes are really unhealthy , and even though i do enjoy smoking , i want to see if i can move into the new house and be smoke free . kinda like a fresh start .","291583":"so i think i m going to try to quit cigarettes completely . i smoked the rest of my last pack around noon , and it s currently pm i haven t had a cigarette . however , i am vaping every hours or so . i know vaping isn t very healthy either especially with all of the mysterious illnesses coming about rn , but it s a good substitute for cigarettes in the meantime .","291584":"they don t personally do anything for me . but if they help someone else , then i m happy for that person .","291585":"no , not at all . that s why i m moving out .","291586":"iced coffee .","291587":"when you feel emptiness inside , it s sorta like a hollow feeling in the middle of your chest where it s like something is missing . it s a yearning of sorts , but you have no idea what you re yearning for so it s difficult to overcome . i ve had chronic emptiness since i was a teenager . and no , my boyfriend and i are still together .","291588":"most religion is corrupt in my opinion , not just christianity . most religions except maybe for eastern philosophies are pretty intolerant , and those following those scriptures usually interpret things according to their own benefit .","291589":"yes , i wholeheartedly agree . i know people who have turned to religion to teach them healthy coping mechanisms , but it is by no means a cure for mental illness .","291590":"i suppose you re correct in that you can believe in god while discounting the corruption of organized religion . regardless , believing in a higher being isn t a cure for mental illness .","291591":"totally , because a corrupt religion is going to cure my mental illness . lmfao .","291592":"quite often , especially lately . i ve been feeling empty almost every day .","291593":"it depends on how old the child is , in my opinion , and whether or not the parents are literally stalking their children . coming from the perspective of a person whose parents stalked my social media accounts for years and still would had i not blocked them , i believe it s wrong for parents to still check up on their children if they re over the age of . but if they re a pre teen or a teenager , then i don t see the problem in doing it in moderation and within reason . children do deserve some bit of privacy , but to give them complete freedom will only hurt them and expose them to dangerous situations .","291594":"the simple response is that i agree with her because i hold the same opinions as evident in my own response to the question .","291595":"uh , everything . lmaoo . i have generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder although i think i m in remission for panic disorder , i haven t had a panic attack in months .","291596":"i definitely wouldn t be annoyed , but i would be a tad bit suspicious , especially if we were close friends and talked frequently . it would mean that they still feel too uncomfortable around me in order to reveal who they are in most cases . . . or they re pretending to be someone they re not for some ulterior motive .","291597":"graduating from college . i know it doesn t seem like a massive achievement , but for me it was a proud moment because i struggled a lot with my mental health during my college years and i didn t think i would make it to see my graduation day , or that i would drop out entirely . i ended up graduating magna cum laude with a bachelor s degree in professional writing .","291598":"the social sciences , particularly as they relate to people s behaviors influenced by their environment , whether that s their family structure , cultural background , or brain chemistry . i m very much interested in psychology , sociology , and anthropology , and i took quite a few classes of each during my college years .","291599":"almost never , or if i do , it s very rarely . if someone is distant from me and they don t check in on me like i ve checked in with them , then i ll distance myself further because i have no room in my life for people who simply do not care .","291600":"yes , lies destroy any sort of relationship , whether platonic or romantic . if you don t have a steady foundation of trust and communication and honesty , then the relationship will not last long or at least be genuine .","291601":"i believe that children are entitled to some privacy , but definitely not complete privacy because that s just a recipe for the child to get into hazardous activities . at the same time , however , too little privacy can be extremely overbearing for a child and leads to them acting out of rebellion because they feel constricted and caged , so to speak . there has to be a healthy balance , and you must also trust your child to a degree as well .","291602":"i normally like all answers to the questions i ask to acknowledge that i read their answer , even if i disagree with their opinion .","291603":"i don t really think of these as political , personally . if they were political opinions , i would be taking about circumcision , civil rights , voting rights , etc etc .","291604":"i m all right . i feel more stable this morning than i did all week , for which i m thankful . i m just finishing up the rest of my freelance work and then i m going to do laundry , run some errands , and begin packing .","291605":"good morning texts matter a lot to me , they instantly make my day and makes me feel loved and secure . it doesn t necessarily mean that i ll get angry if i don t receive a text since i know most people are busy in the morning , but the times i do receive one matter a lot to me .","291606":"i want more people to be aware of the devastating effects of climate change and actually take it seriously . the topic of climate change has become a matter of debate in the political world , which is ridiculous because it s scientifically proven and shouldn t be a debate at all .","291607":"pineapple does belong on pizza . allow people to enjoy things . the friend zone doesn t actually exist . the government and the media collaborate to broadcast and make a big deal out of celebrity stories to cover up government affairs . having a mental illness doesn t excuse you from malicious or toxic behavior this probably isn t unpopular though . adults over years old shouldn t be dating teenagers . it s p dophilic behavior .","291608":"i really need to get back into politics . i feel like i ve been so disconnected from everything that s been going on , and my best friend is super political and it s basically all she talks about in her spare time . she went to a rally recently for elizabeth warren , and i ve been meaning to look up warren s policies to see if they align with my views .","291609":"i don t like attending the gym , i have my own treadmill in my house that i use .","291610":"this is true in some aspects , yes . exercising releases endorphins in some cases , which can make depression momentarily seem like it s gone . however , it is also an escape from depression too , much like alcohol is an escape from depression for some people . personally , exercise has never helped my depression and if anything , it has only made it worse because of my own self expectations and self image . i normally don t have the physical energy to even get up and exercise to begin with .","291611":"i never learned how to ride a bike .","291612":"it s a gender identity on the trans spectrum . it means i m neither a man nor a woman .","291613":"i haven t been exercising because i haven t had the motivation for the past like two weeks . i ve been too depressed .","291614":"november th .","291615":"yes , i m in love with my boyfriend .","291616":"i don t know who that is .","291617":"marriage simply isn t a priority in my life right now . you can be in a successful relationship without needing to be married .","291618":"no , i m not married .","291619":"are you asking me why i haven t been exercising ? or something else ?","291620":"i just woke up and it isn t even am yet , so i m probably going to go back to bed for a few hours . otherwise , i don t have anything planned for today besides laundry and working .","291621":"i ve always put at least into my jobs , because i know the only way to move forward is to keep working toward your goals and being the best that you can be . thankfully , my jobs have recognized my potential and promoted me accordingly , but i wouldn t have gotten to that point if it wasn t for my diligent work ethic and inability to

.","291625":"hello do you have a question ?","291626":"i partially agree with this notion , but i also disagree . i believe there s a large hook up culture , but honestly , it isn t anyone s business what someone does with their s x or romantic life , especially if they re having s x casually and it s their decision and their decision alone . human intimacy is still going strong , it doesn t necessarily mean that it s losing an appeal simply because people are given more freedom with their bodies and desires . we re all simply learning to listen to ourselves , do what s best for ourselves , and live our own lives free from judgment .","291627":"out living her life , obviously not on askfm .","291628":"generally , no . i only really care about a few close friends and my boyfriend .","291629":"it ranges on a case by case basis . you can t really make a universal statement like that because not everyone in the same group will have the same relationships with their partner s families .","291630":"i don t think i ve ever tried it before .","291631":"empty . it s one of those days where i think everyone hates me , that i m a burden to everyone in my life , and that i m going to be stuck in this cycle and rut for the rest of my life . rationally , i know there are people who do care about me but today is just one of those days where i think that i don t deserve them and they can do better than me .","291632":"shehitsback isn t . and even if she was , isn t old .","291633":"what would you like me to report on ?","291634":"lol . yeah askfm has a much larger demographic than simply teenagers and users in their early s .","291635":"no ? there s no age limit for askfm . shehitsback isn t even old , lmao .","291636":". shehitsback on facebook . . i don t

health care .","291639":"perhaps certain reactions to answers , like how facebook has reactions to posts on there i . e . laughing , crying , anger , love , etc etc . sometimes i feel weird liking an answer that s sad because i don t want to seem like i m endorsing their sadness , so it would be interesting to be able to express our reactions to answers in different ways .","291640":"coffee v . tea . how dare you pit them against each other .","291641":"between and degrees fahrenheit , that s my absolute favorite .","291642":"oh hell yes , i would go on live tv . i don t care about who knows , or rather who comes up to me asking for money . i can finally use that money to pay off all of my debts .","291643":"i believe it s a product of ignorance . facial hair doesn t determine someone s personality or anything else , it s simply a choice someone makes of how they want their face to look . it isn t isn t unhygienic either , which is also a large stereotype regarding people with facial hair .","291644":"i think it depends on the severity of what they did wrong . certain things are unforgivable .","291645":"memento mori , a latin phrase meaning remember you must die . it s an expression and artistic symbol representing the inevitability of death , and also the importance of making your life worth living while you re still alive .","291646":"not really , no . i prefer art from the renaissance and baroque eras .","291647":"settle for anything less than what i deserve . i ve gone through life merely accepting things that come my way , including certain people in my life . i m done with trying to appease others whose presence isn t productive or helpful to my life .","291648":"yes . i would much rather be hurt by the truth than be blissfully ignorant .","291649":"they re equally important to me . i don t think i would get along with someone who doesn t have the same sense of humor as me , especially because i love laughing at stupid sh t and comedy makes me feel better . i also find it s easier to connect and relate to people when you have similar interests , whether it s through television shows or movies , hobbies , their idea of fun , topics they re interested in , their passions , and what they re looking for out of life and the relationship .","291650":"i don t want anyone knowing more about me anymore . the more that people know , the more vulnerable it makes me and i m tired of people thinking that my business is their personal business .","291651":"honestly , i like my current workplace . i always have something to do to keep my mind occupied , the work is easy and comes naturally to me , and i don t get bothered by people or have to interact with people very often , unless it s through email .","291652":"the internet and a cloud network . the cloud network makes saving my files at work much easier because i can access them from any computer in the office , as well as from home through a remote login . it s a good backup

i ll be known for my writing and advocacy of mental health issues .","291660":"i ve also been limiting my cheese intake for my own health , and i don t drink regular milk either . dairy has been really upsetting my stomach lately .","291661":"i don t have a diesel engine .","291662":"i don t support the majority of the meat industry because of the way they treat animals . i would like to eventually transition to at least a vegetarian lifestyle in the future .","291663":"that doesn t sound very safe ? i ve never heard of that before .","291664":"i try to limit my consumption of meat and dairy as much as possible , as well as recycle plastic , glass , and cardboard . i don t use water bottles or disposable straws , and instead i have refillable thermoses and reusable straws that i can simply wash . i use regular gas in my car , though . i wouldn t even know where to get used gasoline .","291665":"i m rarely disappointed in my purchases because i always take the time to research

very well , but i would assume so . long island is a very diverse area .","291667":"yes , i ve been purchasing things from the internet since i was in college .","291668":"i have an accordion door , not an actual wooden door with a doorknob or a lock . accordion doors just slide closed , but during the summer i keep it open to allow the air conditioning and fan to blow in . i still get privacy because i m the only person on the upstairs floor , and no one goes upstairs except for me .","291669":"i m not leaving long island , so yes . there are still gang related crimes .","291670":"i don t exactly have a door for my bedroom , so no . that isn t something necessary for when my boyfriend visits , anyway .","291671":"hate is a very strong word and i seldom use it . i don t mind compliments from anons , but they do put me in an awkward position considering only a select few people on askfm who are not anonymous actually know me .","291672":"i m in a monogamous relationship , so polyamory isn t for us . we ve discussed the prospect of opening our relationship in the past before and decided it wouldn t be productive for our relationship .","291673":"no , they usually make me uncomfortable , especially since they don t particularly know who i am .","291674":"no , i m not interested in the mathematics or algorithms behind skyrim . playing skyrim is a relaxing way for me to escape , and i normally gravitate towards the same approaches anyway .","291675":"cajundoxyy is a good friend of mine , and i support her decision as long as her decision is something that makes her happy . i support all sorts of open and polyamorous relationships .","291676":"lol , no . the shed is filled completely with things , and i don t see the point in clearing it out to make a makeshift office when i can just work on my assignments in my bedroom . especially since i only have one more month until i move out .","291677":"i have a shed in my backyard , but it s filled with outdoor furniture and tools and things like my lawnmower , haha .","291678":"it depends on who s saying it . if it s from someone i know and trust , then it s a compliment and i feel honored to hear it from them . however , if it s from anyone else then i feel like they re unfairly putting me up on a pedestal or that i have expectations to meet .","291679":"when a person is shady , they usually have some sort of ulterior motive behind their actions that benefit themselves while they give off the impression that they re helping someone else . these tendencies are normally apparent to some people

at am today . but the second my family wakes up , my work is interrupted constantly .","291682":"i ve only ever owned xbox consoles , so i m inclined to choose that . haha .","291683":"i don t go into the office on saturdays , but i do freelance work from home .","291684":"apparently there are lottery tickets that are being sold for . but normally they re more than per ticket .","291685":"i noticed the other day that i say yeah , that s true a lot . and it really angered me because i hate when my own vocabulary isn t up to par with my expectations , haha . i had three text message threads in a row where that was the last text i sent .","291686":"i have a savings account , if that s what you re referring to . i don t plan on buying land or building my own house , though .","291687":"morbid ,

rest of the year , traffic is horrible .","291694":"spending time and making memories with the people i love .","291695":"i only go to the cemetery to visit one person s grave , usually once or twice

considered a science perhaps a social science ? if so , then psychology is the most interesting to me . i ve always enjoyed learning about the ways our brains control our behavior , as well as deeply

don t have any spectacular weekend plans . i m just planning on doing freelance work , laundry , video games , and seeing my boyfriend .","291705":"oh please . my age has nothing to do with whether or not i choose to drink , and i drink responsibly . having a drink every now and again isn t a bad thing for me .","291706":"that s my specialty . upsetting men worldwide just makes me stronger .","291707":"being attention seeking isn t necessarily a bad thing everyone craves attention to some degree , whether it s from friends or family or loved ones or even strangers . the only thing that would be bad is if people went about it in a bad way . regardless of all of this , i don t see how responding no to an answer is attention seeking , lol .","291708":"haha , no . i just call it by its denomination .","291709":"yes , i ve seen quite a few broadway shows .","291710":"no . likes are meaningless and you shouldn t put such a grandiose meaning on them .","291711":"i have in the past , so

milkshakes . they give me a stomach ache .","291720":"i don t remember . i don t really get embarrassed easily .","291721":"no , and i prefer it that way .","291722":"it s an addiction like most other addictions . perhaps the smoker got into smoking initially because of peer pressure or they were looking for a quick escape , but nicotine is one of the most addictive chemicals out there and quitting cigarettes is very hard for most people to do . coming from the perspective of a smoker myself , i like the relaxation that cigarettes give me even after all of these years . i ve slowly been resorting to vaping , though , because smoking cigarettes is an expensive habit and i m not ready to quit yet .","291723":"personal independence , financial stability , and emotional stability .","291724":"i prefer sparkling water over still water , but only if it s flavored sparkling water . i don t drink enough water to begin with during the day , so i ve gotten into the habit of buying polar or la croix seltzers that have a variety of flavors to entice myself , lmao .","291725":"half of a buttered croissant and an extra large coffee .","291726":"they re marketed towards children these days , unfortunately . ouija boards actually came out first in the late s and were popularized in the supernatural community during world war i .","291727":"i have a lot , but apparently since truth hurts by lizzo actually premiered in , i ll have to go with ariana grande s rings . https www . youtube . com watch ? v qyh myijg y","291728":"haha , probably . i was a teenager , so i don t remember much of the experience at all . i just remember i was asking it questions with my friend , questions we didn t know the answers to but were later confirmed by her parents . then we saw an apparition in the hallway , so i haven t used a ouija board since then .","291729":"not very often at all , and it only happens when i need something that i cannot easily get in stores or i m too lazy to get in a store and don t mind waiting days for it . the last things i ordered were string lights for my bedroom and extra light bulbs for my himalayan salt rock lamp .","291730":"i used ouija boards occasionally when i was much younger , and yes they did work . which is why i always speak out now against using them entirely .","291731":"i accidentally ordered chorizo in a burrito bowl once , but i actually did enjoy it .","291732":"i try to force myself to sleep by laying down with my eyes closed , but normally when i cannot sleep , my thoughts are racing too much for me to handle . in those instances , i ll get up and go outside to have a cigarette , and then maybe make myself a glass of water . i don t normally have issues with sleeping , thankfully , so after i get up and walk around , i m normally okay enough to try to go back to sleep .","291733":"only chocolate truffles , but i m fairly certain that isn t what you re referring to , haha .","291734":"whoever didn t answer with mosquitoes is wrong .","291735":"marijuana for both medical and recreational use . there s no reason why it can t be legal , especially considering how many more substances are legal that are so much more unhealthy and dangerous than marijuana .","291736":"it depends on the nature of my friendship with them , what they said , the context in which they said it , etc etc . it s difficult to really make an overall determination on whether or not i would forgive someone because each scenario is different .","291737":"i don t hold any negative views about open relationships at all , only as long as all partners involved are consenting to the agreement and have open communication amongst each other .","291738":"i honestly don t remember , it s been a number of years .","291739":"those haven t been circulated since the s .","291740":"it isn t really an excuse if it s true , haha . i downloaded mods and it froze on me , so i disabled and deleted them . even after that point , the game continued to freeze on me with no mods on so i gave up and stopped playing it . i think i even uninstalled and then re installed the entire game to try to fix the issue , but that didn t work either .","291741":"after they introduced mods to the game , yes . it never did it before mods existed .","291742":"being afraid for someone s life is the most i ve ever been afraid . i went a day or two without knowing whether someone i cared about was alive or dead and there was nothing i could do about it except wait .","291743":"emotionally , last week . physically , i don t really remember . i ve never exactly been injured extensively , i just have back and joint pains which flare up occasionally .","291744":"this is assuming i m currently playing a lot of video games , which i m not .

heathers . i enjoy both films a lot .","291759":"about a half a pack per day , plus or minus a few cigarettes here and there .","291760":"considering i was born in , yes . lmaoo . my first consoles that i played were things like nintendo and the snes .","291761":"slightly , yes . i ve just been trying to take each day as it comes along instead of focusing too much on the past or future otherwise

not at all . most animals basic instincts and reasons for living are procreation , eating , and protecting their young depending on the animal . humans have developed much more intricate , complex reasons for why we re alive .","291765":"nothing out of the ordinary or terribly interesting . i ve just been working a lot throughout the week on the weekends , as well as getting my belongings organized for the move next month .","291766":"i m pretty sure i was years old in this photo .","291767":"a debit card is connected to your checking account in the bank and gets taken out immediately

to vaping , tbh . it s way too expensive to be a smoker . and yeah , when i was looking for one bedroom studio apartments for myself a while ago , hell even basement apartments , they averaged around month . at least now with the house i m renting with my friends , i pay much less than that since we re splitting rent three ways .","291777":"my boyfriend . i tell him everything that bothers or upsets or angers me , and he s always been a terrific support system . he knows how to rationalize and validate my feelings while also bringing me back to reality if perhaps i m acting dramatic or irrational .","291778":"a pack of marlboros on long island is between and . in manhattan , they re . as for gas , it depends on which station you go to but it s anywhere between . and . .","291779":"yeah , everything from gas to milk to cigarettes to food items and hygienic care . i ve never lived in another state before besides massachusetts , but i was a student , but from my understanding , the prices are inflated here more than most other states , and people simply don t get paid enough to keep up with the cost of living .","291780":"i use my debit card to buy groceries . i only ever use my credit card on big purchases or if i m buying something online .","291781":"moving out and paying for rent and utilities would cost a hell of a lot more than the rent he s paying now plus the groceries he buys . trust me , if there was a way we could currently do it , then it would have started happening already . i m not putting my life on hold and staying home with my parents simply because he can t move out yet . i need my own place .","291782":"yeah , i bet if i lived anywhere else i would have been able to afford my own place years ago when i was paid less money at my old jobs . new york is one of the most expensive states to live in .","291783":"that s a different scenario entirely , lol . ideally , if someone is living rent free they should have the conscience to contribute in other ways , especially if the parents are in need of assistance .","291784":"it sounds illogical , but that s the way it s always been . he stopped fighting it a long time ago . honestly , i don t believe that a child should have to pay to live in their home with their parents , it s part of your parental duties to care for your children even if they are an adult . plus , i would have rather moved out years ago instead of putting up with my family s bullsh t for all of these years . i m finally escaping .","291785":"it s his way of contributing , and its honestly always been that way . he just bought a new car well not new , it was a few years old when he got it so he s paying the car payments on that . i still have a few thousand left on my car myself .","291786":"his car payment is higher than mine although his car insurance is a tad lower than mine , he pays rent at home , and he pays for most of the grocery shopping for his family . he also pays more out of pocket for medication every few weeks , among other things .","291787":"we make roughly the same amount of money , but he has different bills than i do .","291788":"he can t afford it .","291789":"uh , laundry ? lmaoo .","291790":"no , i seldom go shopping .","291791":"yeah , it s the unfortunate truth . i ve only been able to afford my own place very recently , and that s with two roommates i still wouldn t be able to afford an apartment on my own .","291792":"looks are somewhat important because you want to be physically attracted to the person you re dating . however , attraction ultimately does come down to personality and the chemistry you have . if you don t have similar interests or can t converse with each other , the relationship may not last long .","291793":"i m moving into a new place without my parents in a month too ! ! i haven t experienced this before , so i m sorta in the same boat as you . however , my best friend advised me to start packing now so that i m not overwhelmed later in the month . i just bought some moving boxes so i ll be slowly packing my things and organizing them this weekend .","291794":"i live in new york , not illinois . lmaoo .","291795":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","291796":"starry , starry night","291797":"no , not usually . sometimes i ll straighten out the covers if i know i m going to be exhausted when i get home , but most of the time i don t .","291798":"i have seven tattoos . you ll have to be more specific .","291799":"yeah , not much has changed lol . i just started playing skyrim minutes ago .","291800":"yes , i used to be obsessed with harry potter . those books really introduced me to the world of literature and writing , and they inspired me to begin writing my own creative works .","291801":"i have a bookshelf filled with books , and i also keep them on my desk and the headboard of my bed .","291802":"get over it . it s incredibly invalidating , especially in the context of mental health where someone feels depressed , anxious , angry , etc etc . people cannot choose to feel the way that they feel , and it isn t productive to tell someone to simply get over it , and if anything , that makes those feelings worse .","291803":"i don t get shocked easily , so i really cannot remember . nothing surprises me anymore .","291804":"i don t take new years resolutions seriously , so i don t bother making them . if you resolve to do something with your life , you really shouldn t wait for the beginning of a new year to begin doing it . if you have the ambition and drive , you should work towards it as soon as you re able to do so .","291805":"i don t think there s anything wrong with sharing your past history with your partner , as long as both people are comfortable with that knowledge . i know all about my boyfriend s past , and he knows about mine . it doesn t change our opinion on each other .","291806":"there s a space in between . that s really the only difference .","291807":"compromising my own well being for other people s satisfaction when they didn t deserve my kindness .","291808":"i m all right , kinda angry today but other than that , i m fine . i m going to play some skyrim later since i started a new game last night and i forgot how much i loved that game .","291809":"it s only boring if you don t follow people with interesting answers , or have entertaining questions being asked to you . i find askfm quite enjoyable .","291810":"no , i don t like watches .","291811":"this text , lmaoo .","291812":"i d rather spend it with my boyfriend if i only has the option between the two . otherwise , i would prefer if he was there along with my friends .","291813":"lol . no , i don t even sound like her either .","291814":"i m honestly not sure . i m turning in november , so it s not as if it s a milestone birthday or anything . i ll probably just go to work as usual , and maybe see some friends in the evening when i get home .","291815":"i don t have a spirit animal because i m not native american .","291816":"lately i ve been listening to the entire halo odst soundtrack on repeat .","291817":"to some degree , yes . honestly , most of my better writing was written when i was in a bad mental place . morbidly , pain has always inspired me and writing has also been a major outlet for me when i m hurting .","291818":"no . honestly , my intuition is pretty spot on . if i have a bad feeling or vibe about something , then i normally trust that feeling and it turns out to be true .","291819":"i like halloween the most .","291820":"the bahamas ! !","291821":"terrible . i only know how to cook simple meals , haha .","291822":"i don t really care where i go . i just want to go somewhere where i can relax and do absolutely nothing for a week straight . where every day is unplanned for the most part , and i act on whatever i feel like doing in that current moment . where i have zero responsibilities or obligations .","291823":"sometimes i ll have a buttered roll , although most times i have yogurt with fruit and granola . i try my best to eat healthy for every meal .","291824":"yes , the current state of the environment is extremely worrisome at the moment . we all need to take an active step in helping the environment and slowing down the process of climate change .","291825":"other people s opinions and feelings towards me . when i was younger , i was too concerned with what other people thought and adjusted myself accordingly in an attempt to appease them . however , i learned that you simply cannot change a person s feelings towards you if they re dead set on their views , and the only thing you can do is learn to simply not care and live your life according to your own needs and desires .","291826":"i think it depends on the reason why they re against the idea in the first place . sometimes we don t realize that something is a bad idea until another person talks to us about it from their own perspective . you may think it s a terrific idea , but viewing it from other people s points of view is helpful in ultimately making a decision .","291827":"deciding to come home after my freshman year of college after living in massachusetts for a year . even though i enjoyed the freedom , i was in a really dark place mentally and ab sed substances constantly and failed out of two classes . my boyfriend was also struggling with his life as well , and after some tragic events happened , i decided to come home to support him and his family during a rough patch in their lives . it also helped with my own mental health , and i enrolled in a local university where i could commute to school to get my degree .","291828":"yeah , that s exactly my thinking as well . i mainly get the overwhelming urge to drink because she gets under my skin , and i go out as a means of simply not being home . by living on my own , i won t have that stressor in my life anymore . thank you , though i appreciate it .","291829":"sitting alone in my room with mellow music playing having the first cup of coffee of the day listening to the rain and thunderstorms outside sleeping in until at least am seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile having deep conversations with friends being in a clean room after spending time cleaning and organizing it and writing something creative and being proud of it .","291830":"you used to captivate me by your resonating light . now , i m bound by the life you left behind . your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams . your voice it chased away all the sanity in me . my immortal by evanescence .","291831":"my mother and i got into an argument yesterday morning . she claimed i drank too much alcohol even though i severely cut down my drinking from a few months ago , and she said that she doesn t want me to move out because then she won t be able to keep an eye on me and know when i m drinking . it really angered me , mainly because i m a grown adult and she doesn t need to keep tabs on me anymore . i can make my own decisions , but she s trying to exercise control over my life at any possible moment .","291832":"i would have no qualms over cutting off my parents completely from my life . my father isn t terrible , so i would likely stay in contact with him , but my mother has ab sed me my entire life and i have no reason to remain in contact with her .","291833":"i would rather have perfect abs , haha . i have no desire to be noticed by anyone besides my boyfriend .","291834":"virtually anywhere , haha . i want to visit my best friend in new hampshire . i want to go camping in upstate new york . i want to take a cross country road trip and visit yosemite , redwood national park , and the badlands . i want to see europe particularly italy , spain , and croatia and visit new zealand and australia .","291835":"peaches , mangoes , and raspberries .","291836":"yeah , definitely as long as they obviously take care of those dogs properly .","291837":"no , i cannot stand any sort of heels . i can t walk in them and they re very uncomfortable .","291838":"depends on their tone of voice . if they say it in a nasty way , then yeah i take offense to that . however , if they re saying it in a concerning way then i don t mind it at all . sometimes i do forget to take my meds and it makes my depression worse .","291839":"i drink at least cups of coffee every day .","291840":"i just like wearing flip flops or flat sandals .","291841":"yes , the total of maybe five times i ve had a cheeseburger or hot dog this year obviously is the reason why i m fat . lmao .","291842":"yeah , i have a smart tv .","291843":"no , i ve never done that before .","291844":"no , not at all . it s simply an expression of their religion .","291845":"i normally try not to judge by appearance , but i will have some sort of judgment towards you if i know you have the capability of dressing nicely and you forego your physical appearance and or hygiene . obviously this isn t the same case as when someone is struggling , though .","291846":"i really like cozy , autumn styles with big , soft sweaters , striped and plaid cardigans , ripped skinny jeans , knee high boots , scarves , beanies , etc etc . i like the colors and patterns of autumn clothing the most .","291847":"i m not sure if this is an unpopular opinion or not , but i m against circumcision . i think it s the equivalent of female g nital mutilation and it s completely unnecessary in most cases . parents do it for cosmetic reasons and there are so many risks involved .","291848":"idk if this is strange or uncommon or not , but i always dip my french fries in ice cream and eat hot dogs cheeseburgers with potato chips in them .","291849":"i like pinks and purples on myself .","291850":"honestly , i ve been better . i m going through a rough patch right now , but today has been a bit brighter . i did three loads of laundry and cleaned , so at least that s something .","291851":"to each their own . i don t care about what other people wear .","291852":"i don t generally ask questions . i only answer them .","291853":"idk , i feel like i look totally different .","291854":"when someone has clout , it means that they have power or influence over someone else or a group of people .","291855":"i don t really agree with the reason why they work like that , but i do still think that it can be productive for their own health and sanity .","291856":"not really , no . i ve been stressed at work so i guess that hasn t really been helping though , haha . mainly family stuff and i m stressing out over the things i need to do for the move .","291857":"yes , i believe it s a productive use of their time and it gives them something to focus on while they re serving their sentence . being idle for too long is unhealthy for you , both physically and mentally .","291858":"i like most kinds of music , depending on my mood . lately i ve been listening to lo fi hip hop , rap , alternative rock , indie rock , nu metal , and some top pop music .","291859":"yes , i m almost too good at lying because it comes so easily to me . particularly when it involves my own feelings .","291860":"idk , i think it differs for each person . i think it s difficult to decide whether or not to part ways with someone or something that you genuinely love , but it s toxic for you .","291861":"i m still not feeling the best . there s a lot of sh t going on in my life rn , and it s gotten me feeling rather discouraged and down . i feel a bit better today than i have in the past week , though . i m just trying to take each day at a time .","291862":"i don t use the term loser because i m not years old . to answer your question in a serious manner , though , it depends on why they re living with their parents . every situation is different , and some people need to live with their parents for emotional , financial , or physical reasons sometimes related to health . however , if someone is living with their parents and they re not contributing to the household or actively looking for ways to move forward , then i think that is a bit concerning .","291863":"lately i ve been focusing more on the future , but i do think about the past on occasion . i try to live in the current moment , but sometimes it s difficult given my anxiety and whatnot .","291864":"i like questions that are personalized to my own life , such as questions about my education , my career , my hobbies , my relationships , my mental health , etc etc . i would like to receive more questions related to those subjects because answering generalized spam can get boring at times .","291865":"i don t really have an opinion . i think he should do what makes him most comfortable . even though it s just wisdom teeth surgery , he could be feeling a lot of anxiety over the situation since the dentist freaks a lot of people out .","291866":"the only thing i do to my hair in the morning is brush it to get the knots out .","291867":"just because i don t remember most of my childhood doesn t mean i don t know what shows i watched . i remember random bits and pieces here and there , and the majority of life events are completely lost to me .","291868":"i mostly use askfm , instagram , and facebook .","291869":"i remember watching dragonball z and sailor moon .","291870":"the entire experience is exciting to me , haha . the pain isn t so great obviously , but the minute the tattoo gun turns on , i m so amped and in the zone .","291871":"i definitely wouldn t sabotage the training , haha . i would want to give that person the best resources to do their job correctly and efficiently . it would only hurt me in the long run if i didn t train them correctly .","291872":"i m in control of the entire magazine project , from editing the features to keeping track of clients and their revisions that they send in . right now , we re in the pre production stages of layout and the graphic design team just finished laying out the pages . i have to go through the pdf on monday to check for any mistakes . in addition , i have a writer who works beneath me and writes the magazine features in the past , i was the one writing the features beneath the previous senior editor . i ve been training her for two weeks now .","291873":"i don t tend to hold grudges because they wind up hurting me more than they hurt the other person .","291874":"i like going down to the bay , listen to live music , and watch the sunset .","291875":"i m doing a little better today than i have been this past week as a whole . i m just learning to take each day at a time , set small goals for myself , and focus more on self care .","291876":"if i adopted a black dog or cat , i would want to name them nocturne . if they were white , then luna . i don t know what i would name them if they were brown or spotted or whatnot , though .","291877":"i usually go out for food drinks with my friends .","291878":"my bills , lmao . particularly my health insurance and my student loan .","291879":"i wholeheartedly agree with you . you re not a bad person if you don t reciprocate feelings , you re just simply looking for something or someone that isn t the person asking you out . it isn t usually anything personal , but those who advocate for the friendzone make it super personal , like it s a personal insult to them and they view themselves as irresistible .","291880":"i try to give off the impression that i m an open minded and tolerable person , someone who can be trusted and is always willing to talk when necessary . instead of that impression , i usually accidentally give off the impression that i m awkward af because i don t know how to behave in social situations . lmao .","291881":"no , i don t have emotional attachments to my clothing or even most of the items that i own . i routinely clean and throw things away or donate them because i don t like having junk .","291882":"i don t believe the friendzone exists , tbh . it s just a term salty people use when they re rejected by someone they re interested in , and they can t let go of the fact that not everyone is either looking for a relationship or not everyone wants what you re offering .","291883":"money , pls .","291884":"self reassurance and the knowledge that one s power comes from within . once you realize that you re the only person stopping yourself from achieving your goals , you re unstoppable .","291885":"i don t really agree with the concept we re all human beings , we all have things that make us strong and vulnerable , and it s unhealthy to put people up on a pedestal like that .","291886":"no , that seems unnecessary , lol . i ll probably light a candle the first night , though . i want to buy a pumpkin pie candle , lmaoo .","291887":"i don t really understand what true crime has to do with gossiping , haha . the two aren t related .","291888":"an accent wouldn t deter me from visiting a country , lol .","291889":"the scenery ! !","291890":"i ve always wanted to visit new zealand . it looks absolutely gorgeous there .","291891":"i prefer the ocean , although admittedly it does scare me a bit . i only ever swim in calm waters because i don t want the current to grab me and cast me out to sea .","291892":"i trust my boyfriend the most . whenever i have a problem or if i m struggling with my mental health , he always knows what to say in order to make me feel better .","291893":"other people s goals , ambitions , and passions . i think that you can truly get to know someone by discussing those types of things , and everyone has a different perspective of what they want to accomplish in life .","291894":"i listen to more male singers than anything else . although there are a few female fronted bands that i love , like florence and the machine , in this moment , and otep .","291895":"i think it is rather important to maintain some degree of positivity in life , yeah . i believe that people should have realistic approaches to situations , but having positive thoughts definitely helps others work towards and succeed in their goals .","291896":"i would eradicate all forms of oppression and discrimination i . e . homophobia , transphobia , ableism , racism , sexism , etc etc .","291897":"i like psychological thrillers , dark comedies , and gritty action movies .","291898":"i don t like either because i m not a big fan of chocolate . i prefer vanilla .","291899":"depends on the severity of what someone did to hurt me . i ve forgiven people in the past , but these days i m much less forgiving toward people who have hurt me .","291900":"no , not everything happens for a reason . i don t believe in destiny or fate , and i believe some things happen simply because it was a domino effect or just coincidence . to say that everything happens for a reason discounts the traumatic experiences that some people have , as well .","291901":"it depends on the individual , because some techniques work for some people and not others . personally , i like laying down in a cool , dimly lit room with calming music playing .","291902":"lol , thank you ! !","291903":"aw , thank you","291904":"yeah , luckily i m on my laptop so i have a few old photos saved , haha .","291905":"i just explained it . i don t shower in the morning , i shower at night .","291906":"i don t like it when it s freezing outside , but i can handle degree weather . my favorite is when it s in the s and s .","291907":"lol , that s great ! ! i ve lost a concerning amount of weight in the past week alone because of stress and anxiety . i just don t have an appetite when i m feeling this way and i ve only been having one meal a day , usually without carbs .","291908":"oh god , i would be so uncomfortable and angry , lol . i absolutely hate the hot weather .","291909":"some of my tattoos don t have a particular meaning . i have two friendship tattoos , a tattoo dedicated to my passion for love , a yin yang dedicated to my passion for music , and a band logo to represent how much that band has helped me , among others . most of my tattoos weren t terrible painful , except for the back of the calf and my ribcage . those were pretty bad , haha . the easiest tattoo was the one on my shoulder blades and my forearm wasn t bad either .","291910":"lol . definitely having the first pee of the day . i don t shower in the morning , i shower at night before bed . i can t wake up early enough to shower before work , i would much rather sleep .","291911":"no , i wouldn t consider myself to be immature . i believe my maturity level is average compared to other people my age .","291912":"ugh , yes that s the absolute dream rn . it s currently degrees fahrenheit where i live , which isn t terrible because it was up in the s and s only a few weeks ago . but i do love when the temperature is in the s and s , especially when it s a bit cloudy .","291913":"i don t really know about it being completely free since i m sure there s some labor that goes into making a passport for someone . it should be more affordable , though .","291914":"i m not entirely sure , but i know it s over because of the application fee . i think that s ridiculous .","291915":"i mainly wear hoodies during autumn , but i also like wearing loose blouses with comfy cardigans , skinny jeans , and knee high boots .","291916":"i normally switch to hot coffee , whereas in the summer i mainly drink iced coffee . i also drink more peppermint tea during the winter and hot chocolate on occasion .","291917":"i don t have anything that i m really looking forward to in september , i don t have any spectacular plans . i do need to begin packing , though , and i want to get my passport .","291918":"in the beginning of august , i got a promotion to the senior editor position for my company s magazine . then last week , i signed the lease on the house i m renting ! !","291919":"i don t really consider any of my makeovers to be crazy , particularly because i don t really like the use of the term crazy to describe ordinary things it s stigmatizing towards those with mental illness . however , i think the most drastic change was when i cut off all of my hair into a very short pixie cut during my senior year of high school and bleached it to a very light blonde . before that , my hair was to my shoulders and it was brown .","291920":"i wasn t very young at all , i only started shaving my head maybe years ago . that would have made me years old .","291921":"that my office decided to close for labor day tomorrow , haha . my office is always open on holidays except thanksgiving , xmas , and new years day , and the only reason why i go in on holidays is because i earn time and a half for the entire day .","291922":"idk , i m pretty unmotivated rn . i do want to get some laundry done , but i m really not feeling up to it .","291923":"lol , for real . and this conversation all started because an anon idk if it was the same one or not said it was gross to have to clean a bathroom that other people have also been using . like . . . i ve been cleaning my bathroom for years , and i share that bathroom with my parents and in the past with my brother too . after a while , it doesn t phase you anymore .","291924":"i understand this completely , and i do sometimes feel the same way . however , even though there are some genetic components to those mental illnesses , it s also a product of a person s environment . if or when you have children in the future , if you provide them with a loving , understanding , and open home then that decreases the chance that they ll develop mental health problems . give them the life that you weren t given when you were growing up .","291925":"yeah , when i was house hunting there were a few houses that had . or . bathrooms the being the en suite you just mentioned , but they were super expensive . there s really no reason for us to get a house with more than one or two bathrooms , considering there are only three people living in the house and we re all never going to be home at the same time .","291926":"i m middle class the houses where i live usually have one or two bathrooms . the houses with bathrooms cost more than , .","291927":"i literally don t know a single person who lives in a house with three bathrooms at least where i live . it s normally just one bathroom , or two if it s a bigger house with more bedrooms .","291928":"this just proves my and heartofstitches s point . lmao .","291929":"what would you like to know about them ?","291930":"drinking alcohol , smoking cigarettes , and skin picking .","291931":"people can do whatever they want to do with their facial hair , it doesn t matter much to me . some people are more comfortable with having a beard , while others prefer a shaved face .","291932":"an easier question would be what doesn t make me cry , lmao . i have a terrible habit of crying over the silliest , most insignificant things . however , i notice that i don t seem to cry when major events happen until much later after the fact . i ve never cried at a wake or a funeral , or even when i was in the room when we had to put down my boyfriend s dog . it always occurred when i was alone a few days later .","291933":"for real , man . i grew up in a household with four people sharing the same bathroom . when i m at my boyfriend s house , i share the bathroom with other people . when i was in college , there was a bathroom with stalls in it for everyone on the same floor . it s . . . just a bathroom . and as you get older and begin cleaning your own bathroom , you don t get phased by the gross sh t you see . obviously if the situation is extreme and i find my friends pissing all over the place , that s a conversation that needs to be had , lol . but otherwise , it s a normal part of life and living with other people .","291934":"this is a ridiculous notion in my situation . i ve known my friends for years and i trust him with my life and he feels the same towards me . if i wasn t comfortable with the situation , then i simply wouldn t have signed the lease . in addition , it says a lot about your friendships with people if you don t trust them not to assault you . furthermore , assault is never the victim s fault , so to place blame on a person by saying they re inviting the event is extremely toxic and problematic .","291935":"i ve been sharing bathrooms with people for my entire life , it isn t really something that phases me .","291936":"if i m depressed , sad , or unmotivated , i honestly just try to sleep my feelings off and hope that i wake up in a better mindset . sometimes it works , sometimes it doesn t , depending on how severe my mood is . i ve also found talking to trusted friends is helpful when trying to sort out why i m feeling a certain way , and hanging out with someone offers a distraction from my thoughts temporarily .","291937":"yes , the house has three bedrooms one bathroom .","291938":"no , that seems unnecessary and also dangerous . if something happens where my friend needs to wake me up , having a locked bedroom door could be detrimental to the situation .","291939":"depending on what the situation is , i normally go to my boyfriend or my therapist for advice regarding the situation . they both offer me objective perspectives on situations and help me make a decision on what to do .","291940":"lately i ve been thinking about the future , particularly with respect to moving into the new house i m going to be renting with friends . i m in the midst of planning what i need to purchase before the move , how i m going to organize my belongings , and also what sort of phone calls i ll need to make in order to lower my monthly payments on other bills so that i have more money to put towards rent .","291941":"a very old photo , but i ve always felt proud and confident in this picture .","291942":"i woke up from a nap about an hour ago , and i had a dream that i owned a bearded dragon and a yellow monitor lizard . they were both the sweetest little creatures .","291943":"team work , patience , and creative thinking .","291944":"seeing my boyfriend laugh and or smile having a campfire with friends waking up to the sound of rain or freshly fallen snow drinking the first cup of coffee in the morning having a clean bedroom after a day of cleaning and doing laundry being freshly showered and wearing yummy lotion so that i smell nice and having deep conversations about life .","291945":"i didn t have the free time anymore and life got in the way . i ll paint very rarely as an adult but my skills have deteriorated greatly , haha .","291946":"realism .","291947":"i don t have any photos of them . they re from when i was in high school .","291948":"no , they started me off with just one anti depressant . i cycled through at least or different types before finding one that worked for my depression . during the course of that , i was also prescribed an antipsychotic as an adjunct to my anti depressant to increase its effects . then after i was on those for a while , we began to treat my mood swings and anxiety .","291949":"? ? ? no , it s my ribcage . on the side of my torso where my ribs are .","291950":"lol , no . my tattoos are on my shoulder blades , my left arm , my ribcage , and my legs .","291951":"i don t usually watch cable , but i ll check it out ! ! it sounds interesting .","291952":"no , i ve never heard of it before .","291953":"take time out of the day to reflect on their feelings and recharge .","291954":"it s a slang expression meaning that someone has to use the restroom .","291955":"yes , i have heard that expression before .","291956":"no . i have no interest in being seen by others .","291957":"not usually , no . my body is just so used to coffee at this point .","291958":"not really , no . most of my encounters are awkward instead of embarrassing . i routinely screw up my words when talking to people in public , like when i receive my coffee at the drive thru window and the worker says enjoy ! and i reply with you too ! smh .","291959":"i m a senior editor of a magazine at a publishing company . i have a degree in professional writing with a minor in english literature . i mainly listen to video game , movie and television soundtracks , as well as alternative rock and hip hop . i have multiple mental illnesses and i m a strong advocate for mental health awareness . my favorite scents are balsam , jasmine , campfire , patchouli , and gasoline . i have seven tattoos and i m planning my eighth tattoo . i m a coffee caffeine addict , and i drink at least cups of coffee per day . i m obsessed with true crime shows and documentaries . i used to be a painter , and i ve had my artwork hung in art galleries . in my spare time , i enjoy writing creative non fiction and poetry .","291960":"memento mori .","291961":"i usually check my email first .","291962":"? ? ?","291963":"in my backyard at dusk .","291964":"i disagree , but i appreciate the sentiment .","291965":"lol , definitely not . that s highly inappropriate .","291966":"i kissed my boyfriend when i said goodbye to him thursday morning .","291967":"my weight , my face , etc etc . i m not a confident person and there s a lot i want to change .","291968":"i cover up most of the time because it s more comfortable to me . i cover my arms because i ve absolutely destroyed my skin , otherwise i feel really self conscious about them .","291969":"most of the clothing in my wardrobe is black , gray , or dark red .","291970":"very rarely does justice actually occur in this world . the world is filled with injustice , particularly in a political or social context .","291971":"i have one faux leather jacket that i wear during the winter , yeah .","291972":"drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes . i enjoy them a little bit too much , and i know it s very unhealthy for me .","291973":"i don t really support the use of clothing that s made from animals , such as leather . there are so many better alternatives out there , like faux leather jackets , that don t contribute to cruelty against animals .","291974":"i m pro choice . i believe everyone should have the right to decide what to do with their own bodies without interference from the government . it s a health care decision . i m pro stricter gun control . i believe there s absolutely no reason for civilians to own assault rifles . they re incredibly dangerous and unnecessary , and the second amendment is very outdated . i m pro affordable health care and access to behavioral health services . the amount of money health care costs in the united states is ridiculous , and often people go without health care because they cannot afford to see doctors or visit the hospital . this is especially true for mental health care , and often insurance companies don t cover behavioral health services because it isn t deemed necessary .","291975":"myself , haha . i m extremely stubborn and if i have my mind set on something , there isn t really much that can change my mind .","291976":"i prefer online shopping as opposed to shopping in actual stores .","291977":"i disagree with the death penalty . for convicted criminals , i believe it s an easy way out and the best means by which to punish them is to have them live in complete isolation for the rest of their lives . in addition , there are a lot of people who are wrongly convicted and sentenced to death , and often they re proven to be innocent after they ve already passed on .","291978":"i would rather have my shirts two sizes too large . i m not happy with my body , and i would be much more comfortable in oversized clothing than clothing that is too tight for me to wear .","291979":"yes , i believe aliens exist , but not in the stereotypical way where they re portrayed as little green or grey men with giant heads , bulbous eyes , and elongated fingers . it s a bit ignorant to assume that earth is the only planet that can sustain life , especially considering most of our universe is unexplored .","291980":"yes , i believe in ghosts mainly due to my own personal experiences with the supernatural .","291981":"no . despite being raised in a catholic household , i ve really never believed in god or any sort of higher being . i don t have faith that a god or goddess exists , but i do respect other people who are religious as long as they don t enforce their beliefs onto others .","291982":"yes , i m very much a science driven person .","291983":"no , not at all . there isn t an ulterior motive behind why certain things happen in life , and most of the time things occur because of some sort of domino effect . i don t believe in fate or destiny , and i also believe that life is unfair to most . things happen because they simply happen , and the best thing we can do is learn to cope effectively with events and make the most of them .","291984":"this halo odst soundtrack video with thunder and rain in the background . it s super relaxing https www . youtube . com watch ? v mzjjzeephfm t s","291985":"being forced to stay in a room with screaming children . lmao .","291986":"it usually depends on what sort of music the other person is into . however , i normally recommend grandson k . flay nf watsky two feet","291987":"i m definitely more of a nature person than a city person . i would much prefer to trek through the wilderness or live in a secluded area amid forests and mountains than live in a big city .","291988":"my phone , my car most days , at least , and my coffee machine .","291989":"i haven t worked out in the past week , unfortunately . usually i use the treadmill every other day or so , though .","291990":"i would absolutely love to have a big bedroom window that looks out to a scenery of snow capped mountains and trees .","291991":"i actually enjoy being awake in the early mornings when no one in the house is awake , and everything is quiet and serene . even though i m off from work on weekends , i usually wake up around am just so that i have a few hours of solitude .","291992":"that s entirely up to you . if you re satisfied with the job and you can live off of that sort of paycheck , then you don t necessarily need to find a new job . however , if your job pays you either less than you deserve or you cannot live off of your paychecks , then it may be time to look for a new job that will pay you an adequate amount .","291993":"i m sure some people find it offensive , yeah . obviously not everyone is going to react the same to it , though .","291994":"the bathroom is always empty when i wake up in the morning .","291995":"like any other form of addiction , some people get addicted to food because they re using food to mask deeply seated issues within their own psyche . it isn t so much about the food itself , it s moreso about the feeling it brings them that helps them cope i use that term loosely with their circumstances , feelings , etc etc .","291996":"ugh , i understand this all too well . particularly the chronic emptiness , which goes hand in hand with my depression as well . my feelings of emptiness have gotten better over the years , but they still occur occasionally when i m in the midst of an episode and my emotions are a roller coaster everywhere . i ll go from feeling everything at once to feeling nothing at all at the drop of a hat . i also struggle with anger , but it s more internalized than external , if that makes sense . i direct my anger towards myself and self destruct , rather than explode on other people . as for how to handle anger and emptiness . . . honestly , it s useful to learn mindfulness and grounding techniques . it won t be an overnight transition obviously , but there are books you can buy regarding mindfulness and how to apply dbt to your life if you can t see a therapist . i ve had one book in particular in my amazon shopping list for months now , the dialectical behavior therapy skills workbook by dr . matthew mckay . it has really good reviews .","291997":"yeah , that s normal for people with anxiety . if your anxiety is detrimental to your sleep , however , you should seek help from a professional .","291998":"as long as the relationship isn t a child and an adult , then no .","291999":"when i m alone , yeah . it s fairly common and normal .","292000":"no . i have seven fairly large tattoos , haha .","292001":"probably . i don t know how much it cost , my parents purchased it .","292002":"yeah , there s a local aquarium that i visit every year or so .","292003":"nothing good , i can guarantee that much .","292004":"it s a tie between fallout and skyrim both bethesda games , haha . i can get lost in those games for months upon months , and even though i ve played them through a million times , i m always discovering more .","292005":"helping other people through mental health advocacy and writing .","292006":"i like eating a lot of protein for breakfast , so i enjoy having scrambled or fried eggs with breakfast sausages .","292007":"when my family re did the kitchen , we got a refrigerator that has a water and ice dispenser . instead of buying bottled water now , we use the dispenser on the fridge for fresh , cold filtered water so that we re not wasting plastic .","292008":"no , i don t believe in miracles . i just believe in science and coincidences .","292009":"a proper computer desk and comfortable chair . i already have a desk chair picked out for when i move into the new house , so it s only a matter of time until i m able to set up the perfect vision i have for my bedroom .","292010":"i talk to courrtana , misphire and cajundoxyy the most out of all of my internet friends . i m so thankful for their presence in my life .","292011":"i don t currently have any pets , unfortunately . i had a dog when i was much younger until she passed away when i was in my early s . recently within the past two years , i ve owned a few fish until they passed away too .","292012":"i wouldn t want to rent a house if they didn t have those appliances , lol . the rent for the house itself isn t very expensive at all considering the area , and it would certainly be much more expensive for us to have to purchase those appliances ourselves and have them installed . the current residents were not there when we visited the house , no . the real estate agent purposely scheduled a data and time when the residents wouldn t be home so that we were free to walk around the house and inspect all of the rooms and the basement and garage and whatnot .","292013":"yeah , that sounds like an anxiety response . if you re comfortable putting that foot forward , i would recommend bringing these feelings up to your doctor so that perhaps they can refer you to a psychiatrist and or a therapist .","292014":"refrigerator , freezer , dishwasher , oven , stove , washing machine , and dryer . unfortunately , we re going to have to purchase our own microwave .","292015":"most people do experience anxiety however , there s a difference between feeling anxiety and then having an anxiety disorder . anxiety symptoms vary wildly from person to person , but generally anxiety is characterized by excessive worrying , excessive fear , feelings of impending doom , insomnia , restlessness , heart palpitations or feeling like you can t slow down , lack of concentration , etc etc . feelings of anxiety in unwanted or stressful situations is completely normal . however , it doesn t become a disorder until the feelings of anxiety are disproportionate to the impact of the event at hand .","292016":"i struggle with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder , although lately my panic attacks have been less frequent and more manageable . i cope with my anxiety disorders through medication and therapy . i take anti anxiety medication twice per day , and i m also in therapy twice per month . my anxiety normally comes in waves , though for example , today my anxiety is extremely bad , so i haven t been able to do much of anything today at all . i m only starting to stabilize now , and it s already pm .","292017":"the family who s currently living at the house isn t moving out until around september th . then the landlord wants around two weeks time in order to freshly paint the walls and clean the carpets and check up on whether or not appliances need repairing . so we re getting the keys around october th .","292018":"i m left handed , but i never learned how to properly write with my left hand most lefties curve their hands to write from the top , so my left hand is constantly dirty with ink . before i graduated with a bachelor s degree , i was basically a stereotypical neo hippie in the early s who formerly attended a liberal arts school in an artsy area of massachusetts . the only hair color i ve never had is green . i ve had every other variant of color that i can think of i . e . both bright and dark red , bright orange , yellow , bright and dark blue , bright and dark purple , brown , gray , and black . my favorite scents are gasoline , balsam , patchouli , jasmine , and freshly brewed coffee . i ve lived on long island my entire life , but i ve never visited fire island before .","292019":"tbh all stigmas against mental health should be abolished . however , i believe the biggest stigma that exists is this notion that all mentally ill people are a danger to society and should be treated with hostility and caution . particularly when it comes to complex disorders i . e . personality disorders or psychotic disorders , there has always been a tremendous stigma stating that these people are dangerous or capable of doing harm to another person . however , studies have shown that mentally ill people as a whole are more of a danger to themselves than anyone else , and most mentally ill people could never imagine hurting another person in their life , friend or stranger . the stigma that we re all dangerous is extremely hurtful in itself and further pushes mentally ill people away from obtaining the proper help they need .","292020":"i ve only ever used the laundromat on a few occasions . but uh , you do know that laundromats have dryers too right . lol .","292021":"yeah , from my understanding the strength of coffee is determined by the ratio of coffee grinds to water during brewing . for example , if you re making a pot of coffee , if you want a stronger pot then you ll put more grinds into the filter instead of less grinds .","292022":"i m terribly sorry that you re going through this . have you sat down and talked to him about this yet ? it s definitely a conversation worth having , especially considering you were under the impression that you two were exclusive to one another . you deserve to know the truth , and to be perfectly honest , i wouldn t want to personally be with someone who isn t honest enough to tell me about them developing feelings for another person before they go ahead and act on those feelings . that s a pretty sh tty thing for someone to do .","292023":"oh wow , that s terrible . as if your medical conditions have any factor on whether or not you re a good student . i know plenty of people who completed college despite their medical conditions , both physical and mental , and just because you re diagnosed by a physician with a disorder doesn t mean you re not qualified to be a student . in this case , i suppose you have no other choice but to disclose your mental illnesses to your potential schools . however , depression and anxiety are extremely common disorders , so i honestly don t see them giving you a hard time about them . and if they do discriminate against you because of your medical history , that isn t a school you should want to be affiliated with anyway .","292024":"hello do you have a question ?","292025":"yes , i was the toxic and bad person in other people s lives a long time ago . i was a party animal , insatiable , and completely and utterly selfish . i did things that aligned with my own desires with little regard of other people s feelings , and a lot of others got hurt along the way . after i grew out of that phase of my life , i lost a lot of people .","292026":"perhaps buy an aisle seat instead of a window seat so that you can walk around when necessary . you may also want to talk to your physician regarding prescribing you a small amount of medication that will help you relax on the plane .","292027":"i text one of my close friends the most , actually . i was initially going to say my boyfriend , but we talk on the phone more than anything else .","292028":"yeah , i log on every afternoon when i m bored to answer questions here and there . it s a good way to waste time , lol .","292029":"i prefer saturdays , considering i don t work on saturday except for my freelance work at home .","292030":"i wholeheartedly agree . relationships are difficult on their own , so to throw depression into the mix just makes it much more complicated . but i don t believe relationships are doomed to fail if both partners have depression , though .","292031":"cadence and i are friendly , yes . she s helped me out before regarding my mental health , so i ll always be grateful for that .","292032":"someone anonymously sent me a link to one of their answers , but other than that , no . i wasn t on askfm yesterday .","292033":"reading , writing , painting , playing video games , and photography .","292034":"i don t involve myself in drama at all because i think it s stupid , but i can t help but admit that i do like remaining aware of what s going on , haha .","292035":"this is a very difficult question to answer , haha . has been a roller coaster of a year for me , and terrible things have happened but also really great things have happened as well . it s hard to say whether or not things got better or worse since .","292036":"i have a tendency to cry over small , meaningless things and clam up and become distant over large , meaningful things . for example , i ve cried over perfectly happy songs before . i ve cried over my coffee spilling on the way into work . i ve cried over situations that don t even pertain to me but because i could empathize with the other person . however , it s extremely difficult for me to express emotion with big events , like at funerals and such . it takes me about a week to process those emotions , which makes me feel like a sh t person because everyone else in the room is crying and i m sitting there emotionless .","292037":"my only plan for tomorrow is to successfully make it into work which is probably going to be a feat in itself , considering i m exhausted but still seeing a friend tonight . i don t even care if i don t get any work done tomorrow , i just need to show up . lmao .","292038":"in person . i m not a big fan of texting , so i ll text in order to make plans instead of text in order to have a conversation . i would much rather have a face to face conversation instead .","292039":"i don t have any plans this weekend , besides perhaps doing some freelance work on the side for extra cash . i mainly want to sleep , do laundry , and have two days where i have no real obligations or responsibilities .","292040":"i m not afraid of people , no . however , i seriously dislike most people and actively try to avoid them at all costs .","292041":"i wouldn t personally color my eyebrows in when i do makeup , i lightly fill them in but that s all . however , i don t care about what other people decide to do with their makeup . if it makes them happy and more confident , then more power to them .","292042":"i woke up at am . five minutes before my alarm was supposed to go off , smh .","292043":"a gallon of water , extra strength ibuprofen , and sleep . my body is so sore from the amount of stress i ve been going through , i must be thrashing myself in my sleep or something .","292044":"i don t foresee myself having children tbh . but to answer your question , if my hypothetical child was caught bullying someone else , then i would have a serious talk with them regarding why they thought that behavior was appropriate . i would question if they re upset about something in their life that would cause them to act out in such a hurtful way . and i would discipline them accordingly , but also show them that i m here for support . most bullies out out of a need for attention to fill a void in their life , so i would want to understand what my child needs psychologically in order to prevent future bullying behavior .","292045":"yes . when i was like years old , i met the members of linkin park . they were having a meet n greet right before their concert , so i was able to shake their hands and talk to them and get their autographs .","292046":"it varies depending on the individual . for some people who are mentally ill , having a healthy diet and exercising does improve their mental health as a result there are also studies showing the inter connection between your gut health and mental health . personally speaking , i do feel better when i m on a routine , and if i m somehow off of that routine , then i struggle as a result . the same cannot be said for everyone , though . just because a few people s mental health is aided by diet and exercise and positivity and whatnot doesn t necessarily mean it will work for everyone who is mentally ill . each person is unique , so treatment modalities will differ depending on each person s background , resistance to medication , openness , past experiences , support system , etc etc .","292047":"eh , it depends really on company policy and how your relationship dynamic is . a lot of companies out there forbid coworkers from dating , but there are also some that don t mind as long as both partners keep their personal life separate from their professional life .","292048":"i got bullied when i was in middle school and early high school . i don t remember how mild or severe it was , though . i unconsciously blocked out most of those moments from my life .","292049":"i honestly didn t even know that miley cyrus was married . obviously i pay zero attention to celebrity news .","292050":"i have a splitting headache , and i m stupidly doing nothing about it and probably making it worse with the iced coffee i m drinking . other than that , my friend wants to hang out with me and my boyfriend tonight , so i m in the middle of planning that .","292051":"hoodies , skinny jeans , and boots . i ve also been known to wear tee shirts , cardigans , scarves , and beanies .","292052":"i ve never read the book , unfortunately although i do own it . i absolutely love the movie , and i ve always wanted to see the musical .","292053":"i do have joint pain , but i m not sure if it s from my medication or not . i started working in an office about a year or so before i began treatment for my mental health , so by the time i got started on medication , i was experiencing joint pain . therefore , i m not sure if my pain is due to sitting down at a desk all day or because of my medication or maybe both ? . perhaps ask your doctor ? i never heard of joint pain as a side effect , but anything is possible .","292054":"i don t personally know of anyone who was in that scenario when i was in high school i knew of people , but i wasn t close with them or anything . but in most cases , it stems from a dysfunctional home life so i sympathize with most of those cases . occasionally , you ll see a student who really has no excuse for their behavior at all but there s usually a deeply rooted , underlying issue for why children party , flunk classes , and get kicked out of school .","292055":"no , definitely not . if i was pregnant , i would get an abortion .","292056":"i think it depends entirely on the individual animal . i ve met some really smart , and also really stupid , cats and the same can be said for the dogs i ve met as well . i m not sure if it s accurate to make a conclusion about intelligence based solely on a species .","292057":"yeah , i m hella flab .","292058":"i go out weekly or so , but it s always with the same one or two friends . i have a close knit circle of few people i can call my friend , and i prefer it that way . i would much rather have a small circle of people whom i trust as opposed to a larger circle of acquaintances or people i otherwise don t care much about .","292059":"i just finished putting the groceries away , and now i m relaxing in my bedroom , drinking coffee , and listening to music .","292060":"i ve honestly never heard of a school i m assuming college or university ? asking about medical conditions . i don t recall any of the colleges i applied for asking about my medical history , so idk if it was simply those colleges or it wasn t a thing at the time . this involves privacy laws and hipaa and whatnot , so i don t know the answer to your question . i can only assume that you re under no obligation to disclose your medical history , physical or mental , but this is something you should discuss with either a law professional or a school counselor .","292061":"depression is not a character flaw , so no a relationship is not doomed to fail if both partners have depression . i believe that in some cases , people might be toxic for one another if they re not actively trying to help their own mental health and are using it as an excuse or a crutch for bad behavior . but in most cases of couples with mental illness , it just fosters understanding and empathy .","292062":"no , i haven t played video games in months . i just haven t had the motivation to play lately .","292063":"most of them don t really have deep meanings , lol . i have two friendship tattoos for my best friend and i , a band logo as a tribute to their music and how much they have helped me , a ying yang bass clef to represent my love for music , and a half sleeve of roses with a latin phrase on a banner among other tattoos .","292064":"yes , i have seven tattoos . i m planning on getting my eighth tattoo sometime during the winter .","292065":"the only thing i did today was go to work . i worked for . hours , drove home , and made a cup of coffee . now i m sitting down and listening to music .","292066":"drinking alcohol , unfortunately . it s one of my vices that i don t have complete control over .","292067":"occasionally , yes . there really isn t much to discuss , though . it doesn t really have a substantial impact on my life .","292068":"i disagree with the idea of hunting as a sport and viewing animals as trophies . it s unnecessarily cruel . if someone is hunting for survival , though , then that s perfectly fine in my opinion , particularly if every aspect of the animal is used whether it s for food , clothing , shelter , etc etc .","292069":"my boyfriend is my significant other .","292070":"i don t really believe that phrase in general . you shouldn t wait for something you want . you need to put hard work into the things you want to accomplish .","292071":"unfortunately , yes . that s extremely common .","292072":"about to pop open a spiked seltzer and watch how i met your mother .","292073":"unfortunately , people in management positions don t necessarily have to call or email you back . it s common courtesy , but they re not obligated to do so .","292074":"i am perpetually in an autumn mood .","292075":"my boyfriend . our conversations are always interesting and we never run out of things to talk about .","292076":"nothing . i don t dance to music , lol .","292077":"i don t love pizza , but it s good every now and again . i like pizza with fresh mozzerella , tomatoes , basil , and olive oil .","292078":"it s ultimately their choice . if they re not ready yet , then that s perfectly fine .","292079":"you re not doing anything wrong . the job market sucks right now for students getting out of college . it took me a year to find a job in my field .","292080":"i don t really ask questions anymore . and how many i answer depends on how active on askfm i am on that particular day .","292081":"lmao , that s what it sounds like .","292082":"having a cigarette outside . i just finished dinner .","292083":"i don t personally like pineapple , but i don t care about how other people eat their food .","292084":"fresh mozzerella , tomatoes , basil , and balsamic glaze .","292085":"no ? cajundoxyy isn t my best friend either . i only have one best friend .","292086":"we didn t argue a lot , but it did happen on occasion .","292087":"nah , i m good . i appreciate the sentiment , though .","292088":"i like the friendships i currently have with my friends . i don t need any new friends .","292089":"i have no desire to get to know other people or have them get to know me in that manner . if you want to get to know me , then ask me questions here on askfm . that s the purpose of this site .","292090":"i ve been talking to others , no need to talk about my issues with a stranger . thanks for the offer , though .","292091":"any sort of discrimination or oppression i . e . racism , sexism , homo transphobia , ableism , etc etc .","292092":"no , we seldom argue . we ve gotten over our angry pasts for the most part , so if we disagree on something these days , then we have a civil conversation about it . we don t raise our voices to each other .","292093":"i have generalized anxiety and struggle with panic attacks . nearly everything makes me nervous , lol .","292094":"i honestly have no clue . all of the argument we ve had in the past were over serious matters .","292095":"no , love at first sight is just an illusion . it s lust at its very core you re attracted to the person physically , but true love doesn t actually happen until you get to know the other person on an intimate level .","292096":"no , i m quite possessive lol . the only people i share things with are my boyfriend and best friend .","292097":"your girlfriend deserves to know the truth so she can decide for herself whether or not to give you another chance .","292098":"i haven t been doing so well for the past few days , to be perfectly honest . but today was a bit better than the weekend because i was able to distract myself with work . however , my anxiety skyrocketed again as soon as i started driving home .","292099":"my summer isn t really much different from the rest of the year . i haven t done anything special simply because it s the summer time .","292100":"no , but i failed two classes during my freshman year of college .","292101":"no , i m not really a silly sort of person .","292102":"thank you","292103":"it s difficult at the moment , and i ve had my hardships in the past . but everyone experiences hardship , so it s not as if my life is much different from anyone else s .","292104":"no , far cry is the only game i ve played out of the series .","292105":"dark or medium roast with one small scoop of stevia and a splash of either half n half or soy milk .","292106":"i don t have an opinion on what other people decide to do or don t do with their own bodies .","292107":"depends on my mood . i like both of their coffee , although i prefer dunkin s iced coffee .","292108":"i ve never listened to it . i don t like her music .","292109":"i use at t .","292110":"i don t pay much attention to people s bodies . it doesn t concern me .","292111":"flabs .","292112":"why would i reveal a secret on askfm if it s something i wouldn t tell anyone ? that s silly .","292113":"i have zero clue who you are .","292114":"the teller at the bank asked to see my id when i went this morning .","292115":"no , that isn t really what defines mania . to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder at least one type of it , you have to have a manic phase for weeks and a depression phase for an additional weeks . there s also rapid cycling bipolar disorder , but the mood swings are characterized by extremes . feeling euphoria is just one facet of manic episodes . they re also characterized by impulsive behavior , i . e . reckless spending or spontaneous sex , racing thoughts , etc etc .","292116":"lol yes , they were one of my favorite bands .","292117":"i think the last video game i played was far cry . i m not currently playing any games . i haven t picked up a controller in months .","292118":"someone who treats me with respect , who has the same interests and sense of humor as me , who supports my goals and ambitions , who isn t afraid to speak their mind or tell me if i m doing something wrong , who is honest and communicates well , and who is hard working and driven in their own right .","292119":"no , i ve never really had the desire to try their foundation , or any of their cosmetics .","292120":"i m only really close with like of my coworkers . i don t know much else about anyone else in my department .","292121":"no , i didn t really care . it was the first time i was ever at that wal mart and i had no intentions to return anyway .","292122":"i got kicked out of a wal mart before . my friend stole something , so security kicked both of us out .","292123":"i started reading game of thrones by george r . r . martin , but i never finished it .","292124":"idk , probably two weeks ago .","292125":"i m in the same boat tbh . i work monday through friday and my boyfriend closes most weekdays and every weekend , so we only get to see each other once or twice per week . it s difficult but doable . if it s possible perhaps one of you can take a day or a half day off of work so that you can spend some time with each other . my boyfriend and i have done that on some occasions .","292126":"samsung galaxy s .","292127":"yeah , i never entertained his questions or statements . they were obnoxious and annoying , so i just deleted them .","292128":"i don t really know which app that would be , so i m assuming no .","292129":"tomato soup and grilled cheese .","292130":"yeah , but it s private .","292131":"not great , but better than the past two days considering i haven t cried at all . i did some freelance work to take my mind off of things and ran some errands in the morning .","292132":"this is heresy . i love beer , i just wish it didn t have so many carbs calories .","292133":"vsco . it s my favorite photo editing app .","292134":"just a color filter , i . e . brightness and contrast and whatnot . i changed up the warmth of the image as well , and added grain to it .","292135":"i don t personally think it s bad , it s a really smooth beer despite the fact that it s an ipa .","292136":"i don t follow people on request . thanks for the follow , though","292137":"lol . it s a watermelon flavored beer it s a subtle flavor , not too overpowering at all , so that s why they served it with a slice of watermelon .","292138":"nobody , lol . i m thinking about what i m going to need to pack when i move .","292139":"thick pillows , depending on the firmness . i like pillows on the softer side .","292140":"i just delete the question .","292141":"well , i write at work but that s just work writing , not creative writing .","292142":"i don t write when i m depressed .","292143":"drunk driving .","292144":"oh yes , my depression is acting up solely due to my own free will because of my supposed need for attention . lmaoo . just because i have good things coming my way doesn t mean my mental illnesses are put on standby . sh t happens sometimes . i don t have control over my brain chemistry or mood swings .","292145":"packing and transferring everything over to the new house , lol . it s the small insignificant things that worry me , like i don t want to get anything broken and i also need to spend money on new furniture for my room that i ll have to build .","292146":"yes , he s been very caring and supportive .","292147":"no , it s one of those things i just have to wait until it runs its course .","292148":"no , there isn t anything to really talk about . i appreciate the concern though .","292149":"i just answered a similar question below .","292150":"not so great the past few days . i ve been depressed , so i ve rotated between feeling completely numb and then crying my eyes out . i ve been sleeping too much and drinking too much . i haven t taken my medication . i haven t eaten . i hope this is just a passing episode because i can t cope .","292151":"i ve always been afraid of getting stuck in an elevator , haha . i know i would have really bad claustrophobia if that happened , especially if other people were in the elevator with me .","292152":"when you re infatuated with someone , it s normally surface level attraction . real love , on the other hand , is much deeper and intimate than infatuation . you re in love with who a person is on the inside , you strive to help them achieve their goals , you hurt when they hurt , you celebrate when they celebrate , etc etc .","292153":"i m afraid of abandonment in my relationships . i haven t overcome it at all . it s a constant , sometimes irrational fear that i ve never been able to shake .","292154":"putting myself out there in terms of renting a house , even though i didn t know the first thing about renting a house to begin with . i had to do a lot of research to see what s a good , affordable price and what isn t , what features i should be looking out for , etc etc . it s paid off because i did find a place to rent , and we re moving in october . i m excited but also hella nervous .","292155":"my personality disorder diagnosis .","292156":"what i do on rainy days doesn t differ much from what i do on sunny or cloudy days . i prefer rainy days over anything , actually . i find rain and thunderstorms to be relaxing .","292157":"my answers to these questions don t mean that they re

capabilities of achieving and surpassing my goals . i just need to have the drive and ambition to do so .","292159":"sorta , yeah . when my boyfriend and i initially met , he was in a long distance relationship with someone else for about a year or two . after we began talking routinely , he developed feelings for me and broke up with his girlfriend in order to ask me out on a date . there s no animosity between anyone involved , and i m actually good friends with his ex . we talk sometimes on instagram .","292160":"i ll order an appetizer if i m feeling extra hungry , but most times i just have a single meal . i ll usually order spinach artichoke dip if the restaurant has it . i don t order dessert . i ll usually only order coffee .","292161":"i m mainly a creature of habit , and the times i ve stepped out of my comfort zone were when i had to do so out of necessity . stepping out of my comfort zone increases my anxiety because i don t like the unknown , but sometimes it is necessary to do so for your own progress and or survival .","292162":"i usually burst out sobbing and my anxiety skyrockets . i can t handle when other people are angry and yelling , it s a major trigger of mine .","292163":"no . i wanted to when i was a teenager , and i even packed my belongings and was writing a note , but i realized i had no place else to go .","292164":"my biggest pet peeve is when people talk over me when i m in the middle of speaking , because it shows that they clearly weren t listening to me and don t care about what i had to say . i find it very disrespectful and rude .","292165":"lately i ve been listening to this halo odst soundtrack video with the backdrop of rain and thunder . https www . youtube . com watch ? v mzjjzeephfm t s","292166":"sushi or veggie burrito bowls .","292167":"i don t know anything about him and i never heard his music before .","292168":"coffee . drinking coffee has always been comforting to me .","292169":"i m usually very calm , grounded , and easy going . sometimes i ll sink into episodes of rage , but it only happens if i ve been suppressing feelings of anger for a long time and they explode after one small thing happening .","292170":"i often ask myself what s the point ? especially when i m going through a depressive episode . things sometimes seem so meaningless to me .","292171":"it would depend on the context , i suppose . there are different levels to cheating , but he s my best friend first and foremost as well as my boyfriend . i value our connection together and i ll always support his dreams and goals .","292172":"my boyfriend . regardless of what we re going through , i m always going to have his back and support him in his endeavors .","292173":"i prefer having eggs in the morning for breakfast . it s much healthier for you , in moderation at least , and the protein is good for you . cereal is basically empty carbs .","292174":"abandonment by my loved ones . i m terrified that people are suddenly going to get fed up with me and leave me .","292175":"pretty much all of them besides marijuana . i ve seen the devastating effects illegal drugs can have on people , particularly heroin .","292176":"yes , i really value the times we spend when we re together . we have a chance to sit down and talk and laugh without fear or judgment , especially when it comes to catching up on each other s lives outside of our relationship .","292177":"i never personally understood the purpose of hitting on strangers online . if anything , it s annoying and immature .","292178":"a cheese stick , or hummus and carrots . i also have spinach dip in the fridge , but i haven t been in the mood to eat lately .","292179":"i probably shouldn t have gone out to drink when i was in a horrible , depressed mood the other night . it numbed me for the time being , but i felt guilty and anxious when i woke up the following morning .","292180":"yes , i do .","292181":"i m not afraid of the dark , but i do feel more comfortable with some sort of dim light on so that i can see my surroundings .","292182":"my best friend . she has always remained loyal and honest with me , even during difficult times .","292183":"relaxing and recharging . i m around people all day long while i m at work , so when i m home i prefer to be alone . i usually just sit down , watch some television or a movie , drink coffee , or listen to music while laying down with my eyes closed .","292184":"no . i m not interested in making new friends , and i don t have whatsapp .","292185":"pretty much all the time . as i ve gotten older , i ve really connected with the comfort of being in solitude .","292186":"no , i don t talk privately to people from askfm unless they re a good friend already . if you have a question , you can freely ask it here .","292187":"i have a tendency to move on quickly from things and people . once i m done with a person , i move forward from them without looking back . i only really cut people out of my life if they ve proven themselves to be toxic or bad people , so at that point then i m already finished with them .","292188":"i haven t really done any fun or extraordinary activities this summer at all , i ve been mainly focusing on work , making money , and taking steps toward bettering my mental health . i suppose the highlight has been finding the perfect house to rent , as well as my promotion at work .","292189":"comfort is relaxing in my bedroom wearing sweatpants and an old tee shirt , lighting a pine scented or pumpkin pie candle , drinking hot coffee or tea , and watching a compelling television show or docu series . ambient lights are lit around my room , giving off a faint blue or amber glow , and my himalayan salt rock lamp is glowing in the distance .","292190":"these days , i would much rather stay home with my boyfriend or a close friend , watch television together , and eat delicious food . i used to love to party and be around other people , but i don t have the energy for most of those things anymore .","292191":"inner beauty is much more important than outer beauty . it s great if you re attractive on the outside , but that doesn t determine who you are as an individual , your interests and hobbies , your personality , or how well you connect with other people . when you re in a relationship , in particular , that person is going to like you for your personality and your passions . physical beauty is superficial and temporary when it comes to interpersonal relationships .","292192":"you simply don t know what is going on in someone else s life unless you walk in their shoes . i wouldn t want to be anyone other than myself because i wouldn t know what someone else s life entails on a deeply personal level . even though i have my flaws and struggles and downfalls , i wouldn t want to take that risk .","292193":"just be yourself when going out on dates with new people . if you put up a fake persona , then your date is going to get the wrong impression of you . you shouldn t change your personality to appeal to the other person , because if they re the right person for you then they re going to like you for who you are .","292194":"playing video games at least , it used to . i haven t played video games in a really long time , i just don t have the drive or attention span anymore .","292195":"i disagree to an extent . i think having high self esteem is a good thing , and it doesn t necessarily mean you believe things aren t good enough for you . having high self esteem means you know your worth and you don t want to settle for anything less than you deserve .","292196":"i thought adulting was going to be a lot easier than it actually is , haha . the freedom is nice , but there s a lot more responsibility than i anticipated when i was a teenager .","292197":"i don t have any pets . i used to have fish , but they passed away .","292198":"me too ! ! i searched mountain aesthetic on google , lmao .","292199":"no , if i set a reminder for myself then i m usually good at remembering what i need to do . in addition , if something is important enough then it almost never leaves the forefront of my mind until i m done doing it .","292200":"i fell in love with my boyfriend after a few months of dating him . the quickest i ever fell out of love was almost immediately after i broke up with my ex boyfriend when i was a teenager . he was just a scummy person and when i realized that , i broke up with him and moved on fairly quickly .","292201":"yeah , i panic even when i m a few days late on my period . i ve never taken a pregnancy test , though . i just wait it out , i ve never skipped an entire month before .","292202":"the smell of the house , if that isn t weird . every home has a unique scent to it , and that isn t necessarily a bad thing . some homes smell more comforting than others .","292203":"i would absolutely hate to be famous , haha . but if i was famous , it would hopefully be for my writing .","292204":"assault rifles . there s absolutely no need for them for the average civilian in today s society .","292205":"lately , i ve been wanting to go down to the beach to one of those cute restaurants bars that are right on the water , during the sunset so everything has that amber glow and the wind is gently going through my hair .","292206":"i m the least confident person that i know , lol . i don t really know any tips on how to be confident .","292207":"i want to find myself again . i ve been so wrapped up with work and stress and finances that i haven t taken time out for myself to really work on myself and distinguish who i am apart from my role in my career . i want to invest time in my hobbies again , i want to travel and have adventures , and i want to feel a zest for life that i used to have when i was younger .","292208":"my passions and ambitions for the future . when i set my mind to something , then more often than not i ll accomplish my goals .","292209":"the mountains always make me feel at peace .","292210":"do you mean people who are two faced or hypocritical ? if so , then i think it s sad that they have to put on a fake persona in order to exist in the world . ideally , people should act like themselves and put forth their genuine selves on the outside . those who are two faced are often hypocritical or trying to appease the masses by being something that they re not .","292211":"i actually have seven tattoos i m planning on getting my eighth tattoo sometime during the winter months . my first tattoo was a yin yang i have each side of the yin yang on my shoulder blades , and i turned them into a bass clef symbol as well to represent the duality of music and how it balances me . i got it when i just turned years old .","292212":"i don t believe that s acceptable , no . your partner should not have the authority to dictate what you can and cannot do in your life , including which friends you choose to keep . in rare cases , such as in the case of having friends who are ab sive or just bad people , i think it s fine for the couple to talk about why they don t want their partner to be friends with them , but overall if it s just the partner exhibiting controlling or manipulative behavior , i don t believe that s right at all .","292213":"cigarettes , ugh . i ve been trying to cut down on smoking so that i can eventually quit , but it s been really difficult .","292214":"i m pretty open to most questions , as long as they re not trolling , invasive , or inappropriate particularly sexual questions . however , i do like talking about mental health , politics sometimes , relationships , my education career , video games , my hobbies i . e . writing and video games , and tattoos the most .","292215":"my friend asked how i was doing , and i lied and told them that i was fine . in reality , i m the furthest from fine at the moment and i feel like my sanity is barely hanging on by a thread . i m trying to take each day as it comes , but i keep waking up and existing with a heart dropping , sinking feeling in my chest .","292216":"les miserables if that counts , i know it was a book musical before it was a movie .","292217":"i m hopefully taking the treadmill with me , although i really have no idea how we re going to do that because it s one of those older models that are huge and clunky and it s also upstairs , not on the ground floor . i m the only person in the house who uses the treadmill . before i began using it , it was honestly just a rack for my mother to throw clothes on , lmaoo .","292218":"aahh , yes i do ! ! i was thinking about her the other day , actually . i was going through my twitter followers and saw her profile . it reminded me of the conversations we would have on here .","292219":"i don t believe so , no . although it isn t obviously as corrupt or broken down as some other countries in the world , the united states is still filled to the brim with injustice , ignorance , and oppression .","292220":"i can hardly see myself in the next year , let alone the next five years . i can only imagine that i ll be living with my boyfriend somewhere , whether that s here in new york or somewhere else , and i ll still be working as a writer and editor . i m hopeful that i ll have more free time at that point to begin writing my own creative books and short stories in the attempt to be published one day .","292221":"last night , my boyfriend and i were talking about saving up money to take a trip down to new orleans for the music and the culture .","292222":"honestly , any vacation i can go on with my boyfriend is a dream vacation , lol . i m so burnt out from working so much that any vacation would be ideal right now .","292223":"yes , i used to routinely steal from the drug store i worked in when i was in my early s .","292224":"read , write , paint , do photography , sleep lol , drink coffee , hang out one on one with a friend , play video games , listen to music , and watch television shows and or documentaries .","292225":"the first actual meal i learned how to cook was bacon scrambled eggs , i believe .","292226":"go outside and have a cigarette , check up on my notifications on my phone , make a tall glass of cold water , and attempt to fall asleep again .","292227":"i usually get inspired to write after enduring stressful situations in my life , because i need an outlet to release those negative feelings .","292228":"a necklace my boyfriend bought me a few years ago . its a silver pendant with small diamonds encrusted in the rings , and the center is an opal .","292229":"overall , yes . i believe that i m a nice person most of the time . i do have my moments where i m a ruthless individual , though .","292230":"occasionally , yes . i usually discover the reason sometime after the fact , though .","292231":"of course ! ! as long as courrtana is happy with her decision to return to askfm , then i m happy .","292232":"hello do you have a question ?","292233":"no , i have a card that i scan at the door every morning and evening .","292234":"no , i welcome death with open arms .","292235":"george carlin .","292236":"lately it s been the show it s always sunny in philadelphia .","292237":"not well at all honestly . i m not going to get into the reasons why , i m just not okay right now .","292238":"i m seeing my boyfriend this afternoon , but other than that , nothing .","292239":"probably not . i like having at least a little bit of hair to play around with .","292240":"i would be perfectly fine with that . they re human beings , they deserve to eat .","292241":"i don t usually have money on me to give to homeless people to begin with .","292242":"stable interpersonal relationships , stable finances , and stable moods .","292243":"i agree with legality does not equal morality . just because a teenager is legal in terms of the age of consent , that doesn t necessarily mean that it s okay or healthy for a teenager to be in a relationship with someone who is significantly older than them . i also agree that the adults who are in the relationship are usually predatory in their intentions , because there s obviously a reason why they cannot find someone to date in their own age bracket . it s just suspicious and concerning .","292244":"i m selective to a degree , but in most cases , i don t have opportunities to make friends and i also don t really want to make new friends . i get along with people in general and i know how to play politics , but i simply don t have an interest in getting to know new people .","292245":"you probably already follow most of them ! ! but , here are some of my favorites shehitsback urlsareshittbh manicmartyrdom cajundoxyy courrtana origamibirds asgardarts daintybumblebee frecklefacedimplecheek kittiemeowsie louisarhale babycadiexo","292246":"i can t even think about eating right now . i haven t been hungry in hours and the only thing i ve eaten in the last day has been a quesadilla from taco bell .","292247":"take a scalding hot shower , put on moisturizer , light a candle , and either read a book or watch a television show documentary that i enjoy .","292248":"sorta , although it depends on my mood . i like dark , moody aesthetics with black , dark blue , and gray undertones . at the same time , however , i also like pale pink aesthetics that are wrought with nostalgia .","292249":"the last person i had a deep meaningful conversation with was one of my close friends , when we went out together last night . i needed to get a lot of things off my chest and vent about them , so we went out to drink and talk about what s been going on .","292250":"my boyfriend . we call each other almost every night .","292251":"i went to taco bell last night and paid for a cheese quesadilla and nachos .","292252":"at this point in my life , i would rather choose a high paid office job instead of something adventurous , but low paid . i prefer office environments to begin with anyway , they may be boring but as long as the stuff you re doing at work isn t boring , then office jobs aren t really too terrible .","292253":"yeah , i have two or three people in my life whom i tell everything or well , mostly everything to .","292254":"askfm , facebook , instagram , twitter , tellonym , and snapchat .","292255":"yeah , i ve had this particular tattoo in mind for many years now . i want a writing quill in black and white down my right forearm .","292256":"natasha lyonne ! !","292257":"i sent good morning to my boyfriend around am this morning .","292258":"yeah , i was planning on making an appointment for another tattoo sometime during the winter .","292259":"yes , it s perfectly legal to carry a taser in the united states except for like two states , i believe . as long as you re not a minor , have a felony record , or intend to use it for reasons other than self defense , then you re allowed to carry a taser on you .","292260":"no , i m not afraid of the dark . however , i do prefer to sleep with a dim light on i usually use the glow of my himalayan salt rock lamp .","292261":"i m not addicted to any gadgets , except perhaps my cell phone . even so , i wouldn t really call myself addicted because i only really use my phone at night .","292262":"the interpersonal relationships you foster with friends , lovers , and family . setting and meeting your own goals , regardless of whether they re career based or for your own personal enjoyment . education and discovering a plethora of information is at your disposal , and utilizing that information to make your life , someone else s life , or the world a better place .","292263":"linkin park korn nf watsky michael salvatori","292264":"i enjoy both action and comedy films , but what i prefer ultimately depends on my mood in that moment .","292265":"i can t recall any particular instances , but more than likely , it was coffee .","292266":"it s a combination of other events going on in my life , as well as my mental illnesses acting up always happens at the worst times , smh . just because i have a few great things going on in my life doesn t necessarily mean i m immune to mood swings and depressive periods , unfortunately .","292267":"sushi is always the correct answer .","292268":"whether or not it s raining doesn t determine my activities for the day , because often times i do the same things regardless of the weather i don t really do outdoor activities . if it s raining during the week , then i just go to work as usual . perhaps i won t run my errands after work like i normally would , but that would be the only change . if it s raining on the weekend , then i stay inside and catch up on laundry and cleaning and whatnot .","292269":"i would rather be a lonely genius . i m not particularly sociable and don t feel comfortable being around groups of people .","292270":"never said i was the smartest person .","292271":"i m pretty down tbh . i m feeling really empty and horrible so i m drinking alcohol .","292272":"yeah , it s heartbreaking and there s surprisingly little to no news coverage on it .","292273":"no , i don t need help in writing a book .","292274":"hello do you have a question ?","292275":"lately only twice a day .","292276":"at the bar , drowning my sorrows .","292277":"no ? lmaoo . that isn t what bond money is used for .","292278":"i didn t move yet . but i m moving out of my parents house .","292279":"sometimes it happens , sometimes it doesn t . i ve just noticed that some of my answers get deleted if there are vulgar terms in them idk if someone reports them or not because i ve never gotten a warning .","292280":"no , it s probably just an automatic filtering system .","292281":"some words are buzz words for askfm , and i don t want my answers to be deleted so i censor them .","292282":"no , i m renting a house .","292283":"all of us .","292284":"lol , yeah . you simply can t satisfy these people .","292285":"? ? ? we re renting a three bedroom house , and he isn t my best friend . he s my boyfriend s best friend .","292286":"i see ! ! in that case , then yeah i definitely agree with you . i was taking the initial anon s use of purpose as meaning something religious or spiritually oriented , if that makes sense .","292287":"the best thing about my summer has been getting a major promotion at work , getting a raise , and finding a house to rent . this fall , i m looking forward to getting the keys and moving into the house ! !","292288":"in that case , then yes i wholeheartedly agree with you , lol . i think i understand what you re saying . you mean like a cause effect sort of purpose , right ?","292289":"i believe we re just seeing the term purpose in different lights . when i think of the term purpose , i m under the impression that there s some ulterior motive behind something happening , whether it s to teach a lesson or something else . many people who believe that things have certain purposes also put forth the notion that it s guided by an omniscient being .","292290":"some of the coastal parts of long island can be in danger , yes . when hurricane sandy happened , for example , everyone south of montauk highway in both nassau and suffolk counties had to be evacuated because of the rapidly rising sea levels .","292291":"i believe you re misunderstanding the original asker s intention behind using the word purpose . they were questioning whether or not i believe depression has an underlying purpose in our lives , as if depression was meant to happen to teach us something instead of understanding it as an indiscriminate mental illness . something being normal expected and something having a purpose behind it are two different things . in the situation you re posing , i agree that it s very common and expected for people to develop situational depression and have a trauma response to life altering situations .","292292":"autumn is my favorite season ! ! my favorite things about autumn are the color changing leaves , the seasonal drinks and dishes , the fashion , the chilly weather , and the campfires my boyfriend and i have in his backyard .","292293":"definitely not , haha . i don t like the summer time because it s always horrifically hot and humid where i live . i prefer the autumn and winter months , and i can t wait for it to be colder outside .","292294":"my boyfriend and or my best friend probably know me the best . i often say that they know me better than i even know myself .","292295":"proofreading and copyediting , lol . it s a genuine passion of mine .","292296":"how to look after yourself , as well as how to put yourself first when the situation calls for it . you , yourself , should usually always be your first priority . people eventually learn how to protect their privacy and their interests .","292297":"i normally consult my boyfriend , my best friend , or one of my coworkers , depending on the situation . some people are more well versed in things than other people .","292298":"indicating that depression somehow has a purpose in your life is basically insinuating that people deserve to be depressed . depression doesn t have an ulterior motive or a purpose it s a medical disease .","292299":"no , i don t have games on my phone ."}}
