club he s in whose family has an really small island or something and they invited us over on the th of july holiday in the us sort of and there s this show that happens near a nearby island that they motored us too and we just sat on boat and watched them and we were like right under them . it was nice bc just watching them felt good for some reason and i rarely ever get times like that where i just feel at ease . . . in fact that may have been the most recent time and that was like years ago almost","803412":"that s a good question . . . but there is nothing super interesting that i ve done before . . . i guess maybe camping , rode in a plane , horseback riding and going in a motorboat to see fireworks over the water on a holiday is probably the most adventurous things i ve done before","803413":"i really hope i get it and die in the place of someone else who will get it","803414":"there are so many things on that list . . . . . have a best friend i can trust . have a

roommate or two . get really drunk and then jump off a building or something really high . do a kidaskitchen video with kida . go to a live showing of dancing with the stars or world of dance with

that was generous of them . they probably could end homelessness if they wanted to lol . jk . ohhh i also got a coding book from my brother s university that i really like !","803442":"whenever i need something i guess . i have no food rn so i might go down or the little market thingy a bit later and get some snacks like oreos , bars , chips and fruit . . . . yesterday i ordered a charger thingy on amazon bc mine broke . . . . two days ago i walked in the rain down the hill to buy some toilet paper and get my prescription refill . . . . the day before that i went to the market place to buy advil . . . so i guess quite frequently","803443":"the harry potter exhibit i went to once was pretty cool bc it was back when i used to really like harry potter . i m not much a museum person honestly though","803444":"argued with someone on youtube comments probably . it wasn t a childish argument , but i feel like comment arguing is just childish in general . and before that , it was probably sleeping with a stuffed animal which i do every night . . . . .","803445":"i like them . nowadays i mostly use my galaxy buds that i bought last october . i really like them and they don t have noise cancelling , but they do block out a lot of sound , but before then i always used the apple earpods w the headphone jack . i also have these sony headphones i got as a gift last year from a father figure and they have noise cancelling and i really like them . i don t like to use headphones out of the house dorm tho , only earbuds .","803446":"maybe running into my old roommate and then texting back and forth a bit . we never really talked much when we lived together last year but then i messaged her to apologize on how awkward i was when i ran into her and we sent maybe a total of or texts just talking about how this school year has been for us . either that this one girl introducing herself to me after class . the moment lasted like seconds , but typically no one ever notices me so i appreciated it . . . . as you can see tho , my weeks aren t very exciting . everything else this week has been pretty rotten .","803447":"i really can t say hi to hundreds of random people . . . . i m not a good speaker in any circumstance","803448":"no .","803449":"just be my friend and don t leave and i ll do the same . i m pretty loyal and devoted friend esp . when i feel like i can trust

, listen to music , watch videos , watch tv shows , dance , sleep . . . . i m not a very adventurous person as u can tell","803466":"it s grey because that s the closest i could get to black and black is my favorite color","803467":"go home for a day , do homework quizzes , computer code , probably cry a lot and watch the new episode of batwoman","803468":"idk , i guess i think that would be interesting but maybe a bit scary bc you never know what to expect when you meet someone new","803469":"i think we all change throughout time , but there still is such thing as as real selves . our real selves just change over time . i think for a lot of people , it s hard to always show your real self because you re afraid of being judged or getting ourselves in trouble or not being liked or something so we give different people different versions of ourselves , but there is the true us inside . i try to always show my real self bc that s the kind of people i like to meet and feel more comfortable around , but it s hard to always be myself bc of some of the reasons above and i get a lot of anxiety and i m always trying to get along with everyone bc i m so lonely and want friends . i think it mainly just makes me get used by people rather than gets me friends tho","803470":"not very often . i don t think i ve gone for fast food since march . . . . . although , the food options they give us in my campus dining halls are pretty fast and i normally get my food from there to go , so if that counts , then i get fast food pretty often . . . . .","803471":"there is no way i m gonna remember that haha . i probably liked it tho","803472":"during the very end of december i finally got to meet my sister s new baby that she had in july","803473":"i think so . . . . i participated in the march for our lives and the women s march and then some we are the one . i m not completely sure what defines a demonstration tho . i guess i liked participating in them because they are for good causes and actually can make a difference sometimes , but i live in a rainy city and it rained and was cold for almost all of those , so that wasn t great . also , i m not really a crowd person . i likely wouldn t have gone if no one i knew was going . but i commend the people who do take some kind of action to protest or spread awareness for things they are passionate about .","803474":"dance and walk","803475":"if you can get a hold of them , probably . . . .","803476":"get her into counseling for sure so she can get help from a professional . also realize that this is

probably take an extra year . and this is college not high school","803529":"tell me what it is","803530":"idk think i would want to know anything honestly . whatever i learned would give me a lot of anxiety and i already have too much","803531":"i do not","803532":"idk about famous , but i wouldn t mind being a well known dancer bc they tend to be the successful dancers . either that or a created

competitive . i think cs is known for being the most competitive major there and i m not good enough to get near perfect grades like the super smart people so it s kind of hopeless . grades testing

people are . . . . but how would i really know . . . . i guess i just say that bc a lot of people at my school seem to be extroverts while i m an introvert and tend to do a lot of thinking . but that s probably some other people too . my school is gigantic so it s hard to say . i do feel at the base of the lonely spectrum though meaning i am very lonely and so just end of thinking a lot ,
