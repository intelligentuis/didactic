And skateboarding was like my biggest interest. It wasnt until I was like 8 that my life took a different direction. Christina my oldest sister wanted to be in a band but it wasnt working out with her friends. My mom has a degree in music and vocals so we were all taught how to sing from a very young age. Originally .... It was just me and amy and christina who started a band at the time but it didnt really take off at first. In 2010 that when my mom suggested we just started a band as a sibling group since our schedules were all the same and we lived together. The band consisted of our brother michael, christina, katherine,lisa, amy and me. Dani was to little at the time to join. We all took musical theater as well so we knew the basically foundations and kinda picked up on playing instruments the further we went. Our grandmother used to book us gigs at nursing homes as well at the time. When Danielle was a little bit older she joimed the band and Michael eventually backed out from being a member but still helps with the sound and technically things for our concerts and what not today. growing up I wasnt really motivated or focused on actually being a singer and it took a long conversation with christina to actually get me to stay motivated and focused on music. I just thought it was never going to work out but then kath suggested we post a cover on youtube of party in the head which went viral at the time ... And left us shook ... So we kept doing more and more which more views kept coming ... Etc. You can read more about it ... But I think I really realized that I wanted to be a singer around the age of 18 when I decided to go to college and realized I was basically wasting my time because I already had a career that I had since I was 8 ... And I'm just doing extra work for basically nothing... And was really stressed out. There were times when I wanted to quit the band but thank god we took therapy sessions and we are all in a good place now...\n  ","932188":"\n  She had a panic attack...
