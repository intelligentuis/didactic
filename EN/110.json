unwarranted","101793":"wut","101794":"honestly , i ll never be a parent so i don t really have an opinion . i feel like the kids should just do what they want . i had a boyfriend in kindergarten we

but moving to a pay per bag system has been talked about","101799":"i ve stopped answering this and have deleted the last bajillion of this exact question that gets sent like every single day lemme tell you why if i answer , this of the time turns into a fetish thing .","101800":"i guess the champagne and cupcake but only because i don t like beer or watermelon . i m not wild about the other two options either","101801":"tiva or bud frances fred","101802":"i am diagnosed with schizophrenia , panic disorder , ocd i was diagnosed with major depression but i am as of last week s shrink visit in full remission ! ! schizophrenia is considered in remission because i take antipsychotic medications . when i don t take those meds , positive symptoms occur . even with the meds , negative and cognitive symptoms occur . i wouldn t say they have gotten worse or have led to diminished mental health , but they are def holding steady . panic disorder , same thing but beta blockers are the meds , which keep my body from producing adrenaline . without the pill , i still over produce adrenaline . so it isn t a better or worse thing either , it s just what it is . i have no current treatment for ocd and it comes and goes . so yeah it s better because i don t have depression anymore but it s basically just what it is elsewise","101803":"yeah in college i just sort of chopped it all off every which way but it looked punk rawk so i kept doing it for a while until i moved in with a roomie who was a hair stylist so then she got to chop at it","101804":"oh shoot that reminds me i ve

want my own unique self to be recognized .","101808":"he s my partner . he s my spouse . he s my husband . he gets to be called any of those things simply because that s what he is lmao it s like so ridiculous to get angry or attach anything to it past that . if he was gender neutral i d stop calling him my husband . if we get divorced but stay together i ll just call him my partner . then he s only some of those three things . but now he s definitely all three things and i will say those things as i please .","101809":"this anon has been salty at me for so long for like just existing like i get it you re a racist and sexist white dude who feels threatened by progress but i definitely have nothing to do with your idiotic ramblings","101810":"is it very hard to be so idiotic like i can t even fathom what life must be like for you i wouldn t call courtney they because she uses she . but when the mail delivery comes and i don t know who the carrier is that day then i refer to the mail person as them . it s a very easy distinction and i don t understand why you don t get it .","101811":"like why not it just helps normalize gender neutral words for folks who use em and that is not a bad thing . i try to refer to people as they rather than he or she or he she when i m not sure . i still use the correct pronouns when applicable of course and i still call jon my husband like a third of the time but anons gotta hate on something","101812":"lmao then unfollow asshole it s a really simple solution","101813":"i ll say what i want to say , but thanks for your unwanted

they show character .","101816":"this isn t a question","101817":"lol . this exact question verbatim was from like two days ago . did you just copy and paste someone else s question ? here i copy and pasted my answer from then since you apparently missed that i like to wear it , and i like when others wear it in moderation not these axe body spray boys ugh my favorite scent currently is a boutique scent from tokyo milk called dead sexy and it s a warm vanilla with exotic woods and white orchid","101818":"well , i don t watch movies of any sort very often because i just don t have the attention span i used to have . i have in the past enjoyed horror movies when i was home alone , and they did play too much on my mind afterwards but that s part of the fun","101819":"lol i m broke i have nothing to lend but i also don t borrow . i ve decided that the foot pain and associated fatigue are bad enough that i get to brew a second pot of coffee and put my foot up and not do anything else productive today so you know send me shit or whatever","101820":"i assumed my partner would be excited about the fast and furious spin off featuring lettie and a female supporting cast but i guess that s his least favorite character somehow so i was def wrong","101821":"they don t understand privilege . they aren t listening to the problem and instead are making everything about themselves . they aren t someone i care to talk to .","101822":"when someone says that to me i assume automatically that a they re an incel and b they hate women it s ridiculous . and wrong . and it s of the time used by guys who most definitely are not nice .","101823":"it s like when people were burning their nikes like you had to buy those in order to burn them and now you don t have shoes","101824":"it doesn t change me that much . if a brand i don t use has a good message i might consider trying them but often i just don t out of habit","101825":"i used to care more about third parties but honestly now it s just this unfun game of trying to beat the republicans out and replace them with often also problematic democrats the whole thing is busted and we need an overhaul but i don t know to what","101826":"so i guess being reminded that toxic masculinity exists makes them real angry for some reason . i saw people flushing razors they already bought down the toilet to own the libs so that was hilarious . republicans are awful , idiotic people i don t know why they do anything","101827":"wendy","101828":"sangria","101829":"this is a weird phrase , doug i guess it means that life

when you sent this and it s now groundhog day but it was mediocre and full of bone pain but i had a good purple lipstick look so there s that","101846":"i mean probably said i definitely run my mouth a lot","101847":"i hardly ever get those anymore tbh i had an anon who asked me about my art regularly and an anon who asked for selfies regularly and both have been very quiet here s me right now having just woken up","101848":"i say both . and spouse . mostly to normalize gender neutral language but also because those three words all sort of are interchangeable for me when i mean jon","101849":"it was really more of an understanding but i guess the last time someone got mad at me and fussed was a week or so ago on facebook i asked for selfies from friends to draw but said that kid and pet portraits were still commission only , and my sister took offense for some reason ? like her kids are definitely not the only kids i ve drawn for free but for some reason she thought it was aimed at her or something and started this whole dramatic thing","101850":"toooooooo late","101851":"i need to be able to walk there . currently within walking distance there is a florist , a medical supply store , a chiropractor , like dentists , a hospital , a clinic , grocery stores , a walgreens , a gym , and that s basically it . so something at one of those things . i think the florist would be my favorite if i could just pick who was gonna hire me .","101852":"not without a manager . i really am not cut out for self promotion it weird me out and makes me uncomfortable but

.","101853":"very very hot water is my preference . i cannot handle cold water i will screech and holler","101854":"because a woman s value is in her looks still . men rate and judge women on their looks constantly probably without even realizing it it s so ingrained . women who are more attractive and more youthful are rated higher and therefore have more worth and are treated with more respect . i call it pretty privilege . when a buddy of my husband s calls him a babyface , it s a tease or a manly compliment but when someone tells me that i don t look my age it s because they value that in a woman .","101855":"yeah it s weird . i dunno . my husband looks young for his age but when people compliment him for it it s less of a judgement thing . and then like , the only thing i saw mostly men talk about when birdbox came out was that they didn t approve of how sandra bullock had aged . it s so gross . i didn t see the movie but i feel like women should be able to age without constant comment . and yeah me too i compliment people all the time but usually on fashion makeup hair etc","101856":"lol um no i won t shut the fuck up ? on my page ? if you don t care for my opinion , then unfollow","101857":"maybe the younger more progressive generations will phase this sort of thing out","101858":"women are still judged on their looks and how well they age more than anything else . it s meant to be nice but it s also kind of a reminder that women still aren t seen as equals . i don t mind being told i m pretty or youthful or whatever and i get that the intentions were kind but it would be nicer to be noticed for how smart i am or whatever . and to be able to age at my own rate without constant comment .","101859":"sucks .","101860":"the art shredding stunt was pretty ballsy i enjoyed that but otherwise i m not really a fan","101861":"always , i don t know the prescription but my left eye has astigmatism and a worse rx than the right eye and they re both

klondike mini ice cream bars because the reg size are way too big","101865":"stash s licorice spice tea so good i feel like stuff that s hair related is usually way more expensive than i would prefer . like going to a decent stylist for just a shampoo and a cut is nowadays and it seems really unreasonable when there still exists places like great clips","101866":"nah hardly ever and when there is one it s very short lived","101867":"an art studio with a printing press","101868":"word up yeah i def didn t intend to come off as explainy to you or to anyone or anything just thought it was a neat

shortened phrase or i wouldn t have brought the full phrase up .","101871":"yeah it sucks a lot and it s so gross to sling that at someone in a disagreement . manipulative .","101872":"it s a phrase my mother yelled at me more than once so i learned where it came from lol","101873":"the phrase itself is a shortened , misinterpreted version of a saying that translated into the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb which means that your bond to your blood brothers , essentially , is stronger than that of the family bond . so considering that , i agree . i m not close to my family i feel more strongly about the people i chose to add to my life . they have less expectations and judgement","101874":"bubo the cutest parakeet in the

in emails requesting more greens . i particularly want an olive green","101886":"haha i call it my mermaid necklace because to me it looks like coral","101887":"it means it s no longer considered a chronic illness for me . when you re in treatment you re considered in remission , and full remission means unlikely to reoccur . i don t know how this happened i spent some years in therapy i learned mindfulness i have an emotional support animal , i got older , i take meds , i smoke a ton of weed , i guess it was just a little bit of all of those things that led to beating depression . it s possible i guess . i agree with the diag , i haven t been depressed in a while i definitely feel like a weight has been lifted in that way","101888":"because she wants me to ease into it slowly

green every day today was parsley and whatever veggies we re eating for dinner tonight a salad so she ll get like a carrot and some kale out of that i give her a bite of my lunch as long as it s healthy so today she ate some wheat bread and egg white . a few times a week she gets a nut today she had an almond . her cage always has fresh seed and dried veggie blend , zupreem pellets , and water . then she just eats whatever else i have when i have it so like today i had some popcorn and she had her own little piece . her favorite foods are sweet corn , spinach , parsley , brussel

squeezing them was just something i did and didn t think about . i ve always been pretty lucky with my skin though .","102091":"it varies state to state . usually they want you to be legally married or a child dependant","102092":"i m years old i haven t had a pimple issue for like years","102093":"oh god no i have accidentally seen them and it grosses me out really bad . facebook keeps advertising a channel that deals with ingrown hairs to me and that s gross too","102094":"yes . i have private insurance through my husband s job . we can choose to pay for several different tiers of

though .","102102":"it s stupid , ridiculous , costing lives at this point . people can t access their food stamps right now in some states because there are no government workers . the shutdown is affecting huge amounts of lives . trump is a racist piece of garbage and his followers are the new kkk .","102103":"i ve been known that shitstain was a problem since aaliyah days . i have never not a single time listened to his song with gaga and put her squarely into problematic fav category when it happened .","102104":"yes , because of probability .","102105":"possibly ? at least a trend towards more plant based foods . we re trying to cut down on our red meat for health reasons so like even though we re omnivores we ll prob be buying veggie burgers for a while .","102106":"i think it was the brother . i think the parents covered up for him .","102107":"taste . texture rarely bothers me surprisingly because i have some weird tactile difficulties with my skin .","102108":"greed and jealousy and fear are causes of wrongdoing . none of those things listed have anything to do with anything","102109":"prob cuz i m cool","102110":"like creamy green ness .","102111":"i do but i rarely

rainy here","102119":"i loathe sports","102120":"nah","102121":"i like to learn about local nature and food particularly .","102122":"if i can get this bone to heal i want to work on strength training and yoga","102123":"oh , mostly a culmination of things from the past week or so building up . my foot isn t healing . i have to pay over for the machine to maybe fix that . it hurts and that price hurts . i think bubo has a cold but i m not sure . it might just be the weather . she s acting perfectly normal in all ways but two she s sleeping s bunch and she s no longer interested in being flirty with her toys or anything . i m worried but i can t get her to the vet until tues . my period started days early and my cramps are completely unreal like make you throw up from pain bad , my sister tried to stir up a social media fight earlier .","102124":"i m pretty great already so this is my plan . my partner comes home soon with pizza and beer . i m going to eat that pizza and watch a

not if i do someone should probably tell my psychotherapist","102127":"haha i m not nowadays compared to pre therapy . i grew up with some weird family with high expectations and very strict conditions under which they might show love .","102128":"well like today i m really grumpy after a bad week and i m kinda lashy outy so i guess not always but usually i do","102129":"not really . they seem kinda boring for the price . i want bright colors in everything . my wedding ring is just a silver band , no stone at all . i wear a big honkin emerald on my right hand .","102130":"is this because of my burp","102131":"i just had a reallly loud burp . success !","102132":"not at all . power is domination and control over someone or something else . if i m powerful it s in a peaceful way i hope .","102133":"it does vary but overall i m much more patient now than i have been in the past .","102134":"i m honest all around but maybe more so to myself . there s always that once in a blue moon that requires withholding or white lies in a human s social life .","102135":"it s too cloudy here for me to see the moon aw","102136":"i own both but i vastly prefer my denim jacket with the sleeves rolled up it s like bisexual uniform . on others i like both . i have to wear a sneaker and a boot brace right now , so both are out . i haven t worn heels since probably decades ago because my bunions that i had removed and i m still not healed enough to try them again . i have several pairs of boots that have no heel though so i guess boots . and i don t pay attention to other s shoes really . jorts for me because i hate jeans on myself passionately but love some shorty shorts woooo . i prefer jeans probably on others so i can silently wonder how they can stand them ugg all around they re so cozy . i have a knock off pair that i wore completely out beanie . especially if i knitted it myself . same on others . leopard def all around .","102137":"probably not","102138":"degrees f and sprinkling rain","102139":"omg ok i guess what i m trying to say is it is pretty ableist that every few months another person with the same exact sorts of questions comes along and it s always because you want my views as a schizophrenic my views on reality are simple and i ve explained that . i m not going to argue it i think it s ridiculous to press further . it s triggering and annoying and i m not a deep thought bot","102140":"there s no code to crack dude . we exist and it s not mysterious it just is .","102141":"i have no views on it i guess . reality is real . it seems really simple but for some reason every something white dude on the planet goes through a phase where they think their super special deep thoughts are somehow going to crack the code of reality","102142":"it depends on sales and specials and ingredients honestly . in general it s cheaper to prepare food yourself but that s only if there s a few ingredients the more ingredients the pricier so in that case a prepared meal might be cheaper","102143":"i have no idea . try surgery . limp for the rest of my life . something .","102144":"what does this even mean i m going to assume it s ableist against me somehow","102145":"nope","102146":"yup","102147":"don t send me this transphobic wanted to be shit . i would be a good parent and honor my child s gender identity with whatever medically approved time frame was suggested .","102148":"i tried to get high enough to answer this but i just can t","102149":"i don t know what the fuck you re talking about but i feel like it has to do with john waters films . so i guess since i stuck up for ash i get compared to gross characters . cool that s super mature and a good use of your time ?","102150":"why do y all concern yourselves so much with other people s lives ? it doesn t concern you , it shouldn t matter to you . it s weird and obsessive and frankly fucking disgusting they way y all pile on them .","102151":"i mean i don t disagree but what does this have to do with my foot surgery","102152":"very . i delete everything .","102153":"not anymore . i try to let anger pass quickly .","102154":"i mean , it s a preference . i obviously haven t turned anon off because so many of you love to hide behind it and sometimes i feel like it s the right thing to do as far as mental health advocation in case someone has a question that s hard for them to ask but like it s discouraged . you get coins when you come off anon . there s incentives to being yourself . you don t automatically get assumed to be a total dickhole who needs to hide his identity .","102155":"only very rarely i m quite introverted though that doesn t show online really","102156":"nope","102157":"just death","102158":"no . this is an inappropriate question .","102159":"no i loathe sports .","102160":"kind of already answered this . not really .","102161":"because all anons are the same to me and that will never change . it s cowardly and weird .","102162":"relief , birds , nature , sunshine , art , music","102163":"i m okay . hurting . hungry . getting ready to celebrate . drinking som cranberry vanilla tea . buo is taking a nap and i can t really do anything because of my foot so this part of my day is just waiting for my partner to come home with food and be entertaining","102164":"none that i can recall but i remember being so absolutely gleeful that a school bully slipped on a twinkie and fell in the cafeteria once that the lunch monitor sent me to the principal for laughing too loud .","102165":"if i have him blocked and don t follow him keep up with his accounts , then how would i have seen anything ? and why do you think i care what he has to say about me ?","102166":"yeah it s all super shady but with the numbers being what they are it s still a cheaper option than a second surgery . i don t know how long i have to use it yet all i know is that it uses sound waves and looks like a little oval sensor thing that attaches around the foot with a band . i know i ll have to use it for minutes every day , and i should keep my foot still and elevated while i use it . i think the hygiene issue is that it requires a lubricating jelly or something like an ultrasound machine .","102167":"yeah i have to buy it . and i can t sell it used for hygiene reasons , which is the reason i was told i couldn t just rent it as well .","102168":"i have conservative family . it weird me out . it comes down to two things abortion and guns . they will do any stupid idiotic thing a politician tells them to do as long as it s against abortion and pro gun","102169":"basically .","102170":"we need to do something other countries have had paid healthcare for years successfully it s ridiculous that america is too slow to progress along with the rest of the world now","102171":"i don t really","102172":"they would cover part of it but i need to meet my extremely high deductible co pay first . i have to pay out of pocket the first of my medical costs every year before insurance starts to pay for things outside of standard preventative visits .","102173":"that s one possible outcome but first i try some sort of ultrasonic bone growth stimulation machine which i pick up from the clinic on tuesday . it has an overall success rate with success on feet particularly . it s also stupid expensive and i literally considered crowdfunding for medical equipment but the rep swears they have very flexible payment plans so we ll see .","102174":"my un fused portion of foot bone is quite painful","102175":"i still prefer her to ben though .","102176":"lol word . sorry . i m in a foul mood from non ending pain . i define a troll as someone who creates drama , negativity , and irritation to amuse themselves","102177":"only once or twice , and very little when it does .","102178":"i mean maybe you re not her but it really definitely is the sort of thing she s sent me before because she gets angry that i call her a troll .","102179":"well , diana , the fact that you still send me anon shit like all the time to either advertise yourself or pretend to be someone else stirring up drama about yourself even after you bothered me offsite about this shit and said you d back the fuck off is pretty trolly , right ?","102180":"i was living at the beach and swimming times a week but i was also really struggling with delusions and anxiety . the only meds i was on were like prozac . i ll never be that tan again , i had cancer removed from my hip not long after this picture","102181":"probably to keep people from destroying young female babies because a king is wanted . pretty grody","102182":"no i started professional art schools at th grade age and continued through college .","102183":"you could also not follow me i already have filled my quota for snarky ass anons i don t like","102184":"bowling or roller skating or a nice dinner or a movie","102185":"mind my

lol","102188":"a portrait of my friend ben","102189":"i dress to make people smile , but everything i wear is also comfortable . hey it s my new dp","102190":"just the stories and art they leave behind","102191":"cool","102192":"yes","102193":"lemme clear something up real quick as long as you re anon , you re just another anon . i m here to answer questions tho not chit chat it s not fun to have an inbox full of literally the same things over and over sup , hi , hey , etc those aren t questions they re conversation starters . if i was gonna start a conversation with someone it would be my spouse or my friends not a kid on the internet i m really in a foul mood today and like anons have been on my last nerve since the moment i ve been at my desk","102194":"i mean none of these things are questions though","102195":"sorry . hope you get less sad soon .","102196":"i mean overall i m pretty content but definitely this bone not fusing all the way thing is a bummer and i m super tired of having a hurt foot . i had a good bday , turned , ate good food . got to draw two people from my portrait bucket list so far this year . haven t made any sales in yet but have had a lot of fav heart activity on my website . got a new lipstick i like .","102197":"haha no but that made me lol though","102198":"nothing happened but no one pays me to entertain fetish weirdos so it ain t

up to allow for jon to have a sexual partner if he wants but he hasn t wanted that yet . i have no drive and therefore no desire to cheat . i do have crushes but they re like flirting with the end goal of friendship , not sex .","102242":"the whole vibe on the east coast is one of constant rushing . the doctors are just booked solid without stop and they have no time to spend important time with patients . here , everyone s or at least many doctors are part of clinic groups where they have good support and lots of doctors to choose from and day weeks and good benefits i guess so that helps i m sure ? i love every doctor i ve seen in washington and they ve all been a part of the same clinic .","102243":"here on the west coast i do . east coast doctors i felt like i had to fight so hard to be heard . they never had time for patients .","102244":"for me it s just an overactive gland i ve had a doctor check it out","102245":"is this a fetish thing","102246":"emotionally ? i can t

.","102262":"she doesn t i just assume she wants what i want","102263":"yes . birds are incredibly good at reading mood and reacting appropriately it s one of the reasons my psychoanalyst and i decided on a bird as an emotional support animal . i ve adapted to stay calm and friendly around her so that she has a calm and friendly vibe all the time and it helps us both .","102264":"i don t really have secrets . i do talk to her though . i asked her opinion on teas a minute ago . we decided on a ginger spice .","102265":"no i m not one of those dolphin girls lol . i ve swam with them

if monkeys dream , then parrots might also .","102371":"i m not sure . i ve always liked birds in general and still do but owls seem so powerful and steeped in lore . owlbeasts as part of native

her cage because she gets bad night terrors so i just leave her in a semi dark area of the house with a night light on just for her . since i go to bed so early it works out for us . if i stay up late

being unable . my birthday is the th though i m considering hiring someone to come deep clean as a gift to myself","102379":"my partner","102380":"it s a degenerative eye disease caused by too much

.","102382":"yeah sure i slip it here and there but i do have glaucoma so i don t take long breaks .","102383":"i don t really get high . like occasionally i ll switch up strains or method of consumption and i ll get a little high but that s short lived and rare . mostly i smoke a small amount throughout the day to maintain my health not to get high . i actively avoid high thc strains when i can choose because i m more interested in the benefits of cbd and terpenes","102384":"no i don t think it s cruel . that said i don t clip bubo anymore because it s just healthier and better exercise .","102385":"nope","102386":"nooo . the air force kept calling me as a teen though .","102387":"like a place with a large military base . like i grew up in norfolk , va where there are several naval stations so everyone who lived there was in one way or another serving the base population , which could be people from all over the country because when you join the military they assign you to a base and you have to move there .","102388":"of course i smoke practically hourly","102389":"electro pop","102390":"at least approximately , yes . unless they grew up in a military town like i did . those are more homogenous because so many different backgrounds are transported there .","102391":"yes . some are more like others and some are resoundingly unique but each state is different .","102392":"no . i believe we are really actually existing here right now with all of the consequences and rewards that come with that","102393":"because he , like his fan base , is afraid of brown people . meanwhile at the canadian border today over a million dollars of meth was seized , but no one cares lol","102394":"no of course not . illegal crossing is in fact down from previous years . most sexual crimes are committed by white men . the wall will disrupt natural habitats , run through tribal lands , and cost ridiculous amounts of money for a non threat .","102395":"not directly . i worry about produce not being inspected . i wish i was flying somewhere right now because now is the time to fly with drugs . no one cares .","102396":"roller skating . i ve never been

pretty good . my parents met at the roller skating rink when they were teens . i grew up skating . i am way out of practice and it takes a little bit to re adjust to it but then i m fine and can skate backwards and all that fun stuff .","102399":"well i hope to become physically stronger , now that i ve addressed all of my previous health concerns and am pleased with my treatment the next step is to try to reach a healthier weight and build some muscle . so i hope within years that will change from now .","102400":"yeah . right now it s damp so it s in a particularly neat bun .","102401":"the only thing i ve ever had rejected was a blood thinner and it was cost related . my doctor had two more doctors vouch for the more expensive one because of additional benefits though and they ended up approving it on appeal . that was a few years ago though .","102402":"i have no idea . i don t deal with any of that the doctor s office submits the request and then i wait for a phone call","102403":"the x rays weren t good on wed , my bone on this foot just won t fuse all the way it s like it gave up on healing . i have to postpone my roller skating party for several months and i m waiting for insurance approval of a bone stimulation ultrasound machine to use to try to stimulate bone growth .","102404":"nah i was sleepin . i m up now .","102405":"people can change if they work hard at it but that has nothing to do with being in love","102406":"ask me stufffff","102407":"nope . not only do i have no sex drive i m also infertile due to pcos . i did take birth control pills

mandated by state to see a therapist after an attempt on my life and that was not cheap because it had to be someone approved by the local hospital and i wasn t insured . that was at age . . . . . ? ? from there i went off and on through the years for about a pop until i was insured and then i started seeing specifically only psychotherapists because i was already diagnosed so seriously so even insured that was still about a pop . and that s weekly to start tapering out to monthly and then as needed in each case .","102477":"i hope so . it took a lot of work to get to this point . i felt pretty dismal about my life prior to therapy .","102478":"it s only pm where i am but yeah haha that is late for me","102479":"no i would want to be born again . i love the idea of reincarnation . i

today like holy shit actual questions would be great , and also to update those who care bubo is off her eggs now and is a super cuddlemonster","102532":"questions are preferred","102533":"i m really

it","102538":"lol the world","102539":"attention","102540":"i guess i don t know why you think i have answers for you though . i just live my life .","102541":"that certainly has something to do with it i m sure i m part of a population with schizophrenia but something like half of the population has anxiety so obviously there is a ton of concern about treating anxiety because it just helps the bigger majority of people","102542":"i don t get what you re asking . are you asking me if some things are more acceptable ? then sure","102543":"i mean , when i wake up to an inbox full of speculation that i m some sort of supernatural being or that my delusions are real or that somehow i m on a different plane of existence , that s pretty ultra fucked up . this morning had that plus that were a different anon who was clearly leading to that sort of weird neckbeard conspiracy theorist shit . i ve never had an understanding workplace . they always start off alright and then when i break down and shit gets ugly they are like nope this isn t working and then i can t work for them because i can t meet their expectations anymore and blah .","102544":"her father was also mentally ill and withheld affection and was very hard . i believe she has an untreated personality disorder and that she just really wasn t prepared to have me . by the time my brother came around a decade later , she had learned more motherly behavior but it was just kinda too late for me at that point i was afraid of her already .","102545":"no , one of my main and continuing delusional threads was that everything was an omen . this included hallucinations . so like , the cat was a good omen and the birds were a warning and the hat man was a threat that bad was coming . the orphan exists mainly to run out in front of my car and make me slam on the brakes so that s really dangerous but i still have a license somehow lulz . none of my visual hallucinations speak and like i said before , i could tell they weren t real . the vocal hallucinations , like the voices , are mainly just judgey things not scary things or anything like nothing tells me to do stuff i just mainly hear my mother screaming at me that i m not good enough .","102546":"i have a personal and an art page . the art page is shehitsbackart","102547":"i have no real opinions on that .","102548":"i just do what i feel

.","102555":"no ? and what s wrong with taking care of one s self firstly ?","102556":"well i live in a house with bedrooms and a garage so i have about that much stuff . it s not crammed full i don t have tonnnns of extra crap because i have slimmed down our haul during moving over the years .","102557":"https www . redbubble . com people shehitsback additionally i m doing portrait sketches of selfies right now starting at most of my paintings are for sale for mostly plus shipping","102558":"no never and it would definitely make me think less of someone if not make me distance myself from them","102559":"cheesy popcorn","102560":"i still do when stressed and no you can t look at them dead on .","102561":"maybe when i was much younger ? i dunno dude . like i ve been dealing with these things for years . i know what is and isn t real . even off meds i know that the things i m seeing and hearing aren t real but the delusions of persecution and shit that s what really causes me harm and upset .","102562":"what ?","102563":"i ve heard a lot of good things i will have to check it out the questions i answer them because i want to normalize my illness but anons , take note , this sort of question to people other than me could definitely be upsetting .","102564":"i sleep like hours a night lol i get lots of rest","102565":"i ve been back and forth doing stuff around the house and going outside and now i m back for tea and then i m going to go shower","102566":"yo","102567":"he looks like a younger nic cage","102568":"i honestly don t even think i ve heard them before i m a

people are just like it sounds . shadows of people shapes that just sort of go about their biz . i still see some walking in the yard out of the corner of my eye . the cat for me is always grey like one of those pretty grey cats with bright eyes . the man in the hat is basically a shadow person but more real and with a fedora . delusions i ve had include thinking my house was haunted , that my apartment was rigged to blow up and kill me , that my hands and feet would be chopped off in my sleep , that i was being monitored by the govt , that i was from outer space and delivered here by aliens , i dunno they can get really weird . what i mean by chaos is that i just don t care as much about consequences when i m in a psychotic episode . i already do what i want but then it s like , that to a dangerous level . it doesn t relate to hallucinations it s just the overall mood .","102585":"haha and i m married an uninterested . and most people are in another country , this site is not popular in america at all","102586":"i m plus sized so imagine g cups and big thighs and a belly it s a fit and flare dress so it flares out at the hip . i m wearing a flannel shirt over it and yoga

.","102588":"nah it s not that cool . it s a lot of crying for everyone involved .","102589":"i think it s pretty shitty to charge for something everyone has to and no i don t think i ve ever used one","102590":"i d be easily led into delusions . most likely mainly that the govt is monitoring me . i d start seeing certain things in my day to day life that weren t there . repeat hallucinations for me have been a cat , a man in a hat , an orphan , a flock of blackbirds . shadow people . chaos . i would stop trusting people close to me . self esteem would plummet because of the feeling that people are out to get me . i dunno i mean i lived that life for a long time and sometimes it was pretty normal like now but there was always something i was trying to ignore because it didn t belong . my mother s voice screams at me in my head . my behaviour is reckless .","102591":"well i mean technically this dude named joshua did","102592":"ugggh i hate being called that so much my holidays were

slapped across the face a lot and had privileges taken away and extra chores and that sort of thing . most frequently were emotionally devastating monologues from an unstable mother who loved conditionally and let her displeasure rain down on the people with snide and harmful words","102594":"they re dehydrated now . the one that cracked open , everything in there was dry .","102595":"i d
