  my day is going fairly well, thank you for asking ~~
  
  i haven't really done much today, tbh. i slept over my boyfriend's house last night, so we spent the morning sleeping in, drinking coffee together, and chilling out before he had to go to work. i stopped by starbucks on the way home.
  
  presently, i'm sitting at my laptop and attempting to write an essay about chester bennington and his influence on me when i was growing up. it's been difficult, but i'm hoping to finish it tonight or tomorrow.

  i was going to keep this a secret until thursday, but i can't hold it in because of how much it means to me, but there's an 85% chance of me getting a linkin park tattoo this week, memorializing chester bennington.
  
  it's going to just be a small logo with some color splashed behind it, but i feel like i need to do this. chester was too much a part of my childhood and part of the reason why i'm alive today to *not* do something for him.

   Creative folk! (or anyone who likes art in any form really): How do you get yourselves out of artistic rut? In the sense, how do you ever overcome a creative block, or go about changing what you'd consider to be ""your style""? If this isn't applicable, how do you go about getting past a mental block?
  ","
  even though it's incredibly difficult, i've found that the most reliable way to get over a creative rut is to powerhouse your way through it. keep on creating, even when you don't necessarily feel the inspiration. if every artist only did art when they felt inspired, there would be a lot less art in the world today. a lot of what encompasses art is dedication to the craft and the discipline to remain consistent at that craft regardless of how you feel that day.

  the whole ""everyone is equal in the US"" concept is a lie because people who are trans or gay face a hell of a lot of prejudice on a daily basis for simply being who they are. there are a lot of bigots who exist in this country, and there's even a lot of legislation that doesn't ensure that gay and trans people have the same rights as cis and straight people.

   How can I change someone that I love not to be racist? I'm embarrassed by this but my bf is racist. He's so sweet with me but when it comes to people of colour he's not nice. I love him but I want him to change?
  ","
  it's hard to reverse characteristics of people when they're so ingrained in how a person grew up, like how racism mostly is. you can sit him down and explain to him why his thoughts are harmful to others, but he probably won't react in a kind manner or realize that he's being discriminatory.
  
  that's been my personal experience with racism, at least. it takes a long time to reverse terrible thought patterns, but the person has to believe they're wrong first and foremost. if he doesn't believe that what he thinks is wrong, there might not be a way to change it.

  it's terrible to make jokes about ANYONE'S death, regardless of whether or not they were a celebrity, and especially considering the circumstances under which he died.

  linkin park is literally the reason why i'm alive because they helped me endure through so much of my trauma when i was a teenager. i'm forever in debt to them because of what they've been able to provide for me.
  
  and chester, especially. i've always resonated with him the most due to him being open about his own personal demons and he was such an inspiration to me. when i met him, i choked on my words because i couldn't convey to him how much he truly meant to me. i'm honestly sick with heartache right now.

   Will you personally be offended if you are dating someone for a year+ and they still show some kind of signs that they don't trust you? Like not telling you about their past, what's bothering them etc?
  ","
  i wouldn't be offended, but i would definitely be concerned - a year is a long time to date someone, and if someone isn't comfortable telling you certain things about their lives, there's a legitimate reason behind it.
  
  i.e. a lot of trauma survivors have troubles trusting in relationships so they'll either lie about really small insignificant things or not disclose some information. it isn't a reflection of their trust in you individually, but it's something ingrained in them from a young age.

   glad to know that I wasn't the only one who found it disgusting. I'm 17 years old but I'm so done with my generation??

  ","
  tbh the entire concept just makes me really uncomfortable, and it makes me think of how horrible society has become to the point where now literal children are EXPECTED to be sexualized and are often berated by their classmates for not taking part in sexual activities - even though they're literally children.
  
  the entire thing just makes me feel so queasy and disgusted.

  my boyfriend and i don't place any importance in celebrating anniversaries tbh, we haven't celebrated an anniversary in a really long time (probably because we've been together for so long, lol). i'm sure that will change once we get married, though.
  
  but a relationship is simply a close connection with someone to whom you love on a romantic level. it's a mutual understanding of the emotional connection you share and the understanding that neither of you want to share that connection with anyone else (unless polyamory is your thing, no judgment here). people put too much importance on labels, but a relationship is just the concept that you're in love with your best friend and you can't imagine experiencing your life with anyone else by your side.

   Do you think money is important? If your partner was poor or homeless would you still be with him?

  coming from a background of financial strife, money is somewhat important to me but it doesn't define who a person is. money gives people security when it comes to shelter, nourishment, and medicine, but what i've learned is that money does not dictate the type of person you are and you shouldn't be defined by how much money you have in the bank.

   What is your biggest weakness?
  ","
  my biggest weakness is my unrelenting self-doubt and lack of self-esteem. from a young age, i was berated for doing even the simplest of things, which has forced me to grow up and think very little of myself. i'm constantly criticizing myself for not doing better, belittling myself for becoming over-emotional about things, and doubting my own achievements and abilities.
  
  because i was raised in such a negative environment, my relationships have suffered as a result. i don't feel worthy to be friends with my friends, to be in a relationship with my boyfriend, or to be successful at my job. my weaknesses have ultimately broke me, bringing me down to my knees at every minor inconvenience.

  even though this is making you sad now, it's good that they're out of your life because now you can move on and work on your own mental health and do things that fulfill you and make you happy. you only deserve to have people in your life that bring you joy and comfort, and soon you'll realize that you're worth so much more than how they treated you.
  
  i hope you feel better, lovely.

  however, your logic is flawed. finances aren't directly correlated to love, it's simply a matter of whether or not a person has the money to spend to begin with. there are families living in poverty all over the nation; however, their financial situation doesn't dictate whether or not they love their family. just because a family doesn't have the means to spend money on frivolous matters doesn't necessarily mean they don't love one another with all they have.

  the only thing you can do is to try your best with what's given to you - your workload may be stressful but try to take each day at a time instead of looking at the bigger picture all the time. it's a lot easier to organize your time when you break things up into increments as opposed to trying to think about everything as a whole.
  
  most people don't know what they want to do when they go to college; that's just a fact, and some people still don't know what to do even when they're graduating. you're not expected to have a picture perfect image of your college career because that's unrealistic, college is for finding your passion and furthering yourself if you do find it then.

  i also have a tendency to experience nightmares where i'm either trapped somewhere and cannot escape, or i'm being chased by something. in those scenarios, i think they represent my inner feeling that i'm presently trapped in my current living situation and that i won't be able to out-run my past.

   Why do some women want their partner to financially support them but call themselves feminists? Both individuals should provide. Isnt that what equality is about?
  ","
  i think there's a difference between someone wanting to be a stay at home wife/mother to provide for the family and someone who clearly and irrationally refuses to work and expects their spouse to financially support the family.
  
  feminism is about equality but it's also about having the choice to decide what to do. i agree with you that people who refuse to work and expect their spouse to pay for everything are acting a bit hypocritical, but that's a different scenario than a person who wants equal rights and either can't work or wants to stay home and do what they can to help the family at home.

   How can i stop being competitive over everything? Whenever someone is ""better"" than me i want to be better than them etc
  ","
  i think it all comes down to a matter of self esteem. if you're happy with yourself then you wouldn't feel the need to compare yourself with others. the desire to be better than another person insinuates that you're not happy with yourself, and you want the validation of knowing that you're better than another person to boost your own ego.
  
  there's nothing inherently wrong with that because it's just part of human nature, though. but it may become a problem if it starts interfering in your everyday life or causes rifts in your relationships. eventually, you'll reach a point where you're content with your own achievements and you won't feel the need to be in competition with other people.

  however, the reason why i enjoy performing those activities is because they're a form of escapism from my everyday life. i can easily escape into a novel, into a video game, into a tv show, etc etc. as for askfm, i enjoy answering questions about myself because it forces me to have introspection and think critically about my life and the choices i've made.

  tbh nobody really knows how to do this stuff until they're thrown into adulthood and are somehow expected to know how to behave as an adult. schools don't give adequate lessons on how to do things like open a bank account, apply for a job, pay for bills, clean a house, etc etc. it's entirely all right for you to not know how to do these things because nobody is ever really taught how.
  
  but it'll all come in time. if you have a parental figure who can help you, that helps a lot as well. i've always had really bad anxiety (especially when it comes to public places), so i understand where you're coming from. when the time comes for you to learn how to do these things, the opportunities will present themselves.

  somewhat, yes. i feel as if modern feminist movements have somewhat backfired on themselves because it's seen more as a fashion trend as opposed to what it should be, which is a radical movement towards equality. people like to brand themselves with feminist ideology without putting the work in to actually make a difference in other people's lives, as if throwing the word ""feminist"" in your twitter bio makes you a better person than everyone else.
  
  this isn't to say that there aren't wonderful feminists in the world, though. there are dozens of people who follow feminist movements and are genuinely doing good for themselves and for other oppressed groups, but often their voices are silenced in favor of people who would rather make a lot of noise as opposed to moving forward.

  it's difficult for me to be myself around most other people, however, and that's mainly because i don't know which aspect of myself i ""should"" project at any given moment. sometimes i feel as if there are multiple facets of my personality that are often contradictory, so it's difficult for me to differentiate between them in regards to how i should behave.

  the same can be said for me; my mental illnesses make it nearly impossible for me to cheer up if i'm down, but thankfully he's very understanding of that since he struggles with the same thing. he doesn't take it personally if his attempts at cheering me up fail. and no matter how much i try to push him away, he's always right there to catch me.

   Hey guys! :) 
Here your question: What's one question you're asking to yourself these day? If you want go into details.
  ","
  these days, i'm often asking myself ""what's the point?""
  
  what is the significance of the life i'm leading? what's the reason behind why i go through my daily life, enduring a job i dislike just to pay for bills i wish i didn't have? how did i get myself absorbed into this 9-to-5 routine of monotony? what is the point of living when it's so difficult for me to get through every day? what is the point of helping myself when i'm still coming home and destroying myself each and every night?
  "
423981,"
   What’s something you really resent paying for?
  ","
  i really resent paying for doctor and therapy appointments. my co-pays are high because health insurance in the US is a god damn joke, so a significant portion of my paychecks is dedicated towards making sure i don't die.

  english is my first language, and it would make sense that i would make a lot of grammatical mistakes on askfm because i don't care about my typing on here like i would if i was at work. i probably have a lot of run on sentences because that's the way my mind works at times.

   It's not rude to correct someone's grammar. It's a public forum so anyone can say what they want. (Freedom of speech)

  the anon in question didn't correct their grammar, though - they pointed out that it was wrong in a condescending tone. it's fine to correct someone's grammar if you're nice and informative about it (especially to people who don't speak english as a first language), but it's rude to assume that someone is of lesser intelligence just because they don't know english.

  neuroatypical is a term used to describe people who have been diagnosed with mental, developmental, or neurological/cognitive disorders (""neuro"" meaning the nervous system, and ""atypical"" meaning abnormal). the opposite term is neurotypical, which generally refers to people in the general population who do not have any mental, developmental, or neurological/cognitive disorders.

  however, in light of that, i always feel the notion that i'm somehow running out of time because i'm already in my mid-20s and i have no clue how i got here; i didn't expect myself to live this long. i always assumed i would die before the age of 25, yet here i am - it's frazzling.

  considering i'm diagnosed with a mental disorder where attention and validation are integral to my self-esteem, attention matters a lot to me. i don't necessarily desire being the center of attention, but i do crave recognition and validation for my efforts quite often, and sometimes i'll go to great lengths to ensure that i'm being recognized.
  "
424020,"
   Do you love people unconditionally, or do they have to earn it from you?

  others have to earn my love and trust, because love and trust go hand-in-hand. i cannot love you unless i trust you, and i must develop that trust over time. however, once i do learn to properly trust and love somebody, i do tend to love them unconditionally (within reason).

  i don't judge people based on their gender, so whether or not they're trans isn't a criteria that comes into play when i'm deciding on whether or not i like someone. if you're a good person and you're easy to get along with, then i like you (until you give me a reason to dislike you).

  right now, my greatest weakness is the price of housing on long island. you can't usually find an apartment to rent that's decent for anything less than $1200/month, and that's pushing it. houses are usually $500,000, and sometimes you can find foreclosed properties for $250,000 (but that means they're in shit condition and you have to spend money to fix them up). right now, my best friend and i are looking for houses to rent for 5+ people, since that's the only way we would be able to afford living independently.

  yes; i'm not a perfect human being, and i'm capable of feeling resentment and jealousy just like everybody else. this is something i recently spoke about with my therapist, in fact.
  
  the truth is, it's unrealistic to compare our lives' milestones with the milestones of other people. everyone walks their own path on this earth, and we all hit milestones at different points - not because some people are 'better' than others, but simply because our lives are unique and unfold in different ways. feeling resentment or jealousy because others have advanced quicker than you is a useless and damaging emotion to have because it doesn't help in advancing you personally in your goals. the best thing you can do in these circumstances is to try to feel happy for these people for achieving what they have and using their achievements as motivation to do better.
  "
424057,"
   At what point, is it abnormal to hate your own family?

  'abnormal' is a strange word because i don't particularly believe that it's uncommon for people to hate their families; quite the contrary, in fact.
  
  however, perhaps 'damaging' or 'detrimental' is a more appropriate word to use. if you're having violent thoughts about harming your family, then perhaps at that point, you should seek some professional help to guide you in understanding why you feel the way you do and to possibly make amends with your family.

  regardless of why it happened, i still think that this tragedy is saddening and my heart goes out to all of the people affected by this incident.

   can depressed people still enjoy things and feel excitement sometimes?
  ","
  yes, they can. depression comes and goes in waves, and it also exists on a spectrum. just because you're diagnosed with depression doesn't mean you're completely incapable of feeling joy 24/7/365. however, don't allow these periods of joy to misguide you; those who are depressed are still in need of mental health treatment when they're willing and able, and periods of contentment doesn't mean you're disqualified from receiving help.

  i prefer winter; i love the holiday season, the look and smell of freshly-fallen snow, seasonal drinks, and cozy fashion trends. i'm not a fan of the heat in general (which is ironic, considering i live on an island), and i've always been more accustomed to the cold.

   People have told me medication can't cure depression and the cure has to come from within, and you gotta be your own therapist. Is that ableist?

  yes, that sounds pretty ableist to me. depression is often a chronic illness and can only be remedied with a combination of medication and talk therapy. while a lot of components of therapy do take into account that those who are depressed have low self esteem, it's often difficult to reverse what's been ingrained into someone's brain for what is usually years upon years of self hatred.

  this is your relationship and i don't know the nature of it, so i can't tell you what to do. however, it isn't healthy for a relationship to be one-sided like that. you should ideally be able to come to compromises with your partner and act as a team, not being in fear and feeling like you're the one who has to apologize even if you're not in the wrong. it could potentially be a red flag, but i don't know what his behavior is like so i don't want to give absolutes.

   Is mental illness an excuse for malicious behavior?

  of course not. you don't get a pass at being an abvsive person simply because you have a mental illness that predisposes you to certain behavioral trends. a major component of mental health recovery and awareness is becoming mindful of your actions and how they affect others and taking the necessary precautions to ensure that you don't repeat the same mistakes.

  i understand that her need to constantly talk about herself is rooted in some psychological fear of failure and lack of self worth, but she won't ever acknowledge that she has a problem and, instead, gaslights everyone around her to make themselves out to seem ""crazy,"" meanwhile she's the ""normal"" one who has to deal with our problems. it can be incredibly frustrating and self-defeating, which is why i've never talked to her about any of my personal issues over the years (besides the fact that, above most other reasons, she was the reason for my problems).

   How's your life going? What are some efforts you want to make this year?
  ","
  my life is looking up, thank you for asking ~~
  
  my relationship with my therapist has gotten a lot stronger, and i feel like i can confide in her a lot more than previously. she's been helping me a lot in coming to terms with my trauma and validating my experiences, which is uber important to me.
  
  at the same time, my best friend hired a realtor who's going to help them find a house to rent, so i may be moving out of my parents' house a lot sooner than anticipated (hopefully before august). my relationship with my boyfriend is more rewarding than ever and i've been a lot more open with him regarding my feelings, which has been for the better lately. and while my current job has its certain pitfalls, i realize that they've very accommodating to my mental illnesses, and i don't think i'll be able to find that elsewhere.
  
  as such, i want to make the effort to develop healthier coping mechanisms, healthier eating habits, and perhaps get back into running so that i can lose weight. i fell off the wagon recently in terms of my mental health, but i think i'm finally getting a grasp onto something tangible in helping me lead a healthier lifestyle.

  i don't go shopping for myself very often, and when i do, it's usually something small like a book or a bottle of alcohol. otherwise, most of my money is spent on paying off my bills, gas for my car, cigarettes, coffee, and food for the household.

  i don't resemble her physically, but my personality is very similar to the personality of chloe price from the video game 'life is strange.'
  
  chloe's personality has been altered significantly by the losses she sustained in her life, and as a result of those losses, she experiences a fear of abandonment. at the same time, chloe is very mischievous, rebellious, snarky, pessimistic, and resentful; she smokes weed, drinks, and leads a very reckless lifestyle. she has the tendency to be stubborn, possessive, and selfish, but she's also very loyal and faithful to her close friends.

  somewhat, yes. a big part of mental health recovery is taking care of your body, which means eating healthy, drinking plenty of water, and exercising within moderation. while it may not contribute directly to reducing stress, it certainly helps it putting people in a healthier state of mind which makes them more capable of handling stress.

  "
424178,"
   thank you. I really want to get help, but I hate people knowing things about me. I even want to take back whatever I told my best friend. I just don't want anyone to know anything about me anymore. I don't want people who know me irl to be burdened with such my problems. They deserve happiness ?
  ","
  this is a really common feeling to have, especially when people may not necessarily be as understanding of mental illness as they should be.
  
  i often feel this way towards my partner and best friend; i feel as if i burden them with my mental illnesses or as if i'm holding them back due to my own insecurities. and when that happens, it's incredibly common to feel as if you should 'take back' what's been said or done.

  i'm sorry that you're going through all of this, friend. ♡ i understand your feelings, though and its tough when you feel like you have nobody to talk to.

  ","
  is there a school counselor you can talk to regarding your feelings? they may be able to help you with respect to your mental health or help you make a plan in having your mother understand that your issue isn't laziness, it's your mental health.
  
  if that doesn't work, perhaps you can talk to your mother about seeing a therapist. plenty of people use therapy for more than just mental health reasons, so the idea might resonate with her if you inform her that you feel like it would be good to talk to someone about your feelings.
  "

  "
424182,"
   Do you give second chances?
  ","
  it depends entirely on who the person in question is, what the 'first chance' was, and what they did to ruin that first chance.

  "
424187,"
   Who do you have sympathy for?

  i generally have the most sympathy for trauma survivors because i can relate to them the most; i understand their feelings 99% of the time because trauma is complex, and trauma is something that nobody should ever have to go through, especially when talking about childhood trauma.

   what do you believe are the underlying reasons why some teenagers and young children are prone to violent behavior?
  ","
  it depends entirely on the individual child, but it's either due to genetics, to environment, or a combination of nature/nurture. some young children are predisposed to violent behavior as a result of their genes, and that could be further exacerbated through a poor upbringing or exposure to multiple traumas. on the contrary, there are some children who have had a relatively normal upbringing, but they still may be prone to violent behavior as a result of neurological or psychological deficits that have altered their personalities.
  
  i've always found this topic to be extremely interesting because it delves down into the root of aggressive behavior. i'm currently watching a show called ""killer kids"" that's all about children who have committed heinous acts of murder, and it's so mindblowing to me.

  his character is really intriguing because he has low empathy, so he has internal monologues regarding wanting to feel empathy for other people but ultimately viewing people as objects. he wants to study human bodies and he's fixated by how the human body works. he's the textbook definition of a young person who will grow into antisocial personality disorder, and i find his thoughts regarding death and murder to be intriguing.

  ","
  i agree with
  
   @LAKocis
  
  on this: a trump supporter would statistically be more open minded that an extremist feminist, because you don't have to necessarily agree with everything trump says and does in order to support him as a presidential candidate.
  
  extremist feminists, on the other hand, are less likely to budge on their opinion of issues regardless of which facts you throw at them. the very definition of the word extremism presumes something static and inherently bad, so there isn't any room for growth.

   Thoughts about; Feminism
Are you with or against? Followed by the reason.
  ","
  when the topic of feminism first began catching wind on social media, i was quick to align myself with intersectional feminism because it already resonated strongly with the beliefs i currently hold.
  
  however, as time progressed, i feel as if feminism itself took its own course and delved into often restrictive and hypocritical forms of thought, especially on social media sites such as twitter and tumblr. what used to be a respectable mode of thinking turned into something laughable because of the great masses of neo-feminists who spoke on topics they obviously had no idea about and used feminism as a means of advancing their own popularity.
  
  i still believe in many typical 'feminist' beliefs and ways of thinking, and if you had to consider me under any label it would probably be some sort of mixture between intersectional and radical feminism, but i've since distanced myself from the feminist movement because of what it's turned into and how toxic the community has become.

   what means being bipolar? sorry for the question but every description i find on the internet is kinda hard for me to understand
  ","
  bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by severe periods of ""high"" moods and ""low"" moods, called manic and depressive episodes, respectively.
  
  manic episodes are defined by periods of great euphoria, impulsivity, racing thoughts, reckless behavior, needing little to no sleep, etc etc. depressive episodes are defined by periods of hopeless moods, requiring a lot of sleep, anhedonia, little energy, fatigue, etc etc.
  
  there are typically 4 subtypes of bipolar disorder, but most people classify as bipolar 1 or bipolar 2. bipolar 2 disorder had what's called hypomanic episodes where the individual still experienced mania but to a lesser degree. however, in order to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, i believe you need to experience at least one week of manic symptoms followed by two weeks of depressive symptoms, and sometimes symptoms are severe enough to require immediate hospitalization.

   Do you think there are people who are mentally ill but they don't know it? They're not aware they have issues?
  ","
  yes, it's called having a lack of insight into one's condition. they're either in denial about their mental health issues or they're simply unaware that their behavior is problematic.
  
  for example, i'm fairly certain my mother has bipolar disorder but it's not something she would ever consider or admit to having. she thinks she's mentally healthy; meanwhile, my therapist and i have analyzed her behavior and concluded that she's likely mentally ill.

424282,"
   How often do you compliment someone? It is said that we compliment people on how they look, rather than their achievments. For example we will say ""your hair looks nice"" etc, do you feel most compliments are based on appearance?
  ","
  i think most compliments are based on appearances because it's the easiest thing to compliment a person on without putting in too much critical thought behind the compliment. it's simple enough to compliment a person's hairstyle, but you really have to sit there and think about how a person genuinely is in order to compliment something about their personality or their achievements.

Should i bother with counselling..?
  ","
  i will ALWAYS recommend therapy - there's no such thing as ""not depressed enough"" for any kind of mental health treatment, because the fact that you still had bad days is enough to warrant treatment of some kind, whether it's through therapy or medication or a combination of the two.
  
  your therapist isn't going to invalidate your experiences, and if anything, they're going to say the same things i'm telling you with respect to your depression: depression comes and goes in waves, you'll have good days and bad days, and what's important is the progress you will make. therapy is honestly a wonderful thing, it's healthy to gain an outside perspective on your problems and be taught productive means of coping with your feelings, regardless of what those feelings are.

  honestly - i'm not satisfied with my life at all, and it's been really difficult for me to pull myself out of this depressive episode when i'm unhappy with so many areas of my life.
  
  my job is stressful and puts me to the verge of tears nearly every day. my living situation is toxic and i can't progress forward with my recovery while living here. i'm ridden with anxiety most of the day, and my depression leaves me in pain and fatigued.
  
  i'm trying to take the proper steps in order to better my life, but it doesn't happen overnight and it's difficult when i have these mental barriers preventing me from performing even my basic activities of daily living.

   I've heard people say ""illegal drug taking is a victimless crime, no one except the user is affected"" do you agree with this? Why/why not?
  ","
  i disagree with this concept. a person's drug use affects a person's relationships with their spouse/partner, their children, their friends, their employers, etc etc. it's impossible to develop an addiction to an illegal drug and not have it affect a personal relationship in some way. you're not only hurting yourself by enforcing that addiction, but you're also putting your friends and family at risk because of your actions. i've known too many people lose their friends, lose their family, and lose their own lives due to their addictions, and it affects nearly every aspect of someone's life.
  
  drug use is not a victim-less crime, not unless that person is somehow a hermit with no friends or family.

  if it's from a stranger, then i ignore their advances and walk away. i have no interest in deliberately giving them the attention they desire by acknowledging their remarks, and the best thing to do in any scenario is to remove yourself from the situation as fast as you can.

  my boyfriend is more than just simply a boyfriend to me - he's changed my life for the better, he's understanding of my mental health issues, he's incredibly helpful and nurturing, and he's proven himself to be the strongest support system i've ever had, even when i least deserved it. he's given me a reason to keep my suicidal thoughts at bay and not act on my impulses.

   Is this controlling.. I told my bf not to speak to only one of his exes (told him my reasons) he flipped out and told me he doesn't love her anymore but agreed to not befriending her.. The other day I found out he's in group chat with her n his friends, and I'm not added, I feel left out
  ","
  i would say that's borderline controlling and is an indication that on some level, you don't trust your boyfriend. by indicating to him that you don't want him speaking to one of his exes, you're actually indicating that you don't trust the things he could potentially say to her or stand up for his current relationship.
  
  however, he did betray your trust either way by promising not to talk to her and then going behind your back to enter a group chat with her. this is something you need to discuss with him on a mature level.

  i don't see my boyfriend everyday because our work schedules are often opposites of one another, and we also have different family obligations to attend to that reduces the chances of us seeing one another. i'd say we see each other 3-4 times per week.
  
  however, we talk on the phone at least twice per day, send each other snapchats, and text each other occasionally. it actually works out in our favor at times because we're given the space that we need on the days we can't see one another, so that on the days we CAN see each other, we take full advantage of the time given to us.

  everybody is different, so there's really no objective way to answer this question. if you're in a relationship with a person and they need space or if you need space, that's something you'll have to discuss with your partner.
  
  personally speaking, however, i need a lot of space. it's tiring for me to be around people 24/7, and often at the end of the day, i'm content with just being left alone. i do enjoy the company of my partner, and thankfully he is understanding of when i need space versus when i just need his comfort. but the reason why we work so well together is because we're open and honest about our needs to one another. we know when to leave each other alone and we don't get offended if the other person doesn't want to be sociable.

  depression is a diagnosis; it doesn't magically go away if you feel okay for one day here and there. however, if you feel happy and content for weeks and months at a time, it could simply mean that your depression is in remission.
  
  as for your second question, I think it is possible to unconsciously feign symptoms of mental illness without actually having the illness itself. it's like a placebo effect. if you read enough about a disorder, you could unintentionally display ""symptoms"" of that disorder like a self-fulfilling prophecy. look up ""medical student syndrome"" and you'll see that it happens often in medical students who are studying certain disorders.

  tw: self harm
  
  this is a complex question, but the short answer is no. you're purposely causing harm to yourself, regardless of whether or not it physically leaves a mark or a scar. the mindset behind self harm is what's unhealthy and is what needs to be remedied; it doesn't matter how severe the self harm is, the fact that a person is still engaging in it is bad enough to where they require psychological attention.
  
  i can hurt myself and the wound will disappear the next day. that doesn't leave any lasting physical impact on my body, but it's still considered regression, it's still considered relapse. when you resort to unhealthy patterns of thinking in order to deal with emotional pain, that's when it becomes a problem.

  personally speaking, i'm very open about my mental illnesses because i want to spread awareness of mental health issues, stigmas surrounding mental conditions, and how to dissolve those stigmas. if a question is too personal, however (e.g., ""what is your trauma?""), then i don't answer the question at all.

  if they were placed in front of me, i probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference (especially since i've never tasted subway coffee before). i'm pretty sure both starbucks and mcdonalds use arabica beans in their regular coffee blends, and they're also both fairly strong.

  i don't know about establishing a primary diagnosis, but there are often cerebral abnormalities in the brains of people who are mentally ill compared to those who aren't mentally ill. obviously to be diagnosed with a mental illness, you need to have an evaluation with a psychologist or psychiatrist, but sometimes doctors can rule out neurological causes through radiological imaging (such as in the case of traumatic brain injuries, for example).

  i have a tendency to become attached too quickly to new friends, which makes me over-analyze people's messages and intentions & causes me to over-share past normal boundaries.

   How would you describe your boyfriend's personality?
  ","
  he's like a homemade chocolate chip cookie: tough and hard to break on the outside, but soft and gooey on the inside. he gives off the impression that he's emotionless and a jokester to those he doesn't know, but he's actually incredibly caring and thoughtful to his friends and family.
  
  there are also so many facets to his personality that its hard to describe him in one shot. he's musically inclined, artistic, good with his hands, he has a strong work ethic, and he's very good with children and animals. he's a good person by heart, but his life has led him astray in a variety of ways, and now he's in the process of turning things around. he's one of the deepest and most interesting people i've ever met.

  i think it did a shit job of 'raising awareness' for svicide and mental health - filming graphic scenes glamorizes and makes a spectacle out of trauma, it doesn't actually inform the audience of the implications of being mentally ill and how trauma can affect someone.
  
  i also really dislike how everyone on social media is suddenly 'woke' and 'spreading awareness' for svicide prevention and trauma because of a tv show that romanticizes mental illness. neurotypical people are trying to speak up over trauma survivors over what's 'acceptable' and 'unacceptable,' and it's only silencing survivors, not giving them a voice.

  ","
  it's certainly an interesting idea, but i feel as if it would be hard to implement because a lot of cyber-bullying is based on anonymity. while there are ways to find out someone's IP address, it isn't always guaranteed because you don't know if someone is using a public server (like at a library).

  our first date was actually dinner and a movie; we ate at johnny rockets, which is a 50s-styled diner, and we saw one of the wolverine movies afterwards (lol). after that, things just eventually fell into place and we started dating regularly, even when i later traveled 300 miles away to college. our relationship has been tumultuous since then, but it's calmed down a lot over the past few years and i can't imagine being with anyone else.

  as an additional matter, addiction is considered a mental health issue. treatment for addiction is similar to treatment for other mental illnesses, which includes rehabilitation and outpatient (or sometimes inpatient) therapy and medication management. it's a diagnosed mental health condition listed in the DSM and ICD, so for all intents and purposes, it's a medical disease.

  it doesn't focus on hannah's feeling as much as it does on the feelings of everyone else around her and the drama that ensues as a result of that. with a topic as heavy as svicide, i would have wanted them to be more sensitive towards the subject matter and allegedly the producers went against a lot of what psychologists advised for them to do to make it a safer series.
  
  i simply don't think people should ultimately profit off of the subject matter - if you're going to make a drama off of svicide, then be mature and informative about it. i feel like they ultimately skirted the issue, not to mention the graphic scenes which were totally unnecessary. idk i'm very conflicted about the entire project.

  all of my scars have been self-inflicted. i have them all over my arms and my legs, and it makes navigating my daily life a living hell every day because it makes it difficult to wear short sleeves without receiving comments from strangers.
  
  in the same vein, it pisses me off how internet culture has somehow romanticized scarring into some tragic, fragile metaphor. scarring depletes nerve tissue and causes a host of medical problems, not to mention the emotional implications of living day to day with horrific scarring all over your body. it isn't romantic and it isn't something people should be craving to have. i detest all of my scars and i beat myself up everyday for doing this to myself.

  lately i haven't been having the best relationship with food, so it doesn't matter to me whether a meal is hot or cold. as long as it works in giving me the proper nutrients, the temperature doesn't much matter. lately i've been eating as a necessity rather than a desire, i don't derive pleasure from eating like i used to.

   What does 'old fashioned' mean to you? Do you think of yourself as old fashioned?
  ","
  to me, old fashioned means to be antiquated in thought processes, following a set of moral codes that aren't necessarily relevant to today's modern age. for example, having an 'old fashioned' mindset would include the conglomeration of church and state, reinforcement of gender stereotypes, etc.
  
  i'm definitely not old fashioned in the way i think and behave, especially because i'm considered to be a millennial and constantly at the forefront of new technology and patterns of thinking. i can see social trends and behaviors and adjust myself accordingly.

424596,"
   Is intelligence a ""leadery"" trait, iyo? Why/why not?
  ","
  it depends entirely upon what you're using that intelligence for, in my opinion. it can be a leader-like trait if you have a natural disposition for being a leader, in that you can use your intelligence to group together masses of people and guide them towards a common goal.
  
  however, you can also use intelligence 'behind the scenes,' so to speak. many people with higher IQs are more prone to being socially-isolative as they would rather be with themselves inside their own head as opposed to being around people 24/7.

  yes - who honestly wouldn't get annoyed at that behavior ?? if there's one pet peeve of mine, it would actually be this sort of behavior. it gets under my skin when people don't show their gratitude for other people's actions if it aids them in some respect. you have to be fairly self-centered in order to not say thank you when someone helps you or is nice to you.

   Tell me about the last thing you ate! Was it good? Would you recommend it? Where did you hear about it?
  ","
  the last good thing i ate was a burrito bowl at moe's southwest grill - i ordered it with white rice, black beans, salsa, cheese, chicken, and guacamole. it was delicious and i'm honestly craving to go back again !!
  
  i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys spicy mexican food (yeah, i know it's not authentic mexican food though) because it's very customizable and pretty cheap. one serving of food could easily be two meals and its only $13-15 for a meal, a drink, chips, and a side of guac or queso.

  this is irrelevant to my interests because i'm already in a long term committed relationship and i can't see myself dating anyone else.

  of course. being mentally ill doesn't excuse you from exhibiting appropriate behavior. you can simultaneously have a personality disorder and have enough insight into your disorder to know when your behavior is becoming toxic to other people.
  
  i have a personality disorder myself, but i still hold myself accountable for my actions. my mental illness is not an excuse or scapegoat for how i behave.

   Today's young children are growing up with technology in all parts of their life. What are some of the pros and cons of today's technology (tv, fb, phones, websites, movies, etc) and can you share your ideas of how you would advise children to use these forms of technology in appropriate ways.
  ","
  pros:
  
  - ability to interact with people across the globe
  
  - immediate access to a plethora of disposable information
  
  - an array of avenues of self-expression
  
  cons:
  
  - firsthand risk of being exposed to cyber-bullying and other dangers
  
  - too much time delving in technology leads to less time being outside, which is integral in a child's development and growth
  
  - it could lead to self-isolation
  
  i think teachers and parents should be proactive in how they approach their children using the internet and other technology; for instance, monitoring activity too closely may lead the child to seek out dangerous, reckless behavior. in addition, i believe open communication is very important and the child shouldn't be afraid to tell their parents or authorities if they see something that makes them uncomfortable.

   10. Do you have any plans to go back to school for another degree of any kind? If so, what for? If you could study absolutely anything regardless of cost/time/skills/etc., what would you choose?
  ","
  i've been debating about going back for my master's degree, but i honestly don't know what i would go for. at this point, it isn't worth it for me to go back to school because i would likely accumulate even more debt for an education that i would, in all honesty, obtain just for fun.
  
  i'm interested in so many things that i wouldn't be able to narrow it down. psychology has always been a big interest of mine, but mainly in theory; while i do love helping people, i'd rather do it from behind the curtain instead of interacting with people directly. i'm a writer at my current job, so i'd probably want to continue with that trend.

  ","
  ✧ loyalty - i wouldn't be able to trust myself with a person who wasn't loyal to me. i'm also too old to play childish trust games with people. you're either with me or without me.
  
  ✧ support - i wouldn't be able to be with a person who wasn't supportive or understanding of my mental health conditions. part of the reason why i adore my boyfriend so much is because of how supportive he's been throughout our entire relationship. he's never backed down or shied away from me when i've acted out. he's always approached me with understanding and a desire to make me comfortable.
  
  ✧ sense of humor - i wouldn't be able to date a person who couldn't make me laugh. laughter is a cornerstone of relationships for me, and i simply wouldn't be comfortable with a person if i wasn't continuously amused by them or able to share amusing moments with them.

  ","
  i usually dog-ear the page out of laziness - tbh i like when books look worn in, like they've been read countless times, because it shows that the precious owner obviously enjoyed the book and felt comfortable enough with it to treat it as their own. there's a certain comfort to take away from seeing a worn in novel, you have to think about the lives it may have touched throughout the years and the journey it took to enter your hands.

   People do not expect surgeons to operate on themselves, yet most of us expect psychotherapists to be problem-free when it comes to psychological conditions, interpersonal relationships, emotions etc. Why do you think that is?

   5. What would you say is your most controversial opinion? Why do you think more people don't agree with that viewpoint?

  i suppose my most controversial opinion is the fact that i believe that those who are muslim are not inherently violent, and islam itself as a religion is not inherently destructive or dangerous. the only reason why i consider it my most controversial opinion is because it's the one topic people continuously argue with me about over the course of the many years i've been on askfm.
  
  i think people don't agree with my perspective because islam is predominant in areas of the middle east where terrorism is prevalent; it's more of a geographic phenomenon than a religious one. however, ever since the attacks on 9/11, fear towards muslims as a whole has been multiplied and it doesn't help that the media plays upon people's fears and has turned islam as a whole into a stigma, especially against the majority of people who are muslim and peaceful.

   What is your opinion on certain theaters, parents, etc wanting to boycott 'Beauty and the Beast' because of misleading click bait about the characters sexuality?

  i think it's childish and homophobic. if you're going to prevent your child from seeing a movie just because one of the side characters is rumored to be gay, then you're in for a rude awakening when your child gets older and starts experiencing the world for how it truly is.
  
  you cannot shelter your children forever, and you cannot enforce your own beliefs down their throats and expect them to adopt the same views as you - especially in today's age where being lgbt has more inclusivity than ever before. it says more about who you are as a parent than what that movie represents.

   have you ever intentionally manipulated someone in order to meet your own needs? conversely, have you ever been manipulated by someone else for them to meet their own needs? what were the outcomes of those situations?
  ","
  yes, i've intentionally manipulated people for my own personal gain. and i've also been terribly manipulated by others for their own personal gains too.
  
  i've been emotionally abvsed my entire life, so it's difficult to come from a healthy perspective in terms of how i treat others when i came from a position of not knowing what being treated fairly was like. eventually as i got older, i developed a weak sense of morality, enough to know right versus wrong and to know what was being done to me was wrong, but that doesn't erase the manipulation i've committed in the past.
  "
424666,"
   have you ever censored what you thought or felt because you were afraid of the outcome? what happened?
  ","
  yes - there have been times i've held myself back because i was afraid of what would come as a consequence of my opinions. it's mostly happened in a family or professional setting, i simply didn't want to offend a family member or coworker with my opinions so i chose to stay silent instead.
  
  sometimes you have to pick your battles wisely; i wouldn't necessarily call it censorship towards myself because i was deliberately choosing not to say something that i felt because i knew there would be adverse reactions to it. i'm fairly open about my opinions on askfm, but that's an entirely different environment.
  "
424667,"
   What's the secret to a successful relationship? How did yours work? Do you have to comprise?
  ","
  open communication and compromises are what make relationships work. you have to be willing to talk about things that make you uncomfortable, regardless of how hard they are, so that you and your partner are always on the same page. you have to learn how to take each other's feelings into consideration so that you can make decisions that will act on behalf of both of your interests. you have to be selfless.
  
  my relationship works so well because we've been through hell and back together. we've been through situations that have made regular arguments seem petty and meaningless, we've been through crises that have forced us to question our own mortality, we've endured death and addiction and heartache and survival. we've lasted for as long as we have because we've put our faith in one another during dark struggles and have re-surfaced stronger than ever before.
  "
424668,"
   When, if ever, can love be considered an act of defiance? Elaborate, please.
  ","
  love can be considered an act of defiance if it's against a cultural or familial norm - for example, couples with religious differences, lgbt+ couples, interracial couples, etc. some people are raised in families where they're told it's wrong to be romantic with certain groups of people, and if one happens to fall in love with someone from one of those groups, their very love itself can be misconstrued as an act of defiance against their family or their cultural norms.

  "
424671,"
   Do you find comfort in relinquishing control or would you rather be alert at all times, in all aspects of your daily endeavors? Why?
  ","
  i find myself wavering between the two concepts a lot - sometimes i'll want nothing except to lose control, and other times i require steadfast alert and control over every aspect of my life, otherwise i'll feel as if my life is a whirlwind of chaos.
  
  lately, however, i've been leaning towards loosening up my inhibitions. i've been wanting to be out of character, out of mind, for quite a few weeks now, and i can't really place my finger on why. it's suddenly okay for me to let loose and let myself go and fly in the wind and see wherever it takes me, while in the past, i used to be incredibly rigid.
  "
424672,"
   how do americans believe that america is a ""land of opportunity""?
  ","
  i think it's moreso travelers from other countries who believe that america is a land of opportunity - most americans i know are actually very unpatriotic and believe it's difficult to really be offered opportunities here, which i partially agree with. it can be difficult at times to climb the economic ladder if you don't have personal connections or a financial safety net.
  
  that being said, i'm also aware that there are a whole handful of countries who offer even less opportunities than america, so by comparison, america is the golden land for opportunities.

My family suggested breaking up. they feel at 24 she should be done with college & working a full time professional job. I'm starting to see my friends buying homes /having children. she has no savings. should i dump her?
  ","
  yes, you should break up with her.
  
  she clearly deserves to be with a person who loves her and supports her endeavors, regardless of the monetary outcome of those endeavors. she's working towards a MASTER'S DEGREE - obviously she isn't going to be finished with college for a while, and if you can't support her education, then she deserves someone who WILL.
  
  as an additional matter - it's meaningless to compare your own personal milestones with the milestones of others. your friends who are buying homes and having children shouldn't be a basis for comparison with your own life, because everyone's lives are on their own separate timeline. these things will come to you when you're ready.

  sexuality is controversial, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be discussed or embraced - the more we talk about sexuality, the more education will be spread regarding it and it'll lessen stigmas associated with it. sexuality is an innate part of most human beings, and to ignore that is to ignore a part of what makes most people human. if we embrace our sexuality and talk more freely about all of the different types of sexualities there are, the more understanding we'll become of it.

   Do you think people would be more tolerant of perceived plagiarism if they were fully informed on things like cryptomnesia (failure to recognize a past memory that may lead a person to claim existing ideas as their own unintentionally)?

  i don't think so, no. plagiarism is usually deliberate, and even if an idea was 'stolen' without the person remembering the origins, they'll still be devising it in their own words, not the words of the original storyteller. plagiarism is normally the exact copying of an idea or written text word for word and then claimed to be original, so it's a bit different than perceived plagiarism through cryptomnesia.

  that also depends on your perception - what makes someone good or bad? is the hero still a good person if they sacrificed the lives of many people in order to save just one person? or are they considered somewhat of a villian in that aspect?
  
  i think there's a universal agreement that heroes can only be stereotypically 'good' people, but someone who does bad things could also be seen as a hero to someone, depending on the perspective of the audience. it really starts to twist your concept on morality the more that you think about it.

  ","
  a part of getting older is coming to the understanding that some people place a different emphasis on things than you do - some people place a high priority on sex, but that doesn't mean that their concerns aren't any more or less valid than yours are. it just simply means you're looking at life from two different points of view, and those points of view aren't compatible.

  i think modern feminism has lost track of what it was originally about, and it needs to return to its roots. most modern feminists have focused too much on insignificant ideologies, which in turn makes feminism as a whole look somewhat like a joke. feminism isn't about shaving or wearing bras or anything like that - at its very core, it's about basic human rights and equality, and a lot of people tend to lose sight of that.
  
  i don't consider myself a modern/intersectional feminist anymore because of the bad associations. i'm honestly tired of telling people i'm a feminist and being laughed at because i'm judged based on the immaturity of the majority instead of being listened to for my own opinions. there are a lot of feminist principles that i still adhere to, but i don't feel comfortable associating myself with the movement itself anymore. i believe what i believe and that's that.

  that's generic for xanax - which is similar to ativan in that its in the class of benzodiazepines and helps treat anxiety and panic attacks. it slows down your central nervous system and relaxes you and its only meant to be taken on an as-needed basis (whether you need it once a day, or once a week, or whenever). it's not a medication you use the same time everyday, it's only when you feel anxiety coming on.
  
  i can understand being afraid of side effects though - believe me, i've been through the ringer a dozen times with too many medications for me to count, so i've experienced them all haha.

  i'm sorry you're feeling this way. i was feeling that way too until i felt i had no choice but to talk to my doctor, and they slowly introduced me to medication to help straighten out my chemicals and make me feel better.
  
  i strongly urge you to see a doctor if you're thinking about medication. they're actually very helpful, especially when conjoined with therapy. there's nothing wrong with taking medication for depression or anxiety and it saves lives.

   how does it make you feel? do you feel different after taking it? also i read on your profile that you consume alcohol
  ","
  the only medication that makes me feel different after taking it is ativan, and that's because it's a benzodiazepine and works to immediately take effect in the body, causing a calming effect (i take it when i feel a panic attack coming on).
  
  the rest of my medication is just part of my daily regimen, so it doesn't make me feel different when i take it everyday. over time, it steadily brought me back to a regular baseline state but it's not as if it changes my mood everyday or something.
  
  and yes, i drink alcohol. it has no interaction with my specific medication (except the ativan, but i don't drink when i'm taking ativan).

  i feel you - it sounds contradictory. and tbh racial violence still exists whether people want to acknowledge it or not. there's a lot more black on black crime that a lot of people don't take into consideration, and there's also plenty of interracial violence too. a lot of factors go into what fosters violence, and i don't think that violence is colorblind because there's still a lot of stigma held against poc and the community, especially in more urban areas.

   Is it normal to feel jealous of other people, when they are better than me? I don't get jealous over material things. I get jealous when someone is more knowledgeable than me, I don't know how can deal with this
  ","
  sorry it took me so long to respond to this !! tbh i think it's common, but i wouldn't necessarily say 'normal' if that makes sense. as in, it happens to a lot of people from all walks of life but you shouldn't allow it to get you down because it's incredibly hard to compare yourself to other people when we come from all different environments and have our own set of strengths.
  
  even if someone is more knowledgeable than you, that doesn't mean you're NOT knowledgeable with what you already know - it's just in different areas. and you should take pride in what you know because guaranteed you know something the other person does not, and they likely feel the same way towards you !!
  
  i understand 100% where you're coming from though - i often get down on myself because other people are smarter than me, but then i'm also reminded that i have my own set of unique skills that others do not have, so that reassures me.

  i would assume so, yes - you're bound together legally through marriage, so the responsibility of commitment is a lot more bearing than if you were in a relationship alone. to separate would mean to get a divorce, which costs a lot of time and money. so people are essentially taking a risk, and a leap of faith, when they get married - which makes it even more important to ensure that you are 100% certain, without a shadow of a doubt, that you are to remain committed to your partner.

  not necessarily. honeymoon phases are when you first enter a relationship and haven't established a history with your partner - you're living off of the fumes of new love, new experiences, new everything.
  
  when you're in a seasoned relationship, however, it's not as if those feelings disappear - they just take on a new form. the level of intimacy you have with your partner can take your breath away, they begin to know you better than you know yourself, and you feel as if you have the strongest support system because of your strong foundations. there's an unmatched feeling of comfort when you're around your partner and it's liberating.

  and what's even worse is that the perceptions are 100% wrong - even down to the name of the fucking disorder. but people refuse to educate themselves and do their own research or listen to people, like yourself, with DID who actively advocate against movies like split - because they don't have to suffer with this shit everyday because they don't have the diagnosis.

   This isn't bait, I'm genuinely trying to see the fault you have with the movie.
It's not saying all people with split personalities are evil - they're saying one is. It does not say ""all people with this disorder are absolute MANIACS."" or anything. It basically says this one man is.
  ","
  you can promote a horror movie about a killer without putting blame on a mental illness that's ALREADY highly stigmatized to begin with. people ALREADY think those with DID are violent and homicidal when they're not, and this movie is promoting that stereotype. there's no reason to use a mental illness which afflicts thousands of people as a plot device.
  
  it doesn't matter if the movie is trying to say ""yeah well ONLY THIS ONE GUY IS NUTS."" humankind doesn't work that way. and now thousands of people with DID are going to be walking around in fear of their safety because everyone is going to assume that they're also murderous and violent.

   What do you think the reasons people become teachers? What do you think they find satisfying about their work? What strengths do you have that would make you a good teacher?
  ","
  i would never become a teacher myself, but i suppose each one has their own reason to doing so - i have friends who are teachers because they want to make a genuine difference in young kids' lives, they want to open the doors of education for them, and they want to see students succeed. teaching takes a lot of sacrifices, so you have to truly be passionate for the job.
  "
425039,"
   Not trying to be rude or anything. But I don't really understand why so many kids somewhere between the ages of 14 and 19 are so desperate to loose their virginity ? Like why are you rushing to have sex, when half of you don't understand about protective sex you just do for pleasure. Just saying
  ","
  likely due to societal pressures - our society is revolved around sex, as if it's the greatest thing to happen to humankind. from such young ages, we're taught that sex is something to be desired, and as kids hit puberty, they're conditioned into thinking about sex without fully understanding the repurcussions of it.

   three unpopular opinions about feminism!
  ","
  - third wave feminism has become somewhat of a joke these days, and most internet feminists adhere themselves to causes which don't make much of a valid difference in the world (e.g., free the nipple campaign, making everyone feel inclusive, etc). there's a lot of rhetoric about accepting people regardless of who they are, which is a bit counter-productive considering how feminism began due to a dire need for radical change.
  
  - i strongly oppose the death penalty, regardless of who it is who's on the chopping block. i don't want to waste taxpayer dollars on criminals who are getting the easy way out of their circumstance - they deserve to rot in jail and be victim to the other inmates for the rest of their lives.
  
  - lifesaving medications should be free of cost or, if not, at least extremely affordable. the games that insurance companies play with pharmaceuticals and doctor offices is asinine, and it prevents a lot of people from obtaining medication which can literally save their life. diabetics shouldn't have to empty their wallets to pay for their insulin, just like how a mental health patient shouldn't go without their mood stabilizers because they can't afford it.

  a lot of americans only know of female and male bathrooms - in public settings, there has never actually been a gender neutral bathroom that anyone could use regardless of their gender. as such, when the topic of transgender people using bathrooms became a hot topic, a lot of americans were up in arms because they didn't know which bathroom they """"""""should"""""""" use.
  
  point blank, if we introduced gender neutral bathrooms as a third option, i think it would eradicate a lot of the mass hysteria that exists regarding the whole bathroom issue.

  i think it's wildly inappropriate, especially given what MLK stood for in his time and what his ideals still stand for today. it's a spit in the face to all people of color who continue to spread MLK's message and ideas in modern times, and it only shows how open people's racism will be once trump is inaugurated.

   Should the law define a minimum age at which children should be allowed to walk to school alone, or should it be left to the judgement of the parents?

  i think it should be left up to the discretion of the parents - a lot of variables are involved in allowing children to walk to school, including the kind of environment they live in, crime rates in the area, how far the distance is between home and school, etc.

  everything is powered by money - they don't actually want to improve your phones, they only release new models when they see everyone has already bought the older model, and then they make it so that you have no choice but to purchase the new model because a certain feature won't work otherwise.
  
  it's the same concept when phones suddenly break or functions don't work anymore - you're then forced to purchase a new product or upgrade instead of fixing it, thereby giving the company more power and more money. it's a horrible system that isn't at all revolved around the consumer at all. it's all part of a power trip to make the companies more money.

  have you ever considered that those who are trans are most susceptible to violent situations BECAUSE of the fact that they're trans ??
  
  studies done on the topic have not made any positive or negative correlation between being trans and having a history of abvse - because even when you take away the abvse, those people still identify as trans. healing from the abvse and finding justice does not undo the fact that they're trans, which suggests that there is no clear-cut correlation between the two.

   Hey what's up?
  ","
  hello there ~
  
  right now, i'm spending my time answering questions on askfm, listening to music, and having breakfast. i spent the morning shoveling and cleaning off my car; it ended up snowing 8-9 inches last night, so it was a pain in the ass, to say the least.
  
  later on in the day, i'm planning on maybe taking a ride to the gas station, and then i have laundry to do. i'm caught in that strange limbo where i want to be lazy and do nothing, but i know i'd feel better when i'm being active.

  that's exactly my reasoning behind why i don't use those faces now, haha. i used to use them when i was 13-15 years old, and it just makes my current sentences feel so immature and naive if i were to give into my urges to use them out of habit.

  male and female aren't genders. they're sexes.
  
  you're correct in that i'm female - that's my biological sex, and i've always been open about that. however, i'm nonbinary, which means that my gender doesn't align with one of the two polar opposites of the sex spectrum. i don't feel like a ""girl,"" nor do i feel like a ""boy."" i'm happiest when i'm completely androgynous.

  idk the statistics on the topic, so this is something you'll have to research on your own. the term ""most"" is just an assumption and its probably inaccurate. the pill isn't an ideal form of birth control for many people, and generally it takes a few doctor visits (and trial and errors) to determine what method of birth control is best.

  for me, it's more of the problem of recognizing that the person is toxic to me - i've always had a hard time with that, but i've been trying to live by the mantra of ""keep people in your life who make the effort to keep you in theirs.""
  
  if someone doesn't make the effort to see how i'm doing, and if they don't respond to my efforts of calling attention to it, then i don't need them in my life anymore. i don't have room for anyone who won't promote positivity or better well being.

   What is your opinion on the Pit Bull that aggressively attacked a man, a woman, and their child that shown in a video was after the woman was trying to force a pet sweater on the dog? Do you think the attack can at all be justified? Should the dog be re homed or euthanized?
  ","
  animals, especially dogs, are products of their environments - if the dog is acting aggressively, it's most likely due to the fact that the dog has been abvsed in that home or has been witness to violence.
  
  the dog isn't to blame - they're just working off of their basic instincts that has been instilled in them as a result of their environment. obviously this isn't the first time the family put this dog through great stress for their own amusement, otherwise he wouldn't have behaved so aggressively. an investigation into the household is warranted.
  
  as for the dog, i personally believe he should be re-homed. but because society sucks and doesn't understand basic behavior, he's likely going to be put down and not given a chance for redemption.

  ","
  jfc, shit like this pisses me off so much.
  
  there's diagnostic criteria to mental disorders for a reason. people go to school for years and study mental illnesses for a damn reason. to properly assess and diagnose illnesses for those who are legitimately suffering from them, to offer them the best course of treatment available so that they can have the best quality of life.
  
  the fact that people are jokingly saying they have PTSD is such a kick in the face of survivors who DO experience all of the classic symptoms of PTSD, every day, without warning. this is why there's still so much stigma revolved around mental illness. because people view it as a fucking joke and ignore those who are genuinely struggling.

   three unpopular opinions about feminism
  ","
  - i feel like feminism has turned more into a social trend as opposed to a form of activism, which disappoints me because it's led so far astray from its original intentions. it's part of the reason why i don't identify with feminism anymore - there are so many feminists who don't do their research, ascribe to trains of thought with no intellectual meaning, and regurgitate false information just because it's something that's on buzzfeed now.
  
  - people who force themselves into communities in which they don't belong, like feminist communities or communities revolving around specific mental health problems, are disgusting and are the reasons why there is still so much stigma revolved around mental illness. you can simultaneously support your friends with mental illnesses (i.e. due to trauma) without infringing upon their communities. it's the reason why i don't tell people i have a personality disorder, because while my doctors have been alluding towards it in our sessions, i haven't been officially diagnosed and i wouldn't want to step on anyone's toes.
  
  - stop romanticizing and fetishizing unhealthy and destructive coping techniques. stop making aesthetics out of people's genuine mental health concerns. if you've never suffered from an ed or sh or anything else, you have no right to wax poetic on what they truly are: horrible addictions.

  and as a result, feminism has become somewhat of a joke for people to poke fun at and ridicule because of the mass quantities of people who misinterpret feminism as a whole and use it to further their own gains. i've stopped aligning myself with modern feminism for that reason, i don't want to be seen as another ""trend follower"" when my beliefs and opinions are rooted in facts and data.

   do happy relationships need compromise? are there relationships out there where the couple just agrees on everything and respects one another? if u compromise isnt that showing you're not compatible?
  ","
  think about how we are as humans, with our flaws and nasty traits that we wish we could change but can't. nobody is perfect and its impossible to find someone worth who you'll agree on things 100%. it's normal for couples to butt heads on issues, and its expected because that shows that you at least are open and communicating with your partner.
  
  compromising is actually a good thing - it shows that you both are aware that you have different opinions on something but you respect that other person's opinion. if couples didn't compromise on important things and weren't able to accept their partners flaws, then the relationship would crumble (and shows that they're not compatible anyway).

  religion is important on an individual scale -- not necessarily on a global scale. religion is used for personal enrichment and to give people the answers they seek regarding the universe, it instills in people a sense of faith and hope and purpose. all of these things are personalized and dependent upon how you interpret the religion yourself.
  
  sometimes, however, religion does impact society -- and sometimes it's in a bad way... i.e. radical acts of faith, mass murders, etc. it's when these people accept those religions to an extreme scale and cannot view the world in any other way than how they've been conditioned to think.

   If you disagree with someone close to you (spouse/friend/family) how do you convince them to think the same as you? Or do you just accept your difference in opinion? Explain.
  ","
  there's no way to convince someone to think the same way you do -- you can give them your reasoning as to why you think the way that you do about a certain topic, but the decision to alter their views is ultimately up to them. you cannot enforce your opinion onto other people with the expectation that they'll bend to your whim.
  
  that being said, i accept differences in opinion. everyone is entitled to their own opinion as long as they don't try to force it upon other people in a rough manner or hurt people in the process.

  i wouldn't necessarily say ""evil,"" but yes -- money is by far the root of all sorts of greed and corruption, especially in a political sense. this world is run by the monetary value our society has, and people are judged based off of what money they do or don't have. it's sad to think that most people literally cannot survive if they don't have an income of some kind because of things such as shelter, food, and water.

   eggs! #triggered! LMAO joke of the year!!!
  ","
  this is something that gets under my skin - people who make fun of other people's triggers simply because they don't understand what a trigger actually is or how it can affect the person struggling with those triggers.
  
  i've never suffered from an ED myself, but i've had close friends who have - and food can be just as much of a trigger for people with EDs as loud noises or certain smells are for those with PTSD. making fun of a person because their trigger is a certain food is blatantly misunderstanding the concept of what a trigger is, and i hope everyone who has ""laughed"" at a trigger realizes how harmful their attitude can be to people who are in recovery.
  
  people have turned triggers into a joke, and its done so much harm to the mental health community. patients are literally afraid to tell their triggers to their doctors because they think they'll be humiliated, that's how badly this has gotten. it's despicable.

   Hi Leigh, hope it's alright to ask a mental health q, but do you ever feel like you can't be completely honest with your counsellor/therapist in regards to how you feel? Just not sure if that's normal or not, or it's a case of needing to find a different therapist. Thanks :)

  i feel that way a lot, actually - often i feel like i can't tell my therapist the entire truth because i'm afraid she'll judge me wrongly due to all of the terrible things i used to do in my past. in my case, i don't think it's a reflection of the type of therapist she is (because realistically, i know she probably won't judge me), but it's moreso a reflection of my own mental health issues.
  
  however, i do understand where you're coming from. i've had therapists in the past whom i felt i couldn't be entirely truthful because i didn't think they would understand, there was a generation gap, etc. it goes on a case-by-case basis... if you feel like you're not connecting with them or there's miscommunication, perhaps that's an indication that this person isn't entirely right for you. you need to have a therapist whom you can trust.

And the sun warming the blood within your skin after the coldest of winter. And the rain against your window will sing you to a peaceful sleep. And you will awaken some mornings in the arms of someone who will love you most of all. There will be moments when your soul will gleam so beautifully, even the universe will bask in your happiness. Yes, you will suffer. But you will be happy beyond your wildest dreams. And that will make every second of the suffering worth it.'
  
  They should say that. Because it is that balance that makes us beautifully and softly human.""

   Is time the only true indicator of people's care to a person?
  ","
  in my opinion, no. time isn't a reliable factor when it comes to gauging how much a person may care about you. someone could be playing you all along and keep up a relationship for their own benefit, meanwhile you could come across someone who genuinely cares about you within days of interacting with them. it has more to do with who a person is innately rather than the time you spend together.

   what kinds of things were your parents into? did they pass any of that passion to you? (I grew up in a very music-oriented family, and am not musically inclined at all!)
  ","
  my mother is very religious, and as far as i'm aware, the only things she seems to be interested in are soap operas, cooking, and food. i can't say any of those interests have been passed down onto me.
  
  my father is very mechanically-inclined, he's an engineer and works w/ his hands on various household projects. while i'm not a handyman by any means, i can pick apart the way something works with my mind and be able to understand how it functions pretty easily. so i suppose i got that from him.

  - the end of the crisis in syria.

  - the destruction of common core (although i highly doubt that'll happen).
  
  - an end to police brutality and the lack of repercussions given to officers who break the rules in the US.
  
  and on a more personal level, i hope that in 2017 i will have learned better coping mechanisms, came to terms with my trauma, perhaps find a new job, and move into my own apartment.

   Unpopular Opinions?
  ","
  idk if these are necessarily unpopular or not, but:
  
  - don't adopt an animal for someone as a gift unless you're 200% sure that they have the resources to properly take care of that animal.
  
  - i'm partly guilty of this bc i've been so scatter-brained lately, but there needs to be more talk about aleppo and events happening in the middle east instead of people beating a dead horse about issues that aren't significant.
  
  - you don't get to dictate how someone defines their sexuality or their gender. if you're someone who believes that transgender individuals are attention-seeking or making things up, then you can go fck yourself.
  
  - while everyone has the right to express themselves, i think it's appropriate for certain workplaces to have dress codes and other codes of conduct. professional environments exist whether or not we like them, and you're not being hardcore or edgy by purposely breaking the rules for individuality's sake.
  
  - winter > summer
  
  - if someone hurts your feelings or makes you feel unsafe, then they don't get to decide that your feelings aren't/shouldn't be hurt. it's okay to get rid of toxic people who were once important to you.

  2. ""Love is a temporary madness, it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides. And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. No, don’t blush, I am telling you some truths. That is just being 'in love,' which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident."" - Louis de Bernières.
  
  3. ""There is nothing beautiful about the wreckage of a human being. There is nothing pretty about damage, about pain, about heartache. What is beautiful is their strength, their resilience, their fortitude as they display an ocean of courage when they pick through the wreckage of their life to build something beautiful brand new, against every odd that is stacked against them."" - Nikita Gill.

   No ik what it is I'm just asking bc you're more educated on that topic than i am
  ","
  sex is the biological characteristics that determine whether you're male, female, or intersex. primary and secondary sex traits.
  
  gender is your identity - the way you feel in regards to yourself when compared to gender standards and roles.
  
  cisgender means your gender identity aligns with your assigned sex. transgender is an umbrella term that means your gender identity doesn't align with your sex. being nonbinary, for instance, means you hover somewhere in between the polar opposites on the gender spectrum - not entirely male or not entirely female or neither.

  i've always brought food from home - usually because it's cheaper. my office building doesn't have a café, it's just a room with tables and chairs, so i usually bring lunch from home and i'll eat at my desk or in my car (yay social anxiety).
  
  when i was in school, i pretty much did the same thing. i'd try to find a one-person table somewhere and i'd write papers while eating. the only difference is that my college had a pretty good food area, so i wasted a lot of money between classes on food lol.

   Should we require abortion if the fetus has one or more genetic illnesses?
  ","
  if this was the case, then there would be such a small percentage of people giving birth because a majority of people have some sort of genetic illness, whether it's apparent to them or not. a lot of illnesses aren't even able to be recognized until after birth, and it's extremely ignorant to assume that a person's life is not worth living if they happen to have a certain disorder.
  "
425634,"
   Can you be in love with more than one person at the same time?
  ","
  i don't see why not. the human capacity for love is limitless, and our emotions are intricate and complex. it wouldn't surprise me to learn of someone being head over heels in love with two different people for a variety of different reasons.
  "
425635,"
   Should transgender people be allowed to adopt? Why or why not?
  ","
  i don't understand what someone's gender has anything to do with whether or not they're a good parent. if a child needs a loving home and someone is able to prove they're a loving human being with a good home, they should be able to give that child a home.

  honestly, yeah. unfortunately, boys grow up in this gendered society where men aren't ""supposed to show emotion."" hypermasculinity as prompted by the media makes people believe that they're not a ""real man"" if they show sensitivity. so when it comes to boys with depression, they're often told to get over it or they're not even taken seriously.

  before i read her answers, i honestly didn't even know that schools are allowed to authorize trips that weren't educational in nature. when i was growing up, my districts were so poor that if we were given money for a field trip, it was to be used to go to a museum or something worthwhile.

  ","
  ok so you guys know that i generally don't involve myself in drama, but considering i'm a feminist as well as a disability advocate, i felt the need to say something.
  
  the way marissa went about portraying her opinion was wrong - that, i agree with. you (collectively) do not get to decide who does or does not get offended by what you (collectively) say - that doesn't make people too sensitive, it makes them human beings. by stating what she said, it gave an incredibly bad name to those with disabilities and only furthered the stigma that those with disabilities are somehow ""lesser"" human beings. and, as you know, that isn't true.
  
  i think what's crucial here is language - the term ""burden"" has many heavy, negative connotations. and while i think marissa had a logical theory in mind, she went about portraying that opinion in a very negative fashion. obviously being disabled places a person in positions of medical or financial destitution, but the term ""burden"" has always meant something deeper/more intimate than that, and i think that's why this entire situation went awry.
  
  people with disabilities are not ""burdens"" (in the negative context of the term), and if you ask parents with disabled children, they will tell you that they're thankful for what they have - because having a child when you want one is better than not having one at all. if you're the type of person who could not handle having a child with a disability, then - to me - that indicates that you're simply not ready to handle parenthood.
  
  that's just my two cents ~~

   Aristotle said that ""it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."" can/do you do this? do you agree?

  i love this quote, and i agree. you do not have to necessarily agree with a certain viewpoint in order to look at it from that perspective and contemplate how other people can agree with it. a major part of education is learning about perspectives and opinions other than your own, as well as learning how to play the devil's advocate, so to speak, in balancing all of these views.
  
  it's important to see things from all sides - it would be close minded to only want to view an issue from one side only. if you feel strongly about a subject, you have every right to hold your own opinion, but it's important to consider all facets of the topic first.

   I use 'triggered' as a joke, even though I have severe PPD that has major triggers....kind of helps me laugh it off. Do you think that poking fun at your own mental illness can help you cope?
  ","
  tbh i think that's perfectly acceptable - especially if the dark humor (lol) helps you cope with what you're struggling with. i joke about my illnesses at times, it makes it easier for me to deal with them and it lessens the tension in the air if i'm trying to talk to someone about what i'm currently experiencing.
  
  i probably should have specified in my last post, though - people who usually use ""triggered!"" as an insult or to make light of mental illnesses are usually neurotypical and have no idea what it's like to actually have real triggers.
  "
425742,"
   Thoughts on people who are constantly saying ""triggered"" ?
  ","
  this is one of my pet peeves - being triggered by a situation, smell, person, object, etc. is a very legitimate and valid notion. it's something that's been studied in the mental health field for dozens of years. people's triggers are very real to them, even if it may not necessarily be real for someone else.
  
  it disgusts me how jokingly saying ""triggered!"" has become such a hot trend these days because it's been taking away from the legitimacy of those who suffer from REAL triggers. mental health patients are literally afraid to tell their doctors their triggers because the internet has turned their triggers into a humiliating joke. it's pathetic.

  tbh there's nothing wrong with taking a day off from school or work on the rare occasion if you're feeling burnt out. i just don't think it should be called a ""mental health day"" because that insinuates that they're missing school or work due to their mental health, which may not necessarily be the case.
  
  i mean, i take a lot of ""mental health days,"" but i'm also very mentally ill and my mental health days comprise of me simply attempting to get our of bed or not kill myself, so...
  "
425744,"
   Thoughts on people who claim to have a mental illness or dramatize one they actually have for attention?
  ","
  well, this is actually two-fold because these two situations are extremely different.
  
  - people who claim to have a mental illness but actually don't - tbh i think they're disgusting human beings who have no idea what sort of life they'd actually be living if they were, in reality, mentally ill. mental illnesses take reign over every little detail of someone's life, and for someone who's neurotypical to make a commodity out of mental illness means that they're spitting in the face of survivors, neuroatypical type, and other people struggling with illnesses.
  
  - people who have a mental illness that dramatizes their illness for attention - this situation is something i have more sympathy towards because it could simply be a symptom of their illness. i require a lot of attention myself, and i'm not afraid to tell a person that the attention they're paying to me is inadequate. i know it's a symptom of my mental illness and there's nothing wrong with requiring attention if you've lacked it your entire life.

   Did you shop or going to shop on Black Friday? Is there a great deals you don't want to miss?
  ","
  no, i make it a point to not go shopping on black friday. i don't care what kinds of deals there are, i'd rather wait until cyber monday if i needed something that badly.
  
  black friday is the epitome of capitalist greed -- people literally go to such lengths as to hurt complete strangers because of something as obsolete as a sale on an item that nobody genuinely needs. retail sales associates who are forced to work on black friday are spit on and disrespected for working, are not looked upon as human beings, and are outright insulted by total strangers for being in the position that they're in. even though 99% of the time, they have no other choice.
  
  i highly dislike black friday. as a former retail worker who used to work on black friday, i can say with confidence that the worst of people comes out on this day.
  
  for everyone who follows me or whom i follow who is working in retail today: please know that you are doing as much as you can, you are loved, and you are respected. don't let the things people may say to you today get under your skin, and soon, this day will be over.

   Do you think there's a stress in the media on what type of body shape one should have? Do you think those ""standards"" changed dramatically?

  the media contributes to a lack of self esteem in a majority of people, and both men and women. it's no secret that tv, music, and movies portray an unrealistic expectation of what a person's body ""should"" look like, which makes others insult people who don't fit into that mold.
  
  there have been more body positivity movements, which has been good -- but there's still a lot of work to do because often ""body positivity"" only refers to one ""type"" of body, which precludes people who are disabled or obese.

  ","
  being a feminist is your own personal choice, and only you can decide for yourself whether or not you want to adhere that label to yourself.
  
  that being said... you have to take some time to think about why you feel uneasy about this situation. it's easy for us to get caught up in societal expectations and the stigmas that arise as a result of them, and sometimes it alters our thought processes. it's good that you recognize that you feel uneasy, but now you have to identify *why* it makes you uneasy so that you can properly address it.

  ohh, i'm sorry i totally misunderstood you.
  
  no, i don't think that's internalized homophobia. unfortunately, saying ""that's gay"" to mean something bad has become such an instinctive thing for some people that they don't realize the implications of the phrase. however, if you recognize that the phrase is inherently wrong and try to avoid using it, then you're perfectly fine.

  personally, no. psychosis is a mental illness that has no correlation with the way a person loves other people. you can have a psychotic disorder and have a healthy romantic relationship, or you can have a psychotic disorder and be involved in unhealthy relationships.

   In what instances can shame be seen as beautiful, in your opinion?
  ","
  i suppose in hypothetical works of art or fiction, it can be beautiful. not the act of shame itself, but perhaps the symbolism behind it.
  
  for example, when cersei was shamed in game of thrones, she was stripped naked, insulted by civilians, had things thrown at her, all while the clergy peacefully walked beside her, chanting the word ""shame."" the act, in itself, is grotesque and shameful. watching it makes you feel sick inside.
  
  but the symbolism behind why she was being shamed, what it did to her, how it was the one time the audience saw cersei in a vulnerable state of mind -- i think that was beautiful.

   Why do you think self-hypnosis and self-suggestion are not as effective as getting hypnotized by another person?

  self-awareness. you're aware of what you're doing to yourself, so it prevents you from becoming completely immersed into whatever state of mind you're trying to be in. it's much easier to follow someone else's lead, knowing that they'll be there in case something goes awry that's out of your control.

   What is your view on standardized tests? Do you think they're beneficial or do we need to get rid of them?

  they're all bs, in my honest opinion.
  
  think of it this way -- a student body is composed of dozens of student who learn concepts and ideas in a variety of different ways. some people learn hands on, other people prefer lectures, and some need a mixture of the two. no two people learn the same way. and because of this, there's no way to adequately ""test"" a person's intelligence on an objective scale especially when the same test is given to the same dozens of students.
  
  just because a student gets a bad grade on a written exam doesn't mean they're a bad student. they could actually be incredibly intelligent -- just not in the way that standard public schools ""see"" what intelligence is. these days, most schools solely teach for the rest and this leaves behind dozens of students who require more hands on lessons. not because they're stupid, but because they simply grasp ideas using different criteria.
  
  so imo, standardized tests like the SAT are a poor evaluation of a student's potential. it's a shame so much emphasis is placed on it.

  the reason WHY there's so much disparity between white people and POC is *because* of racial segregation. you can't solve racial problems by dividing people due to their race, that will only worsen relations and reaffirm the antiquated thought process of racism in people's minds.

   this is a vague question so i hope its ok but isn't is kind of wrong for the people of the movie to say that its okay to not cast poc their roles, because 'things change in the modern world' and they thought it could be a white girl instead of poc?
  ","
  uh... i don't really know what you mean?
  
  depends on the movie, i suppose. sometimes it needs to be historically accurate, even if that means settling for racist or sexist standards (because that's how life was life back in the day).
  
  for example, in the mafia iii game, they had a preface that stated, ""please be advised that the racial segregation and slurs used in this game are a reflection of its time and not a belief of the creators of the game, it's meant to be historically accurate"" blah blah blah.
  
  but if the character they're talking about is meant to be a certain ethnicity and they chose a white person for that role anyway, then yeah i see a problem with that. there's no reason why they couldn't choose a just as competent actor of the same race.

  i wouldn't necessarily say it's ableist, but it's pretty counterproductive... i know it's ""supposed"" to help raise awareness for SH and promote understanding, but the only thing people do is draw a stupid semicolon on their wrists without even talking about it, and then claiming that they're a Good Person™ by contributing to the cause. it's more of a trend than anything at this point, which makes somewhat of a mockery out of SH.
  
  if you really wanna help people who suffer from SH and mental illness, then promote funding for mental health research, destigmatize illnesses using words and research, and correct your friends and family if they say something insensitive or ableist. the meaning behind the semicolon project is good, but i feel like a lot of people go about it the wrong way or do so to make themselves feel better instead of to actually help others.

   do you honestly believe this sjw drivel you say? being white doesn't automatically make you an opressor or at a higher point in life. you're such a freaking regressive i honestly wonder how distoarted the world looks through your eyes.
  ","
  i never said that a white person is automatically an oppressor solely due to being white, so i would appreciate it if you could stop putting words into my mouth.
  
  looking at the state of the world right now, it would be naive to say that those who are white experience the same racial indifferences as what people of color face on a daily basis solely due to their race. for example, i got pulled over by a cop a few months ago for speeding and i wasn't afraid. with what's been happening in the world lately, could i have felt the same if i was a person of color?

   by defintion privilege is something that can be taken away, yet you insist that being white in it of itself is an ""original sin"" that's lunacy.
  ","
  that's the difference between dictionary definitions and sociological definitions, though. the meanings of words change as society progresses. what's written in a dictionary is static, and dictionary definitions don't take into consideration the societal implications of the words.

   Are all white People born with bias and privelege
  ","
  privilege is multifaceted, so this isn't really one of those ""yes or no"" answers.
  
  people who are white are privileged due to their race, because people of color have been oppressed by those who are white over the course of the centuries. people of color are still oppressed due to their race, unfortunately.
  
  however, obviously a person's race isn't the only aspect of who they are... you can experience oppression if you're gay, or trans, or of a certain ethnicity, or of a certain religion, or of a certain economic class, if you're mentally ill, if you're physically disabled, etc. you can simultaneously benefit from racial privilege while experiencing oppression and discrimination due to something else about who you are.
  
  as for bias, bias is taught. anyone can be biased against anyone else if that's how they were raised and they aren't given an opportunity, or want to take an opportunity, to unlearn that bias.

   How is a transgender more likely to die than a CIS person? I don't think it directly increases mortality
  ","
  idk how to really answer this qhestion without repeating myself or stating the obvious.
  
  transgender people are more likely to be victims of abvse, assault, violence, etc etc. simply because they're transgender, because unfortunately transgender people aren't yet accepted in society and are looked upon as less than human, as wrong or vile, as sinful, as immature or foolish, as attention seeking, and the list goes on. we're not accepted in society for who we are, which places most transgender people in vulnerable positions.

  i'm really fucking sick and tired of transgender people being made to look like fools because of those who won't take the time to properly educate themselves on the scientific prospects of sex and gender.
  
  the average lifespan of a transgender person is 23 years old. transgender people have an alarmingly higher rate of svicide compared to cisgender people. nearly 90% of transgender people report experiencing discrimination in the world place. transgender people are more susceptible to being the victim of police violence and anti-LGBT homicide.

  i went to dunkin donuts on lunch and was excited for an iced tea but they fucked it up and it tasted like liquor without the burn of alcohol.

  spending a year of my life not knowing every night whether someone close to me was alive or dead, living every moment in fear of losing them and developing extremely unhealthy coping mechanisms to handle those emotions.
  
  enduring abvse as a child and not realizing the severity of what it actually was until i was much older, because i always assumed that was the ""normal"" way kids grew up. subsequently feeling ostracized from my peers because i had nobody i could relate to or trust. and, thereafter, coping with the fact that its affected literally every aspect of who i am to the point where its fractured my very concept of myself.
  
  surviving svicide and living with the long term psychological and physical repurcussions that follow me to this very day (chronically wishing i was dead).
  
  i always survived because it was my instinct to survive, i was constantly in a state of fight or flight and i knew that if i stopped moving, then i would turn into something worse than death. now that i'm older and understanding how severely these things affected me, i'm taking the steps i need to receive professional help and try to develop healthy coping skills.

  ","
  the writer of that article sounds incredibly bitter, in my opinion lol.
  
  i think that people, regardless of whether they're male or female, deserve to be treated right in a relationship setting. in this respect, people do not necessarily have to do ""something"" to warrant that because we should naturally treat other human beings with respect, by default. it isn't too far-fetched to say that everyone deserves a partner who loves them wholeheartedly and supports them. if you respect yourself then you won't feel obligated to settle for a person who obviously doesn't respect you in return.
  
  as for the whole ""you never hear guys telling other guys that they deserve a good girlfriend"" -- i'm calling bull on that hahaha, maybe it's simply because the men in my life are all open minded people, but it isn't uncommon to hear them say that their friend deserves a girlfriend better than x because she treats him like shit, etc etc.
  
  however, i'm also getting older and entering an age where everyone, for the most part, is looking to settle down with someone who not only will be their partner but also be their best friend. so perhaps the article was intended for an audience younger than myself who could relate to it more.

   It's World Vegan Day!  Do you think it is healthy to be a vegan/vegetarian?

  what a lovely question of the day, askfm.
  
  PSA: you are not *automatically* healthy if you have a vegetarian diet or choose a vegan lifestyle. you can be vegan/vegetarian but still partake in unhealthy eating habits, which means that those who are non-meat eaters are not automatically ""healthier"" than their meat-eating counterparts !!
  
  if you are vegetarian/vegan and you take the proper steps to ensure that you're getting all of your supplements -- then yes, that's healthy. HOWEVER, that being said, obviously not everyone has that opportunity or access to healthy vegan/vegetarian food choices, which can be extremely restricting to some people, causing them to actually be unhealthier than if they chose a meat-inclusive diet.
  
  not everyone can be vegan or vegetarian, for a plethora of reasons: medical illnesses, allergies, mental illnesses (such as eating disorders), socioeconomic reasons (lack of access or lack of funds to healthy vegan or vegetarian options), etc. in the same vein, it's important to realize that people can simultaneously advocate for animal rights while eating meat because not everyone's bodies are suited for that sort of restrictive diet (and we can do this by buying cruelty free products, recycling, and other environmental friendly actions).

  (( i got your two other messages, i'll just respond to everything here though ))
  
  i think your feelings are valid -- you're basically saying that you feel as if people aren't taking you seriously in light of other people's illnesses getting more attention, albeit for the wrong reasons, is that right?
  
  coming from a medical and legal standpoint (because it's literally my job to help people with disabilities), mental illnesses can absolutely be disabling. being disabled means that your medical impairments hinder you from being able to hold a regular job, or if you can hold a regular job, you'll need accommodations. for as many physical disabilities i handle on a daily basis, there are just as many people with mental disabilities (and obviously often a combination of the two because debilitating depression often occurs secondary to chronic illnesses).

  ","
  (( i got your second message ))
  
  tbh... you need to find a new counselor.  first, it was unprofessional for her to assume that you HAVEN'T experienced those issues because she should know better than anyone that survivors often don't come forward with their stories, especially within the first few times of meeting a new counselor.
  
  second... for her to imply that *only* people with traumatic pasts could be ""exempt"" from something like that -- that's SO wrong of her to say. when we have depression or anxiety or more complex disorders that don't necessarily correlate with trauma, that doesn't mean that it isn't as difficult for some people to regulate their moods. and obviously if you're in counseling to begin with, you're already looking to get help with that. and who's to say that you arent already TRYING to make that choice?
  
  she shouldn't have said that at all, that's extremely discouraging. i'm sorry that happened to you. ://

  my only problem is that a majority of online rhetoric misconstrues the meaning behind feminism, placing blame on ""the patriarchy"" and wrongfully accusing men for all of the problems associated with the world. people become hysterical, irrational, and have such god complexes that its difficult to make ANY progress these days.

  there's a difference between being against the principles for which feminism stands for and not labeling yourself as a feminist.
  
  if you're talking about those who simply don't want to associate themselves with third wave feminism, but still hold the same principles, then i think you're overreacting. a label doesn't define who you are -- and tbh your views on people who don't want to associate themselves with feminism are just as bad as the views of radical feminists, who are the people who have been giving feminism a bad name to begin with.

  however, society needs to change the fact that women are pressured from a young age to portray a certain image and engage in gender-based roles, to think about themselves in terms of their sex as opposed to their passions and skills. there would be more women in politics if there wasn't the social stigma that women don't ""belong"" in office or ""belong"" in occupations that aren't domestic in nature.

  i'm talking about people who advocate for BLM as a whole -- a lot of rhetoric i see online is all ""fuck the police"" sort of stuff. and yeah while you have every right to hate the police if you have a personal vendetta against them due to horrible experiences, i don't really think it's rational to blame the entire group of them as a whole. it's more so the institution of law enforcement, aka the government, then the idea of the police in general -- if that makes sense.

  mob mentality is pretty much psychological conditioning of following the crowd -- if a lot of people think a particular way, then you're more apt to think the same way as well. if misinformation is spread, then that's a lot of people who are preaching about the wrong thing or portraying a situation in a false light.
  "
426267,"
   Your opinion is somewhat wrong buddy
  ","
  allow me to elaborate then.
  
  by crying wolf, i mean that there's a lot of emphasize online placed on misinformation -- the idea of cherry picking evidence to suit a particular bias and simultaneously ignoring other evidence that may go against what they believe. a lot of situations that i've seen recently have been in support of justice brought to people to whom justice was brought while ignoring other stories that didn't get the attention they deserved.
  
  the idea of hating all law enforcement is, in my opinion, radical because the large majority of law enforcement do their job that they're supposed to do. unfortunately, there will always be bad seeds mixed in, and what needs to be emphasized should be the proper punishments placed on those cops who fuck up instead of giving them paid leave and the whole 9 yards. i feel like a lot of BLM these days is about hating law enforcement as a whole, rather than fighting to bring justice to those who have been wrongly killed or acquitted.
  "
426268,"

  good in theory, terrible in practice.
  
  the movement started off strong with a sound emphasis placed on bringing justice to those who have been wrongfully killed by law enforcement who did not receive the proper repurcussions. but due to things like mob mentality, people have seemed to lost touch with the initial reason for the movement itself and has basically cried wolf.

   why do people support hilary when shes as bad
  ","
  i don't think ""support"" is the right term here.
  
  in comparing trump to clinton, she's the lesser of two evils. she has a plethora of experience in politics, she's respectful and calculated in her mannerisms, and she knows when and when not to provide her opinion.
  
  the same can't be said about trump. yes, they both have horrible skeletons in their closet, but when it comes down to thinking about the future of this country and what risks and decisions will have to be taken -- the idea of a trump-guided system will undoubtedly be poorly executed, impulsive, and premature. he will prompt a nuclear arms race. he will not be willing to diffuse a situation when it needs to be diffused. i'm literally scared for the future of this country under a trump dictatorship (because democracy won't exist anymore).
  
  so no... people don't necessarily ""support"" clinton in the way you probably assume, they simply recognize the better of two shitty options.

   Hi Leigh!! I hope you're having an amazing night.
Sometimes when I'm in public, and I hear people laughing, my head immediately thinks ""Oh my god they're laughing at me"" and I go super self-conscious mode... I know you're not a doctor or anything, but do you have any advice on how I can overcome
  ","
  i struggle with the same irrational fear literally 24/7 -- if someone laughs around me, i assume they're making fun of me. i overthink people's statements and conclude that they either feel sorry for me or they're faking their concern towards me in an attempt to ridicule me. if i get up and walk down the hall, i assume people are staring at me. and if people are even looking in my direction, i assume something is wrong with my face or my clothing and it makes me self conscious.
  
  it isn't necessarily a normal thing to feel, but it IS extremely common -- it's a side effect of low self esteem and probably anxiety, because this is a big problem of mine when it comes to my social anxiety. i've been going to therapy to help myself understand these fears and overcome them.
  
  if you can do so, i would suggest the same to you. CBT is designed to help people acknowledge these unhealthy thought patterns, recognize the root of the problem, and work towards developing healthier ways of thinking. by working with a therapist you get along with and feel comfortable around, you'll learn to dismantle your negative thought patterns and promote a sense of well being.

  ","
  idk on the one hand we should be open minded obviously, yes, and realize that people who are racist and sexist and all of those ~ lovely ~ things are that way because that's how they were raised. however that doesn't mean that we're supposed to sit back and allow them to spew their problematic thoughts all over the place -- ESPECIALLY if those people are in positions of power and authority.
  
  everyone will obviously have their own opinions regardless of what people say, yeah. but idk i wouldn't consider it to be ""open minded"" if we just let those people have their way because that's so detrimental to society in so many ways.

  the great thing about college is that you're not obligated to stay in the classroom for any reason other than your own enjoyment of the subject -- you can leave when you want, especially if you feel unsafe, and just inform the professor later on that the conversation was affecting you in that way.

   ik that we should all accept others opinions but whenever i see ignorant people say racit/sexist stuff or they defend trumP (r/pe apologists) its so hard to like,, respect them or have a convo bc t makes me realize that this world is so corrupt to begin with..idk its typing in w mental illness a lto
  ","
  (i got your second message !!)
  
  you asked if you were being dramatic -- no, not at all. trump is honestly a disgusting individual, his perspectives on mental illness and women and race are deplorable and for someone with that mentality to be placed in such a high position of power is honestly terrifying.
  
  all of the progress we've made in the last 60 years would be gone. while disadvantaged and marginalized groups still don't have equal rights, they do have SOME rights, and under trump, it's likely that all of this progress would be undermined and we'd end up going backwards -- not forwards.
  
  at this point it isn't just politics and it isn't just having an opinion, because for someone to defend trump for what he's done and said proves that they're part of the problem. being racist or sexist or ableist isn't an opinion, it's a personality flaw and something like that dictates how you carry yourself or live your life.
  
  so no, you're not being dramatic. you're being rational, tbh. it's normal to have such a strong reaction to these things because he isn't just one person, this is reflected in a large part of the public's eyes.

   what are 5 things about your mental illness (or any if you don't want to talk about) that you want to get off your chest? or maybe write some stereotypes that annoy you?

  like i said, i don't know the full story, but i think that perspective alone is extremely bigoted. someone else's gender has no impact on your daily life, so it makes no sense for a person to actively advocate against and refuse to use someone's pronouns even when asked.
  
  to you, their gender may mean nothing -- but obviously to that person, their gender is their sense of identity and is their world. so for a person to refuse to respect someone at that totally basic level is, in my opinion, inhumane.

  in my opinion, online etiquette is knowing what to say and what not to say depending on the environment. most users on askfm, for example, have no sense of online etiquette whatsoever (the anons at least) -- the ones who send out sexually explicit questions to minors, people who probe into problems despite the user telling them that they're uncomfortable, continuously messaging someone expecting them to answer when they're offline, etc etc.
  
  i suppose it's somewhat important to me, because i believe that most people deserve basic respect and a majority of online etiquette is respecting the other person's thoughts and wishes. however, a lot of people still believe that if you're on social media, you're obligated to reveal 100% of your life, which is obviously false.

  however... while i recognize that politics is important, i don't allow it to control my life or else i'll become obsessive. there's too much on my plate 24/7 for me to throw something as overwhelming as politics into the mix, so i try to keep a moderate distance.

  depends on their views? if someone actively supports things like being pro-life or discriminating against POC and/or muslims or being opposed to gay marriage, then i won't be able to respect who they are as individuals. things like that attribute to someone's sense of human decency.
  
  however, if someone has a different opinion than me on the economy or college tuition reduction or even gun control, it won't necessarily change what i think of them -- unless they're disrespectful in their beliefs or won't accept my beliefs in return. you can have opposing beliefs but understand that not everyone will agree with you in a harmonious manner.

  it also depends on *why* they have no money either -- whether it's due to unfortunate circumstances, or conversely, whether it's due to sheer laziness or not wanting to find a job.

  i have a full time job where i work monday through friday from 8am - 6pm. i'm in a long term relationship, but my boyfriend's work hours can be hectic at times, especially when he lands side work on top of his regular job. we try to see each other at least three times per week, but sometimes it's only once or twice depending on the circumstances. we normally just hang at home since we're usually exhausted, but sometimes we'll grab food or go to the bar.
  
  i also have a best friend who's getting married october 2017. we don't see each other very often, but lately i've been trying to hang out with her more so we can focus on wedding planning. we found a new coffee shop in town, so i expect we'll be spending a lot of nights there brainstorming !!
  
  the rest of my time is spent at doctors appointments and therapy. i've been seeing my pdoc every 2 weeks, and i was in therapy every 2 weeks as well (it's supposed to be weekly but it's expensive). when i use social media, it's normally in between all of these things which is why you mostly see me on askfm on the weekends and intermittently during the week.

  i personally wouldn't be able to do so myself because i have a tendency to be somewhat co-dependent on my partners, and i wouldn't like the concept of sharing because i am always afraid of my partners leaving me for someone better. but i won't knock the concept of open relationships for others because i've seen relationships where they've worked.

  he said something that's been interpreted as racist -- yes, i agree. however, i'm looking at the situation objectively. he acknowledged the post and clarified the situation. i'm sure he apologized for it as well, but that livejournal post failed to post it (i'm assuming either to suit it's own cause or simply because he had not done so yet). in addition, he's done a vast array of charitable work for people from all walks of life with no personal benefit to himself.
  
  if you weigh out the factors involved in misha collins' life, it's easy to see that he's a charitable human being who made one mistake. to boycott a television show for that is a bit foolish, especially considering all of the other actors and actresses on that show who also run charity organizations, donate money to relief causes, raise awareness for important issues, etc.

  this is pretty typical of the US public education program: growing up, we were actually taught that christopher columbus was a ""good man"" who ""discovered"" america and happily made peace with the native americans, etc etc. this point of view lasted from toddler age up until my graduation from high school.
  
  i was never taught the reality of what columbus and his crew did to the native americans. myself and my classmates were never formally educated on the mass genocide of native americans through slaughter and by the introduction of foreign disease. we were all left blindsided in the attempt to shield us from what TRULY happened so that our sense of ""patriotism"" remained intact.
  
  so these days, columbus day is a damn joke of a ""holiday."" government businesses are given the day off from work to ""celebrate,"" but i personally don't find the celebration of mass genocide to be particularly cheerful.
  
  stop giving columbus credit for something he never did. stop praising him for ""finding"" america and start recognizing the brutality that was inflicted upon the native people.
  
  START calling it indigenous people's day as a reminder of all whom we've lost, and START spreading awareness of the small numbers of americans who exist today who are native. native americans experience an absurd amount of oppression and ridicule on a daily basis, and this isn't recognized enough in society.

  i agree, yes. nothing physiologically changes when a person has sex for the first time, so the notion that a person ""becomes different"" after sex is purely cultural in nature. in most western cultures, a woman specifically can be seen as prude or timid if she's chosen not to have sex for the first time (even when she's as young as preteen years) and men also face discrimination from their peers if they're found that they haven't engaged in sex.
  
  it's all based on the oversexualization of our culture and how most ideas revolve around the idea of sex, unfortunately.

  ","
  if a mother is drinking while she's pregnant and she plans on bringing that pregnancy to term, then the child will likely have a plethora of medical problems (if it isn't miscarried).
  
  i don't really understand the confusion here... people who are pro-choice aren't anti-pregnancy or something. but if you're an expecting mother and you want to give birth to a child, then don't potentially ruin that child's life by drinking during pregnancy. that's so irresponsible.
  "
426476,"

  a fetus doesn't have the neurological development to feel pain, or have any feelings whatsoever... it's merely a parasite.

  i'm responsible with my drinking. regardless of how much i drink, i'm always aware of my surroundings. the fact that i drank at this event means i was 100% comfortable with the crowd i was around. most of them were teenagers to young adults, and this community is the type of community to go out of their way to help you if you're not in a good place.
  
  for example: before the show, we were waiting out in the pouring rain for the doors to open. i went to step over a dislodged brick, tripped over it, and fell into a puddle. at least 3 people ran over to ask if i was ok (and if you've ever been to NY, you know that's rare).
  
  also, it's a seated event. we were all sitting in the floor area, in the balconies, around the stage, around the bar, etc. it's a highly esteemed ballroom, so there were security guards every 10 feet. so before you go out of your way to attempt to troll a stranger on the internet, at least know what the hell you're talking about. lmao.

   spam ? what do you think of universal health care or free tuition? is it the peoples job to fund each other, or should we take care of ourselves? besides the tax increase, is there a metaphorical price to pay when it comes to things being paid for by the government?
  ","
  i believe that its the government's job to take care of its citizens, so the money that is being allocated through taxes should be benefitting those in our society who are unable to provide for their basic needs -- food, shelter, water, heathcare, etc.
  
  as for tuition, i support greatly reduced tuition for public universities because the price of obtaining a higher education is atrocious at the moment. students end up being in debt for most of their lives, and the money they make with their subsequent jobs ends up going towards paying off that debt, making it even harder for them to adjust to the price of living in our society.

   spam ? recently, its become a big deal that colin kaepernick doesnt stand for the national anthem - is not standing for the pledge or the national anthem patriotic or unpatriotic, or does it have anything to do with patriotism? does the first amendment grant people the right to sit during these?
  ","
  the way that i see it, freedom of expression means that you have the right to express your support in the way your government is running the country, as well as the right to express your distaste for it as well.
  
  when it comes to personal freedoms, you can't selectively pick and choose between notions that support your cause and then criticizing notions that criticize it. not standing for the pledge or not reciting the pledge is your personal choice, and the reason why we have that freedom to choose is because of these amendments.
  "
426603,"
   spam ? what do you think of gun control? do you think less guns will decrease violence, or do you think criminals will find guns anyway? is restricting guns to certain people a violation of human rights?
  ","
  there should definitely be stricter laws regarding the process of purchasing a gun nationwide. while some criminal undoubtedly will find some way to get one by illegal means, it would definitely deter a lot of people knowing that they would have to go through that process.
  
  i still think everyone should have a right to protect themselves and their family, though. one family owning a handgun for emergency purposes isn't too extreme in my opinion, but it shouldn't go any further than that. nobody needs automatic assault weapons.

   Is it common to feel as if my parents didn't know they were being abusive? They've done really awful things but I feel like it's unfair to call them abusive.

  tw // abuse
  
  i got your second message too. your parents being abusive to you is not your fault -- at all. no matter how bad of a kid you were, that's never justification for abuse. i'm sorry that you're going through this... i honestly understand how you feel, and its a really shitty feeling.
  
  could you perhaps go into counseling and work these feelings through with a social worker? it'll help you understand these feelings and what to do to prevent the abuse from continuing, if it is. i'm here for you though. ?

  i agree somewhat -- at that age, it may be premature for a couple to live together especially since its such a transitional age for most young adults. while every relationship will have its successes and pitfalls, i believe that moving in together at such a young age would enforce a lot of responsibilities onto young people that they perhaps aren't quite ready for, on top of the other extraneous relationship stresses.

  i'm the same way tbh, i hate how i look 99% of the time and i'm my own worst critic. just keep reminding yourself that you're an amazing person who has survived through everything life has thrown at you, and if someone gives you shit about your appearance, then you don't need someone like that in your life. surround yourself with people who will raise you up and encourage you when you're feeling down.

   Do you think taking a break in a relationship can be good for a couple, or do you think it's just a temporary escape to be able to see other people ?
  ","
  i've never understood the purpose of a ""break"" besides to simply keep that person on a close leash with the intent of returning to them if you can't find anything more substantial.
  
  if you're not happy in a relationship, then break up. give that person the same opportunities you're giving yourself, otherwise they'll think that you still care enough to hold on and they won't be able to let go and get hurt in the process.

   10 unpopular opinions?
  ","
  ✧  the recent viral photo of the two passed out drug addicts with the child in the backseat is inappropriate. drug addiction is stigmatized already, and it isn't necessary to use scare tactics when an innocent child is involved. drug addiction requires awareness, education, and rehabilitation. not a viral image that's currently being mocked and treated like a damn meme.
  
  ✧  black lives matter is an important movement, but lately it has been diverging society into sects instead of conjoining society under one just cause. mob mentality can be extremely dangerous, especially when misinformation is spread.
  
  ✧  everyone should have the right to receive an abortion if they need one, regardless of the reason why they became pregnant in the first place. the government has no place in medical procedures.
  
  ✧  body shaming goes both ways -- don't sit there and advocate for fatpositivity while simultaneously shaming skinny people for being skinny. it's hypocritical.
  
  ✧  the viral trend of being a feminist has corrupted the very meaning of being a feminist to begin with, making those with legitimate messages even harder to hear. social justice issues have become convoluted and people have become divided amongst themselves.
  
  ✧  i can simultaneously love animals and not be vegan. it's possible for people to have strong emotional ties to animals but be unable to survive without their products.
  
  ✧  people with mental illnesses do not exist to serve as an example to neurotypical people as to how not to behave. we are not your science experiment, and we never asked to be placed in the positions we're currently in.
  
  ✧  the only person who can define your gender is you and you alone. there's a different between your gender identity, your gender expression, your sexuality, and your sex.

  -- attempts at making other people feel guilty about their own decisions in an effort to direct attention towards themselves.
  
  -- interjection into other people's personal problems as a way of controlling the situation.
  
  -- showing a blatant disregard for other people's feelings if it doesn't directly contribute to their own agenda.
  
  -- selectively choosing problems to focus on instead of objectively viewing issues in their entirely; i.e. making situations look like they're the victim instead of calculating the circumstance as a whole for everyone involved.
  
  -- threatening to do something hurtful if their wishes aren't granted and putting the responsibility on you.

  i think it's fine if you don't have access to proper healthcare and it'll give you closure regarding providing a name to your illnesses. self diagnosing things like depression or anxiety is acceptable, since they're extremely common.
  
  that being said, i don't believe people should self diagnose personality disorders or any other complex disorders since it's inaccurate 99% of the time. often comorbid disorders can present as another disorder entirely and it takes a professional evaluation over the course of numerous weeks to develop an accurate diagnosis.

  ways to save money;
  
  -- for textbooks, never buy from your college's bookstore. i used to use chegg.com to rent textbooks for cheap, and then you mail them back at the end of the semester. they include shipping labels and everything, so you don't have to pay for that either.
  
  -- depending on how you get your food, colleges can have meal plans that you pay into at the beginning of the semester. if you don't have that, i'd recommend splitting groceries with friends and buying things in bulk, since products cost less over time in bulk than if you bought them singularly.
  
  -- ignore this if you're dorming, but if you have to commute to school, try finding some friends to carpool with. it'll save you a lot of money on gas. my college also gave away cheap gas vouchers occasionally, so check with the activities board of your school and see what they have to offer.
  
  tips and tricks;
  
  -- if you can't help it, don't take classes at 8am lmao. that was the death of me during college.
  
  -- always review your notes after class when you have the time to refresh your memory. i used to take my notes on my ipad and then transfer them over to a notebook because it helped me remember things better when i wrote it down.
  
  -- if you're going to a party, always bring a friend with you and have your drink in your hand at all times. you can never be too careful.
  
  -- study groups are a great way of making new friends and learning material. if you can make the material fun, you'll remember it better.
  
  -- look for campus activities and clubs, and don't be afraid to talk to other students. i wish i had joined clubs and stuff during college but i was always too afraid, and i feel like it took away from my college experience.

  i agree that using abortion as a method of birth control is a bit foolish, considering how expensive abortions are... but in regards to the concept of pro-choice vs pro-life, these girls should still have that option. to deny someone their right to have an abortion just because it doesn't align with your own personal moral compass is just as unethical.

  actually, science supports the notion that human beings aren't meant to be monogamous creatures.
  
  it's also been proven that easy access to gynecological health clinics, such as planned parenthood or private practices, result in less people having unwanted pregnancies overall due to the spread of education regarding sex and contraception.

  i'm pro choice. ♀
  
  -- the government should not exist to dictate what's medically right and wrong to do with our bodies. there's no legal or ethical reason to have government involvement in something that's a medical issue.
  
  -- bodily autonomy is the concept that only we can make choices regarding our own bodies. therefore, if a person who is pregnant decides to terminate a pregnancy, they should be allowed that freedom of choice. bodily autonomy exists for corpses who are no longer alive, so there is no reason for it not to exist to pregnant individuals.
  
  -- forcing a person to have a child puts a detrimental physical and mental strain on their health. some people are not medically apt to have children, and it would be putting them at a fatal risk to prevent them from receiving an abortion, if they so choose. many psychotropic medications have to be stopped during pregnancy, which puts mentally ill patients at an even greater risk at a relapse of symptoms.

  -- even if you don't believe your child is at risk of contracting a disease, that doesn't necessarily mean they can't carry the disease to more susceptible people with weaker immune systems, i.e. the elderly and children. vaccinations prevent disease for not only the person getting the vaccine, but also those around them.
  
  -- vaccinations rarely lead to death in an individual unless a person is allergic to the vaccinations. but in today's modern era, that number is miniscule. there's a much greater chance of a non-vaccinated person contracting a fatal illness later in life.

  i have pretty wild nightmares most nights of the week, these days. :/ last night, i actually had terrible nightmares and i also had sleep paralysis, which wasn't fun. i keep waking up in a pool of my own sweat and my heart pounding, probably because i'm having a panic episode in my sleep... bleh.

  i've had a lot of really nice customers over the years who complimented me on my customer service, though. they were all usually photo customers that i would help with their pictures, mostly older men and women who were dealing with printing vacation photos. sometimes they would need help printing photos for funeral services, so those were always the hardest ones. i always tried to give everyone adequate attention and show that their concerns were being listened to.

  apparently this client got really upset at his psych evaluation because he previously tried to kill his girlfriend, so the cops had to be called to calm him down.
  
  i said to my coworker, ""okay... that seems upsetting, but i'm glad they're ok.""
  
  and she was like, ""yeah, i mean he's schizoaffective, so yeah.""

  idk why but it really... got under my skin in a weird way. there's a difference between me missing someone and then me lapsing into depression because i'm alone and then i further isolate myself because my mind goes Crazy™ and into overdrive mode.

  raising awareness on college campuses, in doctors offices, in movies and television, and on social media. the only way to remove the stigma from the misunderstandings of mental illness is to have people spreading valid, relatable facts and showing how common different mental illnesses are.
  
  the most stigmatized disorders are usually dissociative disorders, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders. a lot more people are diagnosed with them than the public generally thinks, and there's still so much bias and false opinions regarding those diagnosed with them. by raising objective and valid awareness that people who are mentally ill aren't ""crazy"" or violent or any of the other horrible stereotypes, more people will be more understanding. and more people will be comfortable enough to reach out and seek help.

  this company (rooster teeth/achievement hunter) has been a huge part of my life for years now and i got my boyfriend to fall in love with them as well, and we haven't done anything special in regards to them since 2014 so i'm so happy !!
  
  i hope my boyfriend will be excited too, i was hesitant to buy the tickets at first because his ptsd gets kinda bad with crowds, but he was fine the first time we saw them and i didn't want to take my chances and not get tickets while they're at least available !! it's the same weekend as comic con so everyone will already be in town anyway, so i know the second the tickets are released to the public, they'll be sold out in hours.

   So, you think white privilege is a thing, so you would therefore view white people as having an advantage, so, they would be  superior. Now since you view white people as superior, that would mean you view everyone else as less. It's pretty clear, that's racist.
  ","
  i don't think you quite understand what white privilege entails. systemic oppression is built upon hundreds of years of enslavement, torture, and abuse of a race of people solely due to the color of their skin. during the course of time, people are ""taught"" that people of other races are inherently bad, thereby creating stigmas and stereotypes regardless of how false they actually are.
  
  this means that in current times, people who are white have a general advantage over other races in terms of education, career opportunities, and other social and political platforms because of these pre-conceived misconceptions. the entire point of the recent BLM movement is to raise awareness of this unnecessary stigma and the inherent racism that's so ingrained in society today, to the point where a lot of people aren't even conscious of it.
  
  me pointing out that there is a historical and sociological explanation behind modern racism doesn't mean that i'm personally racist. these ideologies aren't stemming from my personal points of view, this is a model of our society and the general perspectives which have been further perpetuated by the media and government.

   (here's a shorter video on the subject,i agree with most of what he says) why should women dictate how men should act?
  ","
  i don't think you're quite understanding me, maybe i'm not making myself very clear ??
  
  i never said it was wrong for men to be masculine. my boyfriend is the most masculine, macho lumberjack man that i know (lol). i also have my fair share of masculine features, as well.
  
  and people will always flip flop between masculinity and femininity, it exists on a spectrum so we'll always slide back and forth between the two poles.
  
  what i believe needs to be changed in society is the EXPECTATION for men to be masculine when they naturally don't show those features, when they naturally are perhaps drawn to femininity instead of being aligned with masculinity like society expects them to be. these men are patronized, harassed by their peers, and sometimes even killed because people still believe that having feminine qualities is ""bad.""
  
  women aren't dictating anything in that respect, and none of the people i know who are feminists would ever say that they're dictating men to behave a certain way because that would be totally hypocritical.
  
  hope this clears things up !!

   why do some people talk about their relationship every day on social media? its so annoying asf
  ","
  it can go in one of two ways:
  
  1 - their relationship actually isn't as pleasant as the person is making it out to be, so by posting about the positive qualities online or even embellishing on their experiences, they're attempting to prove to themselves that their relationship is healthier than it actually is.
  
  2 - they have nobody else to talk to about their relationship because perhaps their only friend is their partner, so the internet becomes a diary for them to share their experiences.
  "

   well there's some evolutionary psychology mixed with thousands of years of civilization in that. men often feel like they have to portray themselves as big alpha males to stand out of competition to be the most attractive candidate, whather it's subliminal or liminal.
  ","
  i understand that completely. but men also shouldn't be harassed, hurt, or even killed for displaying feminine qualities as well. a lot of people, men and women and everyone else in between, still hold onto the notion that ""being a man"" means to display all of those alpha qualities, and that someone is less of a man if they don't.

   It's very obvious that ""sex sells"" in terms of advertising a product, but why does this method usually only involve women? Think deeply..

  from a marketing perspective, it creates competition.
  
  the women they're selling the product to are being taught that they can be more appealing to men by buying the product. these women, in the company's eyes, don't want other women to be seem in the same light of sex appeal. so it creates competition among all of these women to purchase these products with the ""most"" sex appeal, thereby skyrocketing profits.

  in any circumstance, the best thing you can do is take care of yourself. you don't need that kind of negative energy in your life, and obviously someone who's blatantly humiliating you about your mental illness isn't worth having in your life. sometimes you can try to educate someone all you want in the simplest terms, and they still won't understand.
  
  take care of yourself, and thank you so much for this message !! ♡

   did the american dream actually exist or did it only apply to privileged people?
  ","
  the american dream was a concept that was only ever achieved by the top 1%, in my opinion. especially during the 1950s when the idea of the ""american dream"" was at its peak.
  
  the idea was that a person could be perfectly happy as long as they had a nuclear family, a middle class suburban home, a white picket fence, a husband with an office job, and a housewife.
  
  how many people really had that lifestyle back then ?? how many people could say that they have this lifestyle now without experiencing financial struggle ?? the middle class is disappearing, families aren't perfect, and the concept that such an ideal described above is the ""dream"" completely precludes the struggles that POC, single mothers and fathers, lgbtqia people, the mentally ill, the disabled, and others faced.

  say what now.
  
  obesity occurs due to a myriad of factors -- calorie input/output, thyroid function, hormone imbalances from other vital organs, genetic factors, side effects of medication, etc.
  
  it's unethical to assume that just because a child is obese that it means their parents are abusing or neglecting them. the child could have a medical condition causing unnecessary weight gain, for example.
  
  but it's definitely not comparable to abuse. i think that's extremely inappropriate to suggest, especially in the face of abuse survivors who have had to live with abusive parents for years.

  i think it really depends what's in their past and how much of an impact it's made on who they are now. in terms of relationships, i think it's probably important to tell your current partner if you were ever previously married, divorced, or widowed. no doubt that has an impact on how you view relationships and how you behave in one.
  
  everything else can come with time and trust, especially regarding uncomfortable topics like if they've ever been arrested, hospitalized, undergone trauma, etc. that goes on a really individual basis, though, so a collective claim can't be made for everyone.

  abortion is a medical procedure that people utilize to terminate the unwanted fertilization of an egg in their uterus. being pregnant can have devastating effects on a person who isn't ready for children, in a financial, mental, and environmental sense.

  the reason why i ""worry"" is because hundreds upon thousands of people die unjustly everyday due to this wave of racism in the world. because the government refuses to acknowledge that racial profiling is still a huge problem in our society and, instead of placing blame where it belongs, they deflect the blame onto the victims themselves.

  racism is a system of oppression. historically speaking, people who were white oppressed other races, viewing them as inferior because their skin color was not the same as theirs. those who were white have always been the oppressors, and one cannot experience racism if you're part of the group which did the oppressing in the first place.

  i'm a really active listener, and i try to give good feedback when i can. i also try to make it a habit to not cut people off in the middle of their story, because i know that's rude.

  yes, absolutely. it's asinine to be living in this country and NOT recognize that there's a huge problem with policy brutality and the black community. the correlation of these incidents is undeniable. there needs to be major changes to prevent police officers from taking advantage of their positions for unjust reasons, as well as stricter punishments for officers who do murder a civilian unjustly.

  in today's era, guns simply make society more violent and more dangerous to live in.
  
  there's a difference between upholding your second amendment constitutional right and then flat out taking advantage of it by owning fully automatic machine guns and other easily accessible weapons.
  
  people aren't obtaining proper gun education and the law isn't strict enough to uphold safe gun control laws. right now, the access to guns in our society is only harming it.

   I see what you mean with feminism. But in a way is it not also the fault of women that they let it happen? That we hide our-self behind men??
  ","
  no, it isn't anyone's fault that this has happened. it's just the way society has progressed over time, and it has placed an emphasis on male leadership and male seniority because women were always seen as inferior, weak, and submissive.
  
  women don't allow these things to happen to them. women aren't asking for these things to happen, and sometimes it's impossible to prevent these things from happening regardless of who you are.
  
  but what we can do is change the perspectives of everyone around us to show that we can break these stereotypes, and we can slowly break down the walls of oppression that have caged us throughout history.
  
  i understand that you're young, and no doubt there's a language barrier, and i know you mean well by your question. i tried to word it in a way that's easier to understand, because it genuinely is not the women's fault that these things have happened to us. women have been oppressed and only now have we been given the strength to break the molds and create our own futures.

   FOR FEMALES ONLY: Do you really think you can handle the truth.. Do you expect the truth/intentions from the beginning? SERIOUSLY how truthful are you willing to be in the beginning of an interaction... Entertain me 🤔
  ","
  Yes. I think females who are ready to handle the truth are typically more evolved. The truth isn't pretty. I do expect truth/intentions from the beginning. Saves time and overall quality of life. I'm willing to be pretty transparent. It is difficult to be honest with yourself. I find, once you do that, it is easier to present yourself honestly with others. Easier said than done. But it is possible.

  ","
  I think I'm generally good at making friends. I'm autistic. So, I've learned how to forcedly turn on the switch. I think as an adult it can be a lot harder. It just depends on mindset. If you go into it thinking it's hard, that will affect the social interaction. Just go up to them and genuinely tell them something. Could be about anything. If they react negatively, atleast you tried. It is not a measure of how the next time will be.

Usually, when other fucked up people do that, they are probably dealing with worse issues. So they take it out on people who are more ""empathetic."" Which leads to feeling like you're being used.

   If someone said they do care about you but you tell them taking hours/days to answer makes you feel they don’t care about you. And they don’t answer or explain why it takes so long then that means they don’t care... right? (I just wanted to know what I am to that person. ) no answer is my answer

  ","
  I guess it depends on what context. If they're saying this online, it is easy to get fooled by people. If you've established a connection IRL and they're being sus, I can see why you'd want to give up. Don't give up! Try to learn more about how you work so you can hopefully attract higher quality people.

  Taurus ♉️

427807,"
   She went to take a shower.
  ","
  Ok...
  "
427808,"
   Can you tell when the horse is having fun too?
  ","
  Yeah! When they just want to be around me or when I let Olympia outside, I could tell by their body language!
  "
427809,"
   I keep trying to think why they would call it that
  ","
  Since we also lunge the horses on the lunge line by itself, I’ve done that with Olympia to just warm her up before riding her! So that’s most likely why it’s called that!
  "
427810,"
   How did you get into it?  Does it run in your family?
  ","
  A previous close friend of mine! But the trainer at that barn left to breed her one pony, so I stopped for awhile and we found this barn, my mom rides too now, my horse Olympia is actually the half sister to her horse!
  
  My dad used to ride when he was a kid, lived on a farm!
  "
427811,"
   So the lunge rope is just encouragement to follow the right path?
  ","
  Pretty much to just have them go in a circle!
  "
427812,"
   Me too, but I haven’t injured myself yet so its not all that bad
  ","
  I’ve got hurt before from clumsiness😂😂 but not too bad, just not the best balance😂
  "
427813,"
   You’re glowing in this picture 😊 it’s obvious that you’re having so much fun!
  ","
  Thanks!! Yeah I’m always having fun on my babies! And just any horse in general! This is Holly below!
  "
427814,"
   Does the trainer pull or tug on the rope to give the horse direction?
  ","
  Not too much! Most horses know to go around the trainer, they sometimes guide them a little to continue the circle!
  "
427815,"
   Do you do other exercises that improve balance?
  ","
  Nope! I’m actually a bit clumsy on the ground! I have way more balance on a horse lol
  "
427816,"
   You know the teacher that made me take a shower?
  ","
  No...
  "
427817,"
   Revenge.
  ","
  Okaaayyyy? lol..
  "
427818,"
   Do you like horses?
  ","
  Yup! Pretty sure I love horses lol🥰
  "
427819,"
   Is that you?
  ","
  Yup! The one dressed up is me showing Mirific! Then the next one I just posted was me on biscotti
  "
427820,"
   What does bareback lunge mean?
  ","
  It just means riding without a saddle at all and just being on their back with nothing on! :) and the lunge rope is attached to the trainer holding it, it works great for balance, I’ve closed my eyes and pretty sure, being without the reins :) hope the photo helps! That’s me bareback on the lunge rope!
  "
427821,"
   How did you come up with the name Mirific?  That’s unique!
  ","
  That actually was what the owner named her I believe! But I think they used to call her Murphy😂but the horse whisperer said she didn’t like that named, so I guess they named her Mirific! She was such a cool horse! Sadly she passed a few years ago. She taught me so much with those 2 years!
  "
427822,"
   How do keep your riding skills sharp?  Is there any cross training that helps?
  ","
  When I was in high school, one of the trainers I was riding with I always did bareback lunge lessons, so that helped majorly! Now I don’t really do anything extra, I kind of just hop up on them and just am able to ride them the same!
  "
427823,"
   Have you always had horses?
  ","
  Since I was about 9, I was just taking lessons, but in 7th grade I started leasing a horse, Harvey and then Mirific (that’s Mirific below) I’ve had Chief since I was 14, I’m 22 now. And I bought Olympia at the very end of June of 2020, so I’ve almost always been around horses, but haven’t always had them!
  "
427824,"
   Is it terribly expensive?
  ","
  Right now, with her in training, yes. But when it’s just for her board, it’s not too too bad
  "
427825,"
   That’s close!  Do you get to visit them daily?
  ","
  Right now she’s in training, so I usually just go once a week (since my trainer is taking care of her) (I also only have to pay for her) but before she was in training I went about 4 times a week to see them, when she’s out of training, I’ll resume doing the 4 times a week!
  "
427826,"
   Where do you board your horses?
  ","
  Just a stable about 20 minutes from my house!
  "
427827,"
   You have such a great smile!
  ","
  Why thank you!!
  "
427828,"
   Do you use Hotmail ?
  ","
  I have one hotmail account, but I mostly use gmail!
  "

   From your years of being an equestrian, what makes a horse the most afraid?

  For Olympia something that wasn’t there before. Someone ran through the back doors at the end and she got a tad bit scared😂
  
  But in other horses? Could be loud noises, just depends on the day too

  Well after I started riding Chief, she was put in the back area in the hay barn (which is where they keep all the hay and a few horses are kept out there) I would always visit her and give her treats and show that I still loved her!♥️
  
  Then she was moved to another barn (a girl who rides there owns a barn a little ways a way) but I kept in contact with the girls from the barn there but a couple years ago, she ended up passing away, I found out from one of the girls who messaged me asking about a horse that they had at the barn and I asked how she was doing😞I still miss her everyday! She taught me so so much♥️

   I apologize before hand because I know how annoying sexual questions are, but I am genuinely curious to know this answer. Do you enjoy when your man goes down on you or fucks you while you're sleeping? Or is that fucked up because he didn't ask for consent?
  ","
  Okay so this is probably the ONLY sxual question I’m gonna answer, I believe it is EXTREMELY fcked up because she’s asleep and unable to give consent, I mean if she said it’s fine before hand ig it’s okay and that’s on you two, but if it’s not talked about or she doesn’t want that, that definitely can be considered r@pe.

  There’s really no “set” way to get a girl to love you. Just be yourself, funny, kind and loyal.

But there’s plenty of other girls who will like you I’m sure! So don’t give up and find someone who will love you one day!😊 but just always be kind and some nice girl will come along!

  Friends aren’t for being tasty snacks tho!! I wanna be human size!!
  
  Honestly, yes!!

You live on campus and you can either take your own horse their or you could “borrow” one of theirs and do so much and just learn a lot!! 🙂

  "
428945,"
   At least u only got three people who have wronged you. That doesn't sound too bad and you got them out of your life!    Aww poor guy! But it seems like he is all better now :))

  "
428946,"
   Sweatpants eh lol So you could just chill in him all day and let him know what he's missing out on? I like it lol I still think the pervy dude should be food tho, for sure!     Oh no, what kind of injury was it?
  ","
  It would teach him lol! And yeah definitely, it’ll show him what’s up! And it was some kind of hoof injury, we have no clue how it happened! But he was out for like two years, so I sometimes just walked on him bareback! 😊
  
  During those years I got to show another horse tho!

  "
428948,"
   Right? Food is ALWAYS the right choice 😂 ngl I would probably do like bras and underwear lol that stuff ain’t cheap for cute ones!    He’s cute too! So is that ur main hobby?
  ","
  That’s actually a excellent idea lol! It’s true, it definitely isn’t cheap😫🤣
  
  And thank you! And kinda, I spend a lot of time at the barn since I have to take care of Olympia, Chief is like my “show” horse, so I don’t really have to take “care of him” my trainer does that, but yeah, I go out there a lot of nights a week!☺️
  
  And love every second!
  
  (Oh and hey, if you ever want to message me, feel free to add me on any of my social media’s if you want🙂)
