montauk , rofl . granted , one of my favorite places there is the montauk brewery because i love their beer , but their music festival was always amazing .","271084":"no , not really . i prefer xbox consoles over the playstation consoles , but i ve never stuck solely to the xbox brand . i ve played a few games on playstation in the past , particularly playstation exclusives like until dawn .","271085":"i ve traveled by the statue of liberty on one occasion , but it was by a regular boat , not necessarily a ferry . i never landed on the shore or went inside of the statue .","271086":"yeah , i ve seen a few . one of my favorites was what ever happened to baby jane ? because of how creepy it was .","271087":"the n gamepad was definitely the most comfortable , although i really do like the xbox one controllers they re so much more comfortable than the original xbox controllers , which were basically blocks and were too big for my hands , lol .","271088":"lol . i ve never been on a ferry before , actually .","271089":"i m not sure why there s a crying emoji , considering cases have skyrocketed recently here in new york and it s the best course of action for the state as a whole to take . it isn t necessarily a lockdown it s just further restrictions to prevent the spread of covid . businesses bars restaurants cannot let patrons in after pm , including gyms , and we re not allowed to congregate in groups more than people . i m not exactly sure how they re going to enforce the latter rule , but regardless , it s the best course of action to take right now .","271090":"send me questions , my inbox is empty","271091":"uh , i m definitely not trained in any kind of medicine whatsoever . if you re in medical need , then you should consult an actual doctor , not a stranger on a social media website .","271092":"lol , it s all good .","271093":"i m assuming this is still allison , lol . any sort of progress is still progress i m proud of you .","271094":"it s the least i can do . i m glad you re working it through with your doctor , it seems like they re very understanding and that s integral for sh t like this .","271095":"i ve been meaning to tell you if during this process , you need any support whatsoever , i m here for you . i understand how you re feeling and if you need to vent or anything , my inbox here and facebook and instagram , whichever is always open .","271096":"i went out and bought two six packs of beer this evening . going to be a liquid dinner , folks .","271097":"i don t usually have big ideas to begin with .","271098":"i don t tell people about my ideas , so this doesn t really apply to me .","271099":"sit down with them and tell them that they re not behaving appropriately , that they re making me feel inferior to them whether or not that was their intention , and instead of being cocky , they should at least be educating me on the topic with encouragement .","271100":"i don t normally eat cake . i used to like cannoli cake , but i don t like the taste of sweets anymore .","271101":"i mean . . . i m no expert on genes , but it s a lot more complicated than xx and xy , for starters . however , it all comes down to your own self perception and the comfort you feel within your own body . people who are trans and non binary usually feel as if they re trapped in a body that isn t their own . it s difficult for me to describe .","271102":"my day has been fine , although i feel a bit sad now . my friends invited me to play among us with them tonight , but i m not feeling up to it at all . i d rather just spent the night trying to write and listen to music .","271103":"yes , i ve been in love twice before .","271104":"male and female are sexes , not genders . your sex is determined by your chromosomes , meanwhile gender is somewhat of a construct that exists on a spectrum . people who refuse to listen to trans individuals regarding gender identity are usually stubborn and close minded .","271105":"i used to see a lot of assumptions online that cats were selfish , cold hearted animals who only cared about themselves and didn t express love toward their owners . prior to owning cats myself , i kinda thought the same thing and preferred dogs over cats . however , after living with cats for over a year now , i ve grown to really love them and their unique personalities , and i m thankful that the cats in this house have all been extremely loving and affectionate .","271106":"i love him as a friend , but my romantic feelings have dwindled significantly since we broke up . after all , it has been over a year .","271107":"i wouldn t agree to the proposition because i prefer monogamy over polyamory , and even if we were polyamorous , i probably wouldn t choose to date anyone else so it would be pretty one sided .","271108":"i would rather be immortalized with the words i ve written , if i ever decide to write a book and become published .","271109":"? ? ? my ex and i are still close friends . i can consider him a strong person without romantic feelings being involved .","271110":"yes , i m always willing to listen to my friends when they re going through a hard time , regardless of how i m feeling myself . i would rather focus my attention on other people s issues and giving them advice as opposed to my own problems , lol .","271111":"my best friend and my ex are the strongest people i know . they ve both been through a lot of hardship , but have come through to the other side with confidence and renewed strength . they both constantly try to better themselves every day .","271112":"i don t normally keep up with technology , and i m also not very tech savvy . i just upgraded to windows a few months ago , lol .","271113":"monogamy , for the most part . although i m fine with being single at the moment .","271114":"i d offer them a lending ear and a shoulder to cry on if they needed it . i wouldn t enforce myself on them or anything because people do grieve differently , but i would make it very clear that i m there to support them in any way possible .","271115":"i would not want to be immortalized in such a way , even if i did accomplish something great in life . nevertheless , if it had to happen , i would probably be situated at a laptop on a desk with a glass of wine next to me while i would be typing fervently .","271116":"loud noises , a lot of commotion going on including people talking at once , and just basically anything that s overly stimulating where i can t mentally process everything that s going on .","271117":"i d rather get away with a crime and live with the knowledge that someone could eventually find out . at least then i d be able to live my everyday life .","271118":"i went on a date with a guy when i was a freshman in college while my ex and i were on a break , and i honestly had no idea what i was doing or why i even went on the date to begin with . my ex was going through a lot of hardship at the time i still loved him , so while the date with the guy went well in the beginning , it ended up me venting about my ex s situation and how overwhelmed and worried i was . i m sure the guy didn t appreciate it at all , lol . but he was extremely nice about it and tried to help me .","271119":"i don t feel comfortable in the majority of public places with the exception of one bar i used to frequent and only when the bar was empty .","271120":"i m not spiritual , so i don t have any spiritual goals .","271121":"definitely not me . i don t like the christmas holiday season .","271122":"when i was younger , i didn t think i d live long enough to see this age .","271123":"yeah , my job used to do secret santa a year or two ago . obviously we re not doing it this year considering we re not back in the office , lol .","271124":"i don t use any apps specifically for messaging , so i honestly don t know . i just use texting the majority of the time , otherwise i ll sometimes use facebook messenger or instagram dms .","271125":"i can t really compare it to being trans because i ve never felt a woman or a man , but non binary has always suited me best because of that reason . it is a bit of a pain , though , because while i present as feminine , people assume i m cis and call me feminine descriptors pronouns even after i ve corrected them .","271126":"i don t go to parties anymore i m in my late s , lol . i went to a lot and hosted more when i was in my early s , but now i don t have the stamina for that sh t .","271127":"les miserables always makes me cry .","271128":"i just finished up with work , and now i m drinking a beer debating on either writing creatively or playing video games tonight .","271129":"they should get their license taken away . people s lives are at risk .","271130":"pro choice .","271131":"i had a german shepherd named jada when i was growing up .","271132":"samsung galaxy s .","271133":"it s going well thus far . i haven t done much except work and drink a lot of coffee though , haha .","271134":"no , i haven t changed anything in my room since i moved in months ago . the only things i ve changed were artwork posters on my walls i ve added a few more since then .","271135":"i d much rather text than call people .","271136":"i m pretty sure this was a mass question sent to multiple people . regardless , thank you","271137":"i keep the thermostat on degrees fahrenheit .","271138":"ah , that sounds frightening . sending my best wishes ! ! just wear a mask , and gloves if need be , and continue to practice social distancing when you re able to do so .","271139":"i ve been working from home since march , and i only go out to run errands once per week . i m a bit nervous , but i m taking all of the safety precautions and that s the best i can do for myself and others .","271140":"i d rather take three years off of the end of my life , for sure . that isn t much in the grand scheme of things .","271141":"my friends , you mean ? i ve been friends with them all for years , so if they wanted to abandon me , they would have by now .","271142":"there are currently nearly more than , cases on long island new york state right now .","271143":"myself .","271144":"a bow and arrow , and or a war axe .","271145":"my friends are my family , at this point . i have very little connections with my actual family at this point , and i only see them out of obligation on birthdays and holidays . my true support system consists of my friends .","271146":"i wouldn t go so far as to consider it a red flag , because every situation is different . however , ideally a person should leverage their family obligations with their relationship equally , and understand that there is a place and time for everything . if your family is important to you while you re in a relationship , you have to find a balance .","271147":"i try not to , but sometimes it happens .","271148":"i don t think i can give a definitive answer to this question , because it has to depend on a variety of factors what those opposites are , whether they complement each other or detract from one another , and how it affects the relationship as a whole . in certain times , i think it s healthy to be in a relationship with someone who may be somewhat opposite from you , because it can introduce new perspectives and make you see things in a different light but this might only work if both people are open to looking at new things . it can become a problem if either person in the relationship are too stubborn to look at things differently or try to understand from a different point of view .","271149":"if you ve already talked about this to him multiple times and he hasn t changed , then this seems like something he has to realize for himself . however , i would advise you to not apologize when things aren t your fault and stand your ground . perhaps that change of scenery might help him realize that he needs to take accountability . if this continues on and gets worse , though . . . i would think hard about the integrity of the relationship as a whole and whether or not you want to continue with it . a person never apologizing for their wrong actions isn t really a good person to keep around i m saying this in general though , obviously i don t know the nature of your relationship .","271150":"hey friends , my inbox is empty so y all should ask me some questions","271151":"not really . it was just one of those shows where you had to pay attention the entire time . if you miss a small section of an episode , then that may confuse you in later segments , so it requires a lot of attention .","271152":"i have a decent sleep schedule most of the time , but that s primarily because i have to wake up at the same time each morning , so i plan accordingly . i try to fall asleep between pm and midnight , because any later than that will make me very tired in the morning . my advice try to establish a routine if you don t have one already , even if you don t have to wake up at a set time the next morning .","271153":"tyrion lannister from the game of thrones series at the moment , i m referring to the show , because i haven t read the books yet . i loved his character in the show and found him to be clever and relatable , but at the same time , i feel like he would irritate the hell out of me if he was in my day to day life .","271154":"if i knew the answer to this question , then i would have a happy life . lol .","271155":"honestly , the only thing i can think of is the game of thrones series , lol . it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time , and it was stressful to a degree , but nevertheless i did enjoy it a lot .","271156":"this is perhaps the fourth of fifth time you ve called me miss leigh , and i ve deleted them every time because it makes me uncomfortable . please stop calling me that . i understand you have fair intentions , but i would prefer just leigh . i m non binary and don t feel comfortable with feminine descriptors .","271157":"svspicion and i aren t close , but we do talk every so often when i have a question about something that i know she would have the answer to . i give her a lot of credit for helping me through a lot of my mental health stuff .","271158":"i m really happy that you ve been able to find people on the internet who have been supportive to you like that . i agree , the internet is a great place to meet people with similar interests and common goals as long as you re vigilant about who you re talking to . i started using the internet frequently when i was a pre teen , and i often visited various discussion forums pertaining to my favorite bands . that s where i met a lot of my online friends who still continue to be great friends of mine , even years later . my closest friends when i was a teenager were my online friends , since we would talk every day .","271159":"having my first alcoholic drink after a long day at work makes me happy . when someone says we need to talk or i have to attend a meeting at work , that makes me nervous . i don t necessarily feel alone most of the time because i have a strong support system , but too much isolation can make me feel lonely at times . as for what makes me tired . . . i m exhausted on a constant basis , haha .","271160":"when i consider mental health advocacy , i believe that a person can be an advocate if they continue to fight against the stigma that exists regarding mental illness and make it a mission to educate others on mental health on a continuous basis , whether that s in person or online or both .","271161":"i believe it s important for people who struggle with mental health issues to develop a routine because it can be guide , in some ways , for them to live out their days and life without it feeling like it s devoid of meaning of the time . whether that routine is something like going to school or working a job , or just having a regular routine at home if you re not in school or working , it can improve a person s mood just to have a schedule especially if it s flexible .","271162":"this can happen for a variety of reasons , sometimes due to disagreements especially if someone is already in a sour mood .","271163":"no , i don t do that in general and especially not right now .","271164":"courtneyuwu is one of the loveliest people i know , and i m so grateful for our friendship . she s probably one of the people i m closest to that i ve met from askfm .","271165":"no , it s my genuine belief . i hate my face and my body , it s something that has persisted for years upon years .","271166":"i believe that my generation and the generation younger and older than me will have less of a problem with loneliness because we re familiar with social media and other forms of technology now , which makes it a lot easier for us all to communicate even if it isn t face to face .","271167":"fat people can be pretty , rofl . regardless , i disagree with you considering i hate my face and there are so many things i wish i could change about it .","271168":"eh , yes and no it really depends on the severity of the fighting , how often it happens , and how you behave towards one another . it s normal and very common to get into small arguments here and there , but if things begin to escalate , then i would consider that to be a red flag . . . especially if nothing happens after the argument like apologizing and talking the situation through .","271169":"i m not sure i can t really recall any instances . i suppose it was when my ex s family asked me if i wanted to go on a cruise with them this was before him and i broke up . i definitely thought it was going to be one of those exclusive family only sort of vacations , so i was surprised when they asked me to come along .","271170":"the only thing that comes to mind is robbing a bank , lol .","271171":"if you re not close to a person in that sort of way and you answer their phone , especially without them knowing , i believe that s rude , yes . i think things like that are only really reserved for extremely close friends and partners .","271172":"my current bedroom","271173":"instead of childhood , i m going to talk about my pre teen and teenage years , since i don t remember much of my childhood . it s always been the music from the harry potter movies . even now , they always bring on a sense of tranquility and relaxation when i listen to the soundtracks .","271174":"i agree with courtneyuwu on this subject i would legalize marijuana and release all inmates who have been arrested for marijuana related charges .","271175":"lately , it s been grandson s cover of one step closer by linkin park . https www . youtube . com watch ? v h ywkaqxas","271176":"i mainly watch ambience videos of different music compilations , things pertaining to instrumental movie , television , and video game soundtracks . i like keeping them on in the background while i write or work .","271177":"for me personally , it s been anything mathematics related , haha . i graduated from college with an english major and i m in the publishing industry , so i ve obviously had no need for any sort of algebra or calculus . i also came from an era when i was in middle school high school were teachers said you re not going to have a calculator on you all the time , which isn t true anymore . lol .","271178":"i don t know anything about either of them besides the fact that they re both wrestlers .","271179":"pretty much anything , except maybe hard drugs like meth or heroin . most things are fine in moderation .","271180":"my supervisor complimented my writing on monday when i submitted my editor s letter to her for proofreading copyediting .","271181":"i don t believe this is something new in society at all , we just have easier access to cameras moreso now than ever before .","271182":"when you re paying for what you believe is high end , quality cosmetics , you re primarily paying for the name brand itself . there are plenty of drug store makeup products that are just as high quality for much reasonable prices , and there s nothing wrong with people purchasing drug store makeup . nobody is cheap or most definitely a shame to society for being conscious about prices of items that are just as high quality as the other counterparts that are being sold primarily because of the name brand . it s the same thing as any other clothing item or accessory you re not purchasing it for quality , you re purchasing it for the name .","271183":"this is an inappropriate question for askfm . . . and for strangers in general .","271184":"yes , biden won the presidential election . trump keeps claiming that there has been significant voter fraud , but there is no evidence to back up that claim .","271185":"you re probably better off asking someone who always has a positive attitude , lmaoo .","271186":"no , that s creepy and invasive .","271187":"i ve broken the screen on an ipad once . it still worked , but there was a really nasty crack in it .","271188":"i don t believe i want children , so this doesn t exactly apply to me .","271189":"this isn t reserved to just women , lol . everyone i know , regardless of their gender , has worked retail at some point in their lives .","271190":"not really , no . i find it interesting , but i don t necessarily believe in it .","271191":"i m not really too concerned considering gas is less than per gallon right now .","271192":"no , i don t . i ve never watched a ted talk before .","271193":"i don t usually daydream .","271194":"don t forget the cigarettes .","271195":"that must mean we re siblings .","271196":"they re so pretty .","271197":"no , they re written in a way that could apply to anyone .","271198":"criminal minds , for sure .","271199":"string lights to hang on my walls led lights that are on the back of my television .","271200":"not always , no .","271201":"writing , reading , playing video games , listening to music , etc etc .","271202":"my medication , caffeine , and escapism lately in the form of video games .","271203":"one of my favorites ! !","271204":"i haven t lived in enough cities to really choose one like this . i ve always lived in new york state , and i ve visited a few other cities in the united states , but definitely not as many as i would like not counting internationally either .","271205":"no , that would be a bit unsettling to me .","271206":"i m sure it s a lot more complex than that , but i think that can also be a contributing factor as to why it s getting worse again .","271207":"i think most people should get the flu shot as long as they are medically able to do so .","271208":"they re a good way to connect with people , but you also have to be wary of people on them at the same time because they sometimes aren t necessarily who they appear to be .","271209":"i seldom get colds , so i would much rather never be stuck in traffic again . whenever i return to the office , that would probably lessen my commute to minutes instead of minutes .","271210":"rofl , that s fair .","271211":"that s good ! ! did you still end up getting the second one afterwards ? haha .","271212":"awesome , i ll definitely try that tomorrow . thank you ! !","271213":"ah , thank you ! ! i ll try that . yes , i ve noticed that the healthier food has less gravy in it and more meat , so maybe that s what is turning her off from it .","271214":"i need to buy an external hard drive for my xbox , so i can continue to install games without worrying about running out of space . i want to install the witcher , as well as the new assassin s creed game that just came out today .","271215":"i just called it junk because i couldn t think of a better name for it , rofl . stuff like fancy feast , for example , is not a good quality food brand for cats . a lot of pet stores , particularly petco , aren t carrying the unhealthy brands anymore and have their shelves stocked with the higher quality , healthier foods .","271216":"there was one time i bought a phone charger from amazon , and when it arrived , the package was sealed but completely empty . lmao . i tried telling amazon this , but they were like just mail us back the defected item and we ll send you a new one . bruh , there was no item at all . lmao .","271217":"i m not really poor , and it s something that has boggled my mind even before i started making my own money , lol . apple , for instance , seems to have almost a cult following even though their electronics aren t very reliable .","271218":"not usually , it s just something i ve noticed with the healthier food we ve been buying for both of the cats . the one cat is fine , he eats it up immediately lol , but the other cat doesn t seem very interested in it . they ve been fed the junk wet food for their entire lives , so i m just attributing it to that . we ve only swapped it over to the healthy stuff about a week ago .","271219":"name brand items , like electronics and accessories and clothing . i ve never really been interested in any of that stuff as long as something works well , the name doesn t mean anything to me .","271220":"of course it s part of being a responsible person adult .","271221":"yikes , who hurt you ? lmfao .","271222":"i m not entirely well versed on the subject of hormone replacement therapy , but i do believe that if a trans person stops taking hormones , the effects of those hormones can reverse depending on how long they ve been taking the hormones for .","271223":"one of my cats hasn t been eating the wet food lately , but i think it s because she has to get used to the new brands they re healthier . she continues to eat the dry food every day , so i m not too worried , but there s still a small level of concern .","271224":"depends on what you re into . i mainly watch crime and prison shows , haha . my favorites are wentworth , orange is the new black , forensic files , mindhunter , you , dexter , the keepers , making a murderer , and the innocent man . i also really enjoy the punisher although i never finished it , supernatural , criminal minds , and ncis .","271225":"yeah , there were strangely a lot of twins and triplets who attended my high school .","271226":"aw , i mean you probably are pretty because you re likely being too hard on yourself , but yeah if you re uncertain , better safe than sorry .","271227":"i ve always been wary of things like that , so personally i would turn it down . if you re apprehensive about it , then you re probably better off not accepting his money in case it is a scam .","271228":"okay ? that doesn t make a difference to me , lol .","271229":"a vampire , haha . i ve been intrigued by vampires since i was young .","271230":"i wasn t even aware that there was a new batman movie coming out .","271231":"i guess ? my family usually has dinner together , but it isn t a big celebration or anything .","271232":"i prefer spaghetti and meatballs .","271233":"absolutely , haha . i m sure everyone has at this point in all of our lives .","271234":"i prefer fish . it s healthier for you overall i prefer the taste of seafood over meat .","271235":"trauma is the most obvious answer to this question .","271236":"i guess my birthday , even though i have nothing special planned for it . i m thinking of inviting a few friends over for a campfire and some drinks .","271237":"a vanilla latte and an egg sandwich from mcdonalds this morning , rofl .","271238":"i m in good spirits today i ve gotten a lot done at work thus far , i treated myself to a hot vanilla latte this morning , and i m looking forward to downloading the new assassin s creed game tonight ! !","271239":"cont . . . sac where kids play or a green area with grass out the front of multiple houses where the kids play . it s all v context dependant . that s all super interesting ! ! i can t even think of examples that would come close to that , haha . we do say out front or out back too with the same sort of meanings , but it does also depend on the type of neighborhood it is . i m coming from a suburban perspective , but there could also be meanings that come from more urban areas and rural areas .","271240":"no , i just use their name , or i say dude , man , friend , or sometimes comrade .","271241":"not a problem ! ! thank you for teaching me in the other thread , as well . it s so interesting how different the cultures are .","271242":"creamer is delicious , and i think they even have plant based creamer now ! ! the regular dairy based creamer is so unhealthy though , lol .","271243":"oh wow , that s even more extensive than i thought , haha . in the united states , we just call that the front yard and the back yard .","271244":"i can t even envision that , tbh . i d obviously be more financially stable , which could also mean that i would have a nicer place to live .","271245":"from my understanding , regular cream or cream and milk , which is called half and half here is not as sweet or sugary than coffee creamer . coffee creamers also tend to come in a variety of different flavors .","271246":"the only thing that i can think of would be garden . in the united states , a garden is just a segment of area where a person plants things like flowers , fruits , vegetables , plants , etc etc . meanwhile in other countries i think primarily the uk , a garden is the entire yard .","271247":"probably something along the lines of i never loved you , i just used you , or something similar .","271248":"thank you it was a wild time in my life and i was also working part time while attending college , so i think the major thing that helped me get through it all was the fact that i was busy all the time .","271249":"i just polished off a bottle of pumpkin spice creamer i need to buy more , lol . it s been perfect for this time of year .","271250":"this entirely goes on an individualized basis , because different things make different people happy . however , if you re struggling with depression and not just sadness , i would advise you seek professional help if that s readily available to you .","271251":"graduating from college despite enduring mental illness .","271252":"that s an interesting opinion ! ! i honestly don t know what my thoughts are , i haven t done much research into the big bang theory .","271253":"my family doesn t have family gatherings anymore , but my go to was always pasta .","271254":"i enjoy listening to classical music and or instrumental soundtracks from movies , video games , and television shows . some of my favorites are the soundtracks to harry potter , the lord of the rings , and game of thrones .","271255":"my favorite song constantly changes , but lately i ve been listening to part of me by linkin park a lot . https www . youtube . com watch ? v stpzhsmb n","271256":"any times i ve been on small , weekend long vacations with my friends .","271257":"as long as i have my laptop , i think i d survive without my phone just fine .","271258":"yeah , back when i was in high school , there was another person who people confused me with all the time .","271259":"when i was years old , those years would have made a very exciting movie .","271260":"not very long at all perhaps not more than a day or so . i m really terrible at remembering to drink water i have a tendency of drinking coffee and then

overnights at the most .","271263":"years , give or take if that counts , lmao . my first relationship was when i was years old . then i entered another relationship at years old , and again at years old . i ve been single for a little over a year again .","271264":"haha , no . if i had a swear jar , i would have to withdraw money from the bank on a constant basis .","271265":"i use f ck pretty often .","271266":", and that s on a good day . the only thing i m not very humble about is my writing .","271267":"no , i don t generally shop in person anymore . i do the majority of my christmas shopping online .","271268":"that makes me happy too , lol . it s always a much easier commute than hitting every light on the way . other than that , i like making the perfect cup of coffee in the morning , especially on chilly mornings like it was last week .","271269":"i m from new york state .","271270":"no , i m not married .","271271":"you re anonymous , but i don t generally follow people on request anyway .","271272":"ah , thanks for the heads up ! ! that s so inappropriate for askfm .","271273":"having a decent lunch and drinking more water than i usually do . i also finished writing the editor s letter for the new edition of the magazine i ve been working on for my job , which is exciting .","271274":"no , my stomach has been fine .","271275":"no , i ve never heard of that before .","271276":"i honestly hate baths , rofl . i ve tried taking a few in the past few weeks with epsom salt and stuff , but i get bored so easily .","271277":"i m still tired , and i m planning on napping again possibly after work .","271278":"regardless of how much or how little i sleep , i always wake up so tired .","271279":"if i had an answer , i would fix it .","271280":"yeah , they re pretty chunky , lol . well , the mainecoon is actually fine for his size he s just very furry but the other cat definitely needs to go on a diet .","271281":"i m not exactly someone you should idolize , but all right .","271282":"i feel like i got hit by a truck my body aches and i m exhausted , even though i slept for around hours last night . ugh .","271283":"no , i have no interest in dating .","271284":"you can t exactly force people to get a vaccine , but you can highly encourage them to receive it with proper resources and education .","271285":"definitely not , rofl .","271286":"united as one .","271287":"i don t know the demographics of people who support trump .","271288":"that may be true , sure . not everyone thinks they re weird , though .","271289":"on multiple occasions , yeah .","271290":"i love sushi , it s probably one of my favorite meals . i like having the mexican roll , california roll , spicy salmon roll , and salmon avocado roll .","271291":"you re probably better off asking someone who claims that they re weird .","271292":"mental illness other chronic invisible illnesses .","271293":"putting into your daily tasks and goals , whether personal or professional . most days i give , but depending on how i feel , other times i just do enough to get by .","271294":"i don t really care . people grieve in different ways , and i also never knew shawnie or josh , so his personal business is none of my concern nor should it be yours .","271295":"hello do you have a question ?","271296":"i like questions pertaining to mental health .","271297":"this is getting really old , really fast . although i guess it s to be expected considering trump most of his supporters cannot face the reality that another candidate is better than him .","271298":"ridden a bicycle , swam in a lake , flown a kite , and traveled cross country .","271299":"in my bedroom with my door closed , headphones in , and calm music playing . this normally happens when i try to write creatively .","271300":"the feeling would be mutual in that case , rofl .","271301":"in this moment , otep , rob zombie , and korn .","271302":"yeah , i tend to make an idiot of myself when i m around people i don t know and it makes me feel extremely panicky . i m also too hypervigilant afraid i m going to encounter a dangerous situation .","271303":"no , because their beliefs wouldn t align with mine on a lot of significant and fundamental things .","271304":"i went once when i was in high school .","271305":"depends on the night . sometimes hours , other times hours .","271306":"yeah , it s pretty prevalent i think regardless of where you live in the united states , at least .","271307":"i ve always been pro choice .","271308":"smoking drinking .","271309":"chocolate chip cookie dough , and matcha ice cream .","271310":"no , i m really not mentally prepared to work tomorrow .","271311":"i don t watch cable news networks .","271312":"i agree . it s unfortunate that school systems don t adequately educate the youth on politics due to a lack of resources .","271313":"i ve never pretended to be political , and my life doesn t consist primarily of politics . this may have been the case five years ago , but definitely not now .","271314":"i d rather be rich through hard work because that means i earned that money .","271315":"no , so many roads are under construction and have potholes .","271316":"i would rather never be talked about at all .","271317":"i actually don t think i ve ever fainted before .","271318":"i don t really care . this is the first time i ve ever heard the term neoliberalism too , lol .","271319":"lol . yeah , that s social anxiety for you","271320":"i don t really have strong opinions for or against it it s just something that happens every years , and i do my part in voting and just hope for the best .","271321":"that s the case with this relationship , from my understanding . they were both ab sive towards each other from the little i know right now but like i said , i d have to look into it more .","271322":"this is actually the one issue i have been somewhat following everyone is against amber heard rn because of her ab se against johnny depp how johnny depp just lost his libel case in the uk and has resigned from returning to the fantastic beasts franchise . i keep hearing differing opinions about the situation , though . initially i was all justiceforjohnnydepp but now i m hearing that he was also ab sive towards her , so i have to delve deeper into the situation . i wasn t aware initially that he was also an alleged ab ser .","271323":"hey friends , ask me some questions","271324":"yeah , i agree . i notice that when i point stuff like this out to people , i never get responses back because it s simply common sense at this point . if i was saying oh , fat people are bad people and always lazy then that s fatphobic . pointing out that obesity in itself is unhealthy and is detrimental to a person s health and wellness isn t fatphobic . it s factual .","271325":"i always get called fatphobic when i talk about this subject , lmao . like yeah , you can be healthy technically and overweight , but when it gets to the point where you re obese , that s where complications set in musculoskeletal problems , heart disease , respiratory issues , etc etc . it s no surprise that the united states has high rates of obesity , much more than most other countries , because there s this culture of bigger is better meaning food . granted , i eat fast food perhaps too often because it s easier for me , but i m always shocked at how large the burgers and drinks are . it s wild .","271326":"yeah , where i live primarily consists of trump supporters .","271327":"i wasn t necessarily pointing blame at the fast food restaurants in particular , but i do believe there may be a correlation , if somewhat stringent . with the fast paced world we live in today , it s often much easier to eat fast food than cook meals at home .","271328":"i never said it was . i m fat , but i m not terribly unhealthy considering i eat good meals . however , being obese does raise the risk of inheriting other serious health conditions .","271329":"it isn t fatphobic to point out that the united states has probably the most fast food restaurants out of any other country i m assuming , i don t feel like looking it up rn though . the united states also has an alarming rate of people who are obese , which lends itself to a multitude of other serious health conditions .","271330":"my best prediction is that because places started opening up again , people got more lenient and thought they were safe , which means they were less likely to practice social distancing and wear masks . it s also cold and flu season at least in the united states and europe , so i expect that might have something to do with it as well .","271331":"a dark blonde .","271332":"yeah , that isn t an issue considering my age .","271333":"probably about an , tbh .","271334":"that s all that matters in the end that you made it and made a better life for yourself after that . that s something of which to be proud .","271335":"i wish i could have moved out that young , ahah . i was only able to afford my own place until after i received a promotion in august of , a few months before my th birthday .","271336":"thank you ! ! moving out of my parents house has helped my mental health exponentially .","271337":"i was a lot more anxious one year ago , considering i had just moved into this new house and was still getting accustomed to living on my own . however , i ve become much more relaxed since then , especially with respect to work .","271338":"there isn t really anything i would refuse to pay for , considering i only really buy the necessities that i need to survive enjoy my life .","271339":"at times , yes .","271340":"nope , i m single .","271341":"i don t have an opinion , i don t know anything about them and i never watched the show .","271342":"precisely i can t tell you how many burger kings there are where i live , it s absurd .","271343":"pranks are silly and immature .","271344":"burger king , lmaoo .","271345":"i m so incredibly happy with the outcome .","271346":"not really , i find it easy to occupy myself when i m bored with various hobbies .","271347":"happy birthday ! !","271348":"no , never have been .","271349":"no , i would have suppressed my emotions .","271350":"just drinking and perusing social media . it s nearly pm and i m not even tired . i was planning on writing tonight , but that doesn t seem like it s happening .","271351":"no , because i haven t been . perhaps two hours of the day at most , lol .","271352":"i get crusties that s what i call them , idk what y all call them in my eyes when i wake up in the morning , so i just wipe them away .","271353":"tears , water , my fingers , and soap at one point .","271354":"not very well , tbh . i have a tendency to become self destructive when i m angry , mainly in the form of drinking and smoking .","271355":"i m happy that i have the house to myself tonight because if my roommate was here , he definitely would have heard me sobbing and cheering the entire day . lmao .","271356":"i mean , subway makes some pretty good sandwiches , so i don t blame you , rofl .","271357":"i understand . i sometimes struggle with low blood sugar if i don t eat every few hours , so i definitely needed something substantial besides the salad i had around pm .","271358":"mainly celebrated the election of joe biden as the next president of the united states . obviously i did some essentials in between , like eating and showering and regular daily responsibilities , but the majority of my day was spent talking about the election .","271359":"i m sleeping in this shirt tonight , so i d rather just throw the towel in the hamper to wash tomorrow with my other clothes as opposed to sleeping with snot on my shoulder . lol .","271360":"i m doing quite well , thank you .","271361":"dude , me too . this feels like a weight being lifted off of my shoulders . thank you ! ! i feel so much better now , back to physically . i really think i just needed to eat something and take some pills , and the shower definitely did help .","271362":"this is going to sound gross , but i didn t want to step away from my computer while watching the speeches in case i might miss something so i ended up using the towel that i have to dry my hair to wipe my nose not blow into it , though , lmfao . it s okay i was planning on washing it tomorrow anyway . but the entire time , i was like , i can t step away from my computer until the speeches are done .","271363":"it has been a roller coaster of a day , my friend . i woke up this morning feeling a bit rough around the edges i got too f cked up last night , but ever since biden was deemed the president elect , i ve been feeling so elated , hopeful , inspired , and encouraged . in the middle of the afternoon , i started to feel really sh tty physically i couldn t stop using the bathroom , i was very lightheaded and shaky , and i felt like i had a fever . but eventually it did subside , i was able to take a shower and eat dinner , and now i m just reveling in the moment and having a few drinks .","271364":"honestly , i m better expressing my feelings via text than talking anyway , lol .","271365":"when kamala harris was talking about her mother and family history , that got me choked up as well . especially when kamala said that this is pretty much only the beginning , and while she is the first woman to be in office , she most definitely won t be the last .","271366":"if i do , it won t be of my face . however , i am home alone tonight so i d be willing to respond via video to some questions .","271367":"inspired , tbh . watching those speeches gave me renewed hope in this nation , and while i know what they re saying are just words for now , it makes a world of difference knowing that they re unified for a complete america not an america that s divided between red and blue . we have a lot of progress to do . there s so much left to undo and begin again , and so many issues left to tackle that were neglected under the trump administration , but i feel very hopeful right now .","271368":"it wouldn t surprise me if he does .","271369":"nope . i was elated this morning and teared up a bit , but it was more of a celebration than anything else . afterwards , when i heard that both kamala harris and biden were addressing the nation tonight , i tuned in and totally lost it . lmaoo .","271370":"lol , man i was sobbing so i totally feel you . kamala harris speech got me choked up more than biden s speech , but when biden came out and mentioned the gay and trans communities , and how they both basically said that black americans were the backbone of this nation , i was in tears .","271371":"i know exactly what you mean , dude . it s been four years of just . . . nonsense , lies , insults , and narcissism . it got to the point where i couldn t watch trump s speeches because his voice just irritated me , so i d read the transcripts afterwards . it feels weird , but also nice and amazing , to have a presidential team that is professional and eloquent . it s what we deserve .","271372":"because my eyes are swollen , my nose is red , my hair is still wet tangled , and my cheeks are pink because i ve been drinking . lmaoo .","271373":"i ve been switching tabs between askfm , facebook , and twitter .","271374":"not tonight , i look terrible i ve been crying tears of joy for the past two hours . lmaoo .","271375":"i m already an emotional wreck of the time . alcohol just tends to mask my emotions make me feel normal for a change .","271376":"for anyone who wants to see this","271377":"lmao yes . then guliani stepped up to speak because trump couldn t not sure of the reasons why , which is also hilarious to me considering the controversy surrounding him with the new borat movie .","271378":"i wonder about their life and what got them to that point , and how difficult it must be to survive like that .","271379":"dude , i was laughing so hard when i first stumbled across that . i didn t think it was real until i went on twitter and saw all of the photos and videos .","271380":"i m most comfortable with trains .","271381":"i m thankful for the support system that i have in my friends and therapist for helping me through my mental health crises , especially when i m too self conscious and afraid to come forward on my own .","271382":"there s nothing wrong with going out while being proactive about what you re doing i . e . wearing a mask , social distancing , etc etc . the numbers did get better for a while , but now they re getting worse again in several places across the globe .","271383":"i answered this question minutes ago when it was initially asked to me .","271384":"yeah , on a few occasions .","271385":"don t put time and effort into a person who won t reciprocate that time and effort into you in return .","271386":"the last movie i watched was les miserables i watched it last night . the last series i watched was buzzfeed unsolved true crime this afternoon .","271387":"no , it isn t my birthday .","271388":"biden was elected to be the next president of the united states .","271389":"i m doing well just got out of the shower now i m going to have a few drinks in celebration of today .","271390":"i answered this question a few hours ago .","271391":"i don t go outside . outside is bad .","271392":"they ve been censoring trump s tweets for a while with disclaimers that state that what he says may not be factual . which is the correct thing to do .","271393":"i ve been wearing pajamas since march .","271394":"indeed .","271395":"trump isn t too much younger than him , and as we all saw when trump got covid , the presidents get probably the best medical care in the country . i m not too concerned about his health because he seems to be in great health .","271396":"new york my home state , connecticut , pennsylvania , massachusetts , vermont , maine and pretty much all of new england . i ve also been to florida texas .","271397":"what the f ck . lmao .","271398":"this is bordering on the edge of weird , so i m not answering any more of these questions .","271399":"yes ! ! she s the first woman vice president , who is also the first poc vice president too she s black and indian .","271400":"well , i wouldn t call my first relationship a lover considering i was only years old , lol . i dated my second ex from the time i was to when i was years old .","271401":"my longest relationship was years .","271402":"two .","271403":"i try to be early as much as possible .","271404":"no , i m single .","271405":"hypothetical questions are silly .","271406":"i don t know many of his songs , but circles is a good one . https youtu . be wxhthyigq u","271407":"oh , do you mean aliens ? if so , then yeah i believe that extraterrestrial life exists somewhere else in the universe .","271408":"uh . . . i don t know what this is supposed to mean .","271409":"i live with a roommate .","271410":"i m a writer editor for a publishing company .","271411":"hello do you have a question ?","271412":"yes , lol . my favorite is smartwater .","271413":"i normally offer advice . i very seldom ask for it myself .","271414":"i started reading fahrenheit by ray bradbury the other night .","271415":"of course , it s historical on so many levels .","271416":"idk , i haven t had chipotle in years .","271417":"twitter hasn t done anything , what do you mean ?","271418":"i don t see anything on my twitter feed regarding people being mean to trump . my feed primarily consists of people celebrating , lol .","271419":"lol , no . i ve been in my house all day .","271420":"i think it s rude that you knocked over their signs .","271421":"i honestly don t remember i was probably angry and upset when trump won years ago .","271422":"i definitely did , lol .","271423":"honestly , i don t think anyone can be worse than trump at this current moment , rofl .","271424":"i was teary eyed because of how monumental of an election this has been and the hurdles we have surpassed to get to this point . although biden wasn t my first choice , i was afraid trump was going to get reelected it s a weight off my shoulders to know that the country won t be run by him anymore .","271425":"not a problem ! !","271426":"possibly , considering the senate is primarily republican right now .","271427":"i haven t looked that deeply into it yet .","271428":"no , i don t personally think so . the united states has a pattern of swapping between democratic and republican administrations every few years .","271429":"well , no one knows for certain until it happens .","271430":"no , probably not . i think bernie has made it clear that he doesn t think he should be part of the administration to my knowledge .","271431":"yes , i believe he will .","271432":"i saw on the google election coverage that he won , i wasn t watching a news source .","271433":"his plan is to make colleges universities more affordable .","271434":"no , i was not .","271435":"focus more on climate change and investing in green energy , opening more equality and opportunities for the lgbtq community and poc , reducing health care costs and make health care more accessible , and manage covid more efficiently .","271436":"i could probably say the same about you , if we re being frank . regardless of someone s economic status , today is a day for celebration .","271437":"sitting with my laptop , frantically refreshing the google elections page tbh . i was in the middle of talking to some friends about the election when i saw that he had reached over votes .","271438":"i read that trump is the first president to serve for only one term since george h . w . bush back in the early s . he s only the th president in the history of the united states to lose reelection . regardless , i m so incredibly happy and i had tears in my eyes this morning as i heard the news .","271439":"they probably live in pennsylvania .","271440":"tbh , i wholeheartedly think he is . i m not too worried ! ! for now , let s celebrate this day for what it is . then we can move onto progressing forward in the upcoming weeks .","271441":"it s better to have clear information than to remain ignorant of the facts , in my perspective .","271442":"i looked it up briefly , and they are correct . regardless of what happens with pennsylvania , i m fairly confident that biden will still be president elect either way .","271443":"he most likely will , he ll try any attempt to save himself .","271444":"that does make sense . even if biden loses pennsylvania if that s the case , he ll lose electoral college votes which will still put him at exactly .","271445":"if that s true , then that s hilarious .","271446":"i just checked trump s twitter page and he hasn t said a word in two hours prior to the announcement that biden will be the new president , lmao . i wonder if he s throwing a tantrum rn .","271447":"oh wow , i didn t know that . i wonder if that still applies because of covid , though that s my only question , since so many ballots were mail in this time around .","271448":"i mean , it s immature obviously but also expected from him . i haven t looked at his twitter page , though , besides the tweet from him an hour or two ago saying that he was going to win . rofl .","271449":"i m not aware of what act is , but you re probably right . he won the popular vote and the electoral college , and i think a few states are still counting . i just re checked and biden just won nevada , so now he s at electoral college votes .","271450":"i never stated i loved biden , i would have obviously preferred bernie but he decided to drop out and focus on biden s campaign instead . however , he is a much better candidate than trump has ever been , and now he is president elect .","271451":"y all can t let up , can you ? lol . my statements to you in the previous thread still apply here . today is a beautiful day for celebration whether you like it or not . now let s rejoice in this grand moment in history and work towards a better america .","271452":"you evidently don t understand the messages i m portraying in my responses . to sum it up for you i don t care . today is a good day . i m not going to satisfy your attempts at trolling on such a beautiful day in american history . move along .","271453":"you sound like the salty anon in my other thread . you do realize that under trump s administration , immigrants are also being isolated and ab sed in cages by ice and there are hundreds of displaced families , right ?","271454":"oh please , this isn t the time for this kind of nonsense . i m not going to do silly research just to satisfy your need for validation , especially not now during such a pivotal moment in united states history . just continue about your day and revel in this moment .","271455":"she has a history of being a prosecutor in the legal system . regardless of that , times have changed . i m not excusing her or biden for the wrongs they have done in the past , but kamala karris and joe biden are a much better , more proactive choice than another years of trump .","271456":"i . . . literally just gave you an example , lol . i don t care what you think . i m celebrating today today is a beautiful day for the united states .","271457":"look into what women go through if they want to get their tubes tied , as an example . i m not going to entertain you further than this .","271458":"i m not sure which world you re from , but it certainly isn t earth . regardless this is a moment of celebration . not nit picking inaccurate details for the sake of trolling .","271459":"everyone is equal is ideally what it should be , but in reality , it isn t . this is a step towards progress . this is a step towards equality . i couldn t be happier .","271460":"no ? lmfao .","271461":"kamala harris is not only the first woman vice president of the united states , but the first woman vice president who is also a poc .","271462":"goodbye , you fascist f ck .","271463":"wow , haven t heard about dahvie vanity in a long time thanks for the nostalgia , rofl . my day is going well so far , i ve primarily just been playing music and discussing the election with my friends this morning .","271464":"my friend showed me this , and it is absolute gold . https www . youtube . com watch ? v d n bwbpo","271465":"i ve only been awake for about an hour , so i haven t learned anything today . the only thing i ve been noticing is that my appetite is basically nothing at this point now i used to be able to eat an entire egg sandwich for breakfast , but now i can barely eat half of one .","271466":"aw , thank you ! ! yesterday was a pretty productive day i worked my regular shift , then spent some time with my roommate before he left to visit his girlfriend . i spent the rest of the evening drinking smoking , and at one point i took a bath with pleasant music in the background . it was nice .","271467":"i used to know a few songs on the guitar when i was a teenager , but these days , no .","271468":"no , i don t . not that i don t want to , obviously , but because i don t have the kind of money where i could donate to charity while also keeping myself afloat .","271469":"i honestly don t remember . i don t like slamming doors or hearing other people slamming doors , though . it s unfortunately one of my triggers .","271470":"three years ago i absolutely hated it .","271471":"i would rather be able to drink unlimited free coffee , ahah . i barely leave my house to begin with anyway , so the whole wifi thing doesn t affect me very much . however , it would be splendid to get free coffee wherever i go .","271472":"i made scrambled eggs with toasted rye bread the other morning for breakfast . it came out pretty decent .","271473":"i m not afraid of insects .","271474":"i literally have zero idea . rye bread is my favorite type of bread , though .","271475":"yes , i believe so . just because they re incarcerated doesn t mean they don t deserve a say in who represents them in local , state , or federal governments .","271476":"i had rum for dinner .","271477":"there isn t really anything that i ve eaten enough of to the point where i hate it now . my meals have always been pretty diverse .","271478":"hello , i am bored af would like some questions . photo posted for eye grabbing purposes .","271479":"i agree ! ! one of the best out there .","271480":"right now , i m listening to the soundtrack from harry potter and the sorcerer s stone .","271481":"fresh mozzarella , basil , cherry tomatoes , parmesan cheese , and olive oil with red sauce and a thin crust .","271482":"yes , that s the majority of the music that i ve been listening to these days including right now .","271483":"atlantis the lost empire , or pirates of the caribbean those are disney movies , right ? . atlantis has always been one of my favorite disney movies because of the general atmosphere and the characters , and i think it would be fascinating to live in that sort of world . pirates , on the other hand , well . . . that s self explanatory , ahah .","271484":"i don t remember much of my childhood , so i honestly don t have an answer to this question .","271485":"having a consistent job schedule has taught me that i work well with a solid routine every day every week , when in the past , i didn t think that would be the case whatsoever . it helps my mental health a lot .","271486":"nope ! ! it s going to be a nice weekend of doing absolutely nothing except maybe laundry , unless i get so bored to the point where i want to invite a friend over . and by nothing , i mean playing video games , writing , and reading .","271487":"dvds , i suppose . i watch dvds on my xbox console .","271488":"probably for being in the wrong place at the wrong time , lmaoo . the most realistic scenario i can think of would be if i was somewhere that happened to be a local news scene , and they randomly shoved a camera in my face to get my opinion .","271489":"this is going to sound a bit bizarre , but i look up to my ex the most out of pretty much everyone i know . our breakup was amicable and we re still on great terms , and i ve always valued our friendship over the past decade . he s also an incredibly strong and resilient person who has endured a lot throughout his life , but has also managed to make the best out of every bad situation .","271490":"a good friend is someone who supports all of your dreams and goals , but on the other end , isn t afraid to call you out for your behavior if you re doing something problematic or dangerous . there should be equal communication between friends .","271491":"the normalcy of binge drinking to the point where it s considered alcoholism , but people are too blind or in denial to see it . this is especially prevalent in the united states and i m sure other countries too , but since i live in the us , this is where i see it the most . i know i m not exempt from this either , considering i do drink most nights out of the week . but the fact that it s considered normalized in society is the scary part , that people are drinking on a daily basis and think that it s normal is a detriment to how we view health and wellness .","271492":"why am i the way that i am ? it s a question i posed to my therapist during one of our first meetings , because she asked me what i wanted to achieve in therapy . i described to her that i basically wanted to get to the root cause of all of my problems , which includes all of my repressed memories of the past and come to a better understanding of why i behave the way i do .","271493":"my laptop , my vape , a bottle of wine , and a pot of coffee .","271494":"when i was younger , other people . i wanted to change people to be better versions of themselves and encourage them to become better people , but you cannot help someone who does not want to help themselves .","271495":"i used a ouija board once when i was a pre teen . i was in my friend s house and we used it , and it started answering questions to things that neither of us knew the answer to which we later verified with my friend s parents . then while also using it , we both saw some sort of white apparition dart from one doorway to another from across the hall , which scared the sh t out of us .","271496":"video games , most definitely . as much as i love playing video games and eventually do want to try to stream or record videos with my friends , it would make us absolutely zero money , lol .","271497":"ziplining has always been a goal of mine , especially if it s somewhere in the trees or mountains .","271498":"i ve been trying to devote more time to writing lately because of nanowrimo national novel writing month , and so far i m about , words in the goal is to hit , by the end of the month . other than that , i ve been playing video games on occasion with my friends , which has been super fun .","271499":"i understand that feeling all too well , haha . my dog when i lived at my parents house was a rescue , but i didn t go to the place when my brother adopted her which in retrospect , was probably a good thing because i would have wanted them all . lmao .","271500":"i love learning about medieval periods , especially as it pertains to nordic history .","271501":"by george orwell really made me contemplate the society we live in the first time i read the book .","271502":"feeling the cool breeze coming through my window while i m working , lighting candles , having productive conversations with friends , having a cold beer at the end of a strenuous day , and playing video games with friends .","271503":"in certain aspects , yes . on the rare occasion , i m not humble particularly when it comes to my writing .","271504":"talk them through with someone close to you or a therapist and attain closure through a discussion of those feelings . that s the healthiest way to do it , at least .","271505":"i d probably just scream into the void .","271506":"i do have to admit , even though eminem is a terrible human being , i still enjoy some of his music for nostalgia reasons .","271507":"i just ignore it at this point . it isn t worth giving those people my time or energy .","271508":"anchovies , most likely .","271509":"i would rescue a dog , probably an older dog because they re less likely to get adopted .","271510":"i don t have a crush .","271511":"going on a camping trip with my friends a few weeks ago was the most fun i ve had so far this year . it was definitely worth it and much needed to get away from civilization for a weekend .","271512":"my laptop , my phone , my vape , all of my chargers for electronics , clothing , medication , headphones , a few of my favorite books , and my journal .","271513":"v for vendetta always inspired me in a strange way , ahah . i m also inspired by the movie adaptation of les miserables .","271514":"nicotine and caffeine .","271515":"i normally feel most energetic around am to am . that s the probable time when i ve had enough caffeine in me to fully wake me up , and i notice i get more work done in that hour compared to the rest of the day .","271516":"i m clingy and manipulative .","271517":"i m not much of a sports fan , so i don t have strong feelings for or against racket sports . i ve never played tennis , but i have played badminton on a few occasions . it s been many , many years , though .","271518":"i don t think covid will ever be completely gone , and life will probably never return to the same level of normalcy that we expect it to return to pre covid . regardless , when things become more manageable and vaccines are distributed , i ll probably return to the office and live my life as usual .","271519":"big mood .","271520":"it depends on the type of music they already like . in most cases , however , i like to recommend grandson , two feet , matt maeson , ashnikko , nf , and juice wrld .","271521":"not really , no . if i don t like an app then i simply don t use it , lol .","271522":"i don t have one , rofl . i ve been wearing nothing but loose tee shirts and pajama pants or leggings for the past eight months .","271523":"honestly , over the past few years i ve done so much reading and writing for work that i m exhausted by the time i get home or clock out of work considering the past eight months . i haven t felt compelled to read in a long time with the exception of a few occasions . i started reading fahrenheit by ray bradbury last night , but i only got maybe pages into it before i put it down .","271524":"both , simultaneously .","271525":"camping ! ! or , glamping if that s more of your thing . i went camping for the first time a few weeks ago and it was such a great experience .","271526":"i think a movie about my life prior to the age of would be much more interesting than a movie about my life after i had turned , rofl .","271527":"at this point , probably not . the way he has been conducting himself over the past year alone should have been enough to dissuade voters from voting for him , not to mention the obvious fact that he rolled back so many things that would have protected the lgbtq community , women s rights , and the general health and safety of the country .","271528":"i think the real question is why are colleges and universities offering subpar education for an absurd amount of money .","271529":"unstable , artistic , exhausted .","271530":"there is an idea of a patrick bateman some kind of abstraction . but there is no real me only an entity , something illusory . and though i can hide my cold gaze , and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable , i simply am not there . american psycho book .","271531":"i sneeze when looking in direct sunlight .","271532":"it takes a lot to get me angry , but when i am angry , i do explode . that s a bit different from being short tempered .","271533":"no , you can get a job in the united states without having a degree from a college or university . i got my first job prior to obtaining my degree .","271534":"not really , i m actually a pretty patient person .","271535":"yes , lmaoo . my roommate would show me his favorite videos almost every day , and finally i was like , fine i m downloading it .","271536":"you re better off purchasing a car first before you invest in a house .","271537":", coins .","271538":"i never eat chili , so i unfortunately don t have an answer to this question .","271539":"i love white cheddar , so i m more apt to buy white cheddar mac n cheese as opposed to regular mac n cheese .","271540":"besides askfm , i also use facebook , twitter , snapchat , tiktok , and instagram .","271541":"not really , although it does concern me if i find out that someone is copying me . it means that the other person isn t comfortable with themselves and would rather emulate someone they look up to .","271542":"i would rather control electronics with my mind . having the ability to control animals is rather weird because they re living , breathing creatures .","271543":"like your emojis suggest , i really love dipping french fries in ice cream , ahah .","271544":"yeah , i vape and i also drink alcohol .","271545":"i started reading fahrenheit by ray bradbury last night . prior to that , i read a short story by stephen king a month or two ago .","271546":"aw , thank you for the follow","271547":"yeah , i enjoy the rain .","271548":"horrible , tbh . i had flashbacks and panic attacks all morning , then i started drinking i ve been drunk high for like hours .","271549":"keep your enemies close your enemies enemies closer .","271550":"if you re gonna talk about someone , at least tag them . cx shehitsback","271551":"no , i never have .","271552":"suffer alone , i suppose .","271553":"no , but i do believe that a lot of white people were raised in racist environments , which contributes to their current racism whether they believe it or not . it s all a process of unlearning that behavior .","271554":"tbh , i m the same way so i have nothing productive to add to this .","271555":"y all are reading too much into this , lmaoo .","271556":"if i did , i don t remember doing so . either way , biden harris is a much better alternative to the trump administration .","271557":"i m sure i did as a child or teenager , but not necessarily as an adult .","271558":"travel the world .","271559":"i wasn t aware that i didn t like her .","271560":"well , these days at home for obvious reasons . but it s always nice to go to restaurants on occasion .","271561":"wtf , are you serious ? lol . i m used to seeing external hard drives that are just as big as the towers themselves .","271562":"yes , it is a skyrim shirt ! ! they re the symbols from the thieves guild .","271563":"i would much rather live in washington state . it seems really beautiful there .","271564":"i don t .","271565":"my mental illness is acting up i can t cope .","271566":"not yet , no . there are still votes left to be counted .","271567":"people do things that are unhealthy all the time , lol . they ll try one cigarette and find it gross most likely , then try it again and soon they find themselves buying packs at a time . it s extremely common . i started smoking when i was years old and quit when i was about to turn years old it s been one year and one month since i quit . i knew smoking was unhealthy , but i honestly didn t care at the time .","271568":"uh . . . no ? why would you call out someone for posting a photo of a musician that they like ? rofl .","271569":"most of the time , they sorta fall into it and become addicted to nicotine very quickly . nicotine is extremely difficult to quit , and it s very common for people to try to quit and subsequently start up again .","271570":"i ll be happy , but also cautious . it s an improvement from trump , at the very least .","271571":"zen in the art of writing is more of a writing guide than anything else , much like stephen king s on writing book . i read those when i was a freshman in college during one of my writing classes . i haven t read any of his short stories , but i should definitely check them out if i enjoy fahrenheit . as for books i ve read multiple times , there have been several , haha . it s unfortunate now , but i did read the harry potter series on several occasions , and i also enjoy reading other various stephen king and anne rice books i ve read a few of king s short stories a few times and interview with the vampire twice . girl interrupted is another one of my favorites , by susanna kaysen . that has a lot to do with mental health and it was instrumental in me understanding mental illness when i was a teenager .","271572":"perhaps you should ask him .","271573":"in high school , we read lord of the flies and a lot of shakespeare and poe , among other works that i can t remember . when i was in college , i read a lot of more classic novels , my favorite being don quixote .","271574":"my education was evidently subpar , because i never read animal farm when i was growing up , although that would also be suitable to read rn too .","271575":"lol . the only book i ve read from ray bradbury is zen in the art of writing when i was in college . i m partial to kafka , but honestly , fahrenheit is the only book i surprisingly haven t read yet out of those three . it wasn t required reading for my courses , for whatever reason .","271576":"so . . . which book should i start reading tonight ?","271577":"this just furthers my belief that the us has absolutely no idea what it s doing , especially with the education system , and there continues to be so much societal divide about immigration that nothing is being done about it regardless of what end of the political spectrum you re on . european countries , from my understanding , have much better governmental systems . however , i ll be the first to admit that i know nearly nothing about european politics .","271578":"no , i don t believe that . there are also so many ballots that have yet to be counted as well because there were so many mail in ballots . we won t see completely accurate numbers for a few days from now , from my understanding .","271579":"yes , especially in today s age . the primary problem is that nicotine is one of the hardest things to quit .","271580":"i knew smoking was dangerous from the very beginning . the main reason why i quit smoking cigarettes was because in the last year that i was smoking , i would wake up every morning with a hacking cough that would make me choke or dry heave , and i knew i needed to stop .","271581":"that s interesting . that makes me question what happens to families who cannot afford an education in canada , considering it seems as if most jobs require higher education . then again , canadian universities are probably much cheaper than universities within the us , including community colleges .","271582":"biden is leading at the moment , and there s a pretty decent chance that he ll win .","271583":"interesting . so if someone is looking to immigrate to canada in order to pursue a better education than what is available in their native country , they cannot do so ?","271584":"contrary to popular belief , immigrants have actually created new job opportunities for americans because many immigrants start their own businesses and , in fact , pay taxes . as for the whole drug comment , even if someone did do drugs , that doesn t make them any less of a person because they re struggling with a substance use and mental health disorder . people who are drug users aren t inferior members of society , and we should erase the idea that they re not deserving of help .","271585":"sure , i would make it so that i would have vision and wouldn t need prescription lenses anymore .","271586":"i literally just answered your question .","271587":"i don t believe so , no . the majority of immigrants come to the us to seek jobs and to seek asylum , and immigration is the basis upon which the us was founded . what should be focused on more are the displaced families in ice camps who have been treated inhumanely , and the hundreds of children who have not been reunited with their parents .","271588":"most likely , there would be greater understanding between humans and other animals and probably less ab se towards animals too .","271589":"i haven t really thought about it much , tbh . i would eventually like to visit new zealand and iceland , though .","271590":"yes , i have .","271591":"candles , lmaoo . i finally dug out all of my candles from last year ended up purchasing three more last week , so now i have a lot of candles .","271592":"probably a bit more boring , considering several of the more controversial questions i get are from anons . if anonymous was taken away , there would be a lot less activity .","271593":"probably or so , ranging between boots and slip ons and sandals .","271594":"i really enjoyed visiting the american museum of natural history in new york city . i ve been there a few times , and it s always a wonderful learning experience .","271595":"i m a decent driver , but also very cautious because i have major driving anxiety and i m terrified of getting into an accident .","271596":"yes , i absolutely love tattoos . i have seven tattoos myself i m planning on getting a lot more .","271597":"when you asked me this question , i was home . i am , in fact , still very much at home .","271598":"halloween is my favorite holiday , although i admittedly don t do much to celebrate it . i like hanging up purple orange lights in the house and setting up some decor , but i don t do much other than that .","271599":"neither , i don t like either of those shows .","271600":"honestly , i think that poc deserve to have a greater platform to voice their disgust for people who claim to be poc and are actually white , because they have first hand experience as to what it s like to be discriminated for being a poc . white people doesn t necessarily have to be women , btw should call out injustice when they see it too , but because they benefit from white privilege , the most they can do is offer their opinion . they have zero experience with being oppressed due to their race .","271601":"raven is a single , solitary person on a dying website i m talking about askfm . obviously it s terrible to try to claim that you re a poc when you re actually white , but in the grand scheme of things , it s something that deserves very little of my attention .","271602":"myself and my roommate .","271603":"no , lol . i dislike trump , but hate is a very strong word that is only reserved for particular people .","271604":"i really enjoyed all of the psychology , sociology , and anthropology classes i took . for about six months , i debated on changing my major to anthropology .","271605":"i dropped off my absentee ballot last week , but prior to that , the last time i actually went to a polling place to vote was years ago during the last presidential election .","271606":"i haven t done anything wild for money , i ve always just worked various jobs .","271607":"i hate one person in my life , but that s all .","271608":"it doesn t really mean much to me .","271609":"continue living my life and dealing with problems as they arise , just like the past four years have been like .","271610":"that i m doing fine when i am , in fact , not fine at all .","271611":"i didn t realize we went back in time to years ago when people anonymously talked about one another just for the sake of drama . i couldn t care any less about what other people do or say on social media , unless they were a close friend of mine , of course . we re all adults now .","271612":"when i was in school , i liked the process of continual learning sitting in lectures , having discussions , writing notes , and just having everything come together in one cohesive form .","271613":"i would like to delve further into photography .","271614":"i honestly don t have any strong opinions regarding social media because , although i use social media often , it doesn t encompass my entire life . although now that i do think about it , something that is a bit irritating is when people assume they know all about you based entirely on what you choose to post online . it s irrational thinking because people only post what they re comfortable posting , and it isn t of who someone is .","271615":"hm , interesting .","271616":"i don t really have one . i like composers of various modern media , but they re not pianists .","271617":"i write fairly well when i put my mind to it .","271618":"in that case , then no i don t agree with that perspective . like i stated in my previous response , societal oppression is multifaceted and is based on several different factors not just class and the economy .","271619":"it does make sense , and i don t really agree with that perspective . there s much more to social inequality than just class systems .","271620":"do you mean native american food ? then yeah , from my understanding most of the food that native americans have eaten include corn , beans , sweet potatoes , tomatoes , avocados , etc etc . basically all natural food that comes directly from the earth .","271621":"i honestly have no idea i m not educated enough on the subject of romani people .","271622":"i can t really speak on what black men do or don t prioritize , considering i am not a black man , rofl .","271623":"i would rather lose all of my money i don t really have any valuables to begin with . i can make the money up week by week , but i cannot recover those pictures , and pictures are extremely meaningful to me .","271624":"i don t remember much about hilary s platform , tbh . that was years ago , lol .","271625":"i don t really think wealth has anything to do with it , it s more of how much of a platform they have .","271626":"i m currently listening to hello my old heart by the oh hellos https www . youtube . com watch ? v aobc vkmdec","271627":"any of the linkin park concerts i went to , tbh . the one that stands out in particular to me was when i went to projekt revolution in and saw linkin park and korn this was when i met linkin park as well . their projekt revolution lineup was also excellent linkin park , my chemical romance , taking back sunday , him , julien k , and mindless self indulgence were some of the few bands performing .","271628":"animals don t annoy me , including insects . i prefer animals over humans , rofl .","271629":"neither , haha . i just like listening to music , and when i m under the influence , i have a tendency to dance along .","271630":"tamriel .","271631":"i don t really remember most of my childhood , so i honestly can t say for certain .","271632":"honestly , probably sleep and play video games . lmaoo .","271633":"here s grandson s cover of linkin park s one step closer https www . youtube . com watch ? v h ywkaqxas","271634":"i don t normally sing along to my playlists , lol . the only times i sing out loud are when i m driving in the car .","271635":"cont . . . for the record i have also never guessed incorrectly and my margin of error for ec votes historically is . well , i ll keep this in mind for the upcoming days . one can only hope that you re correct .","271636":"it isn t really a song , but i was listening to this lord of the rings ambiance mix of the shire earlier today https youtu . be ubmbi dzc m","271637":"they would probably be confused because one of my more recent playlists is just a list of random songs i ve been into lately , which ranges from two feet , grandson , and linkin park to missio , korn , watsky , and nf . i also have ashnikko on the same playlist , as well as starset , matt maeson , blackbear , juice wrld , badflower , cardi b , and corpse .","271638":"i like psychological thrillers and fictional books with aspects of fantasy to them .","271639":"my first date with my ex was to the movies and then we went out to dinner afterwards . we saw x men origins wolverine .","271640":"i would probably still work part time just to keep myself occupied .","271641":"no , i ve never ridden on or driven a motorcycle before . it isn t something i m interested in much anyway .","271642":"i think it s admirable that they re using their platform for the greater good and using their voice to speak out against injustice . no doubt they get a lot of backlash from some of their fans , but if the celebrity athlete is speaking for the right reasons , then it s worth it .","271643":"i use snapchat regularly , but not really as a conversation app , if that makes sense . i just like sending snippets of my day to certain people on my friends list , and they ll send back snippets of their day . it s honestly mostly cat photos on my part , rofl .","271644":"i used to really love bands such as def leppard , the rolling stones , the beatles , motley crue , and guns n roses . however , i m not really into that type of music much anymore .","271645":"yeah , this defines a majority of my teenage years , and quite frankly , a lot of my adult years .","271646":"no , i honestly only have small fragments of memories from my childhood . ever since i started talking to my current therapist , these memories have been resurfacing very slowly .","271647":"a tiktok i was watching earlier .","271648":"i ve been extremely anxious nervous all day , tbh . i m also not doing myself any favors rn because i m watching election coverage on television at the moment , haha .","271649":"no , i never have before .","271650":"sure , i believe there can be multiple people out there for everyone . i don t believe in the concept of people having only one soul mate i think that we encounter multiple people in our lives who can enrich our lives in such a way that they touch our very souls , and this doesn t necessarily have to be in a romantic context .","271651":"mayonnaise , or celery . both are foods that i absolutely cannot stand , lol .","271652":"i m not quite sure what this phrase means .","271653":"that certainly does sound interesting , but i don t think i would ever do it myself .","271654":"yeah , that happens to me every once in a while too . it s just an involuntarily twitch possibly because of a muscle contraction in your body , or something similar . i wouldn t be very worried about it personally .","271655":"yeah , i remember reading plenty of books when i was younger that had spelling or grammatical mistakes .","271656":"waiting to use the computer because someone else in the house was on the phone .","271657":"there are plenty of holidays i don t celebrate because it isn t a tradition for me despite the fact that my family doesn t have many traditions to begin with , i . e . cultural holidays and celebrations that exist outside of my ethnicity or religion .","271658":"for me personally , yeah . however , it s much different for some other people who place a greater emphasis on sex .","271659":"i don t feel as if i have to prove anything to anyone besides possibly myself .","271660":"pretty much all of them , tbh . especially christmas and valentine s day .","271661":"old spice , lol .","271662":"i just looked him up , and you re right ! ! he s a professor at american university he predicted that biden will win . i can only hope his prediction is accurate .","271663":"not at all i m terrible at taking care of plants .","271664":"i voted for biden , but i have a feeling trump is going to win .","271665":"blerp .","271666":"it ultimately depends on the personality of the therapist . it may take a bit to find someone with whom you feel comfortable , but they usually ask you questions about your life and that allows you to open up to them more .","271667":"october , because it s autumnal weather and i like the ambience of halloween .","271668":"the election people voting today . i m incredibly nervous and anxious , but i m really happy to see so many of my friends posting on social media that they ve voted .","271669":"no , i m not afraid of people .","271670":"no . two of my exes are my closest friends , and i don t even have the number of my other ex .","271671":"yeah , i ve been coloring my hair since i was around years old .","271672":"yes ! ! i ve had fried green tea ice cream it was amazing .","271673":"personally , the idea of living in the past means that a person cannot move on from their past mistakes or regrets , and that way of thinking is holding them back from progressing further in their life .","271674":"chester bennington has always been a role model of mine ever since i was a teenager . linkin park s music was life saving during those formative years , and i credit them and chester for keeping me motivated to continue living and progressing when all i wanted to do was d e . even though chester passed away three years ago , i still consider him someone i hold in high regard , and i value all of the inspiration he and his music brought to me .","271675":"to experience privilege is to have certain rights and advantages for being in a specific group compared to people who are not part of that group . white privilege , for example , exists because white people have always been oppressors in society who have undermined people of other races simply because they re not white .","271676":"camping ! ! i went camping for the first time a few weeks ago it was so incredibly fun .","271677":"the only youtube channels i follow really are gaming channels , such as achievement hunter , seananners , chilledchaos , markiplier , and videogamedunkey .","271678":"i honestly don t know anything about that . however , it s something i still believe , and i m sure that the government of not only the us , but obviously other countries as well has the ability to keep things incredibly secretive if they choose to .","271679":"i believe that the government is aware of extraterrestrial life and is hiding that information from the public to prevent mass hysteria .","271680":"the stigma associated with mental illnesses , particularly stigmas that claim that people who have mental illness are dangerous , manipulative , and selfish .","271681":"no , i don t own any political tee shirts , actually .","271682":"twitch , i suppose ? i like watching twitch streams of my favorite gamers , and i also like discovering new people to watch as well .","271683":"i m not very confident that my privacy is being protected at all , but i don t post anything incriminating online , so it doesn t really bother me .","271684":"perhaps a week or so ? when i went on a cruise last february , i didn t have any service while we were on the ocean , so i couldn t access social media for the majority of the trip .","271685":"i would rather be loved . money always comes and goes , and while money is necessary to survival , so is love , companionship , and support .","271686":"i love my x files hoodie , but unfortunately i don t have a photo of it .","271687":"i ve never tried hibachi before , although i ve always wanted to have the experience of going to a hibachi restaurant . in general , i prefer steak with vegetables , although i do love calamari , shrimp , and salmon .","271688":"i don t drink soda , so no .","271689":"this was my last doodle from a week or so ago .","271690":"i ve been playing among us with friends the mobile version , at least . i ve also been playing halo with friends the past few weeks , and we just recruited another friend to play with us tonight .","271691":"no , i haven t binge watched a show in maybe a month or two . the last show i was watching was house md , and it s probably one of my favorite shows .","271692":"it doesn t matter to me , people can style their hair however they d like .","271693":"i like smoothies , and my favorite is probably strawberry banana or anything with peaches in it .","271694":"smoking weed basically puts me to sleep within an hour of me smoking .","271695":"i usually keep the thermostat to degrees fahrenheit .","271696":"hours in a row , probably . i honestly can t remember .","271697":"yeah , i have .","271698":"no , i m incredibly nervous trying not to even think about it , tbh .","271699":"it was really fun i never realize how competitive i am until i play halo , lmaoo . i m terrible at the game unless you give me a sniper rifle or a hammer , but regardless , it s always fun to have a big group of people for more options .","271700":"we did another one of those inner child scenarios , which actually brought up some memories that i haven t thought about in years , so we discussed those memories and how they correlate to how i think behave as an adult . it was a pretty productive session , and then i journaled for about minutes afterwards .","271701":"yeah , that s why myself two of my other friends who are non binary and four men were playing tonight , lol .","271702":"halo .","271703":"i worked , then had an intense therapy session . now i m blowing off some steam with video games .","271704":"get out of bed .","271705":"i ve repressed memories until around the age of or so . i m not entirely sure why , but i ve been working it through with a therapist .","271706":"no . i couldn t care any less about random free things , lol .","271707":"idk when i began using the internet specifically , but i do remember playing computer games from a young age less than . i started going on forums in my pre teen years .","271708":"so far , probably an . i ve met plenty of amazing people online over the years and have become close friends with them .","271709":"you can t lump all women into one single category of what they find attractive or not . some women do , some women don t . just do what makes you happy confident , and the rest will follow .","271710":"no , i like lighting candles for the warmth and aroma .","271711":"pretty nervous , tbh . i m nervous about the results of the election and how people will react to it .","271712":"definitely not , haha . i wouldn t be able to handle the publicity .","271713":"i don t remember my childhood .","271714":"not until early december , i m not the biggest fan of christmas .","271715":"peace out , my friend .","271716":"light candles and play video games .","271717":"i know baseball , but i don t play it . i m not interested in any sports .","271718":"biden harris .","271719":"if you re referring to the game of golf , then no . i don t play golf .","271720":"lmaooo . well , that s certainly a different way to approach the topic of sex .","271721":"there isn t a second lockdown where i live , but regardless , if it s suggested by medical professionals then it s probably a good idea .","271722":"i had scrambled eggs and toasted rye bread with butter .","271723":"i curse fairly often , yeah .","271724":"i have zero idea what that is .","271725":"if i told a secret , then it wouldn t be a secret

.","271731":"possibly . it isn t unheard of for people of color to have internalized racism . from what i know , using brown to refer to middle eastern or indian people among other backgrounds is incorrect these days , but i haven t read up on it in a while .","271732":"just the fact that you referred to middle eastern people as brown is a tad racist .","271733":"i don t know much about the history of judaism , but this sounds like a racist question .","271734":"of course , unless you re in a public place where your bodily stench will reek the room and cause awkwardness for everyone involved . lmaoo .","271735":"feminism is about advocating for the equality or equity of women with the acknowledgment that men have reigned superior over women ab sed them for centuries . feminism is about taking back the power of control from men and fighting for women s rights . your personal disdain for your mother wouldn t detract from you being a potential feminist . just because someone is related to you by blood doesn t mean their negative actions against you are excusable .","271736":"i don t really see how that correlates with feminism .","271737":"i m a small percentage of ashkenazi jewish .","271738":"i m not anti white , rofl . i just recognize that white people have always been in positions of power and they experience white privilege i m white , so i experience white privilege as well .","271739":"this this this . white people have always been the oppressors throughout history not the oppressed . therefore , if someone dislikes a white person , it isn t exactly a big deal and it can be discrimination , not racism . some people don t understand that racism is a system of oppression that has existed throughout the centuries .","271740":"you re assumptions are misguided , my friend . if any of my friends expressed a hatred or dislike for people whose race is different from theirs excluding a dislike of white people , tbh , because we re terrible then i wouldn t want to associate with them anymore .","271741":"not really , no . even though i dislike most country music , there are still a few songs i do like .","271742":"absolutely , on pretty much a daily basis .","271743":"nah , i m actually terrible at wrapping gifts .","271744":"you re understanding correctly . i m not looking for new friends .","271745":"tbh , i don t really care about why you re here .","271746":"this is an interesting notion and all , but i have no interest in discussing my personal life with strangers on the internet .","271747":"i don t discuss my family on the internet .","271748":"i ve been working various jobs since i was years old .","271749":"aw , thank you ! ! yes , she s an amazing stylist and colorist . she s been doing my hair for years now .","271750":"i m non binary which is also in my bio .","271751":"i graduated college in , yes .","271752":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","271753":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","271754":"my name is leigh i live in new york state .","271755":"thankfully , no . i ve also never shaved it myself because i m terrified of f cking it up , ahah .","271756":"no , i was a cashier at a drug store .","271757":"yes , exactly . i feel like i ve gotten that anon before because that questions seems awfully familiar . they re probably racist themselves just trying to make themselves feel better about it . smh .","271758":"not my whole head , no . i like it with half of it shaved .","271759":"if someone informed me that they thought lesser of people from another race , then that isn t something nobody knows about anymore , lol .","271760":"i feel like i ve been asked this multiple times before . regardless , yes that person is racist and i don t want to associate myself with racist people . it doesn t matter whether or not they treat them nicely , they re still being racist .","271761":"yes , retail was my first job experience .","271762":"my alcohol tolerance is very high .","271763":"there isn t much i find cringey , to be honest with you . the only thing i can think of are typical karens who make a huge deal and a scene at retail stores for a variety of silly reasons .","271764":"yeah , my handbag was stolen from me once when i was years old . it was found by a stranger in a random parking lot , and my prescription with my phone number was in my bag , so he called me and told me that he found it . when i got my bag back , all of my credit and debit cards were stolen , along with my social security card i know , i shouldn t have been carrying that with me . i ended up cancelling all of my cards , disputing the charges , getting new ones , and signing up for an identity theft prevention service .","271765":"i don t have a spirit animal because i m not native american .","271766":"my halloween was fun relaxing . my roommate and i had a campfire in the backyard while we drank and listened to music . afterwards , i went inside and got high and played video games with my friends until am .","271767":"fun fact i often sneeze when i m either in direct sunlight or look towards the sun .","271768":"not usually , no . to quote the show how i met your mother nothing good happens after am .","271769":"this is difficult for me to answer because i love both cats and dogs . if you had asked me this question a year ago , i would have most definitely said dogs . however , after living with cats for the past months , i ve grown a love and appreciation for cats as well .","271770":"yeah , i dropped off my absentee ballot the other day .","271771":"i have no clue , it was just the first thing to pop into my head . it s probably completely fictional , lol .","271772":"personally , i don t believe loyalty is all that rare it entirely depends upon who you keep around in your life . if someone isn t loyal to you or respectful of you , then there s really no reason to continue associating with them .","271773":"eh , i somewhat trust my instincts . at the same time , however , i tend to be a paranoid person so those instincts may not always be correct .","271774":"i don t really have any facts or stories it s more of a general feeling of being part of a culture or at least witnessing it , because i m neither greek nor cuban that is interesting and fun to me . for example , my ex s father would always play us classic cuban music from when he was growing up in cuba and his abuela would make us cuban food i . e . picadillo . as for my best friend s greek family , it was fun being part of her wedding because it was a typical greek wedding , and the ceremony itself was very interesting to watch . the reception afterwards was probably the most fun i ve ever had at a wedding too , everyone was dancing to greek music .","271775":"having the ability to rely upon yourself instead of other people , particularly in terms of daily living such as paying bills , working a job , owning or renting a place to live , taking care of yourself , etc .","271776":"whoops , i must have missed this one . yes , i would most definitely like to continue receiving your spam in the future ! !","271777":"anywhere up in the mountains .","271778":"no , my nails are disgusting rn . i m a chronic nail biter so they re very torn up .","271779":"i had the outline of a book planned out and it has a lot of biblical themes , actually . i don t want to post the synopsis on askfm though , because it s a work in progress that i may try to work on for nanowrimo .","271780":"no , i m not doing that .","271781":"teleportation bubbles . because it sucks having to commute to everywhere i need to go , lmaoo .","271782":"thank you ! ! it was made by allison tagged above . she has a redbubble where you can buy various items with her art on them .","271783":"art courtesy of shehitsback .","271784":"no , i m just wearing leggings and a hoodie .","271785":"hello i m doing all right , just listening to music and waiting for my coffee to brew .","271786":"i don t have a photo of it , nor do i even know where it is in the house it s in the basement somewhere , but idk where , but apparently my old roommate stole a doorknob from a haunted , defunct psychiatric hospital . we believe that was what has been causing the weird paranormal things to happen in our house , haha .","271787":"neither trump nor biden have alzheimer s disease , so i m not quite sure what this means .","271788":"the past few days have been fairly productive , so i m happy about them . i ve also been having a lot of fun playing halo at night with my friends . i got high last night and played a firefight with my friends , and one of my friends disguised himself as an elite and equipped himself with an energy sword and a sniper rifle , and his main mission was to k ll us instead of the enemies . apparently one of my other friends was worried about me because i was into the game and screaming my head off every time i was k lled , lmfaoo .","271789":"i don t know very much about them and i ve never visited a psychic before , but i ve heard conflicting opinions from my friends so i m unsure .","271790":"i had a really bizarre dream when i took a nap yesterday afternoon . i don t remember the details of the dream , but i do remember that my roommate and i were planning to have a small campfire in the backyard based on our irl plans from yesterday , and suddenly people showed up to the house . so i started panicking hard . the rest of the details are fuzzy , but the weirdest thing was that i knew that i was dreaming , but there was nothing i could do to stop it . it felt like my eyes were glued shut and i couldn t move . eventually , i did finally open my eyes and wake up entirely , and the entire situation was just weird .","271791":"i don t believe i m brave , but i also don t think i m a coward either .","271792":"i have there are certain parts of my life that i do regret , although i have been trying to accept those parts of my life and move on from them .","271793":"turn my string lights on , make sure all the other lights in the house are off , and turn off my television .","271794":"reese s peanut butter cups .","271795":"lol , i have entirely zero idea of where i ll be in one years time .","271796":"i don t care about what other people do .","271797":"sushi , lamb and rice platters , or burrito bowls .","271798":"halloween was last night .","271799":"i don t eat snacks before bed unless i m high or drunk , haha .","271800":"no , i like complete silence when i fall asleep . i also don t like wasting my phone battery or using electricity with my television if i m not even watching it .","271801":"no , i would never want to be on television .","271802":"my only talent is writing .","271803":"i hung out at home , but my roommate and i had a campfire and then i went inside to play video games with friends . it was a fun evening .","271804":"yeah , i do that a lot . i ll listen to a few songs on repeat for a week or so before moving on to something else .","271805":"i m not thicc , i m fat .","271806":"i love these types of shows , lol . some of my other favorites are paranormal lockdown and ghost hunters .","271807":"drinking watching ghost adventures .","271808":"my only plan was to have a campfire tonight , which will be happening soon .","271809":"yeah , non binary is technically under the trans umbrella . however , i ve always felt weird calling myself trans so i just say non binary .","271810":"i m non binary .","271811":"happy halloween , friends . pls stay safe tonight","271812":"listening to good music .","271813":"i m sure she s straight , so obviously not . lol .","271814":"it s amazing i nearly cried when i opened it . everything inside is so beautifully done .","271815":"no . they re just black leggings .","271816":"i know absolutely nothing about this issue .","271817":"it s the box set they ve been advertising for the th anniversary of hybrid theory . i preordered it back in august it arrived last week .","271818":"uh , no ? lmao . there are pants that don t have pockets , believe it or not .","271819":"yeah , i don t have a dvd player or a disc drive on my laptop , so i was initially upset last week because i thought i wouldn t be able to watch the dvds i got in the linkin park box set i bought . but , he told me they d work very well in my xbox console and it does ! ! i m so relieved .","271820":"i don t have pockets .","271821":"apparently dvds are better to play on consoles as opposed to blu rays according to my roommate . i always assumed the opposite .","271822":"gasoline .","271823":"probably , or i would at least try to educate them first .","271824":"idk if my beliefs are on par with that specifically , but i do agree that the economic system does need to be amended somehow .","271825":"i guess the best option is to not be human . lmao .","271826":"oh goodness . i had an inkling you were one of those anti mask people , lol . your freedom isn t being taken from you because of a mask . it s a safety measure to prevent the spread of covid .","271827":"admittedly the us government hasn t provided enough to care for people who lost their jobs , but the first time around , unemployment increased and there was a stimulus check to help families which should have been more money for people who did lose their job , but whatever . i stand by my original statement .","271828":"if covid gets bad again to the point where it s necessary , then yes . i trust the guidance of medical professionals .","271829":"i don t think i own anything embarrassing .","271830":"i honestly don t remember . i haven t done it because i don t really feel the need to do it , it isn t something that has ever

bed .","271837":"when people talk over me while i m in the middle of speaking .","271838":"i thought biden held himself up well when trump was attacking him , and i think it was disgusting in the first debate when trump was attacking biden s son for his addiction it s obvious that trump does not care about mental health or people with substance ab se issues , and the fact that he even attacked biden s family in the first place was horrible . i don t remember much about the second debate , unfortunately . but i voted for biden harris .","271839":"yes , i did .","271840":"no , i haven t done that since i was a teenager . i had a bucket of candy out front for the kids , but i went outside about minutes ago and there was candy everywhere , so i brought the bucket in for now . i m pretty sure it was the animals in the neighborhood .","271841":"i can never tell you anons apart , haha . either way , it does seem most of the time that the trump supporters are fervently obsessed with him , it s strange .","271842":"considering you re the one who brought this topic up in the first place , i wouldn t say that i m the one who is obsessed with trump here . rofl .","271843":"my laundry to finish washing then i ll throw in another load , put that load in the dryer , and when everything is done being washed , i m planning on showering then running the dishwasher . my life is obviously fascinating .","271844":"i have a few games , but i seldom play them . the ones i have installed right now are sims , stardew valley , and goat simulator . i use the keyboard mouse .","271845":"lol , this may be true . i wouldn t know i ve never visited other countries before outside of the us and the bahamas .","271846":"it wouldn t really matter where i go , there will always be people living everywhere with a sense of entitlement .","271847":"you may miss trump , but i certainly won t .","271848":"they believe they re superior to women or people of other genders , and or they believe that they deserve things that they haven t earned .","271849":"the circumstances surrounding working from home obviously aren t ideal regarding covid . i enjoy and am grateful for having a job throughout all of this chaos , but working from home is probably the best thing to come of this , for me personally .","271850":"terribly , but i think that goes for nearly everyone .","271851":"apparently i posted a picture on instagram today in of me with skull makeup .","271852":"whoops , lol . thank you","271853":"dark humor that pertains to things that i ve experience personally .","271854":"thank you for the follow","271855":"last march prior to my job telling us that we can work remotely due to covid , haha . my desk phone had a cord .","271856":"i never indicated money can do either of those things .","271857":"i can try to help , although i m by no means a pro , lol .","271858":"the cats scream at me on a daily basis for food even though they always have dry food out and i feed them at every afternoon , so they would probably demand treats , lmaoo .","271859":"yeah , i had fish for a short period of time around two years ago , and my ex has always has plenty of tanks , so i know a lot about them .","271860":"the closest pub .","271861":"in , i ll be years old . at that point in my life , hopefully i ll still be alive and possibly living with my partner with a lot of adopted animals .","271862":"lol , i guess . if you re attracted to someone on a physical level , that can only take you so far . it s why people fall in love with other people s personalities and who they are , and that is the basis of a lasting relationship .","271863":"i would rather live in the mountains . i ve always loved mountains , and i lived in the berkshire mountains for about a year when i was just starting college . since then , i ve always loved traveling to upstate new york and seeing the rolling landscapes .","271864":"no , i don t .","271865":"to a certain extent , yes . money is what we use to survive , unfortunately , and when we don t have that financial cushion to fall back on , things can become incredibly stressful and devastating . when we do have the money to support ourselves i . e . paying bills on time , affording groceries , etc , it leads to ease of mind and can induce happiness . of course , money isn t everything but it s pretty damn important .","271866":"a lot of the men i encounter have a grotesque sense of entitlement , which is gross .","271867":"hello do you have a question ?","271868":"i had no idea about that tbh . i heard that things in europe were getting worse again , but i wasn t aware of the second lockdown . i believe lockdowns work , as long as civilians abide by the rules associated with the lockdown .","271869":"we simply couldn t use our phones in class when i was in high school . most people had phones at that time , but they weren t smartphones because i went to high school in the mid to late s . there wasn t much we could do with them besides texting and calling .","271870":"i ve been slowly easing back into drinking hot coffee because it s been cold outside , and tbh the last thing i want to drink in the mornings these days are cold beverages which is what my coffee replacement was for the past few months .","271871":"those guys probably aren t as nice as they believe themselves to be .","271872":"i m actually in a decent mood rn , haha . i m off from work , it s been a productive morning , and i m drinking an excellent cup of coffee . there isn t a second lockdown where i live , i believe . things have been the same as they have been over the past months . i actually read an article that says that some movie theaters will be opening with capacity soon .","271873":"no , they can believe whatever they want to believe that doesn t mean their belief is factual , though . let them live in their own stupidity .","271874":"no , my anxiety has been acting up more than usual though .","271875":"when i was between the ages of and somewhere around there , i went through a destructive phase of my life where i did nothing but drink , do drugs , and just do terrible things to people .","271876":"lol . i wouldn t say i m an expert at that either . i don t have a particular area of expertise because i feel as if there s always more to learn .","271877":"yes , i ve met multiple people who have changed my life for better or for worse .","271878":"this is assuming i m going to reach an old age , haha .","271879":"can t be an expert at everything .","271880":"haha ! ! i actually quit smoking cigarettes , but i may take you up on that cocktail .","271881":"i understand askfm is addictive af . it s wild to me that i ve been using this site on off since .","271882":"i seldom cook , so i don t really have one . the only things i m good at cooking are breakfast meals , lol .","271883":"you too ! ! welcome back .","271884":"happy halloween ! ! i went outside to check on the candy bin it was

i work from home , so i was able to drop him off and come back without worrying about my own commute or anything . but it was still dark out raining hard , so of course i went into panic mode . gotta love it .","271904":"not necessarily . you have a degree , but it doesn t mean you automatically make more money than someone who doesn t have a degree . i have friends who make more than i do and they didn t graduate from college .","271905":"idk about other countries , but it is in the us .","271906":"because i took out student loans when i went to college .","271907":"one is part mainecoon ,

that way , tbh . however , considering i m not a person who is disabled in such a way , i don t really feel as if i should have a say in the matter if that makes sense . i m not the best person to consult on this .","271915":"i m not really well versed in cat behavior , but i would think that is common because the older cat may be territorial .","271916":"i wholeheartedly agree , lol . also we do it responsibly i m assuming you smoke responsibly too . it isn t anyone s business but our own , and we re old enough to know the consequences of our actions .","271917":"i don t really believe anyone is special , so idk if that answers your question or not .","271918":"most definitely ! !","271919":"probably , lmaoo . like guaranteed i m a functioning alcoholic to some extent , but to use the word edgy ? that s so .","271920":"i m years old i haven t even thought of the word edgy in years .","271921":"sorta but it was pretty explainable considering i was using a ouija board at the time .","271922":"unfortunately , very much so . i learned a lot between the ages of and , lmaoo .","271923":"nah , i ll be fine . i have water powerade in the fridge .","271924":"no , i had a few beers
