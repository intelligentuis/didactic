changed concerning many choices being made on any part . rationally hiding the truth is what people do their best because they are sometimes scared or frightened of so much concerning the relationship . i tend to know this about people . due to the many facts that i am a very intuitive soul .","212744":"getting my worries under control is the most i can do . and not by worrying about stuff that is beyond what i can work with or deal with . being able to understand the many sciences within people who tend to worry about things involving changes of or within their enviornment world . while understanding this dates further back to . when so many changes were on the rise concerning transitioning into a teenager and then a young adult in the late s and in . coupled with being a witch warlock and how my mom would tend to view this . the authenticity and being an outsider began to surface . when in later years the bullies and those who were looking for someone to hound or harass was those who tend to be an outsider . the truth always was something to worry about concerning the traditional values my mom had carried about this back then . the real confusion is that witches and warlocks that appeared on television and within the movies had been what people believed in as freaks and something or other . which is far from the truth cocerning this matter or fact . having a mighty strong intuition and sense that goes beyond human notion . being intuitive and with intuition for so many things within life itself concerning events where facts are involved . there is a time

county . just yesterday i have been getting a real understanding that people were attempting to push my co workers over the edge . i understand the frustration thats going on . but there is no way to make some product or merchandise appear . unless you can really call up the corners and whip up a few spells . my intuition says that those people need to cool off and take a chill pill . and have
