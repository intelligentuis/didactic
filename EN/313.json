cute , but it seemed very clique y everyone there was friends with the bartenders and the beer was just all right . i took home a growler of pumpkin ale , though . and no , i definitely did not get home early , lmaoo . my original intention was to be home by like pm , but we ended up leaving the bar at am . needless to say , i m exhausted .","289527":"no , definitely not . i dealt with that a lot growing up from my parents , so i taught myself not to behave in such a way because i didn t want to treat other people the same way my parents treated me .","289528":"i honestly agree with you . i don t like traveling into the city because the crowds make me completely anxious . i m usually a nervous wreck when i m traveling walking , bus , subway , etc etc but once i m at my destination , then i m okay .","289529":"it isn t that many in the grand scheme of things , and a lot of my friends have even more tattoos than i do . i eventually want to get my entire body covered , but unfortunately that costs a lot of money .","289530":"i don t have any upcoming , concrete plans for the week ahead . the only things i know i have to do are go to work , clean the house , perhaps do some light grocery shopping , and go to my therapy appointment .","289531":"i apologize first if i did something wrong , yes . i m honestly quite an apologetic person and sometimes i apologize for things that aren t necessarily my fault , which is something i m trying to work on to better myself .","289532":"i absolutely adore tattoos i think they re a beautiful form of art and self expression . i have seven tattoos and i m planning two more that i eventually want to get .","289533":"it honestly depends on the individual i can t say that i m universally likeable or anything because everyone is going to have a different opinion of me .","289534":"i prefer to shower in the evenings . it s an ideal way for me to wind down and relax after a long day , and i like the feeling of crawling under the covers of my bed freshly clean and smelling nice .","289535":"no , i don t even want my friends and family to purchase me gifts for my birthday .","289536":"thanks for the heads up ! ! it doesn t bother me , it s honestly quite entertaining , lmaoo .","289537":"yet you re still here talking to me , lol . if you dislike me so much , then you re not being forced to interact with me .","289538":"you re the one on my profile . . . if you re unhappy with the words i say , you have the freedom to leave .","289539":"there s a pale filter on it from my phone s camera , but that s all i did to it .","289540":"there s no reason to be salty , my friend . i m just informing you of askfm s standards and guidelines regarding verification .","289541":"yeah , but you have to understand that askfm staff don t know that especially considering you re posting photos of celebrities on your profile who aren t you . there s no way to objectively tell that you re real .","289542":"no , it doesn t . all i had to prove to askfm was that i was real , i . e . showing them a slip of paper with my username showing my face alongside that paper .","289543":"uh , you don t even have photos of yourself on your profile . lmaoo .","289544":"that doesn t mean that i m a celebrity . it just means that my account isn t a fake account .","289545":"th birthday eve . ?","289546":"uh , no ? lmaoo .","289547":"my birthday isn t until tomorrow , but thank you regardless ! !","289548":"aw , this is the sweetest message ever . thank you so much ! ! i hope you have a fantastic night day .","289549":"i honestly can t remember . i don t have much time for self care these days , so i enjoy partaking in the things i enjoy when i have the opportunity to do so . i feel as if i don t necessarily need to recharge by distancing myself from the things i like .","289550":"i would like to be remembered for my creativity and compassionate nature , which i channel through my writing and my advocacy for mental health awareness . i want to let others know that they re not alone in their struggles .","289551":"you can call me leigh . it isn t very difficult to comprehend .","289552":"i ve been in mental health treatment for almost three years . i see a counselor and a psychiatrist .","289553":"you may have good intentions , but that doesn t change the fact that i m uncomfortable with those nicknames . for future reference , i m not comfortable with feminine descriptions .","289554":"don t call me ma am either , lmaoo . my name is on my profile there s no reason you can t call me by my actual name .","289555":"hello , please don t call me honey . i m not comfortable with that nickname and you don t even know who i am . however , i m doing fine . i m slowly recovering from my hangover lol and i m finishing up my freelance work this morning . i just made a big pot of coffee so i m hoping that makes me feel better .","289556":"last year and the year prior to that , my boyfriend surprised me with tickets to a wine tasting event at a local aquarium . both years were so much fun .","289557":"from the little bit i know of it , it seems to center on the idea that capitalism results in economic poverty and suffering which is something i agree with . it sounds like a good political ideology in theory , but when put into practice , it doesn t appear that it works out very well .","289558":"yes , although my lazy days are usually saturdays , lol . however , this past weekend was a bit different i did all of my chores and errands yesterday so that i could have a relaxing day today , since i knew i was going to be feeling like sh t when i woke up this morning lol .","289559":"the biggest positive change i ve made recently was moving out of my parents house into a house that i m currently renting with two roommates . my parents house was a very toxic environment and deteriorated my mental health , and it was very difficult for me to pull myself out of depressive states in that sort of environment . since moving out and establishing my own life and routine , i ve been much happier , more content with myself , more productive , and almost looking forward to waking up in the morning .","289560":"depression can t really be cured , but you can most definitely go into remission for depression . the best way to overcome depression and or cope with your illness in a healthy manner is to seek out professional treatment , i . e . psychiatry or therapy . however , everyone who struggles with depression is different so there are different modalities of treatment tailored to everyone s unique situation .","289561":"depends on the reason why they re in debt . if someone has a gambling addiction and is in debt because of it , then i would be more hesitant to date them because that means that they re not careful or responsible with their money .","289562":"i believe you need to have at least , followers and contribute to the site on a regular basis i . e . answering and asking questions routinely . i m not sure what other criteria there is , though .","289563":"i honestly don t remember . i don t watch sports in general , so the last football game i watched was probably last year s superbowl .","289564":"i much prefer to be alone , and if i m around people like my friends , then i prefer small groups . i value my alone time greatly and i become anxious when there are too many people around me .","289565":"of course ! ! i gave everyone candy who came to the door . there were only maybe groups of kids , though .","289566":"hello i m fine , albeit a bit hungover . i ended up celebrating my birthday early last night and stayed out until am instead of pm like i originally expected . right now , i m listening to music and about to continue working on some freelance projects .","289567":"yes , it s sunny , windy , and cold out rn . i think it s supposed to rain later , though .","289568":"i m not jealous , no . like i said , i don t have an interest in the fashion show or just fashion in general .","289569":"no , i m not interested in the victoria s secret show or anything remotely related to fashion , lol .","289570":"aw , thank you ! ! i m hoping not to stay out too late , since i have a doctor s appointment tomorrow morning . i m thinking about leaving the brewery around pm or so , that way i can get decent sleep tonight .","289571":"hi friends ask me some questions while i wait for my friend to pick me up .","289572":"on halloween , lol . a little girl was knocking on the screen door because she couldn t reach the doorbell .","289573":"good timing just finished my makeup .","289574":"i don t know if i ll be able to see him on my actual birthday , but regardless , i m not overly concerned . i don t expect gifts from anyone . i m past the point where gifts matter to me .","289575":"i don t really have plans except going out this afternoon with a close friend . we re going to a local brewery .","289576":"i m turning years old .","289577":"yes , you re correct . my birthday is on monday . however , i m celebrating it with one of my friends today since i won t be able to see her next week at all .","289578":"it isn t my birthday yet , lol . but thank you ! !","289579":"thanks , i appreciate it","289580":"i m doing well . i m finishing up some laundry , as well as my freelance work that i took on for the weekend . afterwards , i m going to get ready to go out for the afternoon .","289581":"no , not usually . i don t surround myself with people who are ungrateful .","289582":"i don t have a reason as to why you should follow me . that s something you can only decide for yourself .","289583":"yeah , sometimes it does bother me . i don t usually say anything , though , because i don t really want to cause a scene .","289584":"no , why would that be weird ?","289585":"i don t give out my personal instagram account because it s private . however , my writing account is mortem . musings ! !","289586":"i can t even fathom being a parent or having children rn .","289587":"it s a bit of a mess rn , but here","289588":"i suppose the most obvious answer would be the ab se i endured for most of my life . it completely re arranged my methods of thinking and my personality , it re wired connections in my brain , and it kick started my struggle with mental illness . childhood development is crucial to how someone behaves as an adult , and because i was overcome with ab se at such an early age , it s affected every aspect of my adult life .","289589":"in current times , yes . i can t say the same for myself in the past , though . prior to getting treatment for my mental health , my mental illnesses were at an all time peak coupled with a significant amount of stress i was enduring earlier in my life . i was obsessive and insecure , and i crossed boundaries that i shouldn t have crossed .","289590":"i think it really depends on the circumstance , but tbh , i can t really remember a time i was ever crushed by any sort of rejection .","289591":"i m doing well . it s not even noon i already completed half of my freelance work , drank cups of coffee , made and ate breakfast , and did two loads of laundry .","289592":"a fresh pot of coffee in the morning .","289593":"terrible drivers on the road i . e . , not using their signal , driving recklessly , cutting people off , etc etc . people who speak over me while i m in the middle of speaking , or similarly , people who barge into a conversation . people who claim to understand things but then their actions or words prove just the opposite . accidentally dropping or spilling my coffee in the morning . people who dismiss mental health problems or claim people are crazy and cannot be helped .","289594":"nowhere on my page would it ever hint that i was a fan of donald trump , lmaoo .","289595":"the most important thing in being a good friend is to simply be honest with your friend and establish open communication with them . also , to be willing to support them in their endeavors while also knowing when to call them out if they re being toxic or problematic .","289596":"i think it s a healthy combination of both , tbh granted in healthy relationships . when you meet the right person and the timing is right , it s easy to fall in love . everything seems to fall into place . but if you meet someone and the timing isn t right , for whatever reason , then the interactions may leave you feeling lonely or confused .","289597":"the funniest best video i ve seen in a while achievement hunter the musical . https www . youtube . com watch ? v xrgqfptvdfs","289598":"probably a lot , lmaoo . i m on my computer for the majority of the morning in light of the freelance work i complete for my job . it usually takes me quite a few hours because i switch between working then perusing social media .","289599":"no , i m not a fan of most sports and i don t watch sports in my spare time .","289600":"hm , interesting . i wish you luck in your endeavors .","289601":"hello do you have a question ?","289602":"yeah , i actually have two instagram accounts one is personal , and the other is for my writing . honestly , i think it s stupid that they re proposing to get rid of likes . it s essentially the reason why instagram is so popular they re going to lose a lot of people if they take likes away . i certainly wouldn t be using it as often , especially in terms of my writing account .","289603":"i have zero plans for next saturday , lol . like i stated in earlier answers , saturdays are my days for relaxation i seldom leave the house . it will probably just be a routine saturday for me , filled with freelance work and laundry and drinking lots of coffee .","289604":"i was very sheltered in my youth and was never introduced to them . as an adult , i simply never had the desire to watch them . it didn t seem like something that would catch my interest .","289605":"saturdays are mainly my days of relaxation catching up on my freelance work and laundry . i like waking up early in the morning to get everything done .","289606":"fun fact about leigh i ve legit never seen a single star wars movie .","289607":"i don t really do many chores on saturdays , i usually reserve them for sunday mornings . however , i absolutely hate cleaning the bathroom .","289608":"tbh , i generally don t like leaving the house at all on saturdays lol . i do my errands and grocery shopping on sundays .","289609":"bulbasaur ! ! and then for pokemon yellow , obviously pikachu .","289610":"i go through caffeine withdrawals if i don t drink any coffee by like noon or pm .","289611":"i remember going to a restaurant with my boyfriend and his family for his birthday one year , and the menu was unexpectedly expensive af . they had surf turf for a plate . i didn t order the surf turf i honestly don t remember what i did order , but it was ridiculous .","289612":"yeah , i was really into pokemon back in the day when pokemon red , blue , and yellow came out for the game boy .","289613":"coffee , hands down . i drink at least cups every day especially on the weekends .","289614":"super mario brothers has always been very difficult for me , and it s probably the game i get most frustrated with , lmaoo . i haven t played it in years except for the mario world games that were on the wii a few years ago those also pissed me off completely .","289615":"i believe the most important thing i learned was the value of friendship . my teenage years were quite tumultuous and i used the support of my best friend to give me the strength to move forward . i also came across some ex friends who were very toxic and unhealthy for me , and i learned to be wary of other people s motives .","289616":"the lord of the rings , particularly in the shire and rivendell . i don t know whether i would be a hobbit or an elf , but i would absolutely have a deep appreciation for literature and nature , and spend my time immersed in them .","289617":"a hippogriff , of course .","289618":"shadows everywhere and bugs crawling on the curtains behind my computer .","289619":"my moods have been pretty even lately , of which i m quite thankful . however , i do still have periods where i get into depressive mindsets i haven t been taking my medication routinely , unfortunately but they usually dissipate within the same day .","289620":"the longest i ve ever stayed awake was around hours , from what i remember . it was during high school and i was experiencing somewhat of a manic phase , so i didn t feel the need to sleep . however , i ended up having visual hallucinations after a while and crashed .","289621":"i don t have anything to vent about tbh . i ve been pretty content and level headed these days . i m going to a brewery with a close friend today to celebrate my birthday , so i m excited for that .","289622":"when i was younger , i used to love watching gilligan s island and happy days . i also liked the munsters , full house , and frasier .","289623":"i believe the purpose of life is to give your life its own sense of purpose . everyone will have a different purpose , a different reason to live and keep going forward . it s up to us to figure out what that specific purpose is while also finding our passions in life .","289624":"i cook fairly often with my roommate these days . i never used to know how to cook but he s been teaching me basic meals , haha . even though breakfast foods are super easy , i love making eggs , bacon and sausages the most in the morning .","289625":"i haven t done much research on those topics , so while i do know that the united states have performed acts of terrorism on other foreign countries , it isn t something i have strong opinions over .","289626":"hello do you have a question ?","289627":"kitty was curled up in bed with me last night .","289628":"a lot of my opinions are things that i m very passionate about , such as gay and trans rights , mental health awareness , women s rights , etc etc .","289629":"lately i ve been listening to a lot of classical composers . musicians like mozart , beethoven , chopin , debussy , and tchaikovsky .","289630":"i haven t had a christmas list since i was a pre teen , haha . i don t ask for anything for christmas , so most of the time my family gives me money gift cards , cash , etc etc . to treat myself , i do want to get my hair colored cut which i m doing before thanksgiving . i also want to make an appointment to get a new tattoo .","289631":"fragile may break easily .","289632":"neither , honestly . i don t remember my childhood and my teenage years were terrible , and i would much rather remain an adult .","289633":"considering i don t know you you probably mean nothing to me , i have no problem with that .","289634":"? ? ? obviously not . if you don t have a legitimate question , you can kindly leave .","289635":"no , i don t .","289636":"hello do you have a question ?","289637":"i ve never critically read the terms agreements on things like social media or apps before , no .","289638":"tbh , i see no benefits . i believe i m a difficult person to really put up with at times .","289639":"yeah , amazon is the first place i go to when i need to shop for something .","289640":"i ve always been intrigued by and have felt connected to wolves .","289641":"i m currently in love with someone .","289642":"i usually sit on chairs with my right leg crossed underneath my left leg .","289643":"yeah , i believe so . there have been countless incidents of people stalking others through the internet social media ab se i . e . death threats and such .","289644":"it s a compilation of classical music songs . https youtu . be miyzp rctvu","289645":"i didn t say i was the only one who did the dishes , lmaoo . i did them last night .","289646":"sure , why not ? people can eat burgers however they want .","289647":"i m not really a history buff . i d rather go somewhere with beaches or mountains .","289648":"nah , i ve never had a desire to go to philadelphia .","289649":"thanks , i appreciate it .","289650":"no , i don t .","289651":"i have a loaf as a friend rn .","289652":"i don t know enough about political systems to really answer this question . perhaps if you asked me this ten years ago , i could give a more thorough answer , lol .","289653":"that s correct , yes . it may have been founded with democracy in mind , but as far as i m concerned , it isn t a democracy anymore .","289654":"having support from friends and or family is a great means by which to overcome self doubt . i mean , self doubt can be inevitable for some people but it s certainly validating when you have trusted people around you who are rooting for you and confirming that you re doing well .","289655":"no . when it comes to presidential elections , the popular vote doesn t matter . and as far as politics are concerned , most politicians just say what they believe civilians want to hear and once they re in office , they either change their views or put forth their own agenda , or both .","289656":"yes and no , tbh . yes in the sense that i believe technology and medicine are advancing greatly , but no in the sense that the governments of the world only have their best interests at heart and are dismissing important issues like civil rights and climate change , which affects everyone .","289657":"i mean , i have my location on my phone on at all times for google maps whatnot , so evidently i m not too concerned with information of my whereabouts being broadcasted to big corporations like google . if someone wants to harm me , then so be it . they re going to find out this information one way or another anyway regardless of data companies efforts to track me if they wanted to hurt me so badly . people have done it in the past without technology , they can easily do it again .","289658":"it isn t concerning to me , no . if companies are constructing a profile of me based on what i spend my money on and which websites i visit , then all they re going to learn is that i enjoy eating food , drinking alcohol and coffee , paying necessary bills , and perusing social media .","289659":"again i don t really care , lol . companies can construct whatever profile they want of me , it doesn t actually determine who i am or how i spend my time in my life .","289660":"honestly , it s been years since i went a full day without using my phone . the last time i remember doing so , i was on vacation and decided to disconnect entirely for the day . it was a freeing feeling , but it also made me anxious knowing that a family member could potentially be trying to get in contact with me in case of an emergency .","289661":"it doesn t really concern me greatly . it s not as if i m doing anything or spending money illegally .","289662":"oh , i wouldn t mind that either . i usually pay for things with my credit debit cards . i seldom carry actual cash on me .","289663":"aw , thank you ! !","289664":"i don t really know if that s do able in today s age , but i wouldn t mind it . we would just go back to bargaining and trading .","289665":"no , i have no interest in that . i d rather just use cash or credit .","289666":"acceptance of people who struggle with mental illness . there have been advancements somewhat in recent years regarding awareness of mental health and its importance , but there is still so much taboo and stigma surrounding mental illness especially complex disorders , like personality disorders , schizophrenia , dissociative disorders , eating disorders , etc etc . i wish it was more popular for people to actually read into the different mental health diagnoses and take the proper steps to support their friends and family who struggle with those issues .","289667":"i m fairly easy going when it comes to romance , and i believe romance is more of a feeling than it is a place or an event . as long as you re emotionally intimate with someone , even the smallest instances can be romantic . i would be more than happy with an evening with my significant other where we have a candlelit dinner together and talk about everything going on in our lives .","289668":"i ve gone horseback riding in the catskill mountains , i suppose . i can t really think of anything else that would be considered adventurous .","289669":"the coworker to whom i m the closest is actually someone i was very wary of in the beginning , lmaoo . i honestly thought she was a b tch and was very intimidating until we started talking regularly . now i feel comfortable telling her anything and we re super close .","289670":"i m proud of my boyfriend close friends for overcoming significant hardship in their lives and emerging from the other side as beautiful , hard working human beings . i don t ever really talk about it enough , and really i should tell them that i m proud of them more often .","289671":"i ve never really had a genuine answer to this question because i believe that , despite the injustices in today s times , common era is much more accepting than it has ever been in the past . it would be a disservice to me and people similar to me if we lived in a previous time period because things such as being gay , trans , mentally ill , etc etc . , were considered taboo and or a sin .","289672":"my friends and i used to drive around drunk high and steal things from people s properties , including government property traffic cones , barrels , street posts , etc etc . not saying that i condone those things because i definitely regret doing them , though .","289673":"depending on the type of company it is , yes . office environments are largely places for solitary working with instances of collaboration , but other environments such as retail or food service do require a lot of collaboration in order for the dynamic to work .","289674":"well , i do value money greatly these days the bills can t pay themselves . i don t believe that money or greed in general has really altered or defined the rest of my views , though .","289675":"only my boyfriend s mouth , lol .","289676":"skinny love by birdy originally by bon iver . https www . youtube . com watch ? v anzcdt eidg","289677":"this basically defines any sort of senior upper management in a nutshell , tbh .","289678":"aw , thank you","289679":"i don t know if it would have necessarily saved my life , but i made a mistake which led me to cancel plans with my friend one night . we were supposed to go to a local bar together , but neither of us ended up going . that same night , there was a giant fight at the bar and some people got hurt , the police were called , etc etc . had we been there , we would have been part of that crowd and would have possibly been hurt too .","289680":"gluttony . greed . malice . anger . selfishness . ignorance .","289681":"november th next monday .","289682":"there are a lot of components that go into a long term relationship communication , trust , a little bit of luck , having the ability to be silly with one another , viewing your partner as your best friend , emotional chemistry , etc etc . personally speaking , we essentially grew up together between the ages of to now and we ve known each other since we were . we ve endured heartache together . loss together . grief together . addiction together . celebrations together . marriages together . all of the facets of growing into one s own and maturing were spent with one another , and for some people it doesn t work out , but by luck it worked out for us . every relationship is different , though . what works for one couple may not work for another . you just have to listen to your partner , your intuitions , and your own heart and go from there . it s difficult at times , and love definitely is not enough to continue moving forward .","289683":"sneezed farted at the same time while i was at work , lmaoo . granted it was silent , but i was still mortified . i literally got up and left the office because i was so terrified and anxious that someone had noticed , lmaoo .","289684":"not in the least , lol . i m not supportive of the united states government or what this country stands for , and i m aware that most other countries view america as a joke at this point .","289685":"my greatest passion is perhaps helping other people , being relateable to other people so that they don t feel as isolated . i channel this passion through advocacy and writing poetry and prose . it helps give purpose in my life and convinces me that there might be a reason for me to be alive .","289686":"tbh , i ve always felt really weird about sharing or lending my bed with others besides my significant other . i m a private person for the most part , and i feel like it s a bit intrusive on my privacy for a person to be sleeping in my bed i can t really explain it , it s weird . however , i would be more than happy to make them comfortable on the couch or on one of the chairs in the living room that lean all the way back with a foot rest . there are a lot of cozy pillows and blankets in the house .","289687":"i heard a particular song while driving home from work this evening , and it caught my attention because of how raw and relateable the lyrics were . it made me somewhat emotional in that it tugged at my heart , but it didn t make me tear up or cry or anything .","289688":"i ve never had actual acne before , but i do get the occasional pimple here and there . lately , i ve been breaking out on my cheeks . which is annoying , because i have a skin picking problem so i keep finding myself picking at them and causing myself to bleed .","289689":"not generally , no . i m not emotionally attached to most people so saying goodbye to them isn t difficult for me .","289690":"hello i m doing well , i m quite relaxed rn . i came home to empanadas for dinner , and then i drank a cup of coffee with my roommate before he had to go to work . after he left , i took a shower and did the dishes . now i m sitting down with a glass of wine and catching up on my questions .","289691":"i ll be turning years old in five years time . honestly , i have no idea where i will be . i can t even fathom my life a month from now , let alone five years from now . i can only hope that i m living my life to the best that i m able to do so while making healthier choices for myself .","289692":"just berate stupid people on the internet via forums message boards .","289693":"no , i avoid going to stores and shops on black friday because i cannot handle the crowds of people . i d rather take advantage of cyber monday deals .","289694":"i don t really see a reason why you re not old if you re in your s or anything . i m around people who are in their s and s every day , and there s nothing wrong with being those ages .","289695":"yeah , i went to a spa once in my life for my best friend s bachelorette party . i didn t enjoy it at all .","289696":"yes , that s considered verbal ab se and emotional ab se too . no one deserves to be in such a relationship and if you have a way out , you should try to escape . you deserve so much better than to be belittled and called names by someone who is supposed to love and support you . it doesn t matter much if kids are involved . it s much healthier for children to be around happy parents as opposed to two parents who are in an unhappy relationship .","289697":"i m not physically active at the moment meaning i haven t been exercising . however , i am an all around active person , in terms of going to work , running errands , seeing friends and family , etc etc .","289698":"oof , it s been a while . i suppose it was during the summer when my boyfriend i went to a restaurant for dinner and drinks , if that counts lol .","289699":"no ? lmaoo .","289700":"a beer , a big glass of wine , and a vodka soda . on three separate occasions , mind you . lol .","289701":"it isn t something i m comfortable describing on askfm .","289702":"lmao , yes . it happened years ago though .","289703":"no . i grew out of the whole trolling stage when i was like years old , lol .","289704":"i cared very much at the time , yeah . i wanted to be true to myself but it was also very isolating .","289705":"haha , no . i was very much an outcast in middle school high school

cheddar chips .","289709":"the scottish highlands look beautiful .","289710":"i ve been in a relationship for years .","289711":"i m definitely the wrong person to ask about dating sites , lmaoo . i haven t been on a first date in over years .","289712":"just be yourself and the right person will come along . perhaps join some dating sites apps .","289713":"it s pm where i live , but hello . do you have a question ?","289714":"i only have knowledge of social security disability law .","289715":"my best friend and i used to spend significant time together , but we ve only seen each other a handful of times since she moved out of state almost a year ago .","289716":"when it comes to other people , i m quite flexible in terms of punctuality . however , when it comes to my own self expectations , i stick to a very strict schedule .","289717":"i was terrified this morning when i got into a fender bender , smh . another driver somehow didn t see my car , and tried to change lanes

stability adopt a few dogs with my partner publish books , whether they re books of poetry or a novel and progress further in my career .","289719":"intelligence , and a sense of personality overall , is much more important than physical beauty . you cannot build any sort of relationship off of physical attraction alone .","289720":"i ve always wanted to do a cross country road trip . no real obligations or responsibilities , just taking each day as it comes and experiencing everything as the opportunities arise .","289721":"i went to montauk , new york , a few years ago if that counts it s only two hours or so from me . i went there on vacation for a weekend , and it was beautiful .","289722":"for the most part , yes . it s difficult to go through life in general without having a sense of humor or the ability to laugh at yourself .","289723":"people should be allowed the freedom to love whoever they love , regardless of their gender or sexual orientation .","289724":"any of my favorite movies i can t honestly choose which one is the best , haha . they re all fantastic in different ways . last night , i started watching interview with the vampire and remembered why i love that movie so much .","289725":"not as an adult , no . when i was in high school , however , i was a contributing editor of the school s literary magazine mostly poetry , but a few prose pieces too .","289726":"the thoughts and opinions of complete strangers . when you re younger around teenage years , most people are so preoccupied with how others perceive them . but as you grow older , you realize that those opinions truly do not matter at all , and that you should always strive to be the best version of yourself while surrounding yourself with people whom you trust .","289727":"i only really watch rooster teeth , let s play , achievement hunter , and sometimes markiplier all gaming channels . i also listen to ambient music channels right now , i m listening to a skyrim ambient

the prospect of being in front of a crowd of people and or being televised is terrifying .","289729":"no , i don t believe that i have dyslexia .","289730":"sometimes , haha . most of the time , it s more of a frantic scramble to get out of bed , get ready , and leave the house .","289731":"no , i ve never had a reason to lie about my age .","289732":"yes , i am actually quite fond of telling people no and turning them down .","289733":"i don t recall any cartoons from when i was a young child , but i do remember watching dragonball z , thundercats , and rocket power when i was a pre teen teenager .","289734":"i usually get a medium popcorn with extra butter a small cherry coke .","289735":"i listen to most genres of music , it just depends on my mood . my favorite genres lately have been hip hop , alternative rock , and classical music i . e . movie , television , and video game soundtracks .","289736":"i ve always looked a bit young for my age , but i don t necessarily believe that i have a baby face .","289737":"aw , thank you i m planning on going to a brewery on saturday afternoon to celebrate my birthday . then i have a doctor s appointment on sunday

as well . when your partner puts effort into maintaining connections with your own friends and family . having the ability to laugh and be silly with your partner without fear of judgment . your partner can acknowledge that they re wrong or misguided in a situation instead of being overly defensive .","289742":"i ve never really been picky when it comes to going on dates . i just like spending time with the person , listening to music together , talking about anything that comes to mind , and getting to know them on an intimate level .","289743":"drinking at least eight glasses of

.","289745":"people should have the freedom to modify their body however they want . if someone wants implants whether it s breast implants or anything else , then they should be allowed to do so

interested to look into that sort of thing .","289806":"i believe horses are beautiful creatures .","289807":"i don t believe it s necessarily rude , but depending on your tone , it could be interpreted as insensitive . if your friend is in an ab sive relationship , it s not that simple to just break up with their partner . in addition , it s quite obvious that she s in a very rough spot right now perhaps you should have prefaced your statement with i m sorry you re going through this , but here are my honest thoughts on the matter .","289808":"talking to my boyfriend always brightens my day regardless of how sh tty of a day it has been . he s very good at comforting me and inspiring me to look forward to another day , and he notes that every day is a new beginning .","289809":"they re comfortable with the idea because it works best for their situation , and they simply want to be in that situation . not everyone has to work or earn money , and if a family can thrive off of one income , then there s really no real reason why both partners have to work .","289810":"please don t call me darling , i don t appreciate it . nevertheless , i m doing well . i feel quite productive today i finished up my freelance work , i did three loads of laundry , i went grocery shopping , and i cleaned a little bit .","289811":"most of the time , i walk away from them and

.","289818":"yikes , that s a big red flag for manipulation . you either need to talk to them about their behavior so that they realize that what they re doing is wrong , or distance yourself from them . even though they helped you immensely , you re not obligated to do them favors and for them to hold it over your head is very wrong .","289819":"well yeah , that s what i meant when i said there was a chance for disappointment . i don t believe it can happen all the time , but there is definitely a chance that your expectations will be shattered .","289820":"yeah , ideally you should be considerate of other people and perhaps put your things on the ground in front of you instead of on the seats next to you .","289821":"i ve never heard of that phrase before . i don t see anything

something that happens every year . i never ask for anything .","289823":"i have similar aspirations , actually . i ve always wanted to go to the airport and take the first flight out to a random destination . it doesn t matter if it s california or alaska or in the middle of wisconsin , or even a foreign country . i find the spontaneity of the idea to be appealing and the idea of just going with the flow .","289824":"yes , this actually happened between me and my best friend . we were friends for a small bit of time , but then we had a period where we did not talk at all for perhaps two years . eventually , we reconnected and we ve been best friends ever since .","289825":"you re probably better off asking an hvac technician .","289826":"i would likely write about my main interests , which are mental health awareness , video games , writing literature , true crime , music , and possibly politics even though i ve been out of the game for a while .","289827":"asexuality means you don t experience attraction toward others . it s different from being a virgin single because those qualities aren t a sexual orientation and you can still experience attraction even if you ve never had sex before .","289828":"if i remember correctly , i believe it was a child called it by david peltzer .","289829":"i don t sing in the shower , lol . i used to listen to music in the shower , though .","289830":"yes , i have one brother technically half brother .","289831":"my boyfriend s love and support . my close friends love and support . coffee . cute animals . my improving mental health and the privilege i ve experienced in being able to access and afford mental health care .","289832":"does a vampire count ? lol . i ve always found the concept of vampires to be interesting . obviously i don t believe they actually exist , but i ve been intrigued by them for many years and some of my favorite books are the vampire chronicles by anne rice .","289833":"neither . i don t drink milk .","289834":"i haven t seen either movie , so i don t have a specific choice . however , i really do want to see the joker .","289835":"i don t believe i ve ever had food poisoning , no .","289836":"no , i don t read any magazines . i haven t read a magazine since i was a pre teen .","289837":"tbh , i know of the spice girls but i don t really know what their names are . i wasn t interested in music during the spice girls boy band era .","289838":"i don t really have any strong feelings towards sexy accents , tbh . i don t personally find any accents to be sexy , but i m aware that other people do british accents i think are a big one .","289839":"no , i haven t played the guitar since i was a teenager .","289840":"i m finishing up the work i started yesterday . my other plans for the day include grocery shopping , cleaning , and laundry .","289841":"thanks for the follow","289842":"good morning i m doing well . i just woke up about an hour ago , so now i m checking my email and i m going to continue working soon .","289843":"i don t really see the purpose in sending users random greetings unless they have a question to follow that greeting . this is askfm , after all .","289844":"i prefer to go darker more neutral during the winter months .","289845":"i like some classical music , yes . i don t know if it s considered classical or not , but i listen to a lot of movie , television and video game soundtracks .","289846":"no . if i have something to say to someone and it s warranted , then i ll simply say it to their face .","289847":"i m confused by your hesitation , but hello nonetheless . do you have a question ?","289848":"hello from the united states do you have a question ?","289849":"no , i m not diagnosed with ptsd .","289850":"it was only a temporary feeling , it lasted perhaps seconds .","289851":"i don t generally respond to trolls or hate messages .","289852":"i ve never been to one personally , but a lot of my friends have gone and posted photos of local parades in the area .","289853":"no , not really . it s going to be an ordinary day . the only difference is that i ll be having dinner with my parents that night .","289854":"yeah , i don t have any bad blood with my exes or think it would be weird if i dated someone with their name .","289855":"i m against spanking children . if you re physically disciplining a child and they re too young to understand why , then they don t know why you re hitting them and all you re teaching them is violence . if you re physically disciplining a child and they re old enough to understand why , then there s no reason why you can t simply talk to your child and explain why their behavior was wrong .","289856":"people deserve basic rights and basic respect regardless of their sexual orientation . gay couples should be allowed the opportunity to adopt children just like straight couples are . gay pride is a beautiful thing , and gay people have been oppressed for ages so it s only right now for gay people to have the opportunity to express pride in themselves and for being able to live how they truly are .","289857":"does anyone else experience bursting , overwhelming euphoria for like seconds amid the normal hopelessness sadness that they feel , like their heart is overcome with fullness and satisfaction . but once you acknowledge or become aware that you re feeling this way , it disappears as soon as it appears and suddenly everything comes crashing down again . you question whether it even happened at all , and when you try to recall the feeling , you re left with an emptiness . it happens to me on occasion , and it just happened again five minutes ago . as if my insides were bursting at the seams with a bright , white joy , euphoria bordering on mania . and as soon as i realize what s happening , it destroys itself within me and i feel crushed with the weight of what might have been .","289858":"sounds interesting ! ! i love watching shows and documentaries about conspiracy theories , so i would probably enjoy it .","289859":"this mindset is honestly so toxic to yourself , and i used to feel the same way towards myself . i didn t , and to some degree still don t , believe that my feelings are justified based on the ab se i experienced because i think so many more people have it worse off than me . however , it s a toxic way of thinking and it only hurts you . it doesn t matter if someone has it worse , what you went through is still ab se and it still affected you , and you also didn t deserve it . you re justified in not forgiving your parents for hurting you . they did you wrong to an extreme .","289860":"of course i believe wholeheartedly that i m a terrible , unlikable person . if and when people leave me , i understand because i m complicated to deal with .","289861":"you don t have to forgive anyone if someone has wronged you just because someone is family , it doesn t mean you re obligated to forgive them . perhaps you may feel differently in the future , but if you don t feel comfortable forgiving them now , then those feelings are valid .","289862":"i ve been listening to a lot of post malone lately , lmaoo .","289863":"greater understanding , awareness , and acceptance of those with mental health problems . although we have progressed somewhat in recent years , there is still significant stigma against those with mental illness .","289864":"my boyfriend , most likely . he s one of the few people with whom i can sit and talk for hours upon hours .","289865":"tbh , i have no clue . i m sure what other people think of me ranges dramatically , from disgust to love . lmaoo .","289866":"i don t remember much about my childhood at all . however , i do recall them being overprotective , especially my mother . she has always stepped over the line between being respectful and being overprotective , to the point where i often felt caged and threatened . i don t remember their opinions on sleepovers . i don t recall having any at other people s houses .","289867":"going to a destination that s equally relaxing as it is interesting . having a casual repertoire , but also enough time to explore and do whatever it is you want at the spur of the moment . i like when there s little to no responsibilities on a vacation , and you can do whatever you like in that present moment .","289868":"i enjoy discussing politics and religion , among other controversial topics , with friends and strangers alike . i think it s important to know other people s opinions about those things .","289869":"i want to eventually quit vaping completely , now that i ve taken the step down from smoking cigarettes to smoking a vape . i haven t really done it yet because i still enjoy vaping , although i have started doing it less often .","289870":"have yourself a merry little christmas by she him . https www . youtube . com watch ? v phf c rzygu","289871":"lol . i never ask for anything for the holidays , tbh . there isn t anything i really need and i prefer to buy things myself . if anything , i ll just request money .","289872":"with my friends boyfriend . i m not a big fan of the holidays at all , but i do enjoy seeing the looks on their faces when they open the gifts i got them .","289873":"i honestly can t remember . i haven t been to the movie theater in years .","289874":"yeah , i was banned during the spring for some unknown reason . i didn t receive any warnings whatsoever and i did nothing wrong . i emailed support ask . fm and explained everything , so they investigated my account and un banned it for me .","289875":"yeah , i desperately need a shave lol .","289876":"hello do you have a question ?","289877":"i want to do this .","289878":"i m changing it soon , lol . i have an appointment on the th to color my hair .","289879":"no , i just feel guilty for receiving money from others . i feel like i don t deserve the help and i also don t like being in a position where i owe others money either .","289880":"no . i have an issue with accepting money from my friends , let alone accept money from someone i don t even like .","289881":"no , i don t believe i can ever come to a position where i will forgive my parents .","289882":"i sometimes hold grudges , but they ve never lasted for multiple years .","289883":"it s part of the snapchat filter . however , i do have naturally long lashes and i use mascara whenever i decide to put on makeup .","289884":"no , i was too shy to really approach them i knew they didn t like me back anyway .","289885":"no , it s leftover from when i bleached colored my hair a few months ago . you can kinda see my natural hair color in my roots .","289886":"i literally just posted a photo of me , lmaoo . it s blonde .","289887":"abandonment by my loved ones .","289888":"pretty much anything that involved mayonnaise . it absolutely sickens me .","289889":"i would be considerate of her feelings , but also tell her that i m in a relationship and not interested in pursuing anyone else at this time .","289890":"probably at some point tbh , but i honestly can t remember . i m not around children often at all .","289891":"yeah , when i was in high school i always had crushes on people who did not reciprocate those feelings .","289892":"luckily i don t get them much anymore probably because people realized i don t tolerate it , but s xual questions in general are the most irritating to me . simply because i don t understand the purpose of them , and why in the hell they would believe that someone would actually answer them seriously .","289893":"i love the smell of real trees , although it is aggravating having to clean the needles off of the ground every day , lol . now that i live with two cats , we re going to be using fake trees .","289894":"i m most proud of my resilience . i ve endured a lot of struggles and some trauma over the course of my life , and although it caused damage to my mental health somewhat , i ve come through to the other side and i still have motivation , determination , and dedication to my passions .","289895":"i m not the biggest fan of christmas , tbh . however , i do really love seeing the looks on people s faces when they open a gift i got them and they re overjoyed at what they received .","289896":"moana , tarzan , the emperor s new groove , treasure planet , and atlantis the lost empire .","289897":"tbh , not doing enough for someone during a time when it still counted . i feel as if i missed out on an opportunity to show them i care deeply and now it s too late .","289898":"i m very boring and the only topping i really enjoy on pizza is sausage or pepperoni , which isn t unusual at all . i also like chicken bacon ranch pizza . i see nothing wrong with people putting pineapple on pizza . if it s something that s enjoyable to them , then they should have the freedom to eat pizza however they want .","289899":"driving in general , tbh . i absolutely hate driving to begin with so i m a very cautious , safe driver although i do speed at times . however , nearly everyone else on the road pisses me off because no one else knows how to drive , or they re very irresponsible with their driving .","289900":"yeah , i would feel comfortable inviting both my family and his family to our wedding .","289901":"my boyfriend , of course . he s one of the few people i would want to see before i die .","289902":"i would obviously be quite upset and afraid , since i don t believe i m exactly cut out to do well in a prison setting . i watch too many prison documentaries and shows and i understand that you really need to be rough on the outside to make it through to the other side .","289903":"i m not exactly sure what a conspiracy tour is .","289904":"i m normally early because i feel irresponsible if i m late to an event , appointment , work , etc etc . i usually arrive at wok minutes early every morning .","289905":"i value my alone time greatly , and i prefer spending my spare time by myself . occasionally i ll be in the mood to see one friend or two at the most , but it doesn t happen very often these days .","289906":"no , i speed walk at best . i only ever really exercise on the treadmill .","289907":"probably not very many i m not physically strong , especially with my upper body .","289908":"healthy burrito bowls i like either pulled pork or tofu ones with brown rice , pinto beans , guacamole , and tomatoes . i also love sushi , although i ve been refraining from eating it very often .","289909":"yeah , climate change is a concerning reality and there are still a lot of people who don t actually believe it exists .","289910":"i m going to be totally honest with you i m not level headed enough to answer questions that require intellectual thought rn . for the time being , i m simply not going to answer these types of questions .","289911":"i have one half brother who s years older than me . we re not close at all , but we have started talking more often on a casual basis as we ve both gotten older .","289912":"to get the most out of askfm , it s best to establish yourself by asking people questions albeit appropriate and answer questions on a routinely basis . eventually , you ll start to gain followers who will ask you questions every day .","289913":"mostly because i m lazy , but partially because i answered this question already when i answered the initial question regarding technology .","289914":"my typical day is rather boring , tbh . i wake up , prepare my breakfast lunch , then head off to work . i work for . hours and then drive home . after i get home , i either order takeout , heat up leftovers , or prepare a new dish for dinner . sometimes i ll clean lightly here and there i do most deep cleaning on the weekends . i ll do the dishes . then when my responsibilities are done , i relax in bed and watch netflix .","289915":"my answer to the technology question will suffice .","289916":"if i can t sleep because i m sick for whatever reason , then normally i just suffer through it , lol . but to actually answer your question it can be helpful to have a cup of tea , relax with tranquil music , maybe read a book that might put you to sleep . everyone has different methods of relaxation .","289917":"yes , i thankfully quite enjoy my job . i find a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction most days , especially when it comes to my own personal progress and feeling productive . i m working within the field i always wanted to work in and i m being recognized for the work i do .","289918":"my mother isn t the biggest fan of my boyfriend , but the rest of my family likes him .","289919":"the world is simultaneously progressing and regressing . while technology is advancing humanity , there are still a plethora of things that require change , especially world hunger , climate change , poverty , oppression based on demographics , etc etc . you can acknowledge that technology is great while still acknowledging that everything else needs improvement .","289920":"the notebook has always made me cry yes , what a cliche . the book made me cry as well .","289921":"i don t know half of you half as well as i should like and i like less than half of you half as well as you deserve .","289922":"i took one music class when i was in high school , where i learned the fundamentals of guitar and percussion . in college , i took two music theory classes .","289923":"if by rich you mean bountiful and fulfilling , then for the most part , yes . i value my interpersonal relationships with my close friends boyfriend .","289924":"overall , no . i believe that technology is astounding and we are a society are making great strides , especially with respect to the sciences , engineering and medicine . i don t think it necessarily makes us lazier as a whole , but technology does make things a lot easier and accessible .","289925":"actually , yes ! ! i started reading mindhunter by john e . douglas . it s the book that the netflix series mindhunter is based off of .","289926":"besides the fact that my first ex is my current best friend , yes . my ex boyfriend tried messaging me on facebook a few times a couple of years ago .","289927":"hello yes , i m fine . i wasn t online for the past days because i had a lot of things going on in my personal life . however , i m feeling much better now that it s the weekend i can have a chance to relax .","289928":"i re watched v for vendetta , the crow , and american psycho over the past week all movies . they re among my favorites . i also started watching the netflix series the devil next door . i highly recommend it , it s very intriguing .","289929":"is there a way to read it online where your family can t see your browsing history ?","289930":"close friends some family .","289931":"i ve only seen maybe two episodes and it wasn t great to me .","289932":"obviously it didn t make them busy . but i want to be social have people over , and unfortunately that doesn t happen often because they all have prior plans or work .","289933":"yes ! ! here s a small segment of my playlist","289934":"no , i seldom can remember my dreams .","289935":"i usually ignore them . or if i can t ignore them i just severely limit my time with them .","289936":"it s just super compelling and dramatic . the characters are likeable well except the bad ones , lol and you really get attached to them .","289937":"no , i m not going to buy much this year at all because i won t be able to afford much .","289938":"i wasn t aware that an anonymous bystander knows me greater than i know myself , lol .","289939":"i m mostly happy with where i am , but i ve definitely become a hermit since moving into the new house . i haven t gone out to do anything since prior to moving in three weeks ago with the exception of halloween night . which normally would be great , but i also do get lonely when my friends are all busy and all i want is for them to come over and chill for a few hours .","289940":"not doing enough for someone during a time when it still counted .","289941":"slow drivers , lmaoo . especially if i m in the left lane and they re barely going the speed limit .","289942":"i have two exes .","289943":"thank you . i don t really send out questions anymore , and i haven t routinely sent out spam questions in quite a few years .","289944":"other people s opinions of me . in the past , i was overly concerned with what people thought about me and my entire self esteem and confidence levels were dependent upon the acceptance i had from my peers . these days , i couldn t care any less . the only opinions that matter to me are those of the people i m closest to .","289945":"unfortunately , no . it was a fairly typical day at the office . however , i made a new spotify playlist and i ve been listening to that all afternoon and evening .","289946":"i don t like sports at all , let alone play a sport . i m not exactly a fighter either .","289947":"yes , i can think of a few people who fit that description .","289948":"i lost my phone . ? ? ?","289949":"i don t believe i have nearly any influence enough to change the world . however , if i can change someone s life in a positive manner , even just slightly , then i m happy .","289950":"a few of the things i first notice about new people are their height , their hair , and their smile .","289951":"i would much rather meet my favorite celebrity . i have no desire to be famous or recognized .","289952":"my day was fairly ordinary . woke up this morning , prepared breakfast lunch , and then drove to work . worked for eight hours , then came home and heated up dinner . afterwards , i did the dishes and put the garbage out . i ve been sitting in bed watching television for the past hour .","289953":"no , that has never happened to me before .","289954":"no , i basically watch the few same shows over over again , lol .","289955":"yeah , i m worried about a few things . nothing has changed since the last time you asked me this question .","289956":"not any more or less than i do during the rest of the year . my eating habits don t change around the holidays .","289957":"i would prefer a party with only a few close friends . i don t deal with crowds of people well .","289958":"wentworth , even though i ve recommended it already in the past . i finally started watching the most recent season it s spectacular .","289959":"unless you re a serial killer , the cereal goes in first .","289960":"no , i ve never been on a blind date . i would never agree to one , at any rate .","289961":"no , i ve

questions most of the time , though , which i believe is why i still check my account every day .","289965":"depends on how busy the highway is and whether or not i ll be able to get to my destination faster via backroads . most of the time , i take the highway halfway and then backroads the rest of the way .","289966":"the tip of my finger was basically torn off in the inside of a door when i was in kindergarten . it got sewn back on .","289967":"aahh , thanks for k likes everyone ! !","289968":"girl , interrupted by susanna kaysen , particularly if you re interested in mental health . it really opened my eyes to what mental illness is truly about and also helped me distinguish my own behavior which was unhealthy that i previously thought was normal . it inspired me to look into mental health awareness more and become somewhat of an advocate for mental health reform .","289969":"we ve always been somewhat close , but nothing in our friendship has changed recently . she s in town and i always see her whenever she s in town .","289970":"i know this is a really cliche answer , but it s continuing to fight for my own survival despite everything in me telling me to die . i ve overcome great odds in fighting my own s icidal thoughts time and time again , and i believe it s my bravest asset .","289971":"yes , intellect completely outweighs physical looks . someone can be very attractive , but if they don t have chemistry with you on an emotional level , then the relationship will fall flat .","289972":"it ultimately depends on the individual , but overall i believe yes . people have the capacity to change , to grow from their past , to recognize their issues and problematic behavior , and to overcome them completely .","289973":"i think an easier question is what doesn t make me cry , lmaoo .","289974":"no , it s been a pretty boring day so far . however , my best friend might be stopping over in a little bit .","289975":"no , why would he ? my roommates are my boyfriend s best friend and his brother .","289976":"it s good . we haven t been able to see each other often lately which is a pain , but other than that things have been great .","289977":"i don t see a correlation between the two ? just because i don t generally fear people doesn t mean i can tolerate jumpscares and spooky imagery , lol .","289978":"no . i don t fear anyone in general .","289979":"my day has been okay so far . i woke up much later than usual am , yikes . i cooked breakfast , cleaned the kitchen , vacuumed , and did two loads of laundry . i also tried starting up a wordpress blog , but the customization confuses me so i have to look up some tutorials . now i m relaxing with some iced tea and going to attempt to start writing a new piece .","289980":"it isn t up to me to say whether or not someone should fear all men . i m saying that it s justifiable if a woman does .","289981":"why would i fear them ? they re harmless human beings , lmaoo .","289982":"yeah , i tell them that i m grateful for their support fairly often .","289983":"i don t think that s justified , because although there are a fragment of women who do ab se or mistreat men , it isn t as common or widespread as men doing that to women .","289984":"i don t think it s a good idea for him to be impeached because the people below him are just as bad , if not worse , than him . i would just rather he be voted out of office .","289985":"instagram already has an option for making your account private or public . you can also hide stories from particular people i . e . close friends

therapist , and friends are my support system .","289987":"the way i see it , men are most of the population that commit crimes , particularly crimes against women . if a woman fears a man or even men in general i think it s justified especially if that woman has always had bad experiences with the men in her life .","289988":"obviously i don t like the way it tastes .","289989":"honestly , i think he s a disgusting and ableist piece of sh t . i m ashamed to call him my president .","289990":"nutella is gross . circumcision is just genit l mutilation but no one wants to admit that . if you have a problem with other people not drinking alcohol , then you have a problem with alcohol . the saying that everyone is beautiful isn t accurate , and there are some people who are just downright ugly . women are morally justified in fearing men . having a child isn t an obligation , and not everyone is meant to have children . people should be given the freedom to have an abortion .","289991":"i have , coins .","289992":"i disagree with hunting as a form of sport . i think it s cruel and unnecessary .","289993":"i like pizza on occasion , especially real pizza from local pizzerias in new york . i usually just eat it with cheese and pepperoni , but i also like chicken bacon ranch pizza as well . yes , i fold it while i eat it . it s basically a sin to do otherwise in new york , lol .","289994":"right now , i m thankful for coffee . however , i m also thankful for my support system for helping me while i m down . i m thankful for my job for providing me with a sense of motivation , purpose , and fulfillment . i m thankful for music for inspiring me .","289995":"when i can t sleep , i normally go out and have a quick smoke well , vape session , make a glass of water , scroll

exact number , but it was a couple thousand .","289998":"no , i honestly value my alone time a lot and i like being alone . i know that s different than loneliness , but i also have a good support system that prevents me from feeling lonely .","289999":"who is tish and why do i care about whether or not someone has a child ?","290000":"no , cadence only invited close friends and family to her wedding .","290001":"tbh i m more content now than i ve been in years .","290002":"yeah , but it s a work in progress . i think my username on there is poetalunam , same as here .","290003":"yes ,

for me to feel nostalgic about anymore and i don t want to live in the past .","290006":"yeah , although it only happens when i m on the desktop version of askfm .","290007":"because there s no one else to do it for her right now . she needed food and her prescriptions .","290008":"i can t really think of anything that s extraordinarily shocking about myself , lmaoo . i m pretty much an open book as it is .","290009":"sometimes , but i prefer ranch .","290010":"i guess go shopping for my mother yesterday and then dropping the groceries and whatnot off at her house .","290011":"no , i ve never taken a spin class before . most of my exercising is basic treadmill stuff and then arm and leg exercises .","290012":"i love museums , but i haven t visited a museum in a very long time . i

me either way . if someone wants to color or braid their body hair , then they should have the freedom to do so .","290033":"this afternoon after work , i went shopping for my mother and brought

now and again , it isn t unusual for me .","290049":"i don t purposely collect anything , but i ve developed a collection of mugs over the years .","290050":"it doesn t sway me either way . if someone is nosy , i have the choice to not tell them anything .","290051":"there s way too much light pollution . the only times i ve ever seen the stars clearly have been when i went to upstate new york

recall .","290056":"i always feel the need to help people who have troubled pasts or people that i see myself in them . idk if that would necessarily be my soft spot but i ve always been drawn to troubled souls . i don t want them to go down the same paths i went down .","290057":"my hobbies lately have been writing , reading , and playing video games . honestly , they were all methods of escape for me when i was younger because it allowed me to not think about my life for fragments of time , and they ve always been there for as long as i can remember .","290058":"yes , my coworker is currently dealing with this situation regarding someone she knows . the person seemed calm and responsible at first , but now she s acting completely ridiculous , sketchy , and overdramatic .","290059":"i try to avoid arguments altogether , but they do inevitably happen . i try my hardest to maintain my composure but sometimes i just lose it .","290060":"i wouldn t know , i ve never bargained with someone before .","290061":"thank you ! ! it s certainly a relief .","290062":"things are fine . i ve been feeling a little mentally unwell , so i ve been writing creatively to offset those feelings . i ve written two short pieces since yesterday , and they re not the greatest but considering i haven t written creatively in months , it s a good start .","290063":"my life has changed dramatically since last october . my mental health has gotten better overall , i m more well established in my job , and i m living on my own .","290064":"i m in the same boat as your boyfriend , lmaoo . i had such an extreme dislike for it back in the day when it first came out . i saw it once and swore to never watch it again .","290065":"i m not entirely sure tbh . but if any of

came over for a few hours .","290085":"i don t really have any cool knowledge , so i honestly have no idea .","290086":"my mood swings can make me sometimes cold and hostile . i also sometimes have the tendency to instigate situations and make them worse .","290087":"i usually go outside and have a smoke , drink a glass of water , watch something on youtube , and try to fall back asleep .","290088":"i am grateful for them , for them sticking by me even when i was difficult and still am difficult to be around .","290089":"no . i only give my phone number to people i ve spoken to long

, or when i wake up in the middle of the night .","290097":"my art teacher in high school had connections , and she picked a few of us out of the class because she thought our paintings were good enough to be displayed . they weren t sold or anything , but they were displayed in a group show . unfortunately , i don t have any photos of my paintings anymore . they re all locked away in the attic of my parents house .","290098":"yes , i do believe in true love . however , i also believe that true love is difficult and you re going to have your ups and downs , trials and tribulations , much like any other relationship . the difference between true love and any other sort of love is that regardless of the circumstance , you both overcome it together .","290099":"an obvious answer is any sort of ab se , including verbal and mental ab se that includes gaslighting or any other form of manipulation . however , relationships should also be free from anything that restricts an individual from being themselves , and ideally your partner should support you in all of your endeavors and not judge you . if your partner is preventing you from doing something you love then perhaps it s best not to even be with them .","290100":"my boyfriend knows me better than i know myself . and even when i try to hide my feelings , he knows that something is wrong through the fake smiles and laughter .","290101":"i was a prolific artist when i was in high school i painted more than i wrote , at that point , and my art was hung in museums and at town hall . i painted the windows of the local post office every year too .","290102":"not generally , no . everyone has different tastes when it comes to music and someone isn t less of a person if they listen to a different artist or genre than me . i also have a really diversified range of music that i like .","290103":"my boyfriend bought me a housewarming gift it s a three hook key rack that i can mount on the wall , and it s made out birch wood with wolves engraved on it .","290104":"yeah , my roommates can help me move it it s huge so i definitely can t do it by myself lol . it s currently in the garage . we ve just been so

.","290109":"i don t believe i have anyone blocked on askfm .","290110":"not really . all i do is work these days .","290111":"i ve never been to detroit before .","290112":"lol . you re lucky i m in the top at all . there s really no explanation besides the fact that i probably don t answer as many questions as i used to .","290113":"gasoline , if i had to pick anything . there are cars and roads everywhere and gas stations on every corner .","290114":"lmao , no . i ve never referred to it like that before .","290115":"thank you so much for always being there for me during a few of my darkest nights . i don t tell you often enough , but i really do appreciate your existence in my life and i value our friendship , even if we re miles apart .","290116":"honestly , no . lmaoo . if anything , i m too strict with people and i don t budge if someone is trying to negotiate with me . i don t give into people s pleas easily at all .","290117":"it would be pointless to name them because they re not anyone that someone on askfm would know .","290118":"nah , not really . the only tradition i have is that i see my parents christmas eve at night , and when we re done with dinner , i go to my boyfriend s house and celebrate christmas at midnight . the following day , my boyfriend and i go to my aunt s house for christmas day dinner .","290119":"chester bennington . he was my role model growing up and i owe my life to him .","290120":"yeah , i definitely do .","290121":"my day went well ! ! i went to work , and after work i went to my parents house to pick up some more of my belongings . i came home , helped my roommate make dinner , ate dinner , organized the kitchen and did the dishes , and then put away my belongings in my room . now i m relaxing and listening to music .","290122":"i m not afraid of the dark exactly , but i do like to sleep with a small light on at night just so that i m aware of my surroundings .","290123":"whoops , it s pm now . lol . my morning was good , though . i got ready , packed my lunch bag and made coffee , and then went to work . i had a pretty decent day at work too .","290124":"a functional adult .","290125":"lol , no . i know of her but i don t personally know her or anything .","290126":"no , she deactivated her account so i couldn t tag her .","290127":"i wouldn t want to pick favorites but i m personally the closest to speakofthefckindevil , shehitsback , and country peach .","290128":"well , considering i only woke up an hour ago . . . today has been boring so far . all i ve done is prepare my lunch , made coffee , and drove to work .","290129":"i don t personally do it , but i see nothing wrong with other people doing it . people can post whatever they want on social media .","290130":"abandonment from my loved ones .","290131":"thank you ! ! i hope you have a great week as well .","290132":"i m biologically female and my gender is non binary . non binary means that my gender is neither woman nor man the two binaries . my gender lies somewhere in between . no , i haven t transitioned or have had any surgery . i considered top surgery for a while but it isn t a priority on my list of things to do .","290133":"sure , why not .","290134":"no , they clean up after themselves pretty well .","290135":"i m obsessed with this cat .","290136":"that sounds pleasant , but no . i don t even know how to speak spanish .","290137":"my day has been good . my roommate and i just picked up two storage pieces for the kitchen a pantry and a foot set of racks . now there s a lot more room in the kitchen . earlier in the day , i did two loads of laundry , cleaned the kitchen , cooked breakfast , and set up my nanowrimo account .","290138":"what else is new ? lmaoo .","290139":"obviously the decision to break up is ultimately up to you . but keep in mind that a relationship can t thrive if it s only hurting your mental health or well being in general , and it s unhealthy to stay in a relationship that hurts you . love can only take you so far . you can love someone but if their feelings and presence in your life don t motivate or inspire you , or if you feel they re making you worse , then you need to really weigh the pros and cons of being together .","290140":"uh , depends by what you mean by a break . if you feel compelled to break up with your partner then you probably shouldn t be together at all .","290141":"yes ! ! he s visited around three times since we moved in . i think he said he s coming over tomorrow night too .","290142":"probably not . i have no desire to maintain a close relationship with my parents .","290143":"honestly ? it s the best it s been in ages . moving out of my parents house was one of the best things i could do for my mental health . i actually have motivation every day and everyday tasks don t seem as daunting anymore . i feel free to do as i please and be myself without dread , anger , or fear weighing me down .","290144":"no , i m a human .","290145":"he apologizes when the situation calls for it , yes .","290146":"because i like the symmetry .","290147":"what about him . . . ? i don t know what this is referring to .","290148":"i apologize profusely , even for things that aren t necessarily my fault .","290149":"lol . i am quite unholy , contrary to popular belief .","290150":". . . no , i m . lmaoo . my birthday didn t come yet . it s in november .","290151":"because i have social anxiety and it makes me incredibly nervous opening the door for even delivery people , let alone multiple strangers in the same night .","290152":"no , i m years old .","290153":"obviously it was the year i was born . other than that , i have no thoughts .","290154":"i have memory loss , so i forgot most of the things about my life . it isn t really unusual , regardless of how much of a masterpiece the game is .","290155":"is it ? lol . i literally don t remember anything about christianity or catholicism or anything .","290156":"no , i literally couldn t sneak out of my parents house . there s a foot drop from the window to the ground , and i couldn t go out the front or back doors because they were too close to the living room and kitchen .","290157":"considering i m not religious in the least and i haven t practiced anything related to christianity catholicism in more than a decade , it certainly does not control my mind .","290158":"i probably played it , but i have no memory of it .","290159":"yes , i remember playing a few of the silent hill games back in the day . i was a fan of silent hill the room .","290160":"no , i don t think i ve played any of the resident evil games .","290161":"i m fairly certain that i did watch that movie at some point .","290162":"depends on who s home on the night of halloween . if i m the only person home , then i ll put out a bowl with candy in it . if i m not alone and one of my roommates are home , then i m sure one of them will be more than happy to answer the door .","290163":"i haven t seen that movie in over years , lmaoo . i don t remember .","290164":"it s rose quartz .","290165":"i m not really a fan of the color blue unless it s a dark or muted navy blue .","290166":"apparently that s the girl from the ring , lol .","290167":"they really shouldn t ask you why you took a three year hiatus , but you don t necessarily have to answer them if you don t feel comfortable doing so . you can simply say that you took the time off for personal reasons .","290168":"i watched horror movies when i was a pre teen and teenager , and i haven t watched any in years . i really can t remember most of them . i don t know if these would be considered horror , but i do remember watching most of the saw movies , hostel , the texas chainsaw massacre , the amityville horror , the hills have eyes , the ring , the grudge , house of corpses , the devil s reject , audition , and oldboy .","290169":"no , i ve never seen the conjuring .","290170":"woke up , took my medication , cooked breakfast , cleaned the kitchen , and did two loads of laundry . i just made a cup of tea and i think i m going to attempt to write creatively now .","290171":"just the standard sized ones in the variety packs , like snickers , twix bars , reeses peanut butter cups , hershey s chocolate , etc etc .","290172":"they had live snakes , frogs , and turtles . they also had taxidermy .","290173":"it was a lot of fun ! ! it was at a local nature preserve s museum , so i walked around the showcases and looked at the few animals they had mainly snakes , frogs , and turtles . there were a few musicians , including my friend , and spoken word poets who were really moving . my friend is a rapper and an artist , so he played a minute set and his artwork was displayed in one of the other rooms . i purchased two stickers from him .","290174":"you don t even know me , so you have no merit in saying what i could or could not believe . if you keep enforcing your religious beliefs onto me , i m going to ignore your messages .","290175":"lol . no , i don t believe in god never have even though i was raised in a religious household . i m years old , and my feelings on religion probably won t change at this rate . if anything , i relate more to eastern spiritualities than anything else .","290176":"no , i m an athiest .","290177":"y all should ask me questions , i m bored af","290178":"yeah , i ve done it with a few of my close friends when they were doing something borderline bad and i didn t want them to get in trouble , so i just played along until they were in the clear .","290179":"yeah , it happened a few times in the past during my party stage .","290180":"i have dozens of favorite books , lol . girl interrupted by susanna kaysen . american psycho by bret easton ellis . the shining by stephen king . the gargoyle by andrew davidson . the secret history by donna tartt . i am not a serial killer by dan wells .","290181":"yeah , i was used to the galaxy s which i think only scanned it maybe once or twice . it always gave me an issue depending on which angle i would use my fingerprint to unlock my phone or sign into certain apps , and then it would lock me out if i didn t get it just right . it was aggravating . but the s is so much better , i m really happy with the phone .","290182":"there haven t been any issues with it at all , actually , even with the screen protector that i m using . one thing i noticed that was different from the other galaxy phone i previously had was that the fingerprint scanner was much more comprehensive . instead of scanning your fingerprint once , it scanned it like different times to pick up every groove . it was ridiculously interesting .","290183":"i m not much of a technology enthusiast at all , so no . i just got the samsung galaxy s , though , and i absolutely love this phone . the camera is amazing .","290184":"writing things down helps me a lot , because often it s difficult for me to express myself verbally . my words get jumbled up and i freeze up a lot it s hard for me to really convey what it is i m thinking or feeling while i speak .","290185":"i m not much of a cook at all , but one of my favorite comfort foods is grilled cheese with tomato soup .","290186":"it depends on how bad of a day i m having , because it can range from being able for someone to cheer me up to me not being consolable at all . however , on the better days , my boyfriend usually cheers me up pretty well . as for material items that cheer me up , it helps my moods a lot when i listen to music , write something creatively , watch one of my favorite television shows , and or play video games .","290187":"i like fragrances like lavender , chamomile , rose petals , jasmine , coconut , etc etc . i have a rose scented shampoo and conditioner , and i think my body wash is scented with jasmine and coconut .","290188":"yes , this basically defines my entire teenagehood . i was always interested in people who weren t interested in me back .","290189":"chocolate isn t very good in my opinion , so most things are better than chocolate .","290190":"i usually set a timer for everything . i have alarms that go off for when i wake up in the morning , for my laundry , etc etc .","290191":"definitely in the fall . the heat of the fire can be too much during summer nights at least where i live but it s perfect for fall nights .","290192":"no , probably not . they re probably just self conscious and are wondering why you re interested in them .","290193":"thanks ! ! my day has been good so far . i finished up my work about an hour ago and i ve been cleaning and tidying up the house since then .","290194":"not the app , no . however , when i use it on the desktop it keeps redirecting to spam sites and it s super annoying .","290195":"i haven t even thought about my birthday yet , lmaoo . i don t have any particular gifts in mind .","290196":"yeah , i don t think i want to do a fancy color next since winter is coming up soon and i want something a bit darker . i was thinking about doing a chocolate brown balayage with mahogany tints .","290197":"the last concert i went to was a radio concert series called not so silent night at the barclays center in brooklyn last december . they had such musicians as muse , florence and the machine , mike shinoda , ajr , death cab for cutie , and bastille . it was a lot of fun .","290198":"right now , i m answering questions and listening to music while taking a break from working . on the weekends , i work from home .","290199":"the other night , i watched the movie saw because i found it on hulu . it s one of my favorite movies .","290200":"honestly , i try to think on it as much as possible and develop theories for as many outcomes as possible before diving into something and making that choice . while i appreciate change and embrace it , sometimes it can be terrifying and if a difficult choice comes with significant change , i don t know how it would affect me . i usually take a few days to think on it .","290201":"the last time that i took a risk was yesterday , when i asked my hr manager about yearly pay raises . my two year work anniversary was this week and i was curious about whether or not my company implements yearly reviews , and i was also hesitant to ask her because i didn t want to seem pushy . however , it did pan out well . she didn t seem bothered by the fact that i asked at all , and she said that she expects me to receive another review within the next months based on merit and performance .","290202":"well , if i told you my secrets then they wouldn t necessarily be secret anymore .","290203":"thanks for the follow i don t follow people upon request , so i won t be following you back . however , i hope you have a pleasant day .","290204":"no , i don t have an issue with you . you may continue asking me question if you d like , after all that s the purpose of askfm .","290205":"no , that doesn t necessarily mean that they still have feelings for their ex . it could simply mean that they re not in the mood at that moment to talk about their ex , or they believe that you ve already covered the subject so much in the past that there isn t anything left to discuss anymore .","290206":"i ve never had that question asked to me before , haha . i would try to redirect the answer to reflect how you would be a good candidate instead of answering the question outright . something like . . . given my credentials and wealth of experience , my wish is that you may take my application and interview into consideration . i also want to thank you for this opportunity to sit down with you . and then follow up after the interview with an email that also thanks them for the opportunity and that you hope to hear from them soon .","290207":"yeah , a few people in my life come to mind .","290208":"for me personally , it wouldn t really warrant breaking up with someone . ideally the two people should have a serious conversation with each other about their feelings and come to a mutual understanding .","290209":"i listen to pretty much all styles of music . and regardless , my depression has no correlation with the music i listen to . my depression is the result of both chemical imbalances and environmental factors while i was growing up .","290210":"i had to google search what that was , lmaoo . no . i just have poor eyesight and astigmatism .","290211":"depends entirely on the person . for some people it can be a happy occasion while for others , it can be depressing .","290212":"my one roommate is a commercial truck driver and the other is a manager at a food store .","290213":"i answered this once already , and my answer was no . you can t put a universal label on a group of people and expect them to all behave the same way . that s unrealistic .","290214":"depends on the situation . having a college degree isn t a necessity and it doesn t necessarily mean you ll find a good job , but i would encourage everyone to challenge themselves and continually learn , whether they want to do that through college or taking up another endeavor . i don t think it s fair for a person to rely solely on the hope that their future spouse will provide for them , but if the case happens where your current spouse makes enough money to support the entire family then there s nothing wrong with staying home .","290215":"neither . nobody should be the head of a household , there should be equality of responsibilities among everyone involved .","290216":"of course not , lol . it s my close friend who i ve known for years and his brother .","290217":"tonight , i m seeing my friend perform at an open mic night at a nature preserve . there are going to be other performers rapping and doing spoken word poetry , and people will be promoting and selling their artwork ! !","290218":"no , like i said we re rarely home at the same time anyway .","290219":"not at all . there s nothing to miss out on .","290220":"no ? i m happy in my relationship . i wouldn t want to change it for the world .","290221":"i m not entirely sure . i don t know if i want children at all .","290222":"they re led lights , but they do come in bright colors . there are color settings on the remote .","290223":"yes ! ! i m obsessed and so happy with the way it came out .","290224":"no , that wouldn t be fair at all and i m also not interested in her in that way anymore . my feelings for her stopped about a year after we broke up when i was years old .","290225":"lol , definitely not . we primarily broke up because she realized she was straight .","290226":"well i ve been with my current boyfriend for years . prior to that , i was interested in another man . i ve only been in three relationships .","290227":"no , she was my first relationship and only relationship with a girl . ironically , she s currently my best friend .","290228":"we were years old , lmaoo .","290229":"no , not at all . the only thing that was difficult was hiding our relationship from others because we weren t ready to come out yet publicly .","290230":"well , i m bisexual so yeah . i had a girlfriend in the past .","290231":"no . heterosexual people definitely exist .","290232":"i like listening to those live lo fi hip hop beat videos

the crow .","290308":"honestly , i would probably try to distance myself from them because it isn t fair for me to always be around when they need support but they re not reciprocating the same effort .","290309":"my friend came over last night for dinner , and i started laughing hysterically at something she said . it was a lot of fun having her over .","290310":"i only talk to my parents when it

when we lived together , we got along pretty well .","290323":"we get along fairly well . we don t see each other often or anything , though .","290324":"lol , no . all i have left to build is a computer chair a desk .","290325":"he was very happy for me .","290326":"i spent the past few hours putting a few corners of my bedroom together i m very pleased so far .","290327":"a mentally stable

haven t seen the first season in years .","290339":"for the most part , yeah .","290340":"i prefer comfortable clothing . i don t care about being fashionable or stylish .","290341":"it only came out to like total , lol .","290342":"i don t know who that is .","290343":"yes , i m fairly certain that i learned about it in my history classes .","290344":"i don t have a stable life at the moment . i don t live with my boyfriend , i don t have the financial means to support a child , and i m not mentally stable enough to be responsible for a child .","290345":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","290346":"i m not entirely sure , tbh . i m definitely not ready to have children at this stage of my life though .","290347":"good morning , askfm lovelies","290348":"yes , that has happened to me on a few occasions in the past . needless to say , i m not friends with those people anymore and now i m very selective about who i tell my personal problems to .","290349":"yes , there are quite a few countries i would love to visit , including australia , new zealand , canada , the bahamas , cuba , italy , spain , england , the netherlands , and russia .","290350":"i m a basic white b tch , so i love anything pumpkin and pumpkin spice flavored , lmaoo . pumpkin bread is my favorite seasonal food , as well as various soups . i also usually buy pumpkin pie creamer for my coffee during the autumn months .","290351":"i m extremely hard working and determined , so i try my best to put into everything i do , which usually results in good outcomes .","290352":"i did buy the furniture it didn t come assembled , so we have to assemble it . i have to assemble a dresser , television stand , bookshelf , desk , and computer chair .","290353":"i only woke up an hour ago , but it s going well . i just set up the coffee machine and made a pot of coffee , as well as made some breakfast . i m just relaxing until my brother comes over to help me build some furniture .","290354":"my best friend doesn t use askfm , so it would be pointless to name her .","290355":"technically they re my roommate s cats , but they live in the house with us too .","290356":"oh yeah , along with two roommates i also acquired two cats .","290357":"it used to be at the local bar , but now that i have my own place , i m probably going to be inviting my friends over instead .","290358":"sadness is a natural human emotion and depression is a mental illness .","290359":"i used to be able to draw and paint very well , but i haven t practiced in years .","290360":"eh , there s a big difference between pretending to be trans because you think it s trendy and then going through a transitional phase where you believe you may be trans but then realize you re cis . i believe it s important to make that distinction , because some people are confused about their gender and it takes some experimentation before they come to know who they truly are . those sorts of situations don t take away from actual trans people , though .","290361":"? ? ? tbh . . . i like the taste of stale things better than fresh things sometimes , lmaoo .","290362":"i don t believe i was ever friends with someone who could be considered a transtrender . that insinuates that being trans is , somehow , a fashion trend , and tbh that sort of mentality just makes life even harder for existing trans people .","290363":"not at all , lol .","290364":"no , there s unfortunately no cure for depression . depression may go into remission but it doesn t mean it s cured .","290365":"tbh i m feeling fantastic after moving out of my parents house . i can actually live my life the way i want to live it without getting negativity or unwarranted comments from people such as my mother , and it feels nice to come home , sit down , and do whatever chores i need to do without someone prying into my life , bossing me around , and judging me .","290366":"my pronouns are they them and i m a non binary person . i ve always felt weird about my own gender , and i remember even from a very young age i didn t identify with being a girl or a woman . i was uneducated on trans identities because of the era , so people just basically called me a tomboy . i didn t learn about being non binary or genderfluid until a few years ago , so ever since then i ve tossed around a few labels that weren t within the gender binary to describe myself .","290367":"i support greta ! ! she has a strong message and it s so important to be aware of climate change and the devastating effects we have on the environment .","290368":"politics are interesting , but unfortunately i haven t kept up to date with what s been going on recently .","290369":"i don t believe that i m better than other people , lol . if anything , i m constantly degrading myself because i have poor self esteem and make terrible life choices .","290370":"yeah , i seldom wear makeup to begin with .","290371":"how so ?","290372":"it looks like the only person trying to be edgy here is you , lmaoo . grow up yourself another person s gender isn t any of your business so it s useless to occupy yourself with the happenings of others , especially total strangers , lol . instead of being twisted about my gender , perhaps you can channel that energy into something more productive .","290373":"i don t have just one favorite movie , haha . i love the lord of the rings trilogy though i m actually watching the two towers rn .","290374":"aw , thank you so much ! ! this is really sweet .","290375":"why would they change ?","290376":"my name is leigh , and my pronouns are they them . some of my interests include mental health advocacy , writing , and music .","290377":"me managing my life is akin to a fish jumping into a dry boat and flopping around in a constant , panicked state .","290378":"i heard about it briefly , but i haven t done any research on it or looked into it at all . i feel terrible , i m so out of the loop when it comes to current events and politics and whatnot .","290379":"yes , i agree that friends can act more like family than one s own family . i m much closer to my friends than i am to my actual family members .","290380":"a few years ago , i paid around for two tickets to a macklemore concert they were around each and then there were added fees .","290381":"no , i don t think they re all bad people at all . i do believe most of them are uneducated , though .","290382":"thanks ! ! it s actually a snapchat filter , haha .","290383":"i ve never watched the office before , actually .","290384":"no , i don t have a garden .","290385":"i think we may follow the same people , butttt . . . urlsareshittbh origamibirds speakofthefckindevil frecklefacedimplecheek daintybumblebee louisarhale","290386":"as my bio indicates , i m non binary . however , do you have a question ?","290387":"yes , i listen to my intuition fairly often because it s seldom wrong .","290388":"it was good , very busy . how was yours ? he had asked me how my day went because we didn t talk for the entire day up until an hour ago or so .","290389":"one of my short term goals is to build the furniture i purchased for my room , haha . i m hoping to have that done this weekend .","290390":"yes , i love sushi . my favorites are spicy tuna rolls and salmon avocado rolls .","290391":"depends on the partner . i wouldn t consider it a red flag really , for me it s normal for my boyfriend and i not to text for most of the day because we re both too busy with work . sometimes a simple hey isn t doable .","290392":"it s great ! ! i m so happy with it , i just need to build a few things of furniture , get rid of the moving boxes , and go grocery shopping , lmaoo .","290393":"not very often at all . perhaps once a month or so .","290394":"strangely enough , i ve never heard any gossip about myself . i don t even think people gossiped about me when i was in high school , but i honestly can t remember for certain .","290395":"one of my passions is mental health awareness . i firmly believe it s important to try to erase the stigma associated with mental illnesses as well as promote better treatment options and accessibility . my hobbies are writing , reading , playing video games , watching television , photography , art , and seeing my friends .","290396":"i suppose my commitment and loyalty to my friends . i ll walk to the end of the earth for them .","290397":"worst as in just . . . bad , stupid , not scary at all .","290398":"i have four pillows on my new bed , lmaoo .","290399":"my new beddddd . ?","290400":"aw , thank you ! !","290401":"no , i can t remember the last time i took a vacation .","290402":"well yeah , i m moving out of my parents house .","290403":"years , lol .","290404":"i m doing well ! ! today is moving day , so i m waiting for my friend to pick up the house keys and bring his moving truck to my house so we can begin loading up my boxes .","290405":"yeah , i m in a relationship .","290406":"i don t think that s necessarily bad , but i do believe it s important to obtain your news from multiple sources instead of just one source .","290407":"i remember watching dead silence when i was in high school thinking it was absolutely terrible , lmaoo .","290408":"my stomach , my jawline , my mouth , my thighs , my upper arms . . . the list goes on and on .","290409":"i always skip youtube ads , they re usually pointless and a waste of my time .","290410":"depends on why you re going to montauk . i personally love it there , it s so relaxing and i love the brewery .","290411":"tonight s sunset . ?","290412":"hello do you have a question ?","290413":"depends on the context and who the person is .","290414":"yes , i m pretty sure all parts of new york have four distinct seasons . i m sure upstate new york is much colder with more severe winters , though .","290415":"if this is referring to street car , then i have no idea . it s been eons since i read the play and or seen the movie .","290416":"does sin city count ? haha . i also liked a streetcar named desire when i watched it years ago .","290417":"attitude matters the most in the long run . having money and good looks is nice , but it s superficial it won t matter in weeks or months from now , but a person s attitude will most definitely matter .","290418":"i haven t yet , but i want to watch it so badly ! !","290419":"finally done packing except for my television and a few small items . i have extra clothes hanging but i ll have to make a second trip and come back for them because i don t have enough room in my suitcase for them . ? my room looks so empty , aaaahhh . but i m so excited to build up a brand new bedroom .","290420":"about an hour apart , give or take . ?","290421":"ah , i thoroughly enjoy a mid afternoon session of disgusting others . the more upset you become at my existence , the more powerful i become . so please , indulge and feed me .","290422":"lmaoo . ignorance is widespread across the world too , evidently .","290423":"? ? ? weird flex , but okay .","290424":"opinions cannot be unwell , lol . regardless , i don t really see the point in telling me this . your opinion on my opinions isn t going to change how i think .","290425":"i m mentally ill , but that doesn t mean i don t have inner strength . most mentally ill people are , in fact , very strong individuals .","290426":"i don t believe so .","290427":"for the most part , yeah . i have my weaknesses like most others , but life has hardened me , which is both a blessing and a curse .","290428":"i love my boyfriend more now , considering i didn t love him when we first met . we were simply friends when we met .","290429":"thanks for following","290430":"depends on the bad news . i normally handle things pretty well though .","290431":"no , i ve only ever shaved half of my head .","290432":"it s cooler than it has been , but it isn t cold . it s around degrees fahrenheit today .","290433":"yeah , my hair is pretty long already . it s past my shoulders at this point .","290434":"i m not in a good or bad mood , i m just exhausted .","290435":"it s been going well . i m finishing up the rest of my packing and i brought all of the boxes downstairs so that it s easier to transport them into the moving truck . i just need to finish up laundry and then i m looking forward to a thicc nap .","290436":"i have a so so attendance record . i have documentation on file excusing me from frequent absences in light of mental health problems . i call out of work maybe twice per month at a maximum these days .","290437":"i think it varies on a case by case basis . but i believe that if that person s past is somehow affecting you in a detrimental manner than its reasonable to judge them .","290438":"i m not on a volleyball team .","290439":"sounds fake , but okay .","290440":"i don t know anyone who copies me , lol . that hasn t happened since high school .","290441":"being unwell is a medical concern , not a supernatural one . lmaoo .","290442":"nah , this is just who i am .","290443":"i feel like toxic friendships are just friendships that bring out the worst in you or don t serve you to some capacity . ab sive friendships , on the other hand , are . . . well , ab sive . an ab sive friendship is usually always toxic , but a toxic friendship doesn t necessarily mean it s ab sive .","290444":"i ve been in toxic friendships , but not ab sive friendships . i think like any other sort of ab sive relationship it s going to be incredibly difficult to release yourself from them , but it may be easier with a support system backing you up and helping you .","290445":"unless they totally ghost you , then no . not responding to your text isn t ghosting you . . . and you should be having this conversation in person , not over text message .","290446":"like i said , that s something you would have to ask them outright . it could mean different things to different people . you won t know their intentions unless you ask them .","290447":"that sounds like they want to break up , but that s something you would have to ask them outright .","290448":"their perception of my feelings and how i actually feel would be two different things in that scenario . it wouldn t be reason to break up , but i would ask them why they felt such a way and what i could do to ease their mind . it could be possible that perhaps i was taking advantage of the relationship or taking the relationship for granted without realizing it , and that i should do more to show my love and appreciation .","290449":"i m five feet tall ."}}
