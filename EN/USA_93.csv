  I don't like the idea of that. I feel like the person could develop ocd with the fears and cause their mental illness to be worse. Making everything into a fear. The past doesn't define you and fears shouldn't either. It seems like it would make them bitter about everything. Fears should be head on. You can't really fear the unknown either...

  No clue. Last year, I had a bloody hasmat suit on. Alien theme... Twirled a fake leg around. Pointed to the area where they needed to go to get the candy. Where there was a bit of an alien lab type thing going and the brother-in-law would jump out screaming help me and other stuff at the kids/adults. They ended up winning 3rd prize.

   Is a life that focuses on avoiding pain and seeking out pleasure a good and worthwhile life? Why or why not?
  ","
  I don't think you can really avoid pain. It can creep up on you when you least expect it. It teaches you a lesson. Makes you know how good you had it? Even the pleasure could bring some pain, maybe? Also rather do whatever feels right in the moment than avoid something altogether. The worthwhile part definitely depends on the person. We all believe different things.

   pros and cons of taking your child into the toilet with you
  ","
  I don't think it's really a pro/con type of situation. They need to go or need help still depending on the age. If there's nobody else they could stay with while you needed to go then clearly its not ok to leave unsupervised. I think its pretty common parenting...
  
  I think there's a stigma attached to it as well. The day we went to the salt water rafting there was a line for the bathroom. This kid must have been 5-8 years old or something. He asked this guy he knew for help at one point. The dude obviously had ""what would people think "" type attitude about it. All ""not my kid, problem"" type thing. He could have atleast gone and got a female from their group to help him. Luckily one of them did wander over and was all ""why didn't you help him"" and then went to help the kid.
  
  Also there's lots of fetish questions on here :p

  ","
  I think it could be both ways.
  
  Sometimes you click together right away and you don't need to be an onion. It's just easy with the person/people. There's no judgement going on. They share stuff with you too and it isn't onesided... once I'm comfortable with someone it definitely gets easier to communicate with them more.
  
  Other times you might be iffy about the person, their attention and all that so its harder to want to share much of yourself with them. Or they try too hard. Don't ask the right questions. Conversation feels forced, pushy. I think I'm a good judge of character.. if they are a pos then why would I want them knowing more about me? haha

   When you are alone do you like the quiet or do you prefer to listen to something such as music, radio, or tv playing in the background?
  ","
  I can go either way. Quiet doesn't always bug me. It would be more of music though. The tv in my room only connects with Netflix and some other apps.. rather watch than just background noise in that case.
  
  Yesterday I had a ""90's rock grunge"" radio playlist going since Alexa doesn't always hear me from the pool and didn't feel like keep getting in/out to request songs.

   What was the best thing about your Summer? What are you looking forward this Fall?
  ","
  I feel like it's still going. AZ seems summer-like all the time. Even winter is 70-80s at times. Only really gets cold in the morning and night.
  
  Salt water rafting was fun besides the sunburn and some rafts popping since we kept hitting trees! Too many people with us and had no way to move. The music choices was annoying  (all Spanish ) got hit with marshmallows which was gross yet fun.
  
  ended up going offroading at Lake Pleasant and checking out the campgrounds there. Lots of donkey friends chilling. Think one might have been pregnant. swam at two different spots there.
  
  I really need to get a passport since I could have gone to Mexico with everyone on July 4th.. looked fun. They still talk about it. hotel right on the ocean, a few pools and hot tub etc
  
  some family parties.. one of their friends was going back to Ecuador so they hosted a party for her.
  
  gone to my brother's country club hes a member at
  
  we're supposed to go camping in Sedona but i don't know when yet.
  
  fall... I guess Halloween. The town has a challenge of best decorated, haunted houses and best business for the community. People go really crazy with it! My sister and her husband got 3rd last year in one of the winning categories. I'm not sure what the theme will be this year but last year they did an alien thing. You get to vote on all the ones, shows maps of houses competing in it so you know what to check out. its just fun!

   if you could pay money to lose weight (not that you need to im sending this out en mass) how much would you pay per lb/kg? but here is the catch you have to offer the highest amount you are willing to pay up front. if its not enough you can be denied. so like one shot what is the most you will pay?

   What are you looking for in a significant other? Be as detailed as you like
  ","
  Someone easy to communicate with, humor, nonjudgmental, good in bed or out of it üòâ a real connection/chemistry whatever you want to call it as (not talking s*xually here but def helps too lol), someone who is more outspoken, spontaneous, laid back, definitely likes to travel but doesn't mind staying in at times either.. best of both worlds there. Isn't afraid to get dirty (take that however you want haha), i don't care for clingy men- space is nice at times.. we can do our own things and have more to talk about as well, someone who wants the same things i do, not closed off emotionally, I seem to like musicians.. either playing or very knowledgeable about bands and whatnot. awesome music taste to bounce off eachother. a best friend kind of thing. doesn't get jealous that much (time/place for, ya know?). yet again i wouldn't want to make them jealous because when i have someone, my eyes are only for them. not controlling or abusive. likes to read but maybe doesn't always that much?
  
  I think this is getting long and boring so I'll stop now. Some things i like but doesn't need to be all of them either. I just haven't found the right person irl that had any of those sparks about them.. something was missing or just not compatible in different ways.

  I don't think that I have really controlled a dream before, embarrassing or otherwise.
  
  I've had dreams where I don't know if I die.. I'd either get shot or stabbed, bleeding out. Then I'd always wake up not knowing what happened to dream me. I think it's a past life or something because it was pretty much reoccurring yet slightly different or it progressed a bit each time yet always woke up not knowing if i made it or not. I haven't had a dream like that in years though.

Luckily, I don't have that part of the pcos, I'm a baby üòÇ kudos to my sister who deals with that side of things. Even mentioned eating the same foods and the dr was just unprofessional.

  I don't think so. I feel like people are just more open about it these days, bring awareness to whatever mental illness they have.

Ending stigmas attached to whatever is going on. Knowing they aren't alone in the fight etc
  
  Maybe with two high school friends. One was already anxious and depressed so it shouldn't have been a shocker to him when admitting recently that something was wrong. The other guy, always seemed happy, class clown, stick skinny guy.. ended up going awol in the navy. His gf got pregnant and he basically was eating for two as well.

I would feel like I wasn't good enough if only getting hugs. I would wonder if something happened in their childhood to make them be less affectionate depending on the way they act, looked fearful of intimacy as a whole. I understand not always being sexual but there's give and take. Takes two people. If you really loved someone both needs should be met? The person should atleast try at times.

  Depends on the person. What they are saying, how. If I get a certain vibe from them... my gut instinct is usually right about people.
  
  Like this one dude in Maine before was with his wife/gf and they had a baby with them. Everyone kept talking about the baby. I didn't say anything because I'm just not someone who needs to talk about babies like that to strangers? They were getting enough attention. Then he started to kind of hit on me.. calling me bashful and stuff because I was more quiet. Like uh not interested in talking to you. You literally have a wife/gf and baby right in front of you. It was pretty bizarre and definitely trying to flirt with me while saying all that. like ew, go away. He ended up going to our friends of the families house. There's a bathroom in the upstairs garage turned bar but the guy ended up going out on the balcony and peeing (high up and facing the driveway )
  
  he got talked to about that and then ended up doing it again later on... let's just say he ended up in the hospital for being disrespectful to them. I was right about what I assumed about him lol

  That's so weird. Are they going to talk about s*x with them then? Or make them live under a rock and become shocked when they cross that line?

If they truly had a problem why not just keep the kid home that day? I don't get how it would be a bad thing for them to know all the risks attached or other bodily autonomy.
  
  It brings awareness.. not everyone would get ideas and start being s*xual because of one class, movie. It's fine to be curious about what is happening to you.

   Due to series usually taking years longer than movies to film, do you think actors feel more pressure/more obligated or less pressure/less obligated to do something that's written in the script for a series rather than a movie? Why?

  I think movies would be less pressure. With series, everything could change. You have more chances and times. You are apart of something longer. The character grows with you. Whereas most movies are one-and-done type of characters...

  In Maine, there's this lady who has two dogs and her cat would follow them. So our old cat, Bob, watched that and started to follow us when we walked our dogs. She'd go in the middle between the dogs like she was their protector or something. It was bizarre because she never did anything like that before and she was like 18 years old.

    we had a sub come in and most of the other kids were being obnoxious to her. The next day he yelled at everyone shocked at their behavior. that was pretty scary coming from him. he never raised his voice at us until that time. made me feel bad and I wasn't even one of the bad eggs lol
    
    this one teacher had free time.. shared the classroom with one of the other teachers and she came in the room and got a beer.. she was literally drinking it infront of everyone.  glad she wasn't one of my teachers! everyone was looking at each other like WTF!

He was all ""what are you doing "" type thing. at first, i didn't know that he was talking to me so gave silent treatment. then noticed he was talking to me so told him that I was printing.. (duh) he was all leave and all that. like for one thing.. i wasn't in anyones way.. The printer was quiet. I wasn't in anyone's seat. like he literally came over to me and was all trying to stop what i was

  Whoever they tap last says a number between 1 and 20. Then the counter taps everyone's fists again as they count to the specified number.
  
  Whoever they land on last, has to take that fist out of the circle and place it behind their back. Then the counter would start all over again with ""Bubble gum, Bubble gum ..."" and repeat the process.
  
  Once both fists are tapped, that person is out. And this goes on until it narrowed it down to one - the winner!""

  helps a lot, actually! breaks down a lot of coffee talk and how to order other items.
  
  bacon, egg and cheese with no bagel
  
  I heard they do a scrambled egg cup with sausage in it. That's pretty new to the menu..
  
  You could do black coffee or add flavor to them. noticed someone did ""large iced coffee with 4 toasted almond flavor, 2 vanilla shots, add cream""
  
  heavy whipping cream basically replaces milk, creamer, half&half etc also less carbs while getting more fat in.

  we had a late start to Sedona for a few different reasons. it was getting late and nobody wanted to stay in the car that long so we ended up going to Lake Pleasant instead. Did some off roading and swam at different areas. You can camp there as well. Saw a bunch of donkeys while there too.
  
  Went to this restaurant/bar right on the water. They had a band singing some good songs. Good food, some healthy options as well.
  
  Overall a good day. our swimming spots looked better than where we would have gone to

   Many people can't taste because their receptors that give them the sense of taste and smell have stopped working as well or they never did.

  Toad Suck, Arkansas
  
  A widely accepted story about Toad Suck‚Äôs name dates back to the days of steamboat travel on the Arkansas River. Toad Suck sits along the river and its tavern was a frequent stop for boatmen, who were said to ‚Äúsuck on the bottle until they swelled up like toads.‚Äù
  
  Dr. John L. Ferguson, late director of the Arkansas History Commission, proposed an alternate explanation. He thought it was likely that, since the first Europeans to thoroughly explore the area were French, the name was an English corruption of a French word (like howaux Arcsbecame Ozarks).
  
  ThisArkansas travel websiteruns with Ferguson‚Äôs idea and muses at length about the different words and phrases that could have given rise to Toad Suck, includingeau d' sucre,chateau d' sucr√©andcot√© eau d' sucre.

It acted like it wanted to be in the water again and then flew off the floatie AND LANDED ON MY HEAD. IT WAS SO WEIRD!

  Christmas we ended up just chilling at the house. opening presents. phone call to my brother-in-law's parents. I think we had steak? AZ doesn't do good Chinese food.
  
  we also went over to his brother's house and watched them open presents. also ended up getting a gift card which was nice of them. Didn't expect to get anything there.

   i don‚Äôt understand how someone can get up in arms about a hypothetical scenario that can change within a decades time ?

   this anon is reaching imo. there‚Äôs so many factors they‚Äôre disregarding and if your child is sexually active. don‚Äôt you want them to be safe by taking possible alternatives ? you can‚Äôt keep an eye on your kids 24/7 and keep them locked away. no one is saying it‚Äôs ok, that it‚Äôs just possible.
  ","
  Reaching so much! It's bizarre at this point. That's what I've been saying the whole time. Like what could you really do after the fact? Besides make sure that everything is ok, open communication on s*x and everything else? I don't think they understand that the pill just isn't for pregnancy either or use condoms/both options. Agreed, so many factors. I was thinking with someone their own age yet they bring in ""consent is age 12, abuse "" and all these other things and that would be a whole different debate in itself!
  "
503025,"

  1. This is dumb to even debate further because you keep changing the topic over and over.
  
  how can you protect someone that's not real as well? There's no attachment there. I'd feel differently if i actually had a kid to protect.
  
  2. not everyone is a predator of young kids. I sure as hell wouldn't have those type of people around
  
  3. Nobody is fine with underage kids having s*x.
  
  4. I was thinking that it was ""consensual "" with someone their own age and here you go bringing in abuse and other stuff that makes me think you mean older people.

503026,"
   ‚ÄúIf 12 is consensual there then what is the problem??‚Äú Did you really type those words? The problem is they are children FFS! Any child engaging in s3x at that age is being abused or is acting out because they have been abused.

  peer pressure must not be a thing in your country? Abuse isn't always the answer to everything.
  
  This person reminds me of the Nike thing. its plastic... its not a real person people are upset over. Just like how this daughter isn't real lol

   You didn‚Äôt say she should, you said she‚Äôd do it ‚Äúanyways‚Äù so just put her on the Pill. A 12 year old child. It makes me really upset and angry that you would think so little of a child. Your OWN hypothetical one. One it would be your job to protect. A 12 year old is under the age of consent.
  ","
  That's out of context and you know it. Would you listen to a parent if they told you to not have sex? Highly doubt everyone would listen :p
  
  ""think so little of a child"" how so? I'd much rather have them be protected if they are going to do it regardless of how I'd feel about it. Again, the pill is not just for unwanted pregnancies. A child shouldn't be having sex at all.
  
  Also you expect a parent to be there 24/7 holding their hand? not letting them out of the house because omg a boy might look at them the wrong way? Here's a twist.. what if they were s*xually active with a girl? hmm
  
  Uh no.. 16/18 is the usual age for consent here.
  
  If 12 is consensual there then what is the problem?? Besides that the child would probably be with way older men and not someone their own age. That culture is gross. But you'd probably start praising it üòÇ
  
  it's funny how you keep adding stuff but still wont give an opinion on what you'd do.

   We are taking about a 12 YEAR OLD CHILD. If you think someone of that age is physically or emotionally ready for s3x then please NEVER have a child. And if you think putting her on the pill is a solution then you have no idea of its side effects on WOMEN let alone a CHILD. You are awful.
  ","
  ""clearly not mature for that"" yes.. exactly that.. physically and emotionally. Did i say that they should? No!!! god damn.
  
  Weight gain, acne and other hormonal side effects could happen. Also if they had bad periods then pills could help with that. its all about trail and error when finding the right combination anyways. talking in general here.
  
  SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO? You keep grasping at straws but won't share what you'd do if you had a young s*xually active daughter. Why ask this question if you, yourself, won't share how you'd handle the situation?

  literally had those fake celebrity pages tell him not to talk with me and now this weirdo blaming me because he doesn't talk with them as much? How would that be my fault? I just don't get people today! bad trolling at the very least???

  Dad was remodeling his childhood home and all the paranormal stuff occurred.
  
  - the first time we officially moved in my mom and I were watching tv. We moved from a 3 family house so naturally was used to other people making noise. It dawned on us at the same time that this was a legit house and nobody else was home/above us. We heard someone moving furniture  (at this time the whole upstairs was still being worked on - there was no furniture up there). We also heard someone going up and down the staircase.
  
  - A ghost in one of my prom pictures.
  
  - bullet casings rolling towards you on the floor where none were before
  
  - the kitchen ceiling was being taken down. His mom had a table with those Spanish mosaics on it and one of the tiles ended up falling down from the ceiling and landed right into my dad's shirt pocket.
  
  - my sister and her then ex were alone at the house and the smoke alarm kept beeping. They even took out the batteries and it was still going off.
  
  - I saw this weird shadow thing. It was just sitting at the table staring my way. I ended up trying to get a closer look at it. I then felt like I couldn't move, couldn't talk or scream. I felt frozen in place. Then a calmness settled over me. The shadow was gone. I went back to sleep. I know that I was awake since I don't dream of monster like stuff. It was really bizarre!

  One time in Maine, my mom and I were driving to the store at night. These ""people"" ended up coming out of thin air. We served. It looked like they were wearing old clothing and had a glow about them. When she served, they basically disappeared the next instant.

  I don't hate anyone but the closest person out of everyone would be my uncle's 2nd wife.
  
  Christian but doesn't help when someone was in need. It shouldn't have been a huge thing. My sister's last ex was into drugs and his mom had problems too. It was thanksgiving and they didn't have anywhere to go so you'd think it wouldn't have been a problem lol but nope, caused a huge thing.. my sister and them didn't end up going. Then when we went she did a huge speech on giving to others.. mentioned that she hoped they found a place to go etc like ??????? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ my mom wanted to kill her over that
  
  she's also fat phobic. My uncle's bathroom is pretty small on the 1st floor and she had to bring it up after i went the bathroom like i had a tight squeeze or was going to get stuck in there or something. like it wasn't that small? why be annoying?
  
  she's also one of those gossip type people. always wants to know what you are doing etc
  
  Sends cryptic updates on my nana making me think something is really  wrong. She's 90.. what do you expect? Sorry that she forgot a certain word momentarily. Also she sent a picture of them on mother's day together but it seemed more like a  ""you guys don't care because not in the same state"" type of sentiment instead of a normal reason to send a pic
