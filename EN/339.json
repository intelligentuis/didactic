clearly misinformed and has no basic understanding of the female anatomy .","313589":"the case i m working on pisses me the fuck off so much and i literally have to work on it in parts because of how overwhelming it is . i m so happy this judge got fired but tbh fuck him for writing this bullshit decision before that happened . he makes up his own case laws . he misrepresented the record a million times . he outright insulted the attorney who was representing the claimant . we asked him to recuse himself from the case and he said no . this case had four hearings and he canceled the second hearing because our attorney questioned him regarding why he wouldn t allow our private medical expert to testify . he set preconditions for our medical expert when it s strictly against rules and regulations . and he clearly shows bias against the claimant during the entire ordeal because the claimant is years old with severe and disabling psychiatric and neurological impairments , but the judge thinks he can work anyway . i am literally fuming and i m going to rip this judge a new asshole in my contentions response . fuck this guy .","313590":"if you re rupturing anything during sex ,

hilarious and i love them and want them to be my adoptive family .","313593":"it s actually pretty clean besides the laundry .","313594":"i m the same way tbh , i hate how i look of the time and i m my own worst critic . just keep reminding yourself that you re an amazing person who has survived through everything life has thrown at you , and if someone gives you shit about your appearance , then you don t need someone like that in your life . surround yourself with people who will raise you up and encourage you when you re feeling down .","313595":"i ve never understood the purpose of a break besides to simply keep that person on a close leash with the intent of returning to them if you can t find anything more substantial . if you re not happy in a relationship , then break up . give that

passed out drug addicts with the child in the backseat is inappropriate . drug addiction is stigmatized already , and it isn t necessary to use scare tactics when an innocent child is involved . drug addiction requires awareness , education , and rehabilitation . not a viral image that s currently being mocked and treated like a damn meme . black lives matter is an important movement , but lately it has been diverging society into sects instead of conjoining society under one just cause . mob mentality can be extremely dangerous , especially when misinformation is spread . everyone should have the right to receive an abortion if they need one , regardless of the reason why they became pregnant in the first place . the government has no place in medical procedures . body shaming goes both ways don t sit there and advocate for fatpositivity while simultaneously shaming skinny people for being skinny . it s hypocritical . the viral trend of being a feminist has corrupted the very meaning of being a feminist to begin with , making those with legitimate messages even harder to hear . social justice issues have become convoluted and people have become divided amongst themselves . i can simultaneously love animals and not be vegan . it s possible for people to have strong emotional ties to animals but be unable to survive without their products . people with mental illnesses do not exist to serve as an example to neurotypical people as to how not to behave . we are not your science experiment , and we never asked to be placed in the positions we re currently in . the only person who can define your gender is you and you alone . there s a different between your gender identity , your gender expression , your sexuality , and your sex . welfare recipients shouldn t be required to undergo drug testing in order to receive government assistance . i can t fit anything else , lol .","313608":"i m neuroatypical with unstable emotions and most of my rationalizations don t make sense . i live off of espresso and cigarettes . my career is in the field of legal writing . i m more emotionally invested in fictional characters and animals than i am in most people . i drive a red hyundai accent . i m agender and my pronouns are they them . i m left handed , which means i grew up without the luxury of using three ringed binders . i mainly play open world rpgs , such as fallout , skyrim , dragon age , etc . i also love halo , destiny , assassin s creed , tomb raider , and life is strange . my favorite shows are supernatural , ncis , criminal minds , parks and rec , bones , how i met your mother , american horror story , game of thrones , and bob s burgers . i prefer the scents of pine , mint , lavender , jasmine , rose petals , gasoline , cloves , patchouli , and dragon s blood .","313609":"glances at the millions of other askfm users","313610":"i don t remember the exact moment , but i do know i was fairly young my family has told me that i was an avid reader going back to when i was a child in elementary school , and apparently my cousin used to tease me because i would read the dictionary for fun , lol . i vaguely remember that call of the wild and black beauty were among my favorite novels at the time . as for more recently , i think my true passion really erupted when i began reading harry potter . i would get so emotionally invested in the characters , and i wanted my writing to have the same emotional impact on others as it had on me .","313611":"the entire guardians of the galaxy soundtrack is . ? ? ?","313612":". when people don t

clean up after themselves . it blows my mind .","313613":"no . isn t it just another q a site like askfm ?","313614":"like i briefly stated in my precious post , i don t like either candidate . trump is just an idiot who has no knowledge of politics , and i feel as if he s going to drive this country further into the ground than it already is . as for clinton , while i think i align myself with a few of her perspectives , i also feel as if i can t trust her . i ve always been hesitant to support her because i don t know what her intentions are . she can say one thing and then mean something else entirely . but she s also decades more politically involved than trump is , so i also feel like she would know what to do in the event of a crisis .","313615":"democrat , if i had to choose . i m fairly liberal in my views but i ve honestly never taken the time to look up the views of other party labels , because all they are are labels . i d rather look into what it is a person believes as opposed to which party they align themselves with .","313616":"i honestly have no idea anymore . initially i was going to choose between jill stein and gary johnson , but then i just read lakocis s recent post about third parties splitting up the democratic vote , which would only make trump stronger , and it makes complete sense . so honestly , idk if i m going to vote at all because i don t like either main party candidate . trump is an idiot and i can t trust clinton .","313617":"my first favorite video games , from what i can remember , were the classics like spyro the dragon and crash bandicoot and the original mario and legend of zelda . i was also really into the extreme sports games growing up , like the old tony hawk and dave mirra games . i had one tony hawk game for the gameboy color that i was in love with . as for now , i prefer open world rpgs like fallout , skyrim , dragon age , etc . and i ve also been getting more into fps games like halo and destiny !

there on , i did my own research .","313620":"the two concepts aren t mutually exclusive . you can pray for the people whose lives were lost and for their families while simultaneously disagreeing with the government s decision to go to war with the entire middle east . i know people who have personally lost family members in the attacks , and members of my own family worked in ground zero for months afterwards . i respect everyone who has been involved in the recovery process , but i can also still mourn the loss of the thousands of innocent lives in the middle east too .","313621":"aw

months sacrificing their time and health to search for survivors . as a long islander , this attack hit close to home as dozens of my classmates and teachers and relatives were waiting anxiously for their loved ones to return home . some couldn t come home until the next day because traffic halted . others didn t come home at all . i ve witnessed students breaking down during class in the years following on each anniversary as they were taken back to the day their parent , sibling , or relative never came home . please keep everyone in your prayers today . ? thank you .","313625":"aw ,

long enough to see your dreams unfold , and you should be alive to see the day where you are happy . these are all the numbers to suicide hotlines around the world . and if anyone needs to talk ,

something isn t registered with an official copyright , art is still considered the property of the original artist . they can only technically sue the shop for doing the tattoo if they make the tattoo without permission from the artist , if they profit from the tattoo which tattoo artists do , and i think if they have the art copyrighted with the government . but i also know artists who will refuse to do a tattoo of another artist s work unless they get permission first , because it s respectful and common courtesy . it s kinda shitty to tattoo a person s art without their knowledge , in my opinion . as much as i love the design , i d feel terrible lol .","313646":"i want this as a tattoo so badly but i m sure it would be copyright infringement from the original artist .","313647":"my

person , tbh .","313696":"this entire ordeal gets under my skin and makes me so angry . for the convictions he faced , he was looking at upwards of years in prison . prosecutors and parole officers recommended years . during trial , the judge ruled that he would serve months because it would have a detrimental effect on him . after only months , he got out on good behavior . you mean to tell me that a rxpist and registered sxx offender was released early for good behavior ? ? bull fucking shit . even after his arrest , he was described as the stanford swimmer . i read an article yesterday after his release , and he was still described as the stanford swimmer . his yearbook photo is still being used in news articles meanwhile , every other offender out there has a mugshot on the internet the second they re convicted ? ? his freedom was purchased . his freedom was privileged because he s a white male in a society that is overtly racist against other offenders who are poc . while others are serving years for minor drug offenses , this kid is released from prison after several rxpe charges after months . i m sorry , but no . this is something the public will have to and is probably going to take into their own hands . justice will be served .","313697":"what am i calming down from . . . ? ? i m confused .","313698":"no , my dad thinks he s the biggest asshole on the

?","313702":"look at this asshole , who does he think he is ? ?","313703":"unfortunately i have to deal with someone who is manipulative on a daily basis . some red flags deflecting blame from themselves onto other people regardless of how obvious it is that whatever happened was partially their fault . attempts at making other people feel guilty about their own decisions in an effort to direct attention towards themselves . interjection into other people s personal problems as a way of controlling the situation . showing a blatant disregard for other people s feelings if it doesn t directly contribute to their own agenda . selectively choosing problems to focus on instead of objectively viewing issues in their entirely i . e . making situations look like they re the victim instead of calculating the circumstance as a whole for everyone involved . threatening to do something hurtful if their wishes aren t granted and putting the responsibility on you . i can go on and on , tbh . but manipulative behavior isn t healthy and if you find yourself in a situation where a person is trying to manipulate you , please try to get out of that as fast as you can .","313704":"considering i live on long island , they re not the same place . . . at all . ? regardless , i have connections with both cities that i have posted publicly both on instagram and facebook

regardless of whether or not men are even there , tbh . why are you going to judge a person for how they choose to dress at an award ceremony that clearly doesn t have any restrictions on dress code ?

educated people can automatically find jobs and live a great life solely because they have a piece of paper saying so , lol . yeah , having a degree does give you a wider range of opportunities at times but so does having a license in a trade or a certificate in cosmetology or any other thing . we need to stop thinking that people who aren t college educated aren t contributing to society or to themselves because it s such a false perception to have .","313725":"college education is important , but what s more important is understanding that your level of education does not define your worth

emailed support for help regarding my computer and they were able to fix my computer for me . it s always been in circulation , so for people who s gender is fluid or have no gender at all , the concept of neutrality makes sense .","313747":"you don t have to get so over emotional , damn . i said that i think it d obnoxious if people push their wishlist onto others or ask people directly to

professional evaluation over the course of numerous weeks to develop an accurate diagnosis . if you have access to medical care , though , i see no reason for someone to self diagnose .","313755":"i

so i ll answer it from what i remember , lol . ways to save money for textbooks , never buy from your college s bookstore . i used to use chegg . com to rent textbooks for cheap , and then you mail them back at the end of the semester . they include shipping labels and everything , so you don t have to pay for that either . depending on how you get your food , colleges can have meal plans that you pay into at the beginning of the semester . if you don t have that , i d recommend splitting groceries with friends and buying things in bulk , since products cost less over time in bulk than if you bought them singularly . ignore this if you re dorming , but if you have to commute to school , try finding some friends to carpool with . it ll save you a lot of money on gas . my college also gave away cheap gas vouchers occasionally , so check with the activities board of your school and see what they have to offer . tips and tricks if you can t help it , don t take classes at am lmao . that was the death of me during college . always review your notes after class when you have the time to refresh your memory . i used to take my notes on my ipad and then transfer them over to a notebook because it helped me remember things better when i wrote it down . if you re going to a party , always bring a friend with you and have your drink in your hand at all times . you can never be too careful . study groups are a great way of making new friends and learning material . if you can make the material fun , you ll remember it better . look for campus activities and clubs , and don t

kafka running away from home to find his lost mother and sister and being taken under the wing of a trans man who works at a library . at the same time , you follow the storyline of an intellectually disabled man who helps track down lost cats for the people in his neighborhood . a gruesome murder occurs and strange things begin happening to both of the characters , until eventually their stories

under years old or younger and that person can or may be punished with up to years in prison . the younger the victim is , the more severe the punishment . note that this means if you are years or younger , you cannot legally consent , regardless of whether the other person is the same age or not . this . which still worries me , but at least the law is very specific regarding consent .","313810":"you have to understand that your personal experiences the reality of the world , though . your tiny bubble of a social circle cannot and will never accurately represent the entirely of the globe , and just because you know of girls who use abortion as a means of birth control doesn t mean that everyone else does too . i agree that using abortion as a method of birth control is a bit foolish , considering how expensive abortions are . . . but in regards to the concept of pro choice vs pro life , these girls should still have that option . to deny someone their right to have an abortion just because it doesn t align with your own personal moral compass is just as unethical .","313811":"i m jealous of people who can live their daily lives without worrying about anxieties , or if they ll be caught in a situation where their mood rapidly changes and there s no way out , or something along those lines . i have anxiety and i over think everything on a daily basis , and it prevents me from doing a lot of things that i wish i can do without a second thought . it would be nice to magically make my brain calm down and experience life without illness .","313812":"actually , science supports the notion that human beings aren t meant to be monogamous creatures . it s also been proven that easy access to gynecological health clinics , such as planned parenthood or private practices , result in less people having unwanted pregnancies overall due to the spread of education regarding sex and contraception . but , i agree with you on one point if someone isn t ready to have a child , why should that child have to be born and suffer with a parent who obviously doesn t want them ? ? why should that child have to be thrown into an unjust foster system where children are subjected to trauma regularly ? ? nobody deserves that kind of pain .","313813":"regardless of how you view people who choose to sleep with multiple partners because there s nothing inherently wrong with that they re still human beings in control of their own bodies they still deserve to be given the choice of what to do with their own bodies . you cannot dictate what someone can and cannot

, alien artifacts , and the happenings of area . he has a hundred books on the subject , i swear . i ve always assumed it was a government plot of land where they tested out nuclear missiles and other technologically advanced wartime weapons systems , though . it s out of the public eye , it s in the middle of nowhere , and guards are heavily armed for people who get too close . i ve always enjoyed reading the conspiracy theories , but idk how much faith i actually have in them .","313815":"i m pro choice . the government should not exist to dictate what s medically right and wrong to do with our bodies . there s no legal or ethical reason to have government involvement in something that s a medical issue . bodily autonomy is the concept that only we can make choices regarding our own bodies . therefore , if a person who is pregnant decides to terminate a pregnancy , they should be allowed that freedom of choice . bodily autonomy exists for corpses who are no longer alive , so there is no reason for it not to exist to pregnant individuals . forcing a person to have a child puts a detrimental physical and mental strain on their health . some people are not medically apt to have children , and it would be putting them at a fatal risk to prevent them from receiving an abortion , if they so choose . many psychotropic medications have to be stopped during pregnancy , which

mumps , rubella , pertussis , smallpox , and polio . even if you don t believe your child is at risk of contracting a disease , that doesn t necessarily mean they can t carry the disease to more susceptible people with weaker immune systems , i . e . the elderly and children . vaccinations prevent disease for not only the person getting the vaccine , but also those around them . vaccinations

contracting a fatal illness later in life .","313817":"fucking clowns . clowns scare the shit out of me for some reason , i don t even know why . i even hated them when i was a child , i would have

needed to try to keep my cool since i needed the money . i ve had a lot of really nice customers over the years who complimented me on my customer service , though . they were all usually photo

evaluation because he previously tried to kill his girlfriend , so the cops had to be called to calm him down . i said to my coworker , okay . . . that seems upsetting , but i m glad they re ok . and she was like , yeah , i mean he s schizoaffective , so yeah . . . . like , was that supposed to mean something ? ? like was she implying that mentally ill people were dangerous ? ? idk i got kind of

she shrugged her shoulders a little and went , well maybe you just miss him . it could be something as simple as that . idk why but it really . . . got under my skin in a weird way . there s a difference between me missing someone and then me lapsing into depression because i m alone and then i further isolate myself because my mind goes crazy and into overdrive mode . like . . . she didn t mean anything bad by it , i know , but i feel like she s downplaying my feelings ? ? or perhaps i m just really bad at describing my symptoms or minimizing my symptoms ? ? idk anymore , i see my

races in terms of education , career opportunities , and other social and political platforms because of these pre conceived misconceptions . the entire point of the recent blm movement is to raise awareness of this unnecessary stigma and the inherent racism that s so ingrained in society today , to the point where a lot of people aren t even conscious of it . me pointing out that there is a historical and sociological explanation behind modern racism doesn t mean that i m personally racist . these ideologies aren t stemming from my personal points of view , this is a model of our society

.","313950":"waking up with my love , having breakfast and coffee and smokes outside on the deck , taking a lovely shower together , etc . as for what to do , what i d want to do would be determined by my mood since it s unpredictable . but usually it d likely involve relaxing around the house , playing video games or watching a movie , or perhaps going out to the movies or to the park ! ! my favorite days are the ones where we get to spend quality time together , ones that are peaceful and relaxing , and ones that don t involve anyone else because other people are exhausting .","313951":"i don t know and i really don t care to know , lol . google is your friend .","313952":"there was a lot of controversy over the song because it seems to trivialize the idea of consent and date rxpe . if you look up the wikipedia page about the song , it goes into a lot of detail regarding the meaning behind the song , it s criticism , and thicke s rebuttal .","313953":"because i keep hearing people refer to themselves or objects as crazy and psycho and ocd and it really pisses me off .","313954":". . . when you think you re pregnant . . . ? ? um .","313955":"it isn t right of you to ask them not to go if someone you didn t like was there . that doesn t mean you don t trust that person that means you don t trust your partner around them . if they still go regardless , i can see how that would turn into a problem because then that means they re not respecting your feelings . however , if this actually happened to a couple , i would feel sorry for them because it can only mean they have really poor communication skills , lol .","313956":"yes . and i m not in the mood today to have a discussion about it , so you can save us both the energy and take your arguments elsewhere . thank you .","313957":"oh my god , do they . lmao . it s going to be a riot , whenever it happens . especially considering of his family still lives down in miami and they d fly up here in a heartbeat . i m also going to a greek croatian wedding next year and i m part of the bridal party , so that s going to be very fun as well ! !","313958":"i m indifferent to it . the idea of living a life with my partner is more important to me than the concept of marriage . but i m pretty certain that marriage is very important to him due to his culture .","313959":"ahh , yes ! ! i love halestorm a lot , and i used to like the pretty reckless but i haven t listened to them in a long time . for a while i was really into symphonic metal like nightwish , within temptation , and lacuna coil , but lately i ve just been meh . . . my taste in music changes as rapidly as my mood , haha .","313960":"i can honestly see us getting married and starting a family together . we ve been dating for almost seven years , so it s bound to happen eventually , lol . i m incredibly happy with him , though . we had an incredibly rough and tumultuous beginning , and granted we endured some shit that i realistically shouldn t have tolerated , but we re much different people now and i m grateful that we ve changed for the better . i can see myself growing older with him and still having just as much fun as when we first met , that spark has never disappeared .","313961":"rob zombie and white zombie love . i have a playlist on spotify dedicated to most of my favorite hard rock songs because they all make me feel empowered in a weird , raw , animalistic way ? ? if that makes sense ? ?","313962":"i don t download music anymore . i use spotify , and according to my app , the last song i listened to was dragula by rob zombie . idk why i like the song so much , i ve just always loved dirty , gritty hard rock and metal music .","313963":"sleep . drink coffee . play video games . sleep some more . you know , same thing i do every weekend . i m so exhausted though , yikes .","313964":"thanks for your honesty ! !","313965":"i don t give my snapchat username out to anons . anyways do you guys think i d be able to pull off the half shaved look ? ? i was brushing my hair and realized i could mimic the style , and i think i like it but idk if it would look foolish .","313966":"aaahhh thank you ! ?","313967":"well yeah , that s a given . i meant within the states , though .","313968":"you underestimate the power of my own brain .","313969":"if i really wanted to try it , i d just drive up the road to that place that just opened . tbh i d feel a lot better with a professional guiding me than me trying to haphazardly do it on my own , lol .","313970":"a place near where i live just opened and they have those sensory deprivation float tanks , i ve kinda been wanting to try it but i m afraid i ll have a meltdown .","313971":"society as a whole is desensitized to violence , chaos , and war . we look at videos of people getting blown away by bombs and children being torn from their families , and we feel nothing . it only makes sense for some teenagers to find thrill in violence because they haven t mentally developed enough to make that connection between reality and theory .","313972":"considering your heart s purpose is to pump blood throughout the body and holds no neural activity whatsoever , i think it s safe to say that your feelings originate within your brain .","313973":"tw sxxual assault abuse ! ! this article is so sad and just proves we need more education regarding consent laws , gender bias , and the idea that males can t get rxped . i feel so bad for this guy because he was literally blacked out you can t give consent if you re not conscious , and i have no idea how that girl was able to twist it around so that she was the victim ? ? even after she sent text messages acknowledging that she did something wrong ? ? omg . this shit just pisses me off , and it proves that there needs to be more awareness so that this doesn t happen as it does .","313974":"nutella is disgusting . mimosas aren t classy , they re a guaranteed stomach ache because of the alcohol acidic orange juice , yuck . you re not eating real pizza unless you re in new york and i m not counting upstate . . . that also goes for bagels and egg sandwiches .","313975":"i don t think you re quite understanding me , maybe i m not making myself very clear ? ? i never said it was wrong for men to be masculine . my boyfriend is the most masculine , macho lumberjack man that i know lol . i also have my fair share of masculine features , as well . and people will always flip flop between masculinity and femininity , it exists on a spectrum so we ll always slide back and forth between the two poles . what i believe needs to be changed in society is the expectation for men to be masculine when they naturally don t show those features , when they naturally are perhaps drawn to femininity instead of being aligned with masculinity like society expects them to be . these men are patronized , harassed by their peers , and sometimes even killed because people still believe that having feminine qualities is bad . women aren t dictating anything in that respect , and none of the people i know who are feminists would ever say that they re dictating men to behave a certain way because that would be totally hypocritical . hope this clears things up ! !","313976":"it can go in one of two ways their relationship actually isn t as pleasant as the person is making it out to be , so by posting about the positive qualities online or even embellishing on their experiences , they re attempting to prove to themselves that their relationship is healthier than it actually is . they have nobody else to talk to about their relationship because perhaps their only friend is their partner , so the internet becomes a diary for them to share their experiences .","313977":"i understand that completely . but men also shouldn t be harassed , hurt , or even killed for displaying feminine qualities as well . a lot of people , men and women and everyone else in between , still hold onto the notion that being a man means to display all of those alpha qualities , and that someone is less of a man if they don t .","313978":"i agree . what s wrong , however , is the pressure for men to be hypermasculine and or giving men the impression that being feminine bad because it isn t being masculine .","313979":"this is why i enjoy the unfollow option on facebook now , haha . or i ll just delete them off if my friends list . i don t really have much tolerance for that sort of thing .","313980":"the media completely sexualizes men too , but it isn t often discussed . if you look at advertisements for men s products , they re all toned with abs , broad shoulders , muscular arms , angled faces , etc etc . there s a lot of pressure on men to look a particular way as well due to hypermasculinity .","313981":"you obviously are new to my page if you re under the assumption that i don t discuss the issues against men as well .","313982":"they re using sex appeal to sell products , so by definition , yes . however , i can t criticize them too much because i love victoria s secret clothing , lmao .","313983":"well , inherently yeah it s pretty damn sexist . but if you want your product to beat out the competition , throwing in nudity to be edgy is unfortunately one of the better ways to do it . society is overrun by sex appeal , and something like that would have people talking about the product moreso than an advertisement that was modest in comparison .","313984":"from a marketing perspective , it creates competition . the women they re selling the product to are being taught that they can be more appealing to men by buying the product . these women , in the company s eyes , don t want other women to be seem in the same light of sex appeal . so it creates competition among all of these women to purchase these products with the most sex appeal , thereby skyrocketing profits . it sounds horribly sexist , but that s the only way i can think of it in terms of marketing .","313985":"what the fuck . i hate humans , omg . this is why my friends and i only play private sessions or crew only sessions , randoms are just too fucking ruthless .","313986":"i was talking about activism in general , actually . feminism doesn t limit itself to just one sort of oppression .","313987":"that or they get hit on simply for being a woman because it s hot . one time , my boyfriend was playing halo under my gamertag with my character and he got like messages from strangers that were like heyyyyyy xxx . just because my character was a girl . like , seriously ? ? lmao .","313988":"i don t really understand the point in it , it s good to have your own space and privacy should be respected , but i would never want to raise my children in a household where they lock themselves in their room and are afraid to talk to me .","313989":"oh god yeah , the gaming community is wrought with sexism and misogyny . a lot of people don t consider women to be real gamers or they automatically assume that someone who s a woman is automatically a bad player , especially in regards to first person shooters . i ve never dealt with it myself because i don t like playing live games with randoms , but i ve heard horror stories from some of my friends who have been insulted and harassed just for being a woman .","313990":"idk where you come from , but bedroom doors don t have locks in most of the houses i ve been in ? ? unless it s like the master bedroom .","313991":"sorry , i had no idea we were still in middle school where kids lived their lives according to what was cool ! !","313992":"lol , same ! ! i m sure a lot of people think it s attention seeking , but i honestly don t care very much . it s moreso for the sake of my own peace of mind rather than anyone else s . i ve always had an obsession with numbers though , it can be both a good and bad thing .","313993":"i m so nitpicky when it comes to my askfm page , both my inbox and my answers . i try to answer as many questions as i can , and if i can t think of a good answer , i ll either say so or delete it depending upon who asked it . also , i keep my answers really organized and clean . if an answer doesn t have likes on it , i ll delete it because i have an unhealthy preoccupation with numbers and it bothers me if there s too much things unrecognized because it makes me feel cluttered .","313994":"i mean , i get it because of health concerns and whatnot but that s what chlorine is for . . . also , i honestly think a little kid pissing in the pool might be more hazardous than a wee bit of menstrual blood , but that s none of my business .","313995":"www . google . com","313996":"i d say my page is a bit of both . i use askfm to educate myself and the others around me , but i ve also made a lot of good friends in the process . as for how i stumbled on askfm , i honestly don t remember . i just remember making the jump after formspring . me died off .","313997":"no , the gendering of material items is solely for marketing purposes and generally has no reflection on how good of a product it is . women s razors are sold at a higher price because women are pressured to shave more often than men , so companies make more profit off of them .","313998":"while this is accurate for the rest of the us , idk if it would apply here because the majority of the people who live in this area are black and hispanic , and the judge was also black . so i don t think it would have really made much of a difference . however , my lack of a record definitely did .","313999":"i went to court this morning and knocked off all of the points that would have gone on my license ! ! i was facing points , but the prosecutor talked to the judge and decided on points and i paid a fine associated with a parking violation . aaahhh i m so happy ! !","314000":"i think it s a cute idea . i wouldn t personally buy one myself if i was single , but i think it s good that you re seeing more promotion for self love as opposed to all of the media that enforces girls to be someone s girlfriend instead of their own individual .","314001":"i m doing better today , thank you ! ! it comes and goes in waves , and today was a good day for me because i ve been wedding planning and i m also seeing my boyfriend later tonight , so yeah . hopefully i can hold onto this good mood for a while .","314002":"i went to a wedding venue tonight for a taste testing ! ! my best friend is getting married so she needs to find a nice venue .","314003":"considering my paycheck is so low , of it isn t really that much money . so i d gladly sacrifice of my paycheck if it meant that trump doesn t win the nomination , rofl . my only stipulation would be that another , better candidate takes his place . so at least there s a presidential race and we re not guaranteed clinton either , because that would be equally as bad .","314004":"yes , of course . men also struggle with coming to terms with sa , and for some reason there s barely any awareness of sa against men .","314005":"five years ago , i thought i d be at a great job and living independently and all that jazz . i can only hope that this happens in another five years .","314006":"lol i wonder how many people fell for this bullshit .","314007":"but wouldn t that cause a parabolic destabilization of the fission singularity ?","314008":"not anymore , no . five years ago , though , i only surrounded myself with terrible influences .","314009":"it isn t harmless because it s still associating mental illness violence . considering i know people with did and they wouldn t hurt a damn fly , it s inherently false . most media portrays violent killers and murderers and criminals as having a mental illness , which is so inaccurate that it physically hurts . people who are mentally ill are more apt to hurt themselves than anyone else , and it s been proven that the majority of violent crimes were committed by people without mental illness .","314010":"you can simultaneously be a feminist and a muslim . just ask the feminists on this site who are also muslim . as for myself , i m not going to judge someone based on their religion because that s unethical . everyone has the freedom to follow their respective religions .","314011":"it s an opinion from one guy . while i agree that obviously some people are antisemitic , i don t think it s justified to judge an entire movement as a whole based on those people because the whole point of feminism is to bring awareness to things like antisemitism and show others why it s wrong .","314012":"you obviously don t know me very well if you think i dismiss everything that goes against my own opinion . to do such a thing would be unrealistic and immature , obviously not everyone has the same opinions .","314013":"the people you re following obviously aren t educated advocates then .","314014":"i love autumn the most because of the crisp , cold air the changing colors of the tree leaves the seasonal flavors and trends halloween and the fact that i don t have to worry about bees or mosquitos .","314015":"if you re depressed about just one thing , then that isn t exactly depression .","314016":"i was really proud of myself when i took this shot , the focus came out perfect at the time , i was using a film camera and had to use the manual focus settings because the automatic setting was broken .","314017":"i m undecided on this , actually . on the one hand , i feel as if giving students the option of volunteer work would mean they would equate volunteering punishment . in addition , it wouldn t help them at all from an academic standpoint , which often is the reason why they re in detention in the first place . on the other hand , volunteering and community service work both give people a strong sense of responsibility and shows them what hard manual labor and dedication looks like , which is also very important . idk , i can t make up my mind about it .","314018":"if you re a parent and you need your phone or another material possession as a reminder that your child is in the back seat of your car , then you re a shit parent . i posted something like this on fb a long time ago , and one of my old friends from high school who has a year old daughter wrote me and said , hey ! humans aren t perfect and sometimes we forget , it doesn t make us a bad parent ! and idk how i honestly felt about it . perhaps it would be different if i was a parent myself , but how could you ever possibly forget that your child is in your car , thus putting them at risk for immediate medical danger ? ? i honestly don t get it . if anyone is a parent who follows me and has a different opinion , please let me know because this is something i genuinely have a hard time understanding .","314019":"i can t take credit for this beautiful work of art , but this quote and artwork is spot on .","314020":"i m honestly laughing , i m glad i woke up in the middle of the night to this nonsense","314021":"i m fairly certain that based on this small conversation alone , i have a broader understanding of medicine and especially of mental illness than you do . but thanks for the entertainment , have a lovely night . cc themedicalcanereturnzz since he s an actual medical doctor","314022":"engineering has nothing to do with medicine . . . ? my boyfriend is an engineer and the only thing college has taught him about science is physics and mathematics , lol get the fuck outta here .","314023":"sex is consensual . rxpe is not . therefore , rxpe isn t sex . people don t say that they had sex with an offender . they say that the offender rxped them . there s a huge difference between the two .","314024":"is it bad that this actually made me panic slightly because it feels like just started ? ? what the hell happened to the time . idk , started off really badly for me health wise . tbh it s all been a blur since then , i ve just been working nonstop and juggling that with maintaining my health and all of the extra social obligations in between . i haven t had much time to myself , but i m hoping that changes within the next few months once i start to accumulate pto again . as for goals , i want to do things for myself without the fear of judgment . i want to go on a fucking vacation . i wish i could be more spontaneous but it s basically impossible because of my schedule haha .","314025":"if you have the time in class to do so , then yeah ! ! people tend to learn best when there s something familiar they can associate it with . also history tends to repeat itself , so it s practical to point out those historical trends .","314026":"i like talking about feminism and mental health , so i can only hope that i ve been able to educate people in those areas at least somewhat . it s all a learning process though . everyone i follow , and even some of my anonymous followers , have educated me as well so it comes full circle .","314027":"dogmeat . that s it . that s all i care about .","314028":"my hair is getting too long . i can t stand it . i haven t changed up my look in almost a year , and i haven t colored my hair in what feels like forever . i want to do it so badly , i may take the risk and hit up one of my friends who recently got her cosmetology license but i ve never gotten my hair done by her before and i don t want her to fuck it up , lmao .","314029":"well if it wasn t for medication , i would have been dead last february . this also applies to thousands of other people who need medication to survive . mental illness , and especially depression , is a disorder of the brain . if you can magically rid yourself of depression through thinking happy thoughts , then you ve never experienced depression at all . this stigma that mental illness can be cured through means other than medicine and therapy needs to end , so many people are dying because society enforces them to believe that they don t need their doctor s recommendations .","314030":"cont when children grow up with violent media and end up being desensitized to violence or killing people is it ok to call that a mental problem ? tw suxcide ! ! jfc your teacher sounds like a horrible person . if they had any education whatsoever , they d know that most violent crime isn t committed by people with mental illnesses at all . but to say that being desensitized to violence is a mental problem is also inherently wrong . everyone has been desensitized to violence and murder , it s in our media and video games and on every tv screen . something of that level of collectiveness can t be considered a mental illness because it s a product of societal conditioning .","314031":"no , it isn t worth it and being verified literally does nothing on the site besides give you a blue check mark next to your name .","314032":"almost all of the people i talk to who support blm advocate it in peaceful means .","314033":"they did , but don t worry . they re doing quite well ! !","314034":"perhaps it s just me being old and cynical , but i think high school students should focus more on their education and preparing for college instead of protesting for their right to wear crop tops to class .","314035":"how many of their brothers and sisters are being led to slaughter .","314036":"watching my boyfriend play seven days to die .","314037":". . . if a boat or a car reminds you of a vagina , then i cannot help you any more than i already have , may god have mercy on your soul .","314038":". . . wow , this just goes to show how shitty the foreign language department of my high school was . i m like sure we were taught le car was the french word for car . lmao .","314039":"i can get behind that idea . the feminism that is seen as radical is often not even feminism at all because it precludes the experiences of poc , mentally ill , transgender , and other oppressed groups . radical feminism these days has equated to white feminism , which is essentially advocating for white women who don t experience other intersecting forms of oppression other than their sex .","314040":"i think it s a combination of linguistics and the passing down of tradition through the ages . in languages other than english , many nouns are gendered like le or la preceding the noun in french . houses are feminine , cars are masculine , etc . additionally , many people equated the concept of a container to a mother s womb . it was a vessel transporting life from one existence to the next . cars , ships , planes , trains , etc . have taken on that feminine pronoun to refer to that object as a giver of life and a fortress .","314041":"my previous account leighlothlorien got suspended , so that s probably why ! ! i ve only had this current account for less than two weeks . thank you for the concern though ! ! and don t worry about it , it s really no big deal . i ve just been browsing a bunch of people s pages and liking things because my askfm feed has been completely dead .","314042":"i m sorry that you ve had to endure that , friend . unfortunately when it comes to basically any mental illness that isn t depression or anxiety , most of the public is severely misinformed . in any circumstance , the best thing you can do is take care of yourself . you don t need that kind of negative energy in your life , and obviously someone who s blatantly humiliating you about your mental illness isn t worth having in your life . sometimes you can try to educate someone all you want in the simplest terms , and they still won t understand . take care of yourself , and thank you so much for this message ! !","314043":"i could kiss this smushy face all day , omfg .","314044":"as much as i feel connected to the mountains and the forest , i just as equally love the sea .","314045":"i could , but it would be a hell of a lot easier for me just to say that if it s a question that you wouldn t ask a person walking on the street , then don t think it s an acceptable question to ask someone on the internet .","314046":"my babes .","314047":"the american dream was a concept that was only ever achieved by the top , in my opinion . especially during the s when the idea of the american dream was at its peak . the idea was that a person could be perfectly happy as long as they had a nuclear family , a middle class suburban home , a white picket fence , a husband with an office job , and a housewife . how many people really had that lifestyle back then ? ? how many people could say that they have this lifestyle now without experiencing financial struggle ? ? the middle class is disappearing , families aren t perfect , and the concept that such an ideal described above is the dream completely precludes the struggles that poc , single mothers and fathers , lgbtqia people , the mentally ill , the disabled , and others faced .","314048":"i literally couldn t find a single candid shot of myself where i didn t look like a smol child , lmao .","314049":"same , tbh . and when i emailed askfm to see what happened and try to ask for my account back , they passively told me no and bolded the askfm guidelines where it says no bullying or something along those lines . i was so pissed at first because if anyone knows me , they know that i m the last person who would bully anymore . but i m over it . i m kinda happy for the fresh start , actually .","314050":"there s honestly no story behind it , i just thought it was a beautiful image . it combines my love of fascination with death and love of nature . it seemingly represents the duality of life and death and how flowers can bloom from decay .","314051":"yes , my necklace pictured below . it was a gift from my boyfriend for my birthday last year , and it s essentially a symbol of his promise to me to be more supportive and make more sacrifices for us . he hasn t disappointed me yet .","314052":"eventually in the future , yes . it s funny because years ago i never wanted children , but the more i see my friends children and interact with them , the more i eventually want children of my own . ? i can also see my boyfriend being a terrific father because we have the same perspectives when it comes to parenting and he s wonderful with kids .","314053":"fun fact , they actually make edible , safe cookie dough now specifically for those who love the taste of cookie dough so that they don t run the risk of getting sick from the raw food . ?","314054":"say what now . obesity occurs due to a myriad of factors calorie input output , thyroid function , hormone imbalances from other vital organs , genetic factors , side effects of medication , etc . it s unethical to assume that just because a child is obese that it means their parents are abusing or neglecting them . the child could have a medical condition causing unnecessary weight gain , for example . but it s definitely not comparable to abuse . i think that s extremely inappropriate to suggest , especially in the face of abuse survivors who have had to live with abusive parents for years .","314055":"i wouldn t pose with a cigarette in my hand if i didn t have the intention of smoking it . lmao . also , does anyone else find it mildly discomforting that we can now save other people s profile pictures to our phones . . . ?","314056":"looks at my profile pic no , the lit cigarette in my hand is purely for aesthetic reasons .","314057":"absolutely . the black lives matter movement is extremely important , especially in light of the recent injustices committed by law enforcement . to deny that police brutality against the black community has become increasingly racist and out of hand is essentially encouraging these acts of injustice to continue . by taking a stand of neutrality , you re ultimately aiding the oppressor .","314058":"i think it really depends what s in their past and how much of an impact it s made on who they are now . in terms of relationships , i think it s probably important to tell your current partner if you were ever previously married , divorced , or widowed . no doubt that has an impact on how you view relationships and how you behave in one . everything else can come with time and trust , especially regarding uncomfortable topics like if they ve ever been arrested , hospitalized , undergone trauma , etc . that goes on a really individual basis , though , so a collective claim can t be made for everyone .","314059":"i mean i d be stoked if someone gifted me gummy worms especially sour gummy worms , yum , but i m trash , so .","314060":"no ? ? that sorta ruins the point of giving someone a gift . also , it s her birthday . you can t expect someone to give you a gift back if you re giving them a birthday gift . that s honestly just rude .","314061":"you re about to have a cigarette and then get yourself a huge bowl of salted caramel ice cream ? ? oh , wait . that s me .","314062":"as far as documentation is concerned , sure . but how many trans people do you expect are willing to report to census records about their gender ? ?","314063":"me too , it s surprising when an anon actually apologizes for rude behavior ! ! haha .","314064":"shoving pizza into my mouth hole and watching a show about forensic investigations re murder cases .","314065":"wow , thank you so much . this actually means a lot to me . thank you for taking time out of your day to tell me this .","314066":"i believe that our souls spirits whatever you want to call them continue on after death , as death is merely the deterioration of our physical forms . it s extremely hard for me to grasp the idea that this life is the only concept of life we ve ever given . as for what happens to our souls , idk . i always compared our souls to energy as it cannot be destroyed , only transfered . i d like to think that perhaps we become the essence of another being or living thing in this universe .","314067":"i think i look the same , but idk i literally took the pic on the left just now . also , the picture where i m wearing makeup was taken months ago so my face probably looks a little different naturally . . . i actually think my face got thinner since then ? ?","314068":"there s a huge homeless population whose rights are rarely considered in social forums . a large portion of the homeless are lgbt and trans youth , the mentally ill , and veterans .","314069":"my boyfriend just got over sun poisoning so i understand your worry . the skin is incredibly versatile so it ll bounce back within a few days . and sometimes even after the burn goes away , you ll be left with a nice tan as long as you don t peel the skin off .","314070":"yeah . first , it s insinuating that you expect them to do so simply due to the fact that they re homeless . second , if you re choosing to give them money out of charity , it isn t your place to tell someone how to spend that money . and third , even if they did , it s just rude to tell that to someone , especially if they struggle with an addiction .","314071":"i never saw the movie , but allegedly it s a great film for children to learn about racial oppression ? ?","314072":"this basically defines my relationship with of my family . we see my aunt and uncle and cousins once or twice per year for holidays , but it s always out of a routine obligation . i managed to get out of it a few times in recent years when i was required to work holidays in retail , but i have no excuse with my current job now that i have weekends and holidays off , lol .","314073":"both , honestly . for someone to completely reject the idea of love means that they ve been so terribly hurt in the past that any notion of love or intimacy puts them into a panicked , defensive state of mind . which is sad , because often the strongest thing to come to terms with those feelings is finding a person who loves you so genuinely that you can feel comfortable enough to break down your walls .","314074":"i just finished eating a bacon , egg , and cheese breakfast wrap from the deli . unfortunately , i cannot post a photo because it s already being digested . ? as for what i m drinking , it s coffee . my first love .","314075":"i d love to be a novelist or a freelance writer , working from the comfort of my own home with my own little office . i think i d be much more motivated if i had my own personal space to do my work .","314076":"lol yes , my boyfriend had one ex girlfriend in particular who posed somewhat of a problem for our relationship towards the very beginning . she d constantly message me and tell me that she was going to take him back and to watch myself around him . there was also another completely different girl with whom my boyfriend had a one night stand and she ended up sending me death threats over facebook one day . thankfully both of them now have completely moved one , they both have long term relationships of their own and one of them is pregnant . thank god for maturity .","314077":"you re the only person who has asked me a question about conspiracy theories , actually ! ! i find them extremely interesting , but i don t know enough about most of them to determine which ones i think are true and false . i know people debate about the moon landing , but i think that event was real . i d like to receive more questions about them tbh , it s a good way to learn more about the theories that are out there so i can formulate an opinion for myself . also sorry i haven t answered your mandela question , i haven t had the time to research it yet","314078":"i don t have anything against people who are against against abortion for themselves . however , if you mean people who are adamantly pro life and push their agenda onto everyone else then i honestly think they re inconsiderate and ignorant to the effects an unwanted pregnancy can have on someone who isn t ready to be pregnant . abortion is a medical procedure that people utilize to terminate the unwanted fertilization of an egg in their uterus . being pregnant can have devastating effects on a person who isn t ready for children , in a financial , mental , and environmental sense . if someone who is against abortion cannot understand why the procedure is necessary for some , then i can t respect them as an individual .","314079":"pap feet what would you do to me if i shrunk down to the size of an ant do you have your tonsils why do you support men if you re a feminist why are you depressed like seriously people , shut the fuck up and learn some common manners and decency .","314080":"since i haven t posted a selfie in a while .","314081":"i don t know the context behind the quote , but it appears to be extremely misandrous and biased , which makes me uncomfortable .","314082":"i probably shouldn t have chuckled as much as i did .","314083":"somewhat . i have a strong sense of intuition at times , but i try not to rely on it because it doesn t necessarily mean it s reliable .","314084":"my first instinct is to get angry and question why , but then i remember that it s just an answer on a social media website and i have no real reason to stress about it .","314085":"probably not , it s impossible to go anywhere where i live without a vehicle and i m not a fan of public transportation .","314086":"i ve never had a teacher who was as horrible as umbridge , but when i was in th grade , i had an earth science teacher who had a lot of anger and personal issues which he brought to the classroom . . . he ended up throwing desks across the room , a student s binder out the window , etc . we later found out he was on cocaine for the majority of his lessons .","314087":"my best friend helped me temporarily leave a bad situation , but it was more accidental than anything else . . . however , if it wasn t for her , i probably wouldn t have stuck it out until the end . her support definitely helped reinstall a sense of hope within me without it , i likely would have killed myself at a very young age .","314088":"strange , i didn t realize that answering questions on askfm suddenly meant that my intelligence exists no longer . hm , who knew ?","314089":"yikes please don t . just leigh , thank you very much .","314090":"international delight ! !","314091":"respect the dead as you d respect the living . it s just common courtesy , desecrating a grave or a body is one of the most disrespectful things you can do . in other news , should i take a nap or have a cup of coffee ? ? i m so undecided .","314092":"i d love to visit new orleans in general due to the rich history , and the cemeteries are just a plus ! ! just another item on my bucket list lol .","314093":"i ve always personally believed in the concept of souls . it s incredibly difficult for me to grasp the concept that this life is all i have , and once my body has deteriorated into the earth , there s simply nothing . it makes the concept of life seem pretty futile .","314094":"i think that s a nice idea to have some sort of a gallery . i just don t know why the staff is choosing to update all of these aesthetic technicalities instead of focusing their energy on more meaningful changes , like to the reporting and blocking system .","314095":"i don t use tumblr .","314096":"broad generalizations like these typically are rarely , if ever , true .","314097":"i strongly advocate for pro choice in regards to unwanted pregnancies . i believe people should be given the right to choose what to do with their own bodies , and the government should not dictate something that s medically oriented . that being said , i ve never been able to wrap my head around pro life arguments . the only rationale i understand is if a person has terrible or traumatic experiences regarding abortion , and of the time , they re not militant in their opinions anyway . most of the other pro life arguments i ve seen were logically medically false or based in false interpretations of religious text .","314098":"i think it depends on the severity of the crime . things such as felonies should be made available to know to the public for employers to see , especially if it s things like robbery or manslaughter or murder . lesser offenses can sometimes be taken off the record after serving the time for it , so i don t really think it s necessary for people to know those details .","314099":"probably not , it s a cosmetic procedure more than anything else because there s nothing medically wrong with my teeth . if i had the money , i d rather allocate it towards something else .","314100":"you ll usually know immediately if you re not doing the right thing based upon the reactions of other people or your own personal feelings retrospectively .","314101":"stereotypes aren t fun , kid .","314102":"one of the single most disgusting sentences i ve ever read . i hope you realize that most muslims will denounce isis and tell you that they don t represent any of the core values of islam . that s the same thing as saying no christians no wbc . but of course nobody will ever say that , right ?","314103":"that s not insulting at all , and honestly , i m definitely not surprised that the us is behind all of europe in terms of education . especially considering the fact that you stated germany doesn t have the best school system , but you were taught more languages than most public high schools can even offer students . in my high school , we only had the option of learning french , spanish , or italian and we couldn t pick more than one .","314104":"no , my gender has nothing to do with my opinions and it wasn t a decision i ve ever made for myself . i ve just always grown up not relating to ideas associated with women , but also not relating to ideas associated with men . i ve always considered myself nonbinary and outside of the realm of regular gender norms . agender is typically seem as genderless , in which the person either slides fluidly between the gender binary , but doesn t adhere to any particular gender construct , or doesn t relate to a gender identity at all .","314105":"not at all . i don t know much about private schools , but the public school systems are incredibly under funded and under staffed . students aren t getting adequate educations , science and art programs are severely lacking , and there s also a lack of alternative schooling programs . the us is behind many other countries in terms of education .","314106":"reposting from a friend who reblogged this from facebook . personality disorders in general are extremely misunderstood and stigmatized , and borderline personality disorder is just one of several that people need to be more educated about .","314107":"no . i think the justice system is extremely flawed , and a large number of police officers take advantage of their positions of power for their own selfish gains . however , at the same time i recognize that it isn t a reflection of all police officers or people in the justice system . but there s still a dire need for reorganization and reform .","314108":"i m honestly not too educated on this topic , but i would assume both play a factor in how we can retain and recall information . on the one hand , there could be genetic factors that direct the kind of information you re more apt to recall . but on the other hand , you can also train yourself to retain and recall more information over time . sometimes there are also things people cannot retain no matter how hard they try , and that could be either a mental block sort of thing or as a result of an environmental or medical factor i . e . dissociation or neurological impairments , for example .","314109":"because it s the law ? ? regardless of whether the other people were using or holding , they re still considered accessories or witnesses and they have to be taken in to determine the extent of involvement . getting arrested doesn t mean you re guilty of a crime , the charges come later .","314110":"i like when people put effort into their answers , but it doesn t determine whether or not i follow someone . if they re able to give good , informative content with just a few words or sentences , then i would prefer that over a drawn out answer that says nothing at all .","314111":"i don t think popularity is very important , and i ve never considered myself to be popular . that being said , however , i think that it s good for those who are popular to use their platform for the greater good , i . e . talking about issues that need heightened awareness , promoting charities and other events , and raising money for good causes . obviously cons of popularity would be vulnerability to cyber attacks , stalking , bullying , and a sense of mob mentality when a group of fans misconstrue or mislead the public into believing the wrong thing about you .","314112":"no , they just got off with a warning regarding the drinking . however , we were technically trespassing in a place we weren t supposed to be , so we were all written summons for loitering . we got off pretty lucky that night .","314113":"because there are some times in my life where i m not exactly rooted in reality , and existential thoughts about real versus fake and life and death make me really nauseous and feel as if there s no point in living . this is one of those times .","314114":"everyone follow morgan s new page ! !","314115":"people obtain medical degrees and doctorates just to answer this question lol , it isn t exactly something that can be explained in a few sentences .","314116":"lol no . the human race is quite possibly the worst species there is on this planet .","314117":"depending on their circumstance , it s probably a hell of a lot better than where they re coming from .","314118":"i fail to see how your statement is , in any way , correlated to the question the other anon asked me . you have the choice to be rude or considerate . it s simply rude and invasive to ask someone personal questions like that if they weren t specifically asked for in the first place .","314119":"women get hate for dating in general , whether they re older or younger than them . i m not too sure where the stereotype or the shaming originated from , to be honest . however , i ve always thought that the expectation was , obviously , uncalled for . as long as both people are consenting and are of legal age , who cares .","314120":"are you serious lol . i can t even take this seriously anymore , you ve gotta be trolling me at this point . especially considering you just referred to a group of people as illegals . ok ok the joke s over , you can scurry back into your corner of the internet again .","314121":"ahaha true , i didn t even think about it that way .","314122":"he doesn t need to say the word all to broadcast to the world that he automatically expects an entire mass of people to be criminals . he isn t specifying his words by indicating well perhaps we shouldn t do this because there s a chance that a mexican is a criminal . he literally wants to push all immigrants out regardless of who they are . . . how can you not see the racism behind that ?","314123":"you wouldn t go up to a stranger on the street and ask them this question , so why do you think it s perfectly acceptable to do on the internet ?","314124":"america land of the unfree and home of the hypocrites .","314125":"it s insinuating that all immigrants are criminals . which is incredibly false , and obviously racist .","314126":"very much so .","314127":"i usually enjoy my hobbies on the weekends , and i take care of my responsibilities during the weekdays . that way , i have a routine and everything is able to get done when it needs to get done .","314128":"this may clear things up for you a bit .","314129":"i get home at pm everyday , so i m not too concerned about a curfew , lmao . even when i do go out , i don t like to stay out later than pm anyway , otherwise i won t wake up for work the next morning .","314130":"i d rather not be stuck at home with my parents for the rest of my life , thanks . i actually have dreams and aspirations that i want to accomplish and a life to live on my own terms .","314131":"i agree . there are a lot of luxuries that people enjoy that were actually funded , created , or built by immigrants . for americans to be so ethnocentric is hypocritical because most of the products we use everyday , the homes we live in , the cars we drive , the jobs we work in were a direct result of working immigrants in america .","314132":"i suppose everyone is in a dangerous position , if they don t trust whom they re sending the images too . it s easy to leak pictures online and ruin a person s reputation .","314133":"the idea of posting selfies is a means of expressing someone s beauty and their confidence in themselves . people learn to respect themselves when they see how worthy of a human being they are .","314134":"why is there such a useless competition between console gamers and pc gamers . who cares , we re all here to have fun .","314135":"stereotypical images of the confederate flag , pick up trucks , flannel shirts , and moonshine . lol .","314136":"when i was first hired , i was told only natural colors . but the longer i m here , the more people i see with unnatural colors . i asked one of my coworkers who had pink hair if the managers gave her shit about it , and she said no because she doesn t have to interact with clients . then she told me that it d probably be the same for me since i don t interact with clients either . so i m going to dye my hair bright purple and see what happens . lol .","314137":"if by narcissism you actually mean self acceptance and self respect , then yes .","314138":"when have i ever bullied someone is the real question lol .","314139":"damn , anon going for the big questions today . are you going to be a prick , or are you at least going to take me out to dinner first ? p","314140":"by allowing that behavior to happen and or laughing at it , you re just encouraging the child to do it more . it conditions them into thinking that it s actually good behavior positive correlation . i wouldn t put up with it if that was my child or a friend s child . i d explain to them what stealing was and why it s considered stealing in the hopes that they d think about the consequences before doing something bad .","314141":"i think my presentation online is more in tune with my true self , compared to how i portray myself offline . i m actually really awkward , shy , and nervous in real life of the time , which prevents me from doing a lot of things , and saying a lot of things , that i wish i could say and do . because there s no public presentation on the internet , i feel i ve always portrayed a truer form of myself online .","314142":"honestly , you ve always come off as a very intelligent and caring person to me ! ! and when people try to give you shit , you re not afraid to shut them down . i really can t say anything bad about you . also , do you mind if i steal this question ?","314143":"rofl the worst kind of torture there is . ?","314144":"that seems pretty mild compared to what i m used to . cue the anon hate","314145":"i agree . there s a huge difference between showing concern for a friend due to their weight like if they gained or lost an extreme amount of weight in a short period of time and , on the other hand , outright judging your friend based on their weight alone because unrealistic societal standards have inadvertently brainwashed them into believing that body fat bad .","314146":"probably not , but i certainly would . i don t have blood running through my veins , it s just pure espresso at this point .","314147":"i definitely understand that , that s precisely the reason why i don t bother to discuss politics with my family . ?","314148":"the reason why i worry is because hundreds upon thousands of people die unjustly everyday due to this wave of racism in the world . because the government refuses to acknowledge that racial profiling is still a huge problem in our society and , instead of placing blame where it belongs , they deflect the blame onto the victims themselves . if we continue to allow racism to happen , then it obviously won t ever go away . you can t just sit back and wish that you could do something about it while doing nothing at all , because that s only encouraging racists to continue their spree of hatred . sorry if this is offensive to you at all , jody , considering your mother said this at all . this is something that really ticks me off at times","314149":"think about why you believe it would be embarrassing for her in the first place what does that say about unrealistic societal expectations when the only reason you believe a friend cannot wear what she wants is because a stranger may judge them on their appearance ? ? if they re confident in what they wear , allow them to express themselves . don t further the stigma of body shaming by telling your friend that her fashion choices are embarrassing because of her body type .","314150":"unnecessary drama , call out pages which are actually just hate pages in disguise , mob mentality , and the new age sense of entitlement . what once created a thriving community is what is currently tearing these communities apart , and instead of educating people , it has become a public forum of humiliation and egotism .","314151":"it s psychological conditioning people are nurtured into believing that relationships won t work out or will always be bad due to their past experiences with bad relationships . if someone has been hurt in the past , it creates a correlation between heartbreak and relationships , so people end up becoming more and more hesitant to put their hearts on the line again .","314152":"we can appreciate our lives and still be allowed to complain about our lives , yes . the two ideas aren t mutually exclusive . our perception of our life and our subsequent struggles shouldn t be invalidated because someone will always have it worse than us . the only life we re living is ours and ours alone , and and it s incredibly ignorant to assume that everyone should be thankful for what they have solely because a stranger doesn t have that .","314153":"you say this as if i don t already know this . . . ? or as if this is supposed to be an insult . . . ? i m crazy , this isn t news . get over it and move on .","314154":"the joker and

.","314160":"the law is the law for a reason you can t disobey it simply because you think it s irrelevant . what the hell is wrong with people ? children cannot consent to sexual activity . children should not be burdened with the decision of sex because they are not physically or emotionally mature enough to consider the consequences of those actions . and anyone who is an adult and is thinking about a child in a sexual manner clearly needs to be thrown in prison .","314161":"i watch that on askfm on almost a daily basis . in addition , i also went through that scenario on a weekly basis when i worked in retail . there have been times where i got so frustrated that i would say to them , i literally cannot explain this any simpler than i am currently . i got a couple of bad glares from that , lmao . but i think it s a thing either people are too slow to genuinely comprehend the idea in front of them , or perhaps they re entirely too proud stubborn to accept the fact that they re wrong , so they pretend that you don t make sense instead . most of the time , it s the latter .","314162":"note to self don t lead a sedentary lifestyle and then think you ll be fine to walk up and

have . lmao .","314169":"racism is a system of oppression . historically speaking , people who were white oppressed other races , viewing them as inferior because their skin color was not the same as theirs . those who were white have always been the oppressors , and one cannot experience racism if you re part of the group which did the oppressing in the first place . that being said , white people can experience isolated events of discrimination due to their skin color . but because racism is a systemic facility of oppression , white people cannot experience racism such as those who are black for example do .","314170":"aw , this is cute . yes , i wholeheartedly agree . you need to keep the flame alive throughout the years , and by continuously reigniting the flame in each other s

feel an episode coming on .","314172":"i don t think i could personally be friends with someone who is sexist , racist , homophobic , or transphobic . in those cases , i honestly couldn t look past

but idk generally when someone treats you well , respects you , and you have romantic feelings towards them , they do become physically attractive to you . if you re not feeling physically attracted to them after that and you re a person who feels physical attraction , then you re either basing your entire judgment off of their appearance or there s something else about them that repels you .","314174":"from what i can see , the only basis on which you d seemingly reject him is due to his physical appearance . that seems incredibly shallow to me .","314175":"a hell of a lot more tolerant , open minded , accepting , and free from most forms of discrimination . there wouldn t be unrealistic societal standards on men or women , there wouldn t be wage gaps or job differences based on someone s gender or sex alone , and there would likely be less cosmetic medical procedures because people would feel less pressured to adhere to a particular standard .","314176":"i m against circumcision and i likely won t circumcise my own child , as long as the father agrees with me . there s no medical need for it whatsoever and the theory that uncircumcised boys get more infections is

among race , gender , sex , religion , economic class , etc . if someone is telling you that they re a feminist but they re precluding the rights of another group of people , then they re not really feminists .","314214":"of course . . . abuse exists regardless of your sex or gender . but i do agree that there s such a lack of recognition regarding cis men and boys who are struggling with abuse . men have to deal with the hypermasculinity of society , and whenever they attempt to cry out for help regarding abuse , sometimes they re simply told to be a man . it doesn t work like that at all .

myself while having those thoughts and i think , why am i acting this way ? i don t even know who they are . everyone is judgmental in some form or another however , what truly matters is how we

one got banned . i emailed askfm to ask for my account back since i honestly didn t break any of their guidelines , and they actually got back to me today with a very passive aggressive no .","314230":"no , it isn t anyone s fault that this has happened . it s just the way society has progressed over time , and it has placed an emphasis on male leadership and male seniority because women were always seen as inferior , weak , and submissive . women don t allow these things to happen to them . women aren t asking for these things to happen , and sometimes it s impossible to prevent these things from happening regardless of who you are . but what we can do is change the perspectives of everyone around us to show that we can break these stereotypes , and we can slowly break down the walls of oppression that have caged us throughout history . i understand that you re young , and no doubt there s a language barrier , and i know you mean well by your question . i tried to word it in a way that s easier to understand , because it genuinely is not the women s fault that these things have happened to us . women have been oppressed and only now have we been given

back night and they said they d look in it . i haven t heard from them since .","314254":"lol ironically enough , an anon was trying to argue with me that muslims can t be feminists . i actually wasn t even in the mood to argue , so i kept telling them to do research because they were making themselves look foolish . and then i was banned out of nowhere . i m guessing the anon got mad that i wasn t responding the way they wanted me to and reported me enough so that i was banned .","314255":"tbh i usually just get a vibe off of seeing their account that they re either catfishing or being a troll . it usually has to do with the photos they upload and how they interact with their followers . i don t care enough to do anything about it , only if they re pretending to be one of my friends

essentially , an anon got mad at me for not responding to his ignorant argument like they wanted me to , they reported me , and i got banned .","314260":"that s essentially the same thing as asking why is advocating for equal rights and breaking down the walls of oppression so important to you ? feminism encompasses everything in our society that currently needs to be amended including socioeconomic issues , political issues , environmental issues , health , lgbtqia issues , gender issues , etc etc . the intersectionality of all of these subjects makes feminism complex , but it s through studying these cross hairs that we realize that humanity has huge problems with oppressive institutes and it needs to be changed .","314261":"it does , mainly because i like going through and reading my old answers . i have pretty bad memory loss , so it s comforting for me to go back and read on my own thoughts , opinions , behavior , etc . i mean , it isn t a huge huge deal if i get it

perhaps that s why . i ve just had it deactivated since then .","314270":"i don t even understand what basis they used to ban me , tbh . i wasn t saying anything offensive , and if anything , i was being the least confrontational as possible because i was legitimately telling the anon to essentially leave me alone because i wasn t in the mood to argue . i emailed askfm about bringing my main back , so they said they re looking into it but i haven t heard anything from them in a few hours . sigh .","314271":"thank you , me too . i had a lot of stuff on there that i would reference to

definitely an old wives tale placebo effect . although , i will say , there have been a few times as a kid i tried it out and i did fall asleep easier it seemed .","314302":"this has been the most depressing question i ve received . realistically , if you don t think your physical genetics are strong , the world would expect you to make up for it by being fit and having money . that s a general

atleast you tried . it is not a measure of how the next time will be .","314312":"lol . yes . it was horrible for a long time . i chose to make it horrible . i chose to continuously let that one
