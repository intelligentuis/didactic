. i ve had a lot of bloodwork done when younger and never mentioned anything . the amh part is interesting . same with rats but will people react in the same way ? i probably should have asked about kids since my sister is going through that but she actually has the cyst and infertility part of it . doing different treatments etc last time i knew the doctor said that i should be fine . also mentioned that i could have a hormone imbalance but didn t go into any details and basically just gave me the minipill . plus , i got my period last june naturally so it must be fine if nothing showed on the ultrasound .","419682":"she s in the double cups now . i think dd or bigger . it s funny since we had an old sewing body form and we were getting rid of stuff when she moved out here and it was the same size as her boobs . she was going to keep it but didn t since the thing was old .","419683":"she was an a cup and wanted them . idk . . sometimes they look smaller and other times it s like oh shit boobs .","419684":"no . that s invasion of privacy . i don t post my pictures so why would i share hers ? also you would probably be all that s not your sister since she looks like barbie , lady gaga and others like that . . . blonde , blue eyes , about a size , fake boobs . probably ish in weight , or whatever , the cyst and infertility issues of pcos going on . she s also married so that s more creepy sharing her pic","419685":"not really . it s not just about my weight , honey . basically eat the same as my sister and she s skinny yet still has pcos too .","419686":"no . pcos is a real condition . i m not surprised that someone said something .","419687":"i m going with recently instead that lingerie a few months ago was but i also had off so i just had to try adoreme . my multivitamin is . . the powders are even more money !","419688":"lucky me , greyface .","419689":"it s never really cured . plus , not all people gain weight . i have insulin resistance which is another part of it . there s lots of different symptoms people could have . they also checked my weight yesterday , happy i lost pounds but generally i usually maintain and gain the same amount lol even when i look way smaller also got metformin for it . it s mainly for diabetes patients but it s been shown to help with pcos to regulate the sugar , periods and whatever else . there s a lot of side effects but i ve mainly heard of pooping or puking ones , nausea in general etc happy that today hasn t been like that xd","419690":"even when i was in the pool my tablet wasn t far i like listening to music while swimming . and would check in . my job is also online so . . . . oops i like when people point this out because it s obvious that they are also online a lot","419691":"oh .

st one urine , bloodwork hormone panel , got weighed . talked about stuff . vitals and blood pressure . it s more of a clinic for gyno and another dr forget the name rn nd the ultrasound to see if i had cysts or whatever else going on . that one was more of a hospital setting . the doctor sent two cortisol test tubes . i haven t got the results from those yet . yesterday to go over all the results minus the cortisol lab since it wasn t ready . but she was basically saying it s pcos which isn t surprising given the fact that my sister was diagnosed with it in december and it can run in families . i ve read that even guys can pass it on too . also a lot of the females in our family have had problems with cysts , surgery to remove stuff etc you don t always get the cysts with it . which i don t . my sister and i are basically the opposites in everything , including our symptoms .","419697":"why would that be bad ? ? ? i m glad i m not puking or pooping nonstop","419698":"no
