I'm wrong with whatever I do say.\n  \n  I get how the saying the actual word instead of writing it out could be an excuse.. still shouldn't get called names for it. Everyone makes mistakes.

Yet you guys keep repeating it unlike mine. Pretty much the same concept.\n  ","491386":"\n  Cool story bro\n  ","491387":"\n  Yes but not over and over again. I understand what they are trying to do but at the same time they are just acting even more foolish than I was. They talk a big game but when words that hurt others reading it, they don't care. Once is better than __ times regardless of how someone is acting.\n  ","491388":"\n  As are you guys for dragging this out even more and acting like children about it instead of actually having rational conversations on the subject and helping educate instead of just repeating \"stupid\" over and over again.\n  \n  The only stupid thing I did was write a slur and you guys keep going in a bunch of different directions with racism.. being in parts that aren't even what the original one is about.\n  ","491389":"\n  It's a right to call someone stupid now? Lol ok.\n  ","491390":"\n  2x\n  ","491391":"\n  Not the way I was talking about.\n  \n  Why marry someone you don't like the color of or anything else about?\n  \n  I understand the parents part of it. Generation, old ways etc.\n  ","491392":"\n  Yes, it would. If they got bullied enough with the word. All degrading words hurt. How would you like hearing it a lot about yourself?\n  \n  A lot of people with cerebral palsy, autism and other spectrums have most likely heard it. I'm not associating, it's more facts. Go ask anyone with those if they've heard that said and i bet they would have. Children and even adults can be mean.\n  \n  You just don't like being called out on stuff so making excuses too.\n  ","491393":"\n  Again, with the stupid.\n  \n  I apologize on their behalf and also on my own for using the word \"chink\" once to describe food. Adding \"bizarrely\" doesn't make the S word any better.\n  ","491394":"\n  It's sad if you let other people decide who to like especially when they they call people stupid and other things. I still have respect for them, it's just annoying always ending like this and rather not keep having drama since my page isn't about that.\n  ","491395":"\n  Yes, I know that. You and that anon are just all \"LOL she held a door.\" It still counts somewhat like you said. I know there's different layers.. my \"excuses\" as you say still matter.\n  \n  If I say I had crushes on asians and other things it's all a joke to you guys too. Like I'm pretty sure that would still matter too.\n  \n  You shouldn't call people stupid either if you are going to defend everything else. Do you see that problem there? How do you think people mentally challenged feel about seeing that word? There's a lot of people with autism and other spectrums on here. I said  the c word once. You keep repeating stupid a bunch of times.\n  ","491396":"\n  Probably. I'd guess Eggsy and Ash again.\n  \n  Was thinking another but I'm sure she'd atleast come off anon.\n  ","491397":"\n  I'm not saying its ok. Just there's a slight difference.\n  ","491398":"\n  ONCE.\n  \n  I never said the N word. Never said it to anyone directly. I never called anyone anything bad on here either. I don't stoop to that level when I'm not getting my way about something. You keep saying \"educate yourself\" but yet calling people stupid isn't the way to educate anyone either. It's offending to those with mental problems and all that too but clearly that's ok because you wrote it. God forbid if I was the one to call someone it. All hell would break loose huh?\n  \n  I'm also not hiding behind anon calling people fat and stupid which is directing it at someone.\n  \n  What makes what you are doing any better than what I said?\n  ","491399":"\n  Someone already did\n  ","491400":"\n  Keep calling people stupid. It's cute. Someone doesn't want any more drama so you name call. Make it about someone's body when that has literally nothing to do with anything. I  don't care if you like me or not anymore. Not everyone is perfect including you. Don't act so high and mighty when calling names. You just downgrade yourself in the end.\n  ","491401":"\n  How am acting like a victim?\n  \n  Call me whatever you want. Shows more about you than it does me, child.\n  ","491402":"\n  Sweet\n  ","491403":"\n  Good. Mixed emotions on it.\n  ","491404":"\n  I guess stuff on my Amazon list\n  \n\n   http:\/\/amzn.to\/2mQK30H\n  \n\n  Haven't really thought about. Money is always nice. Giftcards etc\n  ","491405":"\n  The first one.\n  ","491406":"\n  Took you two hours to come up with that.\n  ","491407":"\n  Lucky\n  ","491408":"\n  October sometime\n  ","491409":"\n  I follow about 90% female so no idea what you are talking about.\n  ","491410":"\n  I'm not sure. Just one of the gifs\n  ","491411":"\n  Haven't been paying attention that much to things I hate.\n  ","491412":"\n  Explain?\n  ","491413":"\n  Yes\n  ","491414":"\n  I don't like that type of spam much. Not sure I've had that way either.\n  ","491415":"\n  Uncircumcised thing?\n  ","491416":"\n  Doesn't take long to cut up some cucumber and put salad in a bowl\n  \n  Reheated chicken - around 2 minutes in the microwave\n  \n  Cut it up after its done.. that felt like it took a while. Was on the phone still and switched to speaker.\n  \n  Caesar Dressing\n  ","491417":"\n  Lulu and Wrangler are on the couch with me and Bruin's sleeping on the ground nearby.\n  ","491418":"\n  Shhh don't ruin it\n  ","491419":"\n  I had chicken and a salad. Boring but was good  :) added some cucumber too.\n  ","491420":"\n  Rarely. He creeped me out\n  ","491421":"\n  Fold?\n  ","491422":"\n  I love everything. Mostly 90s for the nostalgia. 50-70s is good too. Rock, pop, metal etc\n  ","491423":"\n  Same\n  \n  S*x under a waterfall\n  ","491424":"\n  I think I did forn Joker o.o\n  ","491425":"\n  Jane Austen\n  ","491426":"\n  That you\n  \n   @JJD55\n  \n  ?\n  ","491427":"\n  I ended up getting chocolate with that vanilla center part :)\n  \n  I was torn over tapioca and butterscotch but the chocolate had better macros for keto.\n  ","491428":"\n  Get rid of Ben and Lahore forever.\n  ","491429":"\n  I'll cook a pie since I already took out the pumpkin can and pie sheet earlier.\n  ","491430":"\n  Just missed that. Bruin had his paws on the counter trying to reach something up there.\n  ","491431":"\n  Nathaniel\n  ","491432":"\n  I find it odd that my dad never mentions his sister. She died young. He always says he's an only child when asked.\n  ","491433":"\n  Probably.\n  "}}
