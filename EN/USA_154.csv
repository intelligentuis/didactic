  exactly, he could of shot him at least once not 12 times that's just saying I wanna kill this young boy . it pisses me off that people are okay with this cop having no indictment. this mothers boy will NEVER see her son again but that officer will get to see his family every single day
  "

  people fail to realize that okay the kid was big and they gives you a right to shoot 12 rounds at the boy , y'all fail to realize that this young boy's mother won't be able to see her son walk through the door no more, won't get a hug nor a kiss no more , she will be spending holidays without her son meanwhile that officer gets to go home to his family and spend holidays with his family ect

   I don't see a problem with praying for their family just to show you're supporting them I think that's what they meant. It's rude to be that way to someone when they've just lost 2 special people. I'll pray for them and you.
