The first thing I would do to approach this issue is check the notification settings in each app you post on. A lot of apps nowadays are making more specific, separate notification sliders for interaction types. If you see any notification sliders for likes, Turn Them Off. This will help keep you from coming back to check and obsess every time you might get one.\n  \n  Coupled with this, you have to force yourself to do the hardest (and I know, it sounds most obvious) thing: don't bother checking back on your posts. If you're doing things that make you happy, just keep looking forward onto the next thing to post! And then the next. Just don't keep turning back, because you can end up over analyzing and over criticizing yourself.\n  \n  Every time you get the urge to check, practice mindfulness and awareness. Tell yourself, \"this is an urge coming from the self conscious part of my mind, and I won't get better if I keep entertaining it\". Set your phone down and carry on with your day.

Those get posted casually every so often on my Tumblr.\n  ","860652":"\n  No, but I have had premonitions in dreams about a few of the animals I've cared for passing away.

Thank you for stopping by every day and giving me the opportunity to speak to you. \ud83c\udf38\n  ","860658":"\n  When I'm older, I think I'll be gentle, wise, but young at heart!

I'm hoping that is how I will end up being.\n  ","860659":"\n  WOW how long did it take??\n  ","860660":"\n  It's worth so much to me, actually \ud83e\udd7a\ud83c\udf80\ud83d\udc96\ud83c\udf80 Sending lots of love and hugs back!

I just think they've messed it up so bad that the only way to fix it IS to scrap it. And just start all over. It's.. OOF it's a mess.\n  ","860667":"\n  I miss being able to go into a place without the overwhelming thought of getting sick the second I step into the door.\n  ","860668":"\n  Nope!\n  ","860669":"\n  Sometimes I do, yeah! If I'm sus of them being a we\u0131rdo or someone I just don't want to interact with, I'll peek.\n  ","860670":"\n  I can tend to go unfiltered and cuss quite a bit when I get going in certain conversations \/ certain topics. But I don't think I'm \"out of control\" with it \u2014 like I'm not cussing a ton or at all in \"inappropriate situations\" or anything.\n  \n  Also, I think that people should be able to cuss around their parents, in conversations, whatever! I don't see the harm if the person isn't a kid anymore.\n  ","860671":"\n  Something I love doing but kinda suck at is making transparent edits of gifs... I don't have Photoshop, and there's hardly any good mobile tools that properly isolate an animated object. Some of them end up a little crusty so \ud83d\ude14 well it is what it is..\n  ","860672":"\n  RIGHT?? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I'm in shock\n  ","860673":"\n  You should start getting a life instead of wasting your time sending anon hate, fix yourself\n  \n  but go awffff \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udc4d\n  ","860674":"\n  Imagine getting big mad at receiving public advice you didn't like, even when you made the conscious decision to put it in shoutouts.

I'm not interested in romantic drama. But I will NEVER forget when my old high school Spanish teacher had our class watch La Tempestad with her every period. You know, for \"educational purposes\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n  \n  I still remember all of the lyrics to the shows' intro song, \"Hoy Tengo Ganas De Ti\".. Do I speak a lick of Spanish? Nope! But I sure do remember that!\n  ","860678":"\n  Apparently by just using celebs as their profile picture and starting drama so people pay attention to them.\n  \n  Well, at least that's all I've seen! I really don't understand having an \"rp\" account on a place like this.. makes no sense to me!\n  ","860679":"\n  Someone's heart?\n  ","860680":"\n  No clue \u2014 I'm not a man nor am I in Miami. Perhaps you should ask men who are, in fact, from Miami and seeing younger women in their 20's to mid 30's..? \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udcad\n  ","860681":"\n  Pro tip: shoutouts reach FAAAR out of the state that you're in. I'm nowhere near Miami, just as an example. Like not even close.\n  ","860682":"\n  Your man? Take him to your can (I mean the kind that stores trash) and dump him. Oh my God just. Please for your own sake just dump him. You should never have to explain to a grown, s\u0119xuaIIy active adult that using a frigging BALLOON as a C\u00d3NDOM is unsafe. And the fact that he got mad at being turned down from s\u0119x, even without context, that's toxic.\n  \n  Do yourself a favor and find a new one.. this ain't it...\n  ","860683":"\n  My stance on having kids has always been and will always be the same: I don't want any, and I want nothing to do with any.\n  \n  If you mean my thought process about other people having children during the pandemic (\u00bfif I'm assuming correct?) \u2014 NOT MY BUSINESS. No one else's business but the person's involved with creating the child, and providing for the child frankly.\n  ","860684":"\n  I mean the only thing to say is the obvious. If the person you are in love with isn't poly \/ their partner isn't okay with them having other partners.. they need to dump their partner. It's a really sh\u0131tty thing of them to do \u2014 stringing their current partner around on the side while they dabble in interest with you. Thusly stringing you around as well.\n  \n  If they aren't willing to end it, but they still wanna keep you on the side, you should end the \"relationship\" you have with this person. They're indecisive, and likely just enjoy the attention with no real motives for solid commitment if that's the case.\n  \n  I mean I wouldn't even touch this situation (or the person it's surrounding) personally. People like that tend to be fickle hearted. The possibility of them tiring of you the way they are tiring of their current eventually is a possibility with these types. Just my two cents!\n  ","860685":"\n  I've never had my cards read! And I know next to nothing about tarot unfortunately, so I can't say.\n  ","860686":"\n  Nope!\n  \n  Still forever scarred from when a coworker at a former job would sit in the lunch room, smacking their chops loudly as they ate, while playing that game at full volume. EUGH not happy memories..\n  \n  But anyways back to your question, uhh.. nope! Mobile games aren't really my thing anyways. If I play games on my phone at all, I usually emulate older consoles (DS, GBA, PS1, etc).\n  ","860687":"\n  Even without the two controllers, it wouldn't be worth it. You'd be better investing in a PC.\n  ","860688":"\n  Most winters, I've struggled to find energy. But this winter has been different! I know it's not as easy as it sounds, but since I have shifted to a more positive outlook overall, I've pulled my energy from my positive mindsets.\n  ","860689":"\n  I'm an early bird! And I prefer to work out in the afternoon.\n  ","860690":"\n  AAAAAA you're too sweet!! It's good to know I can do so much, so ty for telling me. \ud83c\udf80 Happy to help! \ud83c\udf80\n  ","860691":"\n  Up until recently, there was four weekly tasks to do. Now, there is only two!\n  ","860692":"\n  Hi there, thank you for stopping by! I slept pretty well. There was a point where I woke up around 5 and contemplated staying up, buuut I turned back in for a few extra hours. Safe to say I feel more rested! Also I'm about to go down and make some cheesy scrambled eggs (with orange peppers and tomato).\n  \n  How has your Friday been coming along? I hope that it's been off to a good start for you thus far!\n  ","860693":"\n  You're on anon, so that's not possible! Also just to be clear, I don't have any intentions of giving out my socials to directly communicate. I'm not interested in that.\n  \n  But if you wanted to converse on here, I wouldn't be opposed! :)\n  ","860694":"\n  Nope! To be honest, a lot of my early childhood is.. kind of like a fever dream. Any memories I even have from back then are scattered.\n  \n  Oddly enough I remember the name of my first \"boyfriend\" \ud83d\ude02 I tried to look him up because I thought it would be interesting to see who he became. But I CANNOT spell his last name. I know how to pronounce it, but since I can't spell it... \ud83d\ude14\n  \n  He's the only person I even remember from that point in my life, and I can't even show anything for it.\n  ","860695":"\n  No way, you really mean that?? \ud83e\udd7a Thank you so so so much! And you deserve to know that you're just as awesome (maybe even more so than me)! I'm grateful that you'd take your time to give me so much positive energy.\n  ","860696":"\n  Happy Friday to you too!! I'm ready to take on today and speed on to the weekend. I'm hoping that my energy carries on to you, and that your weekend approaches quickly \ud83d\udcab Good luck out there today!\n  ","860697":"\n  I feel like it's a really powerful quote, and it shines a light on how most animal products are \"gathered\" (using this word loosely) in an inhumane way. It's a really important issue, and I do believe that people should have awareness of how most of these places operate. And it really is terrible, how cruel we can be.\n  \n  BUT... I wanted to bring this up because it feels relevant to my closing point. In high school, they had this \"health ed\" spokesperson come in one day during our Health period. And all this guy was there for, was to show the whole class on the projector around a slaughter house in work. That includes close up shots of animals being sIaughtered. He kept saying (to the whole class), \"If you're looking away, or hiding your face, try and ask yourself why you're doing that\". His whole purpose for being there was to guilt everyone out of eating meat. That entire class revolved around it that day. It was miserable.\n  \n  People like him sicken me. I don't at all like or \"support\" what goes on before I buy the animal products I consume. But I'm not about being guilt tripped, and especially not guilt tripped into changing my whole entire lifestyle. It's not right to try and do that to people. It's not educational and helpful, it's manipulative and forceful. Using guilt as a tool in order to instill a need for change into people is wrong.\n  \n  In short... wanting to educate others and bring awareness to others, because you care? Good. The quote you gave me is simple, but to the point. Guilt tripping others and using how awful they feel against them to coerce them into changing their lifestyle? Bad.\n  ","860698":"\n  I've heard it's really good! But just like with many other things, I just never took the time to get into them. It's on the back burner with a bunch of other stuff I still have to look into \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n  ","860699":"\n  You think so? \ud83d\udd39\ud83d\udd37\ud83d\udd39Well thank you!\n  ","860700":"\n  Let me know what you think!! It's an all time favorite of mine. \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc99\n  ","860701":"\n  Most of my energy is derived from future motivations! Positive reinforcement of the things that need done ahead of me really helps.\n  ","860702":"\n  Not a fan of the ones who have this really weird fet\u0131sh\u0131stic take on it. But the ones out there that are just in it because it makes them innocently  happy? Hey why not, go for it. It doesn't bother me.\n  ","860703":"\n  Oh no, not at all! That's nothing you have to worry about. The only thing that wakes me anymore is my alarms! \ud83d\udca4\ud83d\udcad\ud83d\udca4 I typically wake up between 7am - 8:30am if I can help it. I just had a few days where I was waking up \"too late\" (9:30am), and wanted to shift myself back to where I was.\n  \n  I appreciate your concern though \u2014 thank you for checking. \ud83c\udf80 That was very considerate of you. \ud83e\udd17\n  ","860704":"\n  I probably was, until this message made me throw up in my mouth.\n  ","860705":"\n  It's an \"oldie\" (at this point I feel most everyone knows about it) but a goodie...\n  \n  Coraline!\n  ","860706":"\n  Hey hey!

It warms my heart to hear it. \ud83d\udc9d\n  ","860708":"\n  I won a lot of grade and attendance related awards back in school. But I don't really have anything from back then, so I wouldn't be able to show for it!\n  \n  They weren't anything special anyways \u2014 just those diploma-like papers with a shiny ribbon sticker on it.\n  ","860709":"\n  I have really bad anxiety about the dentist, because of my nightmarish experience with my wisdom teeth extraction.\n  ","860710":"\n  I have quite a few ways of making my bad moods go away!

Comparing yourself and how you look to everyone can be one of the most damaging things you can do to yourself. Everyone is born different, and everyone looks different.

But if this is a close friend, and you know he trusts you, sit him down and ask about it. Don't be insensitive and direct by saying something like, \"why are you so underweight\". Try to open the conversation a little more sensitively to form a space of trust \u2014 maybe ask, \"Are you okay\". If he asks why you're asking, say something like, \"I have been concerned about your wellbeing since you talked about your weight\".\n  \n  It's important to keep in mind that people can be underweight for a plethora of reasons \u2014 from eating disorders to conditions that cause weight loss. Since you don't seem to know the cause, it's important to approach this conversation by being sensitive and open ended. Don't throw around things like, \"you need to eat more\" or \"you're too skinny\" because frankly things like that are \u0131gnorant and not needed \u2014 they don't help. And don't pry if it seems like he's uncomfortable to talk about it. Leave the conversation open on your end, but let his responses \/ reactions be signs of when it's time to back off.

And I pondered upon it a whole lot more during 2020.\n  \n  I don't even necessarily mean in a negative, doomy gloomy way. Sure there were a lot of bad days that caused those thoughts to be incredibly negative. But most of the time, I actually wonder about it because of curiosity about our own mortal\u0131ty. I'm talking about how we start a story on this planet that we will never truly Finish.\n  \n  Sure, our own individual stories will end. But the vastness of the universe \u2014 and heII even just planet Earth alone \u2014 makes me feel like our individual stories are just mere chapters in the whole story of life. It makes me feel like myself and all around me, is small. A lot of those feelings all tie back to the fact that we currently living beings will likely not see the end of Everything.\n  \n  To be honest, I don't think I'm content with that. Even if it's grim, I am always wanting to know. It would just be a funky form of closure for me to know what's going to happen to the planet I lived on, loved, and explored.\n  ","861215":"\n  I think I'm either 5'2 or 5'3 \u2014 genuinely not sure!

If these kind of negative signs keep showing up specifically when you interact with a person, it could be an indication that they dislike you.\n  \n  But then again, it's hard to settle on that answer because a lot of problems are started by getting the wrong idea. Making the wrong assumptions on accident, due to being anxious. I remember learning from this educational video that anxiety can actually mess with that part of the brain that reads and processes body signals. Your anxiety can make you see things much worse than they actually are, like facial expressions and body language.\n  \n  All of the fretting can do much more harm than good. So in conclusion, the best way to tell if someone dislikes you is to just ask outright. It's not a fun thing to do, and it's pretty embarrassing because it puts you on the spot. But hey, you'll finally get an answer straight from the source of your worry. And that's worth the trouble I think, because prolonging worry is just too draining.\n  ","861221":"\n  I really don't pay enough attention to celebrity lives to get all that irritated, to be honest.
