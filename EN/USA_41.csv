I look over to see it was the man . I say hi back , sulking . this man asks me for a hug . for some reason , I did . and we actually held it for a minute . and for some other reason , he literally thanks me . I will never forget that day and I think I needed it more than he did but I still hope he got what he needed out of it . 🤞🏿🤎

   The dolphin question reminded me of something: would you say horses understand laughter? Apes, dolphins, dogs, & elephants have the cognitive capacity to recognize laughter, and while I can't find any studies done on this with horses, it seems like they do possess a sense of humor.
  ","
  Yes! Horses have been shown to associate positive emotions and reactions to laughter. Studies like this one (
  
   https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C47&q=horses+human+facial+expressions&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D-pWSLqfzORcJ
  
  ) concluded that horses do indeed respond to and understand human facial expressions and tones of voice and can tell between positive and negative human emotions. This specific study (
  
   https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30777-z
  
  ) builds upon that finding and concludes that horses perceive laughter as a positive stimulus and generally respond positively to it

  An eye for an eye makes the world go blind. Better to move on and begin taking steps on the path of happiness and self fulfillment than to spend energy dwelling on bad experiences and continue giving your time to someone who doesn’t want or deserve it.

  ","
  Hunting strategy- one is venomous and the other isn’t. Copperheads use a venomous bite to subdue prey and cornsnakes constrict their prey. Is easy to tell by their eye shapes, and most easily, head shapes which is which kind of snake. All venomous snakes have venom glands in their head making their heads spade shaped like ♠️. Non-venomous snakes have noodle/tube shaped heads because they don’t have those glands

  Healthy horses can safely carry or pull 20% of their own body weights,  so you’d just have to know how much your horse weighed approximately and then calculate 20% of that.
  
  For example, the average sized horse usually weighs somewhere around 1,000 lbs so they’d be able to carry roughly 200 lbs but that would be the maximum for them. It’s be much better for them to carry less weight

   I was reading about Alexander the Great's famed horse Bucephalus, who would not allow anyone else to ride him. Have you ever seen an animal like this, and what is it in equine psychology that is the factor in these cases where they will only allow one particular person to ride them?
  ","
  In my experience that’s really not a thing, and if it is, it’s because something is seriously wrong. Horses are friendly and curious by nature, and when they’re not, there’s a reason.  In the case of Bucephalus, it’s pretty hard telling how he really was or what really happened with him because history doesn’t write about every detail of people or animal’s lives as they were actually lived. It’s always from a perspective of someone else and sometimes that perspective can be greatly exaggerated or completely fabricated. If that really was true and Bucephalus didn’t let anyone other than Alexander The Great ride him, it definitely had something to do with mistrust, poor handling, or fear leftover from a bad incident in his life.
  
  Nowadays we know SO much more about horse’s health, wellness, psychology, and training than we did back then, and our methods today are much gentler and more humane- so it could’ve been a product of poor or harsh training he received that made him like that. Even today though, I honestly believe a lot of ""one person horses"" are human-made. Either their early/initial training and handling was done by one single person most of their lives and they straight up were never socialized, or something negative happened in their life to cause them to mistrust humans early on and then one specific human was able to earn their trust back.
  
  The problem is - it becomes a self fullfilling prophecy. It usually goes like this: The horse is comfortable with their one person and acts just fine with them because they trust them. But if the horse gets introduced to someone else or handled by someone else they freeze up or flip out and the owner immediately thinks ""OMG - horsey has never done that before! This is bad! He can never be ridden or touched by anyone else otherwise he’ll hate it, it’s dangerous, and bad for the horse!"" and then they claim that horse just doesn’t like other people, won’t let anyone else ride them, and that they’re a ""one person horse.""
  
  The horse is then never allowed to work through their fears or trust issues with other people and because of that they are never socialized.  That just makes them become more set in their ways as a ""one person horse."" Even when people ""try"" to socialize a one person horse, it’s usually only a half-hearted attempt. Maybe an hour or so, or several short sessions with a different person, but it sometimes takes a long time to gain the trust of a horse and build their confidence. It’s much easier to just say “no, he’s a one person horse” and leave it at that.
  
  Building on that, back when Bucephalus was alive, I’m not really sure people cared all too much about letting their horses gain trust and confidence like we do nowadays because to them, horses were like machines. They were for transportation, plowing, war, and carrying heavy loads. As long as you could force them into submission enough to do what you wanted it was good enough. Nowadays we understand that that’s incredibly cruel.

   i read it but i think scaring chasing animals by hunting them is cruel ik what you mean tho by population control but think hunting should not be allowed.  i think you can control it in other ways organised by maybe rangers that do it
  ","
  Haha I def see why you’d think that for sure. That would be kinda cruel fr I agree. Totally correct me if I’m wrong but it seems like there might be a bit of misunderstanding going on about the way hunting is accomplished tho? Chasing them and scaring them isnt how you hunt. That’s the exact opposite of what you have to do lol.  That would be waaaay too hard anyways haha. Humans are super slow and it’s illegal to hunt/ fire weapons from a motor vehicle. Animals are too fast for that and if you scared them too much they’d probs just leave the area and not come back and nobody wants that. Wildlife is so pretty and nice and good for the environment :)
  
  I don’t hunt and never have but a lot lot lot of my peers and friends do/have as well as some of my family and they all tell me that instead, you have to track their movements for a few months beforehand with trail cams and look for footprints and signs of them around you to see where they naturally like to hang out. After you know where they like to be, when when hunting season comes around you go sit in a deer stand, in a tree, or in a blind and you be very quiet and sit very still and wait for hours and hours for them to come to you.
  
  You can call to them using special animal calls or by just using your voice (if you can make a convincing enough sound). People usually go to great lengths to go undetected by the animals. I think that whole part is pretty neat. They make a bunch of soaps and stuff that literally takes away your “person smell” and makes you smell like absolutely nothing so the animals can’t detect you sitting there. Some people even rub dirt on themselves to be better hidden and smell more like the outdoors 😂😂
  
  When you see the animal you want to choose and they come close enough, you take your shot and you hunt them. No scaring, no chasing, no cruelty, and no pain. I’d say it’s even less stressful for them than if they were naturally predated on by a pack of wolves, coyotes, or a mountain lion where they would def be chased and scared and probably eaten half alive and held down and ripped apart.
  
  Hunting with dogs is where the cruelty comes in for me. Thats a whooole dif issue haha don’t even get me started. That’s fucked up for real but a lot of people seem to agree that it’s not good. Dog hunting is 100% ILLEGAL to do for that reason in a whopping 42 out of the 50 states.  Even in the states where it isss legal you can apparently onlyy do it in certain areas and at certain specific times 🤷🏽‍♀️
  
  Also- your point about rangers doing it: that would be the exact same scenario as normal people hunting and would be accomplished using the exact same tactics of sitting still, being quiet, and respecting the wildlife. Not quite sure what the difference would be except that it would be WAY harder to control the population since there are fewer rangers than hunters, more animals would die slowly of chronic wasting disease, & more of the environment would be degraded due to overpopulation

  ","
  Show genuine interest in her life and hobbies, try them with her! Remind her you love her daily-overuse it.  Be her best friend and be there for her when she needs it. Tell her she’s beautiful, do little things for her like make food or hold hands without expecting things in return. Do it because you love her. Treat her like a princess and don’t put pressure on her to act or be or think a certain way. Love her for who she is and was and who she will be. Verbally and physically remind her she’s important to you. And lastly, never forget why you fell in love in the first place. Don’t get too tied up in the bs and drama of life and forget where y’all came from and that you’re in love with her as a human. Don’t let  the random noise of the day-to-day that tends to take over peoples brainspace make you forget your future feelings for her. He-said, she-said, doesn’t matter. Always be open and honest and non-accusatory and talk out your feelings about EVERYTHING. She’ll come to understand appreciate you more for all of it

   aw, i love outdoors too your a animal lover its cool i hate hunting etc soo cruel its not a sport in my opinion
  ","
  Ok so this is a long statement haha so I hope you read but if not it’s cool.
  
  TLDR: I disagree that hunting is all bad for multiple reasons but acknowledge that killing is generally negative and that some people who hunt just cause they get enjoyment from killing are super messed up
  
  Actual Answer:
  
  I find a lot of people think that way and expect me to say the same but I disagree. It’s because of hunting that we can maintain healthy wildlife populations and raise money for conservation. States are required to monitor wildlife populations and set limits for each person, each season, for the amount of animals they’re allowed to remove from the population. The total number of animals allowed to be taken is always based on the current population of that animal in the area that you’re registering to hunt in. The money the state receives from hunting tags helps fund research and conservation efforts for those animals so we can better understand how to help them. That money serves as the funding to pay scientists to actually go out in the field and do studies and make and implement conservation plans. There are of course cruel people out there who enjoy hunting bc they just like killing things (and tbh that’s super messed up) but most hunters I’ve encountered are outdoorsmen and women who enjoy nature and want to save it for future generations :) it all sounds like a bad thing bc killing things is generally negative but when you zoom out and look at the bigger picture it’s actually super good for the populations and the overall environment. Especially considering humans wiped out all the top predators that would’ve naturally kept game animal populations in check like wolves and cougars in most areas. Without the top preds, herbivore populations grow too big, they eat all the food in their areas and trample everything down, then they slowly starve to death, get sick, and die painful, slow, awful deaths. Being killed by a hunter’s bullet instantly is MUCH better and less painful than the alternative imo

  I turn them on and off periodically. When I get too many creepy anon asks (usually about fucking my feet for some reason??) or any other invasive, inappropriate, or unwanted comments about my body or life I turn off anonymous questions and that usually wards off the creepers.

   Tattoo advice. GO.
  ","
  Too small and detailed will get muddy as your skin ages and you’ll need to get it redone a bunch. Don’t put names on your skin unless that person is dead or it’s a pet (you might regret it and want it changed). Most home done tattoos are trash...wouldn’t try it. Just go to a pro bc that shit is permanent and you’ll want it to look good and have it done right. Face tattoos are silly imo and don’t make anyone look cool or hard. And lastly, obvi don’t tattoo hate symbols on yourself bc that’s super trashy and advertises to the world that you’re a hateful, terrible, person with bad decision making skills

  Too live a good life you need to come to terms with your own struggles, strive to meet your goals, try new things, be conscious of your choices and how they will affect things/people/the world in the future, seek happiness for yourself and others, and find peace.
  
  You can’t live a good life if you’re bitter, cynical, selfish, cruel, or mean spirited. Also, having lots of money doesn’t equate to a good life. You can be poor all your life and still have a “good” life. It all just depends on your attitude and the good you do during your lifetime for yourself and for the world.

   Do you get the impression horses wouldn't like camels very much in general? What made me think this is that a). camels stink, and b). most of the horses I've been around didn't like anything bigger than they were.
  ","
  No not really. I don’t think they’d have a problem with eachother. Historically camels and horses have both been used together in the same spaces (eg the Silk Road) and there hasn’t been a problem.
  
  It honestly all just depends on the horse’s individual personality. Like how some people like dogs and how some people don’t. Maybe some horses would like camels and some wouldn’t.
  
  I don’t think smell has anything to do with anything at all though since horses and camels are both pretty smelly animals. Animals don’t typically care about animal smell. Also, as far as them not liking things that are bigger than them, that’s mostly not true. As an example, miniature ponies are often great friends with giant draft horses that are 10 times their size. Again, down to individual personalities.
  
  You can also train a horse to do or get used to literally anything.  So tbh even if your horse showed aversion to camels size, smell, or general presence at first, you could easily train it out of them so they could eventually become friends

  So strange. I’ve volunteered doing doing hippotherapy for a number of years and none of those animals are ever intact. It poses an unnecessary risk for people participating in the therapy. Stallions (un-neutered) are usually jumpy, alert, quick-paced, feisty, spooky, and get excited when there are mares nearby. They typically give me “Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron” vibes. Of course there are always exceptions. Maybe you have yourself some very special, calm, stallions lol ☺️

   What is the best financial advice you would give someone at the very bottom?
  ","
  Since you asked:  Don’t spend money on random stuff to make yourself look or feel “rich” or “hard” or “g” or “cool” bc that thing is trendy at the time. Trying to flex money you don’t have will lead you to keep investing in things rather than life experiences and it’s an easy way to get stuck in a rut and get stuck in your hometown and never see or do anything else. Stuff is just stuff and doesn’t actually enrich your life.  It’s not manly, or chic, or cool or whatever to spend every single paycheck you earn on new shoes or parts for cars or new purses every single month if you’re struggling to survive. Prioritize things you want and things you need. It’s important to have things you want and to treat yourself occasionally. I’m not saying you should deny yourself the simple joys in life at every turn.  But it’s good to have realistic and attainable financial goals you want to meet and to save up to meet them so you can try to climb up a bit financially. Just my opinion and everyone is of course entitled to live how they want and do what they want, just an observation

   Would you say the horses prefer it when a rider can remain balanced without gripping and will respect that rider more?
  ","
  Yes it makes it much easier for them to move naturally and carry your weight on their backs if you remain balanced with them as they go. It also makes it much easier for the horse to understand your directions to them and they’ll respond better because they’re less likely to be confused
  "
223248,"
   do you get sore after riding the horses?
  ","
  It takes a lot of strong muscles to remain balanced without gripping and remaining static and becoming bumpy and uncomfortable when riding. If I’m not in riding shape, sometimes I do get sore if I do a lot of strenuous or high intensity riding. If I’ve been practicing consistently for a while and I’m in shape for riding then I don’t usually get sore muscles

  In this day and age it feels as if it’s almost expected of people to have a college education in order to even be able to be offered jobs that pay a living wage. Other than that, for me at least, it was a huge learning experience socially and gave me the space and time to grow and mature as a person. I’m very grateful for that

  I use Waze to try to avoid it first but living near Washington DC creates a hell of a lot of bad traffic during rush hours so sometimes jts impossible to avoid. If I get stuck I usually just turn on music or a YouTube video to listen to while I’m in standstill or super slowly creeping traffic and keep my foot off the gas.  I drive a truck so it’s heavy enough to store a lot of potential energy and keep rolling slowly for a while without me having to constantly gas it so I legit just sit there with my foot hovering over the brake most of the time

  Not to be rude haha but I’d only believe that if I saw it with my own eyes. Just from lots of experience with people who aren’t extremely familiar with the ins and outs of equestrian sports, lots of people think they’re experts but end up injuring themselves or the horse bc they didn’t know something. Anyone can sit on a horse and putz around, flopping all over the place, being unbalanced, or just hanging onto the saddle or yanking the reins to hang on for balance and call it “riding”, but to actually learn to be balanced enough to be “one with the horse”, not get in its way, make riding comfortable and easier for them, and to stay with its movement is much more difficult lol. It’s easy to be a passenger on the horse’s back, but difficult to be the pilot lol. Like no disrespect or anything and not to sound like a know-it-all haha js. Based on talking with you for so long you don’t seem the type to be interested in it since you’ve mentioned you don’t even like animals although you say I make you appreciate horses lol

  Working on getting the farmer across the street to let us work with his mare. That would be nice for Chance to have a horse friend to hang out with. The farmer across the street got the horse as a pet for his daughter a few years back, but she immediately lost interest and now the horse just sits in the pasture all day and nobody touches her. She’s got bad health issues and is nervous if people. I know she’d be a great riding horse if someone could work with her for a bit. Her name is scarlet.

I think it might be interesting to see what wild animals are around in a place where we walked with the horse :) what do you think?

  You don’t just get a horse bc it would be “fun”... that’s how animals end up sitting in a field somewhere for their entire lives, forgotten after the moment of interest passes and the fun wears off. Horses aren’t like cats that you can just put food and water down for them and leave them alone and they’ll be happy. They’re a BIG commitment to care for and they have lots of needs that must be met by their caretakers to be healthy and happy. It would be totally pointless to have a horse if you weren’t going to actually enjoy going out of your way EVERY DAY to take care of them and give it exercise and training every. single. day. And if you weren’t going to personally go out and train and exercise and brush and feed and muck, then you’d have to pay a lot lot lot of money to hire people to do those things for you which would be a huge reoccurring financial strain on you for no reason

  He IS a v good horse :) we mostly just ride trails though. As much as I love to jump and stuff it’s not really a realistic goal with our limited access to training space and literally no equipment lol. This summer I want to try to introduce him to some ground poles and see what he knows about them, but tbh I have no idea what he’s been previously trained for but he’s getting a bit old now so I don’t want to push him to do lots of work that might hurt him
  "
223853,"
   Hahah good but u can train him tho
  ","
  I could, but we don’t have any area to practice in. Dressage training requires flat land to practice on and Sandy’s family doesn’t have a riding arena lol. That’s why I haven’t trained Chance to do anything other than WTC

   No some Arabian breed can live till 60yrs
  ","
  That is false lol. The oldest horse EVER to live was a shire horse, born in 1760, who lived to 62 years of age- an astonishing anomaly.
  
  The oldest Arabian horse to EVER live was a horse called Magic. She was the oldest registered Arabian in the US for a long time and died (3/25/20) at the age of 51, in San Diego. This is also an extremely uncommon, old, age for a horse to live to.
  
  Usually horses die around 25-30 years old

  Arabians can be born with bay, grey (white), black, or roan coats not just one color
  "
224019,"
   How much it cost to have one here in USA
  ","
  Honestly depends on what kind of horse you want, where you keep it, and what you do with it. It can be very very expensive if you have to keep your horse at a boarding facility. Upwards of a few thousand a month for fancy facilities with 24 hour care.  Or it can be very cheap if you keep the horse on your own land and only have to pay for food and medical expenses.
  
  Some very well bred and well trained horses can cost more than $100,000 but your average horse will probably be more in the $1000-$3000 price range to buy
  "

   Why don't people ride zebra's like horses?
  ","
  Zebras  cannot be  domesticated like horses have been because of their disagreeable, flighty, nervous, and sometimes unpredictable nature, paired with their general lack of curiosity.
  
  Some animals are prime candidates for domestication because they possess the 6 key traits that make them easier to breed and alter into a domestic animal-  a diverse appetite, rapid maturation, willingness to breed in captivity, docility, strong nerves, and a nature that conforms to social hierarchy.
  
  Some animals, like zebras, don’t have those traits and are therefore very difficult to domesticate (and therefore ride) as a species.

  I have a feeling you’re the user who I’ve already told “stop this makes me uncomfortable” many times. It seems as if you have no respect at all for me since you’ve continued to say things I specifically told you I didn’t like.

224205,"
   but the excessive bleeding. doesn't that hurt. it really hurts when we bleed in period. I can imagine losing blood in birth.
  ","
  I’ve never given birth so idk how it is for people but I do know that bleeding and discharge after birth is normal in animals and shouldn’t be painful. This post-birth bleeding is called lochia and it's how the body gets rid of the extra blood and tissue from the uterus that helped their baby to grow before birth
  "
224206,"
   I also saw a video in national geography of a Vet doctor sticking his hand in a hows lower part and taking out the baby. the problem with it is that I saw him putting his whole arm inside. that made me feel pain in my vagina. I actually literally become an empath in physical things.
  ","
  Haha the cow is so large that a person’s arm isn’t painful. After all, she has to birth a big calf! Also, birthing isn’t nearly as painful for most animals as it is for humans because most animals have wider hips and produce babies with smaller heads than humans do. It’s easier and much quicker to get them out because of this
  "
224207,"
   Oh you're very kind! And i'm 5'4... is there a horse riding height limit?
  ","
  Nope no height limit. There are very tall horses for tall people and very short horses for short people.
  
  There IS a weight limit each individual horse can carry but it’s easily solved by finding a horse that’s right for you.  Riders weighing over 200 pounds (90 kilograms) will need large, strong horses like draft breeds to carry them safely.  Riders weighing from 115-190 pounds (52-86 kilograms) can be carried safely by an averagely built horse breed. Riders weighing anything under 115 lbs/52 kg can usually be carried safely by a pony breed (if they’re not too tall to do so)
  "

  It’s kinda crazy when everyone wears it during competitions cause everyone looks exactly the same. You can’t even tell gender differences from far away cause girls tuck their long hair into their helmets. Essentially everyone looks kinda like a guy 😂
  
  I never wear the uniform when I’m at home practicing though. It’s just for shows. Most of the time I’m just in a t-shirt and breeches or jeans on a casual day lol

   Who else agrees with this? True love feels like security and stability. You don't worry about breaking up or your partner leaving you abruptly. When they go out of town, you might miss them, but you are also happy for them, because you want them to travel and have new experiences. Your love has bala

   Why even have reins if it's not that important?
  ","
  The reins are like a telephone line keeping the communication between you and them flowing. That’s why having a light steady contact with them is important. It helps you feel each other and communicate your intents.
  
  They’re also helpful as a reinforcing aid you use when other aids don’t get the response you’re looking for or also for minor adjustments to the horse’s body position, direction, and speed.
  
  For example, to slow down from a faster gait to a slower one, you’d first sit up, sit deeper in the saddle, impede the motion of the horse with your body, and say “woah”. If that didn’t immediately get a response you’d continue doing those things as you close your fingers to squeeze the reins like a sponge, increasing pressure on the reins until you get a response. Most of the time the horse will respond with very little pressure or almost none at all.
  
  If you wanted them to slow down but stay in the same gait you’d use what’s called a “half-halt” where you maintain forward motion and momentum by keeping your body engaged and keeping your leg on but you ask the horse to collect and come back to you by squeezing your fingers on the outside rein like a gun trigger and saying “easy” or “slow” or “woah”, (whatever word you choose to train)
  "
224615,"
   Do horses understand words or it only has to do with how you pull the reins?
  ","
  Very very little has to do with the reins. Most riding is done from the seat, core, and leg. Horses are very capable of learning words and phrases as training though too just like dogs can
  "
224616,"
   How do you know if a horse has any of these diseases?
  ","
  Those are all people diseases so they’d show the same signs and symptoms as people who had them. If you’re curious I’d say google it. But none of those are all that common diseases for a horse or a person to catch
  "
224617,"
   Are there little critters that jump from horses to human?

  Idk about like actual bugs or anything but diseases people could catch from contact with an infected horse include ringworm, staph infections, salmonella, rabies, and anthrax

  "
224776,"
   That is exactly my point. We see a specific skill and how well someone is with it and ignore all of the previous experience they had in similar skills that helped them reach that point. The only thing that could constitute being natural is the passion put into its learning.
  ","
  That’s just what it is. Someone can be passionate about something and that’s why it comes easy to them. I despise math with all my being and it’s very difficult for me but my mom likes it and it makes sense to her
  "
224777,"
   Absolutely agree with the notiom above that we have a propensity towards certain skills and treats. I for one am extremely analytical, I automatically break things down and compartmentalize at a much faster rate than my twin brother. My twin is almost a mathematical genius, while I am good at math

  "
224780,"
   The entire idea of natural talent is bullshit. Even the idea that some people just have an easier time than others. That’s an assumption made by not knowing the work and time that person put into that skill or other equivalent skills. They weren’t born capable, they earned it.
  ","
  Nah I actually agree strongly with the notion that some people have an easier time doing and learning certain things than others. While they did earn their skills in the end, and everyone can learn to do anything they want, we each have our own strengths and weaknesses to start off with.
  
  For example, math is extremely difficult for me and it takes a LOT of work for me to understand new concepts and do any sort of calculations. I’ve always found it very difficult, and even though I can do it, it takes a lot lot lot of thinking and explaining and repeating, but my mom can pick up entirely new concepts and calculations within minutes. Always been that way for me, always been that way for her. I’ve always had a knack for picking up any sort of art skills pretty easily from square one when I’ve never done them before. I’m pretty crafty. That’s SUPER hard for my mom. She’s always struggled with learning new art skills but that doesn’t mean she can’t and didn’t learn them.

   Do you ever have the desire to dress up like a sexy librarian?
  ","
  No
  "
224782,"
   But what if you broke your neck?
  ","
  That’s a risk you have to accept when you do any sport. The same goes for motor cross, football, soccer, lacrosse, anything that involves physical activity.
  
  My old trainers had me practice how to do safe “emergency dismounts” where you have to practice falling off and also jumping off and away from the horse when it’s moving just in case you needed to bail or in case you were falling down and had to let go. Lots of tuck and roll involved
  "
224783,"
   Aren't you afraid of that happening?
  ","
  No it’s part of the sport you just have to accept. I usually only fall off like once a year if at all. I’ve just been doing it for a long long time so I’ve had lots of opportunity to fall down lol
  "
224784,"

  "
224786,"

  Yeah lots of times. Once I broke my wrist. But it wasn’t that bad. Usually isn’t unless you hit your head or fall wrong
  "
224787,"
   Do you clean your belly button regularly?
  ","
  The same amount as I shower
  "
224788,"
   Yes! This is the reason I asked this question. Natural talent is bullshit, and the idea that one can’t learn something because it takes effort drives me crazy.
  ","
  Agree!! There are those who have a natural propensity to pick up skills easier than others but that doesn’t mean people can learn do do things that are difficult for them! No such thing as not being able to do something because you’re not talented
  "
224789,"

   Got any tips on how to not care what somebody says about you? Definitely asking for myself.... 😬
  ","
  Just remember that any time someone goes out of their way to say something rude or mean to you for no reason it’s because they’re trying to make themselves feel better about something. It’s not you, it’s them. It takes energy and effort to be a dick to someone, but no effort at all to mind your own business and be civil.

  I said I’d rather have neither of those kinda of partners. I don’t like video games lol so that would be super boring and miserable to have a partner who was constantly gaming instead of being outside doing stuff. Just not my type. And obvi cheaters are scum lol that was never a question

  Haha uh noooo that’s not necessary. Like I said he isn’t mean, he’s just blah. He never makes an effort to see her, to call, to FaceTime, to talk with our family, to visit during holidays or birthdays or even to get to know her that much. She doesn’t seem like she really even knows that much about him and she’s been dating him for almost 2 years I think. It’s like they have nothing in common and she just spends all her time and money driving to see him and she gets nothing in return. My parents don’t hate him but they also don’t really like him very much. I feel the same way. He’s not awful he just doesn’t give her what she deserves

  No idea. I don’t go on Facebook
  "
225209,"
   Have you ever saved money for buying expensive thing like chanel purse etc
  ","
  I’ve saved money to buy useful expensive things like new phones and stuff but never for something like a designer brand. Designer brands  are a waste of money imo
  "
225210,"
   Christmas is the best holiday, true or false?

   Is this a good place to talk about politics?
  ","
  Not with me but maybe some people enjoy it
  "
225215,"
   Is it easy or difficult for you to apologize?
  ","
  Easy
  "
225216,"
   What is the theme of your Christmas tree this year? 🎄

  ","
  Awooo!
  "
225223,"
   lol sorry but you walked right into that one!
  ","
  No actually, I feel like that was uncalled for and just annoying and rude. It’s not cool or funny to sexualize others during an otherwise normal conversation or honestly ever without their consent. Just awkward and it gets extremely old very quick
  "
225224,"

  "

   Well then I guess you're just very comfortable with seeing your naked body in all those positions. Oh wait...maybe you haven't seen THAT video yet.
