real people .","299708":"these days , i ve been listening to a lot of hard rock , hip hop , and low fi hip hop instrumentals . however , i also enjoy classic rock , nu metal , classical , and the

own mental health , whether it was through understanding their emotions or inspiring them to seek out therapy . it makes me incredibly happy when i receive those types of messages because it means that my advocacy is working . mental health is so important to me and i can only hope that by talking about it more , i can help more people with their own struggles .","299756":"on my bad days , the only thing i really do is sleep . on those days , it s incredibly difficult for me to get out of bed , let alone function as a normal human being . i try to sleep and allow the depression to pass , otherwise everything just makes me even more miserable . i isolate myself because i don t want anyone to deal with my moods .","299757":"i wrote an essay about death about a month ago . it was mostly for me , but i shared it on medium . com and a few close friends .","299758":"my boyfriend saw grieves in concert recently , so i ve been listening to his music especially sunny side of hell and on the rocks . i ve also been listening to matt maeson , two feet , grandson , and city colour .","299759":"ultimate chicken horse ! ! it s a really fun , competitive sorta platforming game where you and your friends have to make it from one side of the map to the other , but you have a choice of obstacles to place down to make it harder for your friends to go across .","299760":"after i finished watching the ted bundy tapes , i began watching forensic files from the very beginning , which should last me a while ! ! there are nine seasons and episodes per season , lmao .","299761":"no , but p rn puts forth unrealistic notions of sexual relationships , and a lot of content is violent which only encourages budding r pists to act out on their desires . technically , r pe is about power and dominance .","299762":"i stopped watching p rn long before i understood the reality of the sex industry . it wasn t the reason why i stopped , but it helped me develop a greater understanding of why a lot of people are against it overall .","299763":"yes , it did for me personally because sex is somewhat important to my relationship . it created a deeper feeling of comfort and intimacy .","299764":"yeah , i do believe that most people only care about themselves and their loved ones . obviously there are people who exist who are passionate about humanity as a whole and are willing to help anyone in need , but i honestly do believe that a majority of individuals only genuinely care about themselves and those close to them .","299765":"there s a lot of danger involved in the sex industry , from human trafficking to unreported cases of r pe and everything in between . you can easily google this information , there are quite a few resources available with statistics and whatnot .","299766":"i remember seeing it on late night television , and i also had internet access when i was a pre teen . i don t remember if my friends had anything to do with it , though .","299767":"it depends entirely on the relationship itself . some people value sex while others don t everyone is different and you have to experiment with your own relationship to see what works best for you . in some cases , sex is important so those people value the act and it makes their relationship stronger . however that isn t the case for everyone .","299768":"i think i watched p rn for the first time when i was or years old . it wasn t problematic for me at the time because i simply didn t know better . i only learned about the dangers and implications of the industry recently within the past few years .","299769":"not at all . if it was something i regretted , then i would seriously have to reconsider the relationship . if i were to regret something like having sxx with him , then it might indicate that my feelings towards him aren t as strong as i think they are .","299770":"yeah exactly . i also uses to frequently travel to queens and the bronx , as well as driven through some bad parts of brooklyn , so you always have to remain hypervigilant .","299771":"i don t like the idea of p rn because of the implications regarding sxx trafficking and the high rate of r pe that occurs in the sxx industry in general . also , p rn perpetuates unrealistic standards and practices that are unhealthy for relationships . it would be impossible to ban it completely , but i do believe there should be some sort of regulation involved .","299772":"it ll be years this upcoming june .","299773":"for real , though . i bet a lot of people who aren t from new york or big cities in general probably think i m overreacting , but when you grow up in environments where there are constant threats , you get used to it .","299774":"no , i m not married . however , i m in a long term relationship .","299775":"yes , on a few occasions . there was also a lot of theft that occurred when i worked in the drug store .","299776":"you re surrounded by a bunch of strangers whose intentions are unknown to you . anyone could easily try to take advantage of you , try to steal your belongings , threaten you , etc etc .","299777":"no , lmao .","299778":"i don t like being around people in general . however , crowds make me extremely anxious to the point where if i m around people for too long then i might have an anxiety attack . my paranoia also kicks in too .","299779":"aren t all songs emotional to a degree ? ? lately i ve been listening to beggar s song by matt maeson .","299780":"yes , there are family photos as well as paintings .","299781":"yes , especially in retrospect . ten years ago , i was only years old and had a completely different mindset than i have now .","299782":"seeing my boyfriend happy brings a whole host of smiles to my face .","299783":"daylight savings time ! ! i m so happy that i won t have to drive home in the dark for the next few months , lol .","299784":"i just got the shorter side of my hair shaved again , so that made me happy . it s always nice to have a fresh buzz .","299785":"yes , i wholeheartedly agree with this statement . no matter how healthy you are , tomorrow is never guaranteed because anything can happen . it s best to make the most out of every day and continually let your loved ones know how much they mean to you .","299786":"it was chilly and windy earlier today . it s supposed to go down into the teens fahrenheit tonight .","299787":"no . i wasn t friendly to strangers when i was single and there s no reason for me to be friendly now . obviously i m cordial , but i don t go out and make conversations with strangers or anything .","299788":"i don t know the answer to this question . it s not as taboo now as it was in the past , but i don t know where the stigma originated from .","299789":"sex is still seen as a taboo topic in society . however , if you re talking about askfm , then talking about sex is against the community guidelines .","299790":"as my bio indicates , i live in new york .","299791":"definitely not new york , lol .","299792":"yes , i love green tea . i actually bought an iced matcha latte the other day .","299793":"putting on cozy pajamas , drinking a cup of coffee , and wrapping myself up in a blanket .","299794":"yes , i talk to my boyfriend every day .","299795":"hello do you have a question ? ?","299796":"no , i need at least something to play with i . e . cut , color , etc . i would be too bored with a shaved head , and plus i don t think it would suit me .","299797":"yes , my username on twitter is poetalunam .","299798":"yes to all of the above .","299799":"uh , what . lmao . i don t really understand the question .","299800":"no , i ve never cheated on anyone before .","299801":"i literally have no clue . i just signed in because i just got home from work and my notifications are going wild .","299802":"i haven t done so in years . i don t ever feel the need to take a hiatus because social media is a way for me to wind down at the end of the day .","299803":"aw , thank you ! ! anything really although i do like answering relationship questions , and questions about mental health , video games , writing , tv and movies , etc etc .","299804":"hey friends , my inbox is empty so y all should send me questions","299805":"i don t wear perfume , but sometimes i ll use body spray , like the victoria s secret warm cozy spray or bath and body works rose quartz spray . i like when my boyfriend wears cologne , but he only wears it on special occasions . his favorite is ralph lauren polo black which smells so good .","299806":"i normally ask the typical icebreaker questions , i . e . what do you do for a living ? where did you go to school ? what s your love life like ? if i want to talk to them further , then i ll inquire about their passions , desires , ambitions , etc etc . things like what hobbies make them happy , what they want to do in their life , what they re most passionate about , and where they see themselves in years .","299807":"i guess the only fandom i m part of is the rooster teeth achievement hunter fandom , because i ve been watching their content for over years now . i ve gone to their gaming convention , met new friends through their website , and i own quite a few of their merchandise like dvds , shirts and hoodies , and glassware .","299808":"as long as both people are happy and can communicate their feelings , then i m happy for them .","299809":"i m a selfless person , to a certain degree i m selfless when it comes to my loved ones , but certainly not everyone . in the scenario you just posed , it would depend on my feelings toward that community and how connected to that community i feel . if i cared about a lot of people within that town , then perhaps i would sacrifice myself .","299810":"i don t have one at the moment .","299811":"i ordered a large soda , the veggie bowl , and the nacho fries for .","299812":"sour cream .","299813":"sometimes . i only really eat chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream , but i seldom have it .","299814":"probably not , i haven t tried since i was a teenager .","299815":"if you want to get to know me , you can read my page or ask me questions . lol . askfm isn t a site to have conversation , there are other social media sites for that objective .","299816":"i think people who are pro life are generally misinformed individuals . their opinions aren t backed by scientific evidence .","299817":"i don t know what the comfortable game is .","299818":"this is askfm . . . a site designed to ask questions .","299819":"i ve been cheated on , but i ve never cheated or been someone s side piece .","299820":"hello do you have a question ? ?","299821":"yeah , that happens to me a lot . there s nothing i can do to change the past , but that doesn t mean it stops my thoughts from thinking about what i could have done differently .","299822":"there is no specific age involved in marriage . it depends on the couple and how compatible they are , and how fast or slow they want to take the relationship .","299823":"no , i don t believe in horoscopes . they can be applied to basically anyone regardless of your astrological sign because of the way they re written .","299824":"i ve never taken those medications before .","299825":"no , i absolutely hate crowds . they make me extremely anxious .","299826":"they re pretty , but they re also hella mean .","299827":"most coffee consumed in one sitting . lmao .","299828":"no , because that means it was in self defense .","299829":"it doesnt phase me . as long as no one approaches me , i couldn t care less if people look at me or not .","299830":"i don t answer questions regarding sex on askfm . even though this isn t directly related to my own sex life , i only really talk about sex in an educational manner . in addition , if i answer this question then that would only invite more people to ask sex related questions . so , no thanks .","299831":"yeah , losing some limbs isn t a life sentence . medical technology is so advanced these days that people can get very lifelike and accurate prosthetic limbs and relearn how to walk , run , write , play sports , play instruments , etc etc .","299832":"the best thing to ever happen to me is meeting my boyfriend and developing our relationship . he has helped me more than i believe he knows , and i would certainly be in a much worse off place rn if it wasn t for his positive influence in my life .","299833":"no . it isn t something i was ever interested in learning about .","299834":"no , i ve never been to a gay club before . i ve only ever been to a club once in my life , lol .","299835":"sometimes . it can be entertaining and amusing , but at the same time , i m never really in a position where i can people watch often .","299836":"the feeling of being surrounded by music and watching the musician work in their element .","299837":"not far at all , lmao . the only things i plan for in advance are events like vacations or concerts .","299838":"i don t like any name for myself other than leigh .","299839":"for the most part , sure . but nearly everyone thinks that their perception is the right perception until shown otherwise .","299840":"i m sure there is , but i never paid enough attention to really come to any distinct conclusions .","299841":"no , certainly not all cultures . while some cultures may seem to blend into others with relative ease , there will always be outside cultures that will be unaffected .","299842":"no . like i said earlier , it doesn t phase me .","299843":"no , i don t believe mainstream media is outdated . nearly all media is mainstream at this point .","299844":"i m fairly unphased by most events going on in the news . i m not surprised by anything anymore .","299845":"this isn t a question .","299846":"no . the news will never be outdated because current events are always happening on a daily basis .","299847":"no . i have no reason to smile at a stranger .","299848":"some days it can be described as let s fix these writers careless mistakes because they don t proofread their own work . other days it can be why the hell does this client want this feature to look sloppy and inconsistent after i ve already fixed this ? and then some days it can be i m going to write the best damn feature ever . . . three hours later . . . two paragraphs is good enough , right ?","299849":"no , i don t know if i even want children in the future .","299850":"my arms .","299851":"nail biting and skin picking are my top two habits . my nail biting isn t as bad , but my skin picking has taken control of my life .","299852":"i don t generally cook , so probably never .","299853":"i m not getting into the whole metaphysical nonsensical stuff tonight . you can ask me any other questions you want , but these questions are redundant .","299854":"uh , myself . lmao . there are no other people in my mind .","299855":"no , my thoughts are my own internal monologues .","299856":"they generally happen without reason i can t control them easily , even if i try to rationalize the thoughts .","299857":"all the time . it s never ending .","299858":"nope , i m happily in a relationship .","299859":"nah , i m good . i m laying in bed and have no desire to initiate a discussion with my parents . regardless , you wouldn t even know if i did or not considering this is the internet .","299860":"uh , no ? ? lmao .","299861":"hello do you have a question ? ?","299862":"more than i can count . i ve been coloring my hair since i was years old .","299863":"i would rather experience the beginning of planet earth because no other humans existed at that time for at least another few million years .","299864":"i honestly have no clue because i can t remember the last time someone dared me to do something , lol . it s probably been at least years . in addition , most of the wild and reckless stuff i ve done has been on my own free will .","299865":"something new about me i recently got a promotion at my job . my boyfriend i booked a huge family vacation . i m thinking about buying hozier tickets for november . something interesting about me i sneeze when i look at the sun . i never learned how to ride a bicycle . i m left handed .","299866":"my inbox is empty so y all should ask me questions ! !","299867":"study pass , or don t study fail . alternatively , you can just skip the class and accept the zero .","299868":"no , i don t know anyone else who is interested in that sort of activity . i m pretty much the only writing grammar nerd out of my friends , lol . thank you for the compliment , though ! !","299869":"driving i literally spend about two hours driving each day , and it is one of the most aggravating things i deal with .","299870":"i m years old i ve been in a relationship for ten years .","299871":"my sense of humor can be rather witty sometimes . i love my passions for writing , art , and music . i ve struggled through a lot , but i still survived and learned to understand why things happened the way they did . i m a loyal friend and significant other .","299872":"my weekend has been going well . yesterday , i worked in the morning , took a nap , and then headed to my boyfriend s house to chill with him for a few hours before he headed off into work . i wound up staying the night at his house i strangely woke up minutes before he got home , so we drank some coffee for an hour before we went back to bed . this morning , we woke up around am noon ish , had some coffee and listened to music for a few hours . i just got home and now i m going to finish up the work i didn t complete yesterday morning .","299873":"he doesn t have an account on askfm .","299874":"i wouldn t imagine that would matter very much in my profession . i wouldn t personally get hand or finger tattoos until i get the rest of my sleeves done , though .","299875":"my biggest fear isn t an animal , haha . but i suppose i m afraid of spiders the most .","299876":"does this morning count ? ? lol .","299877":"no . it s only gay if the person saying it is , indeed , homosexual .","299878":"i have a bachelor s degree .","299879":"thank you so much . you re a doll .","299880":"aw , that s so cool ! ! thank you for sharing","299881":"apparently so , rofl . it would be one thing if i worked in the business field or something , but considering my job is creative , it really doesn t matter .","299882":"thanks , man","299883":"this sounds more like a you problem than a me problem . i personally love the blue hair that s all that matters . you forgot to mention the part where half of my head is also shaved surely that doesn t meet your approval either . lmao .","299884":"i regret one tattoo of mine , but that s because i thought the artist would do a better job than he did . i ve been meaning to get it touched up , but it s on my ribcage so i m terrified of getting tattooed there again lmao .","299885":"i wouldn t get any tattoos on my head or neck .","299886":"cheese fries , percent .","299887":"beers montauk wave chaser ipa , fat tire , yuengling . wines cavit pinot grigio , the dreaming tree cabernet sauvignon , and pindar pythagoras .","299888":"mostly beer coors light is one of the few that come to mind . after i was legal , i delved into other options and especially in terms of wine .","299889":"yeah , it s so gross to me . not even just to get drunk , but to relax after a long day . moscato has always been disgusting to me , even when i was a kid and too young to drink legally lol .","299890":"aw , this is so sweet . thank you","299891":"i like wine . i prefer white wine over red wine , but i don t like anything too sweet like moscato or chardonnay . i like pinot grigio for white and cabernet sauvignon for red .","299892":"ugh . i ve never been a fan of scotch or whiskey , regardless of how much i ve tried to like it .","299893":"i m all for liquor . my favorite is spiced rum , but i also like tequila .","299894":"my day went well . i worked in the morning and basically did nothing in the afternoon until i got to my boyfriend s house . then we hung out for a while , took a nap , and i ve been drunk high ever since .","299895":"yes , i am quite bored .","299896":"you could send me questions","299897":"no , i haven t . there aren t many places available to me unless i want to go into new york city .","299898":"well i developed multiple mental illnesses as a result so technically i m not okay , but i m doing the best for myself that i can currently do at the moment .","299899":"i d rather not talk about it in detail . i was physically and emotionally abvsed for more than years of my life . but that s all i want to say about it .","299900":"yep you caught me . lmao . but in all honesty , my family isn t part of my loved ones . i have no qualms saying that because they ve hurt me so much over the years , i have no feelings towards them anymore .","299901":"i wish i traveled more , that s assuming i died at my current age and not sometime in the future . i can only hope i ll be able to travel in the future .","299902":"these questions are fucking stupid man .","299903":"i d rather be surrounded by loved ones . my boyfriend , his family , and my close friends . as well as my best friend and her family .","299904":"the atlantic ocean .","299905":"uh , red wine obviously . although lately i ve been preferring pinot grigio .","299906":"probably , sure . i would hate to get to the point where someone else had to take care of me , so i would want to die on my own terms .","299907":"yes , it is ! !","299908":"yeah , but i also understand that it isn t something people generally like talking about unless they re close to the person .","299909":"i like taking photos of natural environments , i . e . the woods or the beach . this is a photo i took a few years ago","299910":"lately , it s been sleeping drinking alcohol , lmao . however , my sober hobbies include writing , playing video games , reading , painting , and doing photography .","299911":"i m not here to make new friends . however , you can ask me questions if you wish i ll answer them .","299912":"i don t give my snapchat out . i only use it with my friends .","299913":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","299914":"bawk bawk bitch .","299915":"this is a frequent issue in my relationship , to be totally honest with you . actually , it s the only issue in our relationship at the moment . he has a very high sex drive , so the fact that i lost mine has been somewhat stressful to the relationship . he understands consent and never pressures me into anything , but sometimes i will do things even if i m not sexually interested in them , but it does make me happy knowing that i m giving him pleasure . and i do get into the mood sometimes , it just isn t very often at all anymore .","299916":"does anyone have any questions ? ? i n bored my inbox is empty","299917":"i have what s called chicken skin which are little bumps on the back of the arms . it started out as me squeezing them because i thought they were pimples , and eventually over time it turned into me picking every single blemish on my arms to the point where i bleed profusely . it s something i m extremely insecure about because my arms are a wreck , and people always look at me weird if i m wearing short sleeves . i also have scars everywhere .","299918":"sometimes , yeah . i have to be in the mood for it , though .","299919":"haha ! ! thank you very much .","299920":"i don t have any plans for next week besides going to therapy . most of my plans happen spontaneously anyway . my weekend is going well , though . today has been pretty chill , and i m planning on finishing up my work and doing laundry tomorrow .","299921":"i ve been good , actually . i got a promotion at work recently , so i ve been busy with that . i m currently just hanging at my boyfriend s house , even though he isn t home haha .","299922":"the x files ! ! lol . i love that show so much .","299923":"nah , i rarely use headphones to begin with . and knowing me , i would lose them immediately , lol .","299924":"i can be myself at my boyfriend s house . he and his family accept me for who i am .","299925":"i don t have much of a temper unless someone really gets under my skin .","299926":"my day has been good ! ! i got a lot of work done in the morning , and then i went to my boyfriend s house to chill for a few hours . he s working an overnight tonight . i smoked a bit before taking a nap , and when i woke up i was still high , so uh i guess i m not going anywhere anytime soon , lmao .","299927":"my favorite games are skyrim , fallout , the assassin s creed series , the halo series , the bioshock series , far cry , life is strange , etc etc .","299928":"dragonfruit , maybe ? ? it s so good though , omg .","299929":"thanks i like hanging out with my friends and boyfriend , writing , playing video games , painting , and reading .","299930":"lol . good to know ! !","299931":"i m not a big pizza person , so i don t know which was the best , lol .","299932":"idk , i ve never had pizza elsewhere so i have nothing to compare it to .","299933":"i don t go to pizza hut .","299934":"slices on salads or in tacos , in spreads , and in guacamole .","299935":"i ve never had that problem , lol .","299936":"avocados are absolutely perfect beings .","299937":"unfortunately , i have . it s been quite a few years , though . like i ve stated time and time again on here , i used to be a pretty reckless kid .","299938":"the past wasn t so great , and i don t really envision the future being great either depending on how the next election goes . i suppose it would depend on if i m being reborn as myself or someone else entirely .","299939":"i don t believe i know who that is .","299940":"i m outside smoking a cigarette rn . however , when you asked me this , i was having sex , lol .","299941":"no , but i had a faux hawk when i was in high school .","299942":"sure , it definitely could be . they ve dodged every attempt at death that happens during life , as it can occur at any moment .","299943":"i don t personally think so . it s a sink regardless , and as long as you re brushing your teeth , it doesn t really matter where it happens .","299944":"anything is possible , rofl . it wouldn t surprise me if some users were found anonymously sending questions to other people .","299945":"yeah , it s close to an epidemic , at least in the united states . painkillers are so easily gotten and easily addictive .","299946":"no , i don t do that sort of thing .","299947":"rofl . this is indeed true .","299948":"i would probably want to live in england or ireland , since the majority of the people there speak english . it would be easier for me to assimilate into the culture .","299949":"i can t remember the last time i bought a new game . i think it was life is strange , probably sometime in september . needless to say , i don t spend much money on games at all .","299950":"does it make sense if i say both ? ? lol . i m tough in situations where i need to be , but i m also incredibly sensitive at the same time .","299951":"no . the united states doesn t have an official language .","299952":"i don t watch reality shows , so i don t really have an opinion .","299953":"only his grandmother speaks spanish , and i rarely see her as it is . the rest of his family learned english when they immigrated here .","299954":"no , they re too old at this point , haha . i desperately need new tattoos .","299955":"i only speak english , and right now , i don t have an interest in learning another language .","299956":"no , i m not that old , lol . i learned how to type on a regular computer .","299957":"i picked up on the habit of typing y all on the internet , but it isn t something i say irl , lol .","299958":"he makes slightly more money than me by one dollar , if even that much .","299959":"i don t think i would want the highest position in my current job because to be in charge of an entire publishing company seems incredibly daunting . i just got a promotion where i m the sole person in charge of a specific program , so right now , i m happy with where i am . if there s something else that catches my eye that i would want to pursue , or if another opportunity presents itself to me , then i would also take that into consideration . as for the financial aspect of my job , i don t really think people make a lot of money in my field unless they re in some higher up corporate position , which is why i feel sorta stuck at the moment .","299960":"honestly , i don t know if i want children . i ve never have a parental instinct and i don t know how to behave around children i . e . i never know what to talk to them about , haha , and it always makes me feel so awkward . if i did end up having a child , i don t know if those instincts would miraculously appear . i know it s possible since people form an automatic bond with their children during pregnancy and at birth , but it isn t something guaranteed for me and it scares me sometimes .","299961":"everyone is wife material , lol . you don t have to act or behave a certain way in order to be someone s spouse . the only thing you have to do is love someone unconditionally while maintaining consistency in the distribution of household chores and parenting with your spouse , which isn t dependent on gender .","299962":"i don t generally make new friends . i m happy with the friends i currently have .","299963":"that s the opposite of what i just said , but whatever suits your fancy .","299964":"i don t generally ask people questions . however , you re free to ask me whatever questions you would like within reason .","299965":"there are no feminists on askfm anymore , lol . regardless , i always took what the former feminists on askfm said into consideration before creating my own opinions , but i didn t allow their opinions to rule my own thoughts . contrary to what you believe , most of my opinions are rooted in some sort of factual basis .","299966":"if you re asking me to answer sxxual questions , then my answer will always be no .","299967":"no , but i m pretty sure drake was on it .","299968":"this basically defines my entire childhood , haha . nearly everyone i know in my age group watched degrassi . i saw a few episodes when i was younger , but i wasn t obsessed with the show or anything .","299969":"this is a prime example of the whole bashing other people for their opinions because they have inner turmoil that i just talked about . instead of criticizing my weight , which has nothing to do with my opinions , perhaps you should take a critical look at yourself and discover why you feel the need to lash out at a stranger anonymously on the internet .","299970":"no , because my opinions aren t simply opinions they re supported by factual evidence from scientists , psychologists , anthropologists , etc etc . if it was simply an opinion and not based in any sort of physical or scientific evidence , then perhaps i would reconsider my opinions . however , that isn t the case when it comes to gender identity .","299971":"everyone is entitled to their own opinion as long as that opinion doesn t directly discriminate against people for things that are out of their control , such as their race , sex , gender , mental or physical illness , etc etc . it s always wrong to feel the need to always be right about certain things because it simply isn t aiding in your personal growth . and if someone feels the need to bash someone else over their personal opinions , then they probably have some sort of inner turmoil that s making them lash out in such a manner .","299972":"no , it doesn t make me sad at all . most of the time , the people i m close with on social media have other forms of accounts on other apps , so i end up talking to them or following them on there instead .","299973":"i wouldn t say that i love hummus , but i do enjoy it a lot . i usually have it with baby carrots or pretzels .","299974":"no , no one is obligated to share all of their thoughts with their partner . everyone is their own individual and they should only share what s comfortable to them , and that ranges depending on how close you are in the relationship . however , if you re afraid to share things with your partner , then that may be a red flag .","299975":"i m not a picky eater at all , and i ll eat almost anything as long as it sustains me . sometimes i enjoy trying new food , but i usually stick with what i know .","299976":"aw , that s perfectly okay ! ! i hope you feel better","299977":"it depends on the situation . if i need help with something , then i ll approach the person first so that we can handle the situation together it mostly occurs during work , though . however , that s pretty much the only time i ever approach people .","299978":"i know it s super early on the east coast it s not even am where i live , lol , but if anyone is awake ask me questions ! ! i ll be working on some freelance stuff and enjoying the snow fall outside my window , so i m up for answering nearly anything .","299979":"people are constantly growing evolving . it s only natural for them to lose interest in certain hobbies , and even certain people , because it doesn t relate to them the same way as it is when they were younger . it s a natural part of getting older and discovering what you truly like and value .","299980":"i think schools should focus more on problem students and how to inspire them to work better for themselves , as well as crack down on actual problems in school like drug substance usage . by focusing on something as mild as vaping , you re minimalizing the other problems at hand . obviously vaping can be an issue because of the nicotine involved , but i simply believe that there are more important matters at stake when it comes to middle schools and high schools .","299981":"i m never in situations where i m around people who are just learning how to speak english , and i don t really have the patience to sit down and teach someone how to speak write in english . i couldn t be an advisor in that field because it simply isn t something i m interested in .","299982":"no , i don t think it s creepy in a general sense . however , it depends entirely on what you say how you say it as well . the way you approach a person could be creepy , even if the words themselves aren t creepy .","299983":"australia , new zealand , iceland , the uk , spain , the caribbean , and alaska .","299984":"sounds like anti vaxx propaganda to relate something they dislike to something else that they dislike in an effort to radicalize their movement .","299985":"wow , that s going to be a huge loss on their part . even most debit cards have the word visa written on them to indicate that they can be used as a credit card , so even if someone doesn t have an actual credit card , they probably won t be able to use their debit card either unless they manually put in their pin number . i think it doesn t matter which way a person pays , as long as they re obviously paying for their purchase and it doesn t get declined .","299986":"i ve used the phrase before , but not in any sort of nefarious or problematic way . the first example that comes to mind would be , you re never too old to have cereal for dinner . it isn t exactly immature by any means , but it does bring you back to that childlike state , especially if you re doing something like watching cartoons while you eat , lol .","299987":"this reminds me of the show chalkzone ! ! i would rather make things into a reality by drawing them . in that case , i would simply draw money for myself . lmao .","299988":"ahh , this is a hard question . i think i would rather know the cause of death rather than the date . if i knew my date of death , then i would be constantly worried thinking about it , and i wouldn t be living my life at all .","299989":"i m not a parent at all , but i think it s wrong for parents to willingly humiliate their children as a means of discipline . it s extremely childish and demeaning , in my eyes . the child won t grow up to respect you as both a parent and a human being . in order to properly discipline a child , there has to be communication not humiliation . i don t really know if it s akin to having a god like complex , but it s definitely an ignorant way to parent a child .","299990":"getting down to the root of the problem , which is drug trafficking police need to crack down on the drugs being distributed in the streets , as well as provide more health care options for addicts who feel like they need help but don t know where to look , or don t have the resources to get treatment . supply and demand is a large component of drug trades , and if there s less demand for the drugs on the street , then dealers will have a hard time maintaining their clientele .","299991":"i don t know much about the event besides seeing headlines for it on facebook . but victoria s secret is notorious for discriminating again people who aren t conventionally attractive , who aren t thin , and who aren t cisgender and i think something happened with them regarding poc but i don t remember . it makes sense why they aren t making any money these days . i still buy from the company because i still fit into their clothing , strangely enough , but a lot of people are disgusted by what they represent and don t want to endorse a company like that .","299992":"yes , they absolutely should . someone s sexual orientation or gender doesn t determine their parenting skill , and children deserve to have loving homes regardless of what their parents are . there are so many inadequate heterosexual homes that foster or adopt children , it doesn t make sense that people who are gay or trans can t adopt as long as they have an adequate home and can provide for the child .","299993":"i don t talk to people outside of askfm . however , if you have questions , feel free to ask me here .","299994":"no ? ? you re a total stranger , lol .","299995":". . . are you kidding me ? ? i think that s ridiculous . smoking a vape is essentially the same thing as smoking a cigarette , and people shouldn t be accommodated that deeply for their vice when they can clearly just go outside for five minutes . smokers aren t given an extra room to smoke in , so why should vapers be treated any differently ? ?","299996":"yes , but my instagram is private . i only accept requests from people i know .","299997":"hell . freaking . yes .","299998":"thanks , my dude","299999":"as my bio indicates , i live in new york .","300000":"i can t sleep does anyone have any questions to keep me occupied ? ?","300001":"aahh , i ll have to check it out ! ! thank you .","300002":"i haven t ! ! i don t think i was aware that there was a comic .","300003":"courrtana , someone is calling you","300004":"i still have to pay a remaining balance for my doctor s office i passed the due date by a week , so i m nervous that they re going to slam interest on the charge because i haven t paid yet . i want to call them tomorrow to see if i can pay over the phone , otherwise they ll just have to wait for a check in the mail .","300005":"i think we re mutuals , but we don t talk to each other . although i did message babycadiexo once a few years ago about my diagnosis .","300006":"i believe it s both . some people in power profit off of the marginalization of others , while other forms of inequality is an inevitable consequence of the way the government works .","300007":"lol , definitely not . there s too much inequality in the united states for it to be such a society .","300008":"realistically , yeah . but there are a lot of people who equate happiness with wealth in a superficial way . however , at the same time , wealth can be equated to happiness because a lot of people may be more at ease if they didn t have financial struggles to deal with on a regular basis .","300009":"the more money you have the more power you have , in a general sense . or vice versa . people with a lot of power , especially in the corporate and political worlds , have massive amounts of wealth .","300010":"because they re greedy ruled by money . a lot of people only see dollar signs instead of focusing their attention on the relationships they create in life , and the power associated with wealth rules them .","300011":"lol , i wish i was rich .","300012":"yeah , animals of all species have their own brand of language much like humans express different languages depending on which part of the world they occupy .","300013":"to an extent , yes . language is a tool used by people of all cultures , and even in animals , to express ideas and further our understanding of ourselves and the world around us . it s also constantly improving and evolving . not to mention the fact that programming language is a technology in itself .","300014":"i don t remember . i graduated from college six years ago .","300015":"my bachelor s degree was in communications and professional writing , so i learned grammar rhetoric in a very intense manner that isn t touched upon in high school , how to communicate effectively within a group via oral communication classes , how to design and format various media with adobe programs , and other things having to do with business communications . i also minored in english literature , so i studied a lot of classic literature and developed a greater understanding of where language comes from and how it s evolved over the years in terms of literary techniques and styles . i also majored in creative writing for one year , so i was taught how to formally structure a paragraph depending on your audience and the do s and don ts of writing fiction and non fiction .","300016":"certain stocks , i would assume . i know absolutely nothing about economics , though .","300017":"not really , no . i only have a bachelor s degree .","300018":"love is a feeling of unconditional infatuation with a person , where you tend to care about their well being more than you care about your own at times , and you consistently want what s best for them before your own needs . their existence in your life is meaningful to you you feel the most like yourself around them , the best version of yourself that you can be .","300019":"not really , no . our opinions are undoubtedly influenced by those around us , whether it s from our friends and family or the media in general . even if our opinion is truly our own , it was influenced in some way through a particular source which led us to come to that conclusion to begin with .","300020":"i m not really sure what my opinion is on this question . even if people of lower financial statuses are taxed at the same percentage as those of higher financial statuses , more money is being taxed from the wealthy because the amount taken out of their wealth will be larger due to the percentage amount . however , at the same time , i also believe that it s important to distinguish the discrepancies between people of higher and lower classes when it comes to taxes , because often those of lower classes cannot afford to get as much tax taken out as they currently do , which further leads to the disconnection between the and the .","300021":"no , i don t believe it s becoming more difficult . as long as you re fact checking your sources and reading articles from multiple news publications , then you can get a general idea of current events from a mostly unbiased perspective .","300022":"i think it all depends on in what context they re mentioning their ex . if they re complaining about the things they used to do or keep comparing their current date to their ex , then it may be an indication that they re still thinking about them or may not be completely over them . however , if they do mention that they learned certain things from their previous relationship , it may be seen as a good thing because that s an indication that they have moved on and are willing to open the next chapter of their life .","300023":"no , not in my opinion . a year old girl is still a minor , and it isn t her fault that she was groomed and taken advantage of by someone years older than her . the adult in this situation should know better than to pursue someone who s a minor , and they re the one at fault for their predatory behavior .","300024":"yeah , that s aggressive behavior regardless of whether it s verbal or physical .","300025":"if you re an adult , you re under no obligation to listen to your family in terms of you moving out and leading an independent lifestyle . they re going to have to accept the fact that you re your own person , and you need to live your life according to your own terms . i know it may be difficult to stand up to your family , but you owe it to yourself to move on with your life and start a new chapter .","300026":"somewhat , yeah . i m not as interested in world history as i used to be when i was in high school i took an ap european history course , but it s still something that interests me from time to time . especially the world war ii era and other events like the french revolution or the renaissance period .","300027":"according to google , teenagers are indeed allowed to get botox injections . i m assuming they would need permission from their parents first , though , considering they re minors .","300028":"i self sabotage more than i m sabotaged by other people , and it mainly has to do with the use of substances , i . e . drugs alcohol . i don t have much self control , and often it puts me in difficult positions . the last time i suppose i self sabotaged was a few days ago when i went out to celebrate my promotion . i got really drunk and i don t remember half of the night , which has always been so embarrassing for me . and even though i keep telling myself that i should ease up , i always give in .","300029":"probably video games , current events , my personal life and career , mental health misconceptions and stigmas , etc etc . i could never videoblog , though . i m extremely insecure about the way i look when i speak and the way i sound , haha .","300030":"i would rather be the most intelligent person in the room , but only really if that meant that you weren t intelligent if you were the funniest person . i value intelligence and education highly , and while it s wonderful to have a sense of humor , you can only go so far with humor in terms of interpersonal relationships .","300031":"i m wonderful at writing , but that s basically my only talent . i can express myself well via the written word , and it has always come naturally to me .","300032":"even though you mentioned gomez morticia addams already , i m going to have to repeat that because they re my all time favorite fictional couple ! ! their love is so surreal , intimate , and real . i ve always admired the connection they had , as well as the darkness associated with them , because it very much reminds me of my relationship with my boyfriend lol .","300033":"something that can always make my day better is a phonecall from my boyfriend , particularly when he has great news or had a wonderful day at work . it instantly raises my mood when i know that he s in a good place .","300034":"no , i believe that s completely unfair . however , i m fairly certain that s how the united states is currently being run , which is disappointing .","300035":"i would prefer my current boyfriend to be my future spouse , lol .","300036":"i m doing well i just got home from work , which was very productive because i managed to finished all of the tasks i laid out for myself last night then worked on completing more of a spreadsheet for the program i m administrating . after work , i stopped by dunkin and picked up an iced coffee even though it s freezing outside , lol , and now i m just sitting down and relaxing at home . i may go back out and run some errands tonight in light of whatever snowstorm is supposed to happen this weekend , but it isn t a priority .","300037":"someone else s eating habits don t matter much to me , as long as they re not completely unhealthy to the point where it s damaging to their body . i want what s best for them and their health , so if i see that they re eating junk food and other unhealthy items all the time , then i would perhaps raise the concern of what it s doing to their body .","300038":"it appears to be that way , sure . i don t know much about plutocracy besides it s basic definition government controlled by the wealthy , but much of the u . s . government is controlled by those who amass great amounts of wealth .","300039":"pinot grigio wine , fat tire beer , or spiced rum mixed with dr . pepper . i also enjoy blue hawaiian mixed drinks on occasion .","300040":"i am not a serial killer heathers the punisher the craft v for vendetta girl interrupted secret window sweeney todd les miserables the lord of the rings trilogy the hobbit trilogy queen of the damned the shining the crow","300041":"nah , i don t make my bed in the morning . sometimes i ll smooth the sheets and blankets out if i know i m going to immediately lay down when i get home , but that s rare .","300042":"i don t use any websites . however , i have apps for netflix hulu on my television , so i use those .","300043":"go to websites like monster . com , indeed . com , and ziprecruiter . com find jobs through there . or go to places in person and ask if they re hiring or have an employment application available .","300044":"i didn t see the drama regarding her on askfm yesterday . doesn t she not even have an account on here anymore ? ? lol . we re mutuals on twitter and we talk very occasionally .","300045":"no , i don t have any real plans . i m just planning on working , sleeping , and doing laundry .","300046":"my natural brows are arched i do get stray hairs beneath the brow line . i usually pluck or wax them myself .","300047":"i get sent other people s accounts on a weekly basis , if not more frequently than that . i usually delete them because it s just an anon s effort to start drama .","300048":"i ve had dreams about hanging out with courrtana ! ! lol . i don t remember what we were doing , but i definitely had a dream she was in it somewhere .","300049":"send feet pics .","300050":"no , that s rude and entitled behavior .","300051":"i am when i need to be .","300052":"yes , she should have waited in line like everyone else . everyone is in a rush these days and she isn t different or special because she also has somewhere to be . she should have managed her time better .","300053":"you would have to google this , i don t personally know the answer to this . i could imagine it being incredibly difficult to get permission to publish fanfiction , though . that s basically their brand on the line and there will inevitably be people who will read the book and think it s canon when it actually isn t .","300054":"no , i don t wear any rings .","300055":"anons love finding the smallest , most insignificant things and somehow making a problem out of them , lol . i knew exactly what you meant when i read the initial answer you posted , but i suppose some people took it way too literally .","300056":"if it was someone else , then i would have deleted the statement because it wouldn t concern me . however , people spreading gross lies about those i care about does concern me , which is why i responded to the initial message .","300057":"there s nothing wrong with putting off certain milestones when you know you re not ready for them yet . there isn t so much pressure on young people to get married and start a family by a certain age anymore . society has learned that there is so much more to life than marriage and children .","300058":"probably because they re seeking an education , not a life partner .","300059":"ideally , sure . but it s impossible to really make that into a law because it s difficult to monitor .","300060":"no , my boyfriend and i never had an argument about food . sometimes we ll be indecisive , but ultimately we re both easy going and will order from wherever .","300061":"i m doing all right i m a bit of an anxious and overwhelmed mess rn , but i m hoping sleep will help with that since i m debating on going to bed super early tonight .","300062":"no , being gay for someone is generally used as a term to mean idolizing or just being obsessed with them in general . it doesn t have an automatic sexual undertone to it unless you make it that way . having the hots for someone , on the other hand , is a sexualized term . lol i can t believe i have to explain this lingo , usually it s the other way around for me .","300063":"i think the song is catchy , but i don t really like the type of music she makes . i ve never seen the music video .","300064":"lol . an infatuation with a celebrity doesn t mean you have romantic or sexual feelings for them , oh lord . y all read too much into things .","300065":"i don t play video games with other people , lol . i ll occasionally play with my boyfriend and a few of his friends , but that s the extent of it .","300066":"no , i haven t . i was debating on buying it , though . i really loved far cry .","300067":"yeah , i use an xbox when i play video games .","300068":"i don t have any plans except to work , catch up on sleep , and do laundry .","300069":"no , i don t have cancer .","300070":"i m not native american , so i don t have a spirit animal .","300071":"uh , courrtana is married . lol . the only person she has a crush on is her husband , as far as i m aware .","300072":"i thought a teacher was cute , but that was the extent of it .","300073":"yeah , three of my medications i take once per day while another medication i take twice per day . if i miss one day , i don t usually feel any effects . however , if it s more than two days , then i experience a relapse in symptoms .","300074":"they make me feel emotionally stable , that s the most important part . and yes , my body got over the whole transition period perhaps a month into starting each medication .","300075":"yeah , i ve been on psych medication for a little over two years now .","300076":"so liven it up follow active people , ask questions , answer questions , etc etc . my feed is really active throughout the day .","300077":"thank you ! !","300078":"i ll try nearly anything at least once . i don t know any food off the top of my head that i wouldn t at least try .","300079":"i m meeting up with a friend to have celebratory drinks in light of my recent promotion ! !","300080":"send me questions while i wait for pm to come around","300081":"mountain dew baja blast ! !","300082":"no ? ? landscaping is a good career , you have the potential to make a lot of money that way . just keep saving up until you have enough to move out . you re still very young .","300083":"i ve never used straight cbd before , but i ve heard it works wonders with anxiety . i ve been thinking about researching some products online that i can ingest orally or even use as an oil since my anxiety has been acting up lately . i also know someone who has some sort of respiratory problems , i don t remember the name of the disorder he has . but he needs one of those breathing machines because it was getting so bad . however , he used a cbd ointment and applied it every night and it helped him to breathe a lot better .","300084":"aw , congrats ! ! that s so exciting . i just got a promotion at work my supervisor is doing my employee review so that i can get a raise accordingly we haven t talked numbers yet , though . in more personal news , my boyfriend and i booked a huge vacation for next year , so i m looking forward to that ! !","300085":"i ve never participated in a medical trial before , but i have considered it in the past . a local university put an advertisement on the radio regarding a clinical trial they were conducting with a new medication for depression , and thought about giving them a call , but i thought about it and didn t really want to screw up the medication regimen i already have because idk if that experimental medication would even work for me to begin with .","300086":"my day was quite productive ! ! my supervisor allowed me to take control of the fulfillment aspects of the program i m administrating , so i spent about two hours organizing files , formatting them into different file types , exporting them onto spreadsheets , and emailing them to the correct people so that the materials can be sent to the clients . it was meticulous work , but i m pretty sure i did everything correctly ! ! it s something i m going to have to do on a biweekly basis from now on , on top of my other responsibilities .","300087":"i don t really have any thoughts on the matter because i don t know the person you re talking about . however , being a parent requires a certain degree of instinct where you feel a natural inclination toward caring for a child , and if someone doesn t feel that instinct or express empathy toward others , then they may not be suitable for parenthood . at the same time , however , parenthood does change people into more expressive , sensitive individuals sometimes . they develop a natural bond with their baby and it becomes natural from there . so it goes on an entirely individualized basis .","300088":"i just got home from work i kinda hope one of my friends texts me back because i want to have a celebratory beer tonight .","300089":"i don t remember what it was about , but it happened a few weeks ago . i was at my boyfriend s house we were talking about something , and i just remember laughing hysterically to the point where i was tearing up .","300090":"none of my friends enjoy going out and partying on the weekends , haha . i m the only person out of my friend group who doesn t work on the weekends , and even so , i would much rather go out during the week . the weekends are normally way too hectic and ridiculous .","300091":"i don t personally believe so . i ve never done anything special that s worth admiring .","300092":"i m usually a fast texter because i feel terrible if i leave someone on read and wind up never getting back to them , lol . i know what it feels like to be left hanging i don t want to be that person who totally forgets a conversation .","300093":"about a month ago . i was debating on distancing myself from a friend , but then he really did something that disappointed me and my boyfriend , so i decided to completely cut ties with this friend . he had been doing some pretty sh tty things for a while , and every time we brought them up to him , he wouldn t try to better himself or alter his behavior . but after what happened about a month ago , it solidified my decision .","300094":"i usually watch documentaries and docu series about serial k llers , true crime , m rderers , etc etc . it s always been really interesting to me . other than that , i ve been watching the world s worst disasters the past two days , and it s very informative . it describes some of the most terrible and disastrous natural disasters that have occurred on earth and it explains why it happened .","300095":"idk , i don t really have any new hobbies . my hobbies have been the same for as long as i can remember reading , writing , video games , photography , painting , etc etc .","300096":"i worked for the majority of the day . when i got home , i called my boyfriend , ate dinner , answered some questions on my laptop to clear my inbox , and put on some netflix . now i m laying in bed , haha .","300097":"no , not at all . i seldom go out on the weekends because not only are bars restaurants crowded , but the roads are too . i usually stay inside on the weekends .","300098":"both , depending on my mood . sometimes i like to plan things because it allows me to look forward to something , but it s also an issue for me because idk how i would feel when the time comes . at the same time , i like being spontaneous because i can easily text a friend and ask what they re doing in a few hours and go from there . at that point , i know that i want to do something , but at the same time , i also become disappointed if no one is available , lol .","300099":"i ve never watched any of the star wars movies .","300100":"no , haha . i don t really seek out new friends or have the opportunities to find new friends , which is perfectly fine by me . i only really see two people on a semi regular basis , and then i have three coworkers who i take breaks with every day .","300101":"yeah , but i usually prefer them in documentaries or docu series . right now , i m watching the world s worst disasters on netflix . it s basically about all of the tragic environmental disasters that have happened within the last years or so , i . e . volcanic eruptions , hurricanes , tsunamis , and earthquakes . it s really interesting and informative .","300102":"i don t really care so much to be up to date with new technology , but i do prefer streaming services like netflix hulu over owning dvds . blu rays go for each , but you can pay per month for a subscription service and watch whatever they offer as many times as you want . there are some movies that i want to see that aren t offered in subscription services , but i can always rent them on demand for like instead of going out and buying the dvd without knowing if i ll like the movie or not .","300103":"i only had one internship , but it was for social media marketing at a technology company . i basically took care of all of their social media accounts , updated them accordingly , and they also had me designing graphics for them too , even though i has no formal training , lol . i needed an internship for credits and to graduate , so i was only there three days a week during the summer . it wasn t terrible , but it made me realize that i wanted to be more hands on with actual writing and proofreading .","300104":"uh , don t put off the advanced oral communications class if you have to take one as much as i did i was so afraid to take that class that i ended up putting it off until my final semester , even though i needed the class to graduate , lmao . it s better to take it early and get it out of the way , especially on top of the stress of every other advanced class you have to take as a senior . also , try finding an internship ! ! communications is a great field because it s versatile so you can find anything from social media marketing to business management to writing publishing , etc etc . my advisor helped find me one , so you can probably inquire within your department . internships are wonderful for your resume .","300105":"my favorite video games are skyrim , fallout , destiny , assassin s creed , and the bioshock series . i have a bachelor s degree in communications professional writing with a minor in english literature . i ve been in a relationship for nearly years . i currently work as a writer and editor for a publishing company . i m a strong mental health advocate and i try to take advantage of my ability to write well to raise awareness of mental health issues erase stigma .","300106":"yeah , i sing along to most songs that i listen to on the drive home from work . it destresses me after the day .","300107":"i ve never been to a party where i had to decorate before , lol .","300108":"yeah , i believe it s very helpful . presentations , especially oral presentations , help prepare students for moments in their professional lives where they ll have to speak in front of a group of people , especially if they become part of a management team .","300109":"i want to go to bed , but it s only pm , lmao .","300110":"we have the same taste in music for the most part , but he listens to more hip hop than i do . i ve never really disliked a song he has shown me , though ! !","300111":"anyone have any questions ? ? my inbox is empty","300112":"my day has been going well so far , actually ! ! i had a pretty decent and productive day at work , where my supervisor trained me on some new programs and materials since i m officially the administrator of the newsletter program now . after work , i treated myself with taco bell i ve basically been listening to music and answering questions ever since .","300113":"poetalunam .","300114":"yes , i have instagram . my account is private , though i only accept requests from people i know .","300115":"geoff ramsey , barbara dunkelman , and jeremy dooley .","300116":"i think body positivity is for everyone , because everyone has their own struggles regarding their bodies and their own self image in general , regardless of how conventionally attractive they are . however , i do believe there s a distinct difference between promoting body positivity and the whole fat acceptance movement . obviously it s good to be positive about your body , but if you re obese , then that s a health concern that needs to be addressed , whether it s through eating healthier food , exercising , taking supplements , etc etc . some people are disillusioned when it comes to obesity because of the body positivity movement , but good health is something we all should strive towards .","300117":"i prefer savoury foods , as i don t like sweet foods all that much . i would rather have a hot meal as opposed to something like candy , or a bag of salty chips instead of a box of chocolate .","300118":"chewing with their mouth open is probably one of the most irritating things other people can do around me .","300119":"i m not entirely sure tbh , lol . if my life depended on it , then perhaps i would have literally no choice , but i can t imagine trying certain insects now without having a massive panic attack about it or puking it up immediately .","300120":"good hygiene is very important to me , but at the same time , it isn t really my business because it would only matter to me in a relationship context i m already dating someone . i have a friend who smells like bo sometimes , but it doesn t really bother me anymore because she s always been that way , lol . however , there was a coworker who used to work at my job whose clothes smelled like they were never washed , so the people who sat next to her actually put a complaint in to hr .","300121":"i don t have a concrete personality , so my sense of humor and verbiage and interests generally change depending on who i m with . i think the person i m most like myself around is my boyfriend , but i also adopt his habits as well , so who knows for sure .","300122":"i don t have a true self , so there s really no deception involved . if i had a true sense of self , then i would simply act the way i naturally am . but because i never developed a real identity , my personality constantly changes depending on who i m around .","300123":"i can dance , but that doesn t exactly mean i can dance well . lmao .","300124":"no , not at all . i find the silent treatment to be extremely childish . when i have to recoup and walk away from a fight , then i ll usually indicate to the other person that i need some time to myself before we can continue the discussion so that i can collect my thoughts .","300125":"i don t really love food in that respect , but i was craving taco bell tonight , so i impulsively stopped at the local taco bell and bought a veggie power burrito . i only usually have fast food once per month or so , though , so it isn t really something that i can t get enough of .","300126":"it depends on how you actually felt when you were drinking , lol . you can throw up after one drink , it doesn t necessarily mean you were drunk . it just means the alcohol didn t mix well in your body . i ve vomited after having two drinks before even though i wasn t drunk at all , it just didn t sit well in my stomach at the time .","300127":"i know people with high iqs , but i don t know if that would classify them as a genius or not .","300128":"i would rather my shirts be two sizes too big . i wear looser clothing as it is , so it wouldn t be too far of a stretch for me . i also dislike the way my body looks in tight clothing , so wearing a shirt too small would make me feel very self conscious .","300129":"my text messages have my friends and boyfriend s first last names , as well as pictures , so i won t post personal information like that on askfm .","300130":"yes , i usually need some sort of cool off period before i can resume the conversation , otherwise i may act out of impulse and say things in the heat of the moment that i don t necessarily mean . or i end up bursting into tears and remain a blubbering mess , where i can t even hold a conversation at all .","300131":"i was tipsy last saturday , but i wouldn t really classify it as being drunk . other than that , the last time i was actually drunk was two weeks ago when i went to the bar with a friend .","300132":"i m decent at saving money i buy groceries and bring lunch from home to work instead of buying lunch every day , and the only thing i really splurge on is coffee every morning i usually go to starbucks or dunkin . i also transfer money into my savings account every month or so , so that i can build it up instead of letting it remain stagnant .","300133":"any of the times my boyfriend and i went upstate on vacation together were the happiest memories . it felt nice to have the entire day to ourselves , where we could eat whenever we wanted , talk a walk through the woods , lay down in the grass at the lake , etc etc . here s a photo of the wooded area upstate where we frequent","300134":"tbh i wish it was easier for me to get out of bed in the morning , lol . it usually takes me minutes to finally crawl out of bed , which is absolutely terrible . no matter how much i sleep throughout the night , i can never wake up by am .","300135":"my boss said she was going to fill out the employee review sheet this week to get me promoted and earn a raise ! !","300136":"with any sort of relationship , platonic or romantic , there should be loyalty and respect between everyone involved . that includes lines that people shouldn t cross , which varies from person to person . a person is free to do what they want within a certain boundary , i . e . if a couple is monogamous then it s crossing a line if someone is sleeping with somebody else . however , it s permissable to a point if one partner is preventing their significant other from doing things like dressing how they want or going out with their friends , then that s controlling and manipulative behavior .","300137":"how would that make me a hypocrite ? ?","300138":"i drink sometimes because it relaxes my nerves , but i also drink more to get tipsy not drunk .","300139":"it s a locally brewed ipa . my boyfriend s father brought it back for me when he went out east this weekend , haha . it s a . beer so it s pretty heavy though .","300140":"ask me questions , friends ! ! i have a full can of beer an empty inbox","300141":"any time my boyfriend i go on vacation together is the best day of my life , lol . specific moments , however , were when we went upstate together and spent the day relaxing , wandering the woods , and spending time at the lake . and also when we went to montauk together and relaxed in the hotel room which had a balcony ! and spent the day finding cute shops and restaurants , and we hit the local brewery during the day as well .","300142":"i really have no idea how to answer this question because my personality changes depending on who i m with , lmao .","300143":"i would personally say i m down for anything , but it varies depending on the person and perhaps even their regional dialect .","300144":"i really enjoy baroque , renaissance , and neoclassical art . i find that the styles and movement are so beautiful and captivating , and the more you look at them , the more you discover .","300145":"i ve never really been the type of person to give into dares , because i ve never felt pressured to do something by someone just daring me to do it . if i wanted to do something then i would , and if i was uncomfortable with doing something , then i wouldn t do it .","300146":"i have over , coins , so perhaps i might be able to put down a down payment on a house , haha .","300147":"yes . this happens to me a lot with random memes on facebook or twitter that are like , you were alive in the s if you remember this show , and it s a screenshot of a really old children s show . it brings back vague memories because it feels so familiar , and it s so bizarre .","300148":"i enjoy making my loved ones i . e . my friends , boyfriend , and a few coworkers happy . most of the time , i couldn t care less about what a random stranger thinks . in addition , men in bars are looking for a fling i m not going to entertain any notion by inviting them for conversation . i shut it down before it even begins .","300149":"i m extremely empathetic toward the people i care about and i ll do anything in my power to help a loved one . i genuinely enjoy making other people happy .","300150":"i have no desire to do that . i d rather just go to the store and pick up a six pack .","300151":"i m not entirely sure would it be too self centered to assume that it may be because i enjoy talking about myself my feelings ? ? haha .","300152":"yeah , i drink beer any time i go out to the bar . i m also planning on trying a new beer tonight that my boyfriend s father brought home for me from one of the brewing companies out east it s called twin forks .","300153":"fine , i suppose . i seldom get sick as it is however , when i do get sick , i m usually bound to my bed for at least a day . that usually only happens once or twice per year at the most , though .","300154":"i don t really have anything planned that i m looking forward to these days . i m going on an eight day vacation next winter , but that s over a year away .","300155":"aw , matching pajama sets are cute ! ! i feel like my boyfriend would wear them if i bought them for us , lol . the only things i dislike are those possessive shirts that say something like belongs to boyfriend girlfriend s name ! i think that s honestly kinda creepy .","300156":"if i has no option but to choose very spicy or not spicy at all , i would choose non spicy . i like a moderate amount of heat , but nothing too wild .","300157":"would it be too cliche if i said my boyfriend ? ? lmao . he used to have long hair i was completely captivated by it . he cut his hair short quite a few years ago , but he grew it out to around shoulder length when we were years old and it looked fantastic on him .","300158":"uh , either drinking while driving or possession of marijuana . i don t drink and drive , but i do drink a lot so it would probably be one of the first things people would assume .","300159":"lately it s been sleeping , lmao . but i also enjoy reading , writing , playing video games , seeing my boyfriend friends , and watching television .","300160":"not very often only when it s applicable .","300161":"my favorite subject when i was in high school was either english literature or forensics . my favorite class in college was mythology and its contemporary applications and russian literature .","300162":"you ll have to specify who you re talking about .","300163":"i don t remember my childhood , so i really have no idea .","300164":"emotional stability a raise at work would be nice . lmao .","300165":"i don t have any photos of me smoking .","300166":"nearly every question posed about feet or socks is a fetish . i m not taking any chances , plus it isn t something i would ever take a photo of anyway .","300167":"i m not even known , so i suppose my answer would be nothing .","300168":"lmao , yeah . like if you were seriously shaming women for having multiple partners , then we would have called you out on it . anon seems to forget that the people they send these things to actually know you and understand you , and we re comfortable telling you that you re wrong if you were wrong about something .","300169":"my boyfriend makes me grateful because of how supportive and loving he is . idk what i would do without him in my life . i m also grateful for my job because not many people have had the employment opportunities i have had , and it allows me to pay my bills on time every month .","300170":"i can take charge of projects and act in a leadership role , but it doesn t encompass my entire being . i know how to be a respectful leader and manager without becoming obsessed with power .","300171":"yeah , i have a vape with nicotine juice that i use to smoke when i m on breaks at work . except i accidentally left it in my jeans pocket when i did laundry a few hours ago it only went through the wash , so i m pretty sure i broke it .","300172":"that s not true at all , rofl . someone s class ranking has nothing to do with the vices they enjoy . if anything , it might mean that they also enjoy coca ne since that s a popular drug among people with wealth .","300173":"definitely not , lmao . i ve never experience baby fever before . i m not even sure if i ever want children in the future .","300174":"probably , because i enjoy smoking since it helps with my anxiety as well .","300175":"no , not really . i have work tomorrow all of the kids will be back in school , so the commute there and back is going to be horrible .","300176":"no , considering i m a smoker , lol .","300177":"from my understanding , that isn t what morgan believes and she was making a totally different point than what you re discussing . either way , it s cute that you re still seeking validation for your feelings from a debate that was over yesterday . get over it and find something to do .","300178":"i don t think that s necessarily true if they re the one asking someone out , then perhaps they would feel more obligated to pay for the whole dinner , but it doesn t make someone more or less of a man if they don t end up paying for the entire bill .","300179":"nah , i m not a person who entertains strangers fetishes .","300180":"i used to enjoy sunbathing , but now i really can t stand the heat at all . i usually tan really well .","300181":"we haven t gone on an actual date in a few months , rofl . we simply don t have the time usually only see each other at night , either after pm or pm . but when we order food , we swap back and forth . if i pay one day , he ll pay the following time , etc etc .","300182":"i think expectations like that are generally rude regardless of your opinions on social justice issues . like , if you go out to dinner with someone with the expectation that you ll get a free meal , then that s entitled behavior and gross .","300183":"i don t really believe in signs like that . life is generally unfair happens randomly , people aren t given a portion of good events and bad events based on the goodness of the universe or something .","300184":". . . well on that note , i m going to take a shower .","300185":"no , it s and men aren t obligated to pay for all of the dates . if anything , splitting the bill is probably the most ideal thing to do however , it depends entirely on the person . some people are traditional and want men to pay , while other people don t see the value in that anymore .","300186":"my humor changes depending on who s around me , haha . with certain people i m witty and lighthearted , while with others , i have a dark sense of humor .","300187":"grey cloudy with a slight chill .","300188":"i can t remember the last time it was sunny where i live , lol . it s been dreary and raining and snowing for the past week . during the spring summer , i enjoy going to the park and taking photos .","300189":"lol . sometimes i read certain things on askfm and it literally gives me a headache .","300190":"congratulations , this is the most bizarre thing i ve ever been sent on askfm .","300191":"i haven t found a new series to watch since i finished big mouth . i m thinking about checking out the umbrella academy , though .","300192":"nah , my coworkers and i don t really have much time to talk since we only talk on our breaks , so usually we re talking about things we re working on and our personal lives . sometimes my boyfriend and i run out of things to talk about , but it isn t awkward or anything because we re at the point where we can comfortably sit in silence with each other .","300193":"yeah . if i m not comfortable doing something , or if i m not up to doing something , then i have no problem telling them how i feel and saying no to them . obviously i say no in a nice manner , but still clear enough to get the point across .","300194":"walk up to her with a straight face and say , spoiler alert i m the one shitting in your garden .","300195":"the package wasn t ripped or torn or anything , unless it happened in the packaging facility . i ve never had an issue with amazon before , so i was pretty confused . but yeah , amazon was extremely helpful . i ve been a customer of theirs for basically years and i own an amazon credit card , so they sent me a new charger without me having to pay for another one .","300196":"i don t really believe it s narrow minded , no . everyone has their own personal preferences when it comes to dating , and sometimes people don t want to deal with certain things when it comes to a person s former life with previous people . it s sorta the same concept of individuals not wanting to date people who have children period . sometimes it can be too much for a person to handle , and they re not ready to accept that for what it is .","300197":"anyone have any interesting or thought provoking questions ? ? my inbox is empty disclaimer anything trollish , invasive , or inappropriate will be deleted .","300198":"nothing has really surprised me recently tbh . however i did surprise my coworker last night ! ! she originally invited me out to this one bar in town , but i told her that i was tired and didn t feel like going out . however , later on in the night , her husband texted me and said she was drunk talking about me , so i decided to randomly go out and surprise her . i walked up to her inside of the bar , and she stared at me and was like , oh my god you re actually here , lmaoo . it made her night , and it made me pretty happy . apparently she also texted a few of our other coworkers , but no one responded to her . so i m glad i was the one who came out .","300199":"i have zero clue , lmao . it wasn t even a box , it was one of those bubble wrapped packages because the charger was . . . well , would have been . . . small and thin , so they wouldn t waste a box on that . i literally walked through the front door after coming home from work my father told me i got a package in the mail , but it felt empty . so i picked it up and it was completely flat . i opened it and there was absolutely nothing inside . i was so confused , lmao .","300200":"coupons . when i worked in retail , there were so many people usually middle aged white women , lol who would literally get so upset and angry because i wouldn t take their expired coupons . or that they accidentally didn t pick up the sale item because it was a different size , so they wanted it for the sale price . it was unbelievable .","300201":"the last time i had an issue with a delivery was perhaps a few weeks ago . . . i don t remember when it was exactly . i had ordered a fast charging phone charger to use at my boyfriend s house , and when i got the initial package , there was literally nothing inside of it . lmao . so i emailed amazon and told them what happened , and they sent me another charger .","300202":"my saturday was fine i spend the morning hours working on some freelance writing , and then i was so mentally drained that i wound up taking two naps , haha . at night , one of my coworkers went out to a bar that s down the road from my house and apparently she was drunk and asking for me it was her birthday , so her husband texted me and asked if i was available to hang for a bit . so i went down there and saw her for like an hour . my sunday just began , actually . it s only am . i did wake up around am , but i felt horrible from staying out late last night so i ended up falling back asleep for a few hours . now i m finishing up my freelance work .","300203":"that usually doesn t happen to me , lol . usually my life is pretty neutral and uneventful and bad things happen every once in a while .","300204":"yes , i was bullied a lot when i was in middle school .","300205":"i ve gotten into confrontations with customers while i was working in retail , yeah . most of the time , it was because they were being persistent about something that wasn t plausible , i . e . their coupon was expired or it wasn t for the product they bought . i would politely explain to them why i can t take it , but sometimes they would get so irrationally angry and demand to speak to my manager . also , it happened a lot with people trying to scam the system or steal things . i confronted a person trying to steal a whole cart of items , so when they left the cart in the aisle and walked out the door , i quickly grabbed it and placed it behind the registers . when the next group of people came in looking for the cart , they were confounded because it was gone . lmao .","300206":"hey boyfriend , can we go to the diner ? lmao . i m craving diner food so much . they usually have the best omelettes and i m a sucker for diner coffee .","300207":"not much time at all tbh . i can t stand looking at myself in the mirror , so i usually only use it to check my outfit before i go to work and to also make sure my hair is fine .","300208":"i don t think there s any social pressure regarding how often people spend on their phones , considering most of us are on our phones often throughout the day anyway . personally , though , i like checking social media first thing in the morning , although i don t usually post anything . i also check it one final time before i lay down , but then i put my phone on airplane mode to charge while i m sleeping .","300209":"i couldn t imagine being a teacher tbh . i experience some social anxiety , so the prospect of standing up in front of a class and teaching for hours and days and years is so daunting to me . regardless , i would teach english , since that s my field of interest . perhaps english literature or grammar rhetoric .","300210":"highest graduating from college witnessing the first time i got accepted to an entry level job post graduation lowest all of the moments

me anxiety .","300220":"cadence i are already friendly with each other , so it would be useless to try to appease her by posting a random opinion online .","300221":"no , i don t take anything on askfm very seriously . if someone has something bad to say about me , percent of the time it s anonymous , and it s useless to really worry about the opinion of a complete stranger who won t even confront the issues privately .","300222":"exactly ! ! heaven knows i definitely need it after this week , lol . i was supposed to go out with one of my coworkers for her birthday , but i don t believe we re doing anything anymore because someone in her family passed away . i didn t want to push the subject further because i m sure she doesn t feel like doing anything , especially considering the wake and funeral services were on thursday and friday . she must be exhausted .","300223":"i m doing well ! ! i started off my morning early around am , and i started working on some freelance assignments about an hour later after i relaxed with a cup of coffee . after writing three assignments , i took an embarrassingly long nap , and now i m back to writing again . i don t have any plans tonight , so i don t feel pressured to really finish anything soon . i m taking my time with my assignments so that i don t make any silly mistakes , which should make the editors jobs easier when they proofread my material .","300224":"anyone have any questions while i continue working on freelance writing ? ? i took a thicc nap before now i m motivated to finish all of my assignments .","300225":"looboobgh . lmao .","300226":"we ll see ! !","300227":"going on vacation next year ! ! after i renew my gym membership and buy new sneakers , i want to start going to the gym again so that i can lose weight and be more confident in myself for the vacation . however , i also need to get a passport so i m not looking forward to that . meh .","300228":"if they re not taking proper care of their children , then yeah , that s hella irresponsible . however , i don t personally think it matters at that point how many fathers there are in that equation because the well being of the children is what matters most .","300229":"it s interesting how there s such a double standard regarding women and men if women are trash for having kids by multiple men , then by that logic , shouldn t you also think that those men are trash too ? ? society doesn t view it that way . there s such a stigma against women who have children with different fathers , but then no one bats an eye when a man has children with multiple women .","300230":"pros you get to listen to a lot of music you can stop at any scenic views along the way cons i m impatient , lmao gas station bathrooms are

room for danger .","300234":"probably certain drugs throughout my lifetime it was a stupid decision on my part because it made me act completely ridiculous , and the come down from the drug was not worth the feeling it gave me while i was high .","300235":"i think it s irresponsible to have unprotected s x to begin with , regardless of how many people she s having s x with . if a woman is single , she s free to have s x with as many people she wants , as long as she s taking the proper measures to have safe s x whether it s birth control , condoms , the iud , the patch , whatever . as for the children portion of the question , i believe it isn t irresponsible as long as she s taking proper care of her children and giving them the lives they deserve . at that point , it doesn t matter who the fathers are , what matters truly is whether or not she s being a proper mother and taking care of her children accordingly .","300236":"good morning , friends ! ! i m about to start working on some freelance writing , so y all should ask me interesting questions to motivate me throughout the day . disclaimer anything inappropriate , trollish , or invasive will be promptly deleted

upcoming year or so . i recently got promoted at work , so that means i ll be getting a raise soon , and i ve been enjoying spending time with my boyfriend and his family .","300238":"the best thing that happened to me in the past week was perhaps either getting mexican food margaritas with my friend on thursday , or the brunch my company catered on friday ! ! my company usually caters simply things like pizza or assorted sandwiches , but this week , they decided to try something new ordered platters of eggs , turkey bacon , sausages , and pancakes , which was absolutely amazing . i wouldn t say it was unusually good , but those moments punctuated the rest of the week , which was exceedingly ordinary . i had a few anxiety attacks this week , but that s not really uncommon , especially since my body is getting used to taking my anxiety medication every day again .","300239":"that s absolutely appalling , and i can t believe that such people exist who would literally drive others to s icide like that . i believe he should face consequences for his actions , but i honestly don t know upon what legal basis it exists . i m not well versed in criminal law at all , so i m not really sure if what he did was technically illegal , even though someone d ed due to his relentless bullying . however , i wholeheartedly believe that behavior like that should not go unpunished . it s wrong to bully someone to the point where that person believes they should d e . and to further taunt her grieving family besides ? ? despicable .","300240":"cont like , i don t think every chuck e . cheese across the us is so trusting of their employees . no one at chuck e . cheese is paid enough to keep that secret ! ? lol . i wholeheartedly agree , and my boyfriend raised the same point too about the

matter .","300242":"i have one sibling .","300243":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","300244":"perhaps video games even though i haven t been in the mood to play lately , it s something

of affection , so i allow them to do it .","300247":"it depends on how severe the addiction is , what you re addicted to , etc etc . people handle addiction in a variety of ways sometimes rehab is the best option , while other people quit by themselves and attend aa or na meetings . it s important to have a strong support system , whether that s family or friends or a significant other . it makes it that much easier to stick to sobriety when you have a person willing to support and encourage you when you need it .","300248":"well , considering this is askfm where the entire point of the site is to ask questions , yes .","300249":"laying down , i m thinking about going to sleep soon .","300250":"hello do you have a question ? ?","300251":"i just looked it up i can kinda see the resemblance

this point .","300255":"my inbox is empty , so y all should ask me some questions","300256":"i talk to people every day , lol . just because i don t have internet doesn t mean i can t text or call anyone for six months .","300257":"i ve never had prison food before , so i really don t know how good or bad it is , lol . i guess i would choose no internet for six months , though . it might be a nice break from social media .","300258":"no , i don t believe that s a good idea . scare tactics such as those often aren t effective , and subjecting teenagers to that sort of experience may make their impulses worse instead of better .","300259":"i think it s a bit dangerous , but as long as they re somewhat supervised , i don t really see the big deal . i started using the internet when i was around that age too .","300260":"it depends entirely on the situation , i believe . sometimes it s worthwhile to love a person although there s distance between you , while other times the cons outweigh the pros you re better off finding a partner who is closer to you . everyone has a different way of loving someone else , and often distance is a determining factor .","300261":"i agree for the most part . people are multifaceted and are deeper than their external appearance , and you can only truly know a person when you get to hear their thoughts and feelings , which takes time and effort .","300262":"you re correct in that it s not percent effective . i don t have an answer as to why i ve never fallen pregnant before . perhaps i m infertile .","300263":"i ve never heard of that before .","300264":"contraception","300265":"i seldom smile in selfies to begin with .","300266":"when i got home from work , i got a letter in the mail from my psychiatrist s office indicating that i , somehow , owe them after i paid my initial co pay for my last visit . i was rehearsing in my mind what i would say to the receptionist when i call them tomorrow , lol . i m obviously angry and confused , but i also don t want to convey those emotions in the phonecall . however , at the same time , i also need to be stern so that perhaps i can get out of paying the additional , considering i have no clue why i even owe that money in the first place .","300267":"boyfriend resourceful , ambitious , creative . best friend compassionate , patient , understanding .","300268":"i m not physically affectionate , no . i don t like when people get too close to me , and i try to avoid physical affection at all costs , unless it s obviously from my boyfriend . he s really the only person i crave physical affection from .","300269":"no . if i m sad or depressed , i prefer absolute silence .","300270":"i seldom use profanity when i m using social media however , in real life , i m constantly using profanity , lol . it has become second nature to me at this point , and i m not entirely sure why that doesn t transfer over to my typing and writing .","300271":"the only people i hug are my boyfriend and best friend . i don t like being touched by anyone else .","300272":"no , i m basically just winging it . it s funny how when you re young , you think adults have their lives all sorted out . however , when you get older , you realize that most people really have no idea what they re doing and they re just winging it .","300273":"i think it depends on the scenario and the individual person . both circumstances can happen to a person , whether an individual is directly causing us unhappiness or our own emotions and feelings cause us unhappiness due to the unconscious actions from others .","300274":"no . when i m stressed , i have a tendency to not eat .","300275":"no , i only follow people whose answers and personalities i enjoy . it would be pointless to follow someone i thought was annoying , because that would just be an annoyance showing up on my dashboard every day , lol .","300276":"no , my physical pain isn t for no particular reason i mostly experience back pain , which is due solely to the fact that i work in an office i m sitting down for eight hours per day . as for mental pain , there has always been a reason behind that . if i m hurting emotionally , it s usually because someone hurt my feelings and i never got closure from it . the only mental thing that happens spontaneously is my anxiety . there s usually no rhyme or reason to my anxiety attacks .","300277":"would it be too stereotypical of me to say susanna from girl interrupted ? ? lol . even when i read the book ages ago , prior to my diagnosis , i related significantly to what she thought and felt , as well as her behaviors .","300278":"i m a strong debater on online platforms , but not so much in person . i stumble over my words and it s difficult for me to express myself verbally . however , in writing , i can put up strong arguments and counterpoints , and i also like to do research prior to stating an opinion on something . i do separate my emotions from my debates , though . debates , ideally , should be logically based , as well as based on scientific evidence and factual support . there s no room for emotions in those contexts .","300279":"i honestly believe it should be around years old , because at that age , you fully know what you re doing and the ramifications of your actions . however , i also believe it does go on a case by case basis and it depends entirely on the situation itself and how severe the ab se is .","300280":"they both sound the same to me , tbh . i don t really have a preference when it comes to finding one that s more personal and intimate because they both convey the same message .","300281":"yeah , a few months ago i reached out to an old friend someone i used to talk to online for many years , but we stopped contact because we eventually just drifted apart when i went to college . now we talk every few weeks or so , just to catch up and tell each other what s going on in our lives . she also likes reading my essays and poetry , so i ll send them to her whenever i ve written something new to get her input .","300282":"i don t have one at all .","300283":"every time i take the personality types test , i always get infj introversion , intuition , feeling , judgment .","300284":"sometimes , i do . i haven t been s icidal in a few months , but when i do feel that way , i simply don t care about myself and start doing reckless things in the hopes that i ll get injured or d e .","300285":"my clothing style isn t really inspired by anything i just buy what looks interesting and comfortable to me , and i don t really have a style anymore , haha . some days , i ll look like a stereotypical hipster with skinny jeans , knee high boots , and an oversized sweater with a beanie , while other days , i ll wear a flannel with converse . most of the time , however , i simply wear hoodies with skinny jeans and sneakers .","300286":"i remember when i was a pre teen , i would constantly play tony hawk s pro skater on the xbox ! ! even when i was much younger , i remember liking the legend of zelda , pokemon , super smash brothers , and crash bandicoot .","300287":"so are the cigarettes i smoke , but you don t see me quitting smoking anytime soon .","300288":"it s a good quality to be persistent in a general sense , but it s not a good quality if you re trying to pursue a person and you simply won t take no for an answer . that s not persistence at that point , that s just being entitled and privileged . if someone says no when you ask them out , then leave them alone . they clearly don t want to go out with you , and if you re consistently vying for their attention , it gets irritating and overwhelming . some people simply cannot handle rejection .","300289":"if the sun refused to shine , i would still be loving you . when mountains crumble to the sea , there will still be you and me . thank you by led zeppelin .","300290":"no , it isn t something i ve ever thought about before . i couldn t care less .","300291":"i can t recall any conversation in particular , but my boyfriend and i regularly have intelligent conversations about current events and other theories relative to life , death , ambition , our purpose in life , religion , etc etc . he doesn t believe he s very smart , but he s honestly one of the most intelligent people i know . he has a plethora of knowledge crammed into his head , it s unbelievable how much random information he knows and in such great detail .","300292":"last week sometime , my boyfriend and i debated over the chuck e . cheese pizza conspiracy theory , lol . i had just watched the shane dawson video where he poses the theory so i was discussing it with him , and i lean more toward the side where it s somewhat believable whereas my boyfriend does not believe it in whatsoever . that conversation eventually led to a conversation about how technology is always listening to us , especially now with smartphones and other smart household items , like alexa .","300293":"i would probably want to go to iceland , because it seems absolutely beautiful there and it would be a tremendous and different experience . iceland is a place i ve always wanted to visit one of my old high school friends got engaged in iceland , and her pictures were absolutely beautiful .","300294":"i feel the same way about some people i interact with too , haha . i have some of the nicest coworkers , and a lot of the sales representatives are really polite , but their voices are so grating . some of them are extremely high pitched , and the actual way they speak is irritating at times .","300295":"no , we re going on a caribbean cruise .","300296":"i watched that video the other day was absolutely floored , lol . i brought it up to my boyfriend and he was all like , that s so ridiculous i can t believe people think that , what the hell . he rationalized the hell out of the situation , which was so amusing . anyway , the more unbelievable conspiracy theory i personally know is the whole famous people are lizard people thing . i don t know much about it , but i think the entire notion is ridiculous .","300297":"i honestly don t have anything to look forward to this year at all . i m going on a big vacation with my boyfriend s family in , but that s in more than a year from now .","300298":"no , you re not responsible for that person , and they shouldn t make you feel obligated to take care of them simply because they re depressed over the breakup . that s hella manipulative .","300299":"writing grammar , as well as mental health and certain disorders in general . i studied psychology briefly in college , but most of what i know is due to independent research and my own personal experiences .","300300":"no , i usually have my phone on airplane mode so that nothing wakes me up besides my alarm .","300301":"yes , i need my phone on because i use the alarm clock on my phone to wake me up in the morning .","300302":"i can t really think of any food that i haven t tried also want to try . i always try different food at least once , so the reason why i haven t tried a certain kind of food is because i haven t been given the opportunity to try something new .","300303":"i don t need to have access to the internet within my brain because i have access already thanks to cell phones and computers .","300304":"my boyfriend . for his birthday , i bought him a big oz candle , a new wallet , and some really cozy pajama pants .","300305":"my day was pretty good , actually . i was extremely productive at work , i implemented some of the new things i was taught earlier in the week to various spreadsheets and programs , and my office catered brunch today , which was hella awesome . i don t have any plans for the evening , so i might just relax with some coffee and work on some freelance writing .","300306":"yes , i m fairly ambitious especially when it comes to my job . i m always trying to seek out new information and further myself in the workplace .","300307":"major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are highly co morbid , so yeah , that s pretty common . if you re experiencing episodes of anxiety alongside your depressive episodes , i would definitely bring it up to your doctor so they can treat the anxiety accordingly .","300308":"sometimes i enjoy life , especially when i have a particularly good day at work or if i m with my boyfriend . i always try to value the smaller moments that are happening in the present moment .","300309":"no , i haven t filled out a job application since september .","300310":"apologize by grandson https youtu . be wjili kavuy","300311":"i don t really know enough about the topic to have an educated opinion .","300312":"the necklace i m wearing now is rose gold . the pendant is in the shape of a tree , and the circle surrounding it is made from opal .","300313":"i disagree with that statement . having wealth these days is moreso a matter of luck and personal connections than anything else . also , to use a blanket statement such as all people who are poor are lazy is inaccurate since that s obviously not the case .","300314":"i ve been wearing glasses since i was a child , actually i want to say maybe since i was years old ? ? i also have astigmatism .","300315":"the only jewelry i wear is a necklace , only the ones my boyfriend has bought for me .","300316":"it was part of the filter from snapchat , lol .","300317":"here are two , since i couldn t decide on one . rofl .","300318":"it s useless because it won t change their appearance , lol . instead of making fun of something that s meaningless , criticize their behavior instead . that s what makes someone a bad person , afterall .","300319":"if they re a bad person , you should be criticizing their behavior or thought patterns . to make fun of their physical appearance is pretty useless and juvenile .","300320":"it s been a long time coming and i m happy he s finally being held responsible for his horrid actions . that must at least give his victims some closure .","300321":"considering my weekend hasn t started yet . . . lol . i just got home from work , so i guess technically my weekend starts now .","300322":"uh , no ? ? that statement literally came out of nowhere , rofl .","300323":"yeah , tbh that s bad even though you acknowledge that their behavior is toxic to you , you re still allowing them to make a significant impact on your life . you already know that the best thing to do is to let them go , but i do understand the familiarity of keeping them in your life . however , you have to recognize that their presence in your life is not good and you would be a better and more productive person without them .","300324":"no , i don t really pay much attention to who likes my answers tbh .","300325":"yeah , a lot of personality disorders are comorbid with one another because the diagnostic criteria can overlap .","300326":"obviously . mocking in any shape or form is rude in itself . nobody can help what their accent is , so to make fun of someone for how they sound is pretty rude .","300327":"one of my coworkers is pretty androgynous looking , but she s a cis woman . however , she came up to me all upset today because she walked into the women s bathroom and apparently two women in there gasped and said to her , this is the women s bathroom ! idk it irked me the wrong way . i couldn t believe that those woman actually said that to her , like if you don t have something nice to say then don t say anything at all . it s almost harassment at that point because it s happened to her multiple times , and it s just really sad .","300328":"it depends on what they needed help with . there are some people i m willing to help , but others not so much because of what they need help with and the vibe they give off .","300329":"honesty , loyalty , a dark sense of humor that resembles mine , creativity , likes music as much as me , and a hard work ethic . thankfully my boyfriend has all of these qualities .","300330":"uh , i m hella drunk so y all should ask me questions","300331":"heathers , tbh . it s probably one of my favorite movies and no matter how much i watch it , i can never get tired of it .","300332":"i d rather have one get out of jail free card tbh . i ve done a lot of stupid sh t during my life , and it would be good to keep handy if anything catches up to me , lmao .","300333":"i love cosmetics . it s a good art form and if it makes people happy , then let them practice their art .","300334":"i seldom wear matching socks tbh .","300335":"no ? ? beauty is subjective . what one person believes to be ugly may be beautiful to someone else .","300336":"warning prone to emotional outbursts , but won t hesitate to stab you .","300337":"maybe ? ? i try to be honest whenever possible i m never really in situations where i feel like i have to lie .","300338":"idk when the last time someone ghosted me was , lmao . if they did , then i clearly wasn t friends enough with them to really notice or i ghosted them first . i haven t ghosted them yet , but i m planning on stopping contact with one of my friends . they ve been told time time again that they re not doing the right thing , but at this point , it seems like they don t really care anymore . i m not going to put effort into a friendship if it s one sided .","300339":"most governments are corrupt . politicians only care about power and money , not the people they re supposed to represent .","300340":"i m supposed to grab dinner with my friend tonight , but she hasn t texted me back so i hope she didn t fall asleep . i was really looking forward to getting tacos and margaritas . lmao .","300341":"the last time i went clothes shopping was probably back in october or november . the last time i went grocery shopping was last sunday .","300342":"the last clothing item i bought was a shirt from blackcraftcult i mainly bought it because they had a thicc sale going on the design on it was beautiful .","300343":"pajama pants an oversized hoodie ! ! usually accompanied by fuzzy socks and a cup of coffee .","300344":"my phone , my laptop , and my medication .","300345":"i ve been awestruck by someone s beauty , but i don t believe that it s ever intimidated me .","300346":"i usually just ghost them , but this is coming from the understanding that the communication was faulty to begin with . the people i ve erased from my life did nothing for me anymore and every conversation we did have was toxic , or just their presence in my life was toxic enough .","300347":"hurricane sandy was pretty wild . thankfully my house didn t get damaged , but homes further south than me near the coast were destroyed . one of my old professors from college was forced to cancel the remainder of the semester because her house was destroyed and she couldn t teach lessons anymore .","300348":"no , it s always been easy for me to cut people out of my life . at that point , they mean nothing to me .","300349":"yeah , candles are super relaxing to me . lately i ve been burning a eucalyptus mint candle .","300350":"i believe that most people have the capacity to change . however , not everyone does , and some people are in far too deep in their own toxic ways that they ll never realize their own behavior , even if it s pointed out to them time and time again . sometimes it is too late , and that s the way life goes . not everyone is willing to wait for someone to change , and tbh , most people don t deserve to be forced to wait on someone like that .","300351":"i honestly don t know , i haven t tried doing push ups in years , lol .","300352":"i use doordash , and sometimes grubhub . i ve never used ubereats before , though .","300353":"no , those seem rather uncomfortable .","300354":"sushi , at least it has been lately . i also really enjoy fried eggs on a croissant .","300355":"i don t post photos of my friends or family on askfm . however , here s a photo of one of my best friend s dogs ! !","300356":"five minutes at the most , lol . i just check myself in the mirror before i leave for work in the morning to make sure my outfit is on correctly and my hair is in place .","300357":"i prefer to answer questions . i seldom ask questions , i only do so when my feed is dead i m extremely bored .","300358":"i was playing fallout for a few weeks , but lately i honestly haven t been in the mood to play video games . my other go tos are fallout , skyrim , and destiny .","300359":"i m not a big fan of chocolate or hazelnut , but i prefer hersheys .","300360":"i honestly don t know much about either , lmao .","300361":"i used to know how to play the guitar when i was a teenager , but i haven t picked a guitar up in like years .","300362":"no , i don t wear anything that s revealing .","300363":"yeah but not the stereotypical green aliens with giant eyes and long fingers scenario . i believe that other life exists within this universe , especially considering how vast it is and how much we haven t explored . it would be ignorant to assume that earth is the only planet capable of sustaining life .","300364":"drink water hold my breath . it doesn t always work but they usually go away on their own .","300365":"absolutely , as long as they re the right person . i ve been dating the same person for nearly years and i can never get tired of him .","300366":"french fries ice cream ! !","300367":"sushi . i also really love fried eggs on a croissant .","300368":"apparently on someone s last day in another department of my company , they wore a full on cat costume , lmao . i didn t get to see it myself , but it sounded pretty amusing .","300369":"the bible is literally a fictional story , lol . it isn t factual by any means .","300370":"no , my name is leigh .","300371":"i believe in science more than i believe in most things . science is irrefutable .","300372":"i ve never felt at home in my own body and i ve always been uncomfortable being referred to as a girl or a woman . at the same time , i also don t identify as a man . for as long as i could remember , i ve always desired to be androgynous to where people can t tell which gender i am . after researching genders a few years ago , i came upon the term non binary and it stuck with me . before that , i was genderfluid , agender , etc etc . but non binary fits me well .","300373":"yes , i am .","300374":"no , i m anxious right now . i just had to drive home in snow slush and it made me so nervous . i have to go back out again tonight too , and i m not looking forward to it .","300375":"i seldom take baths . i only shower for maybe minutes .","300376":"i don t personally think so , no . i m too anxious about random sh t to really be brave about most things , lmao .","300377":"i m not a physical fighter , but i ll fight tooth and nail for what i believe in .","300378":"perhaps ? ? i m not entirely sure , my school didn t really have losers or anything .","300379":"it would be pretty full , lmao . i swear multiple times per day .","300380":"i m not entirely sure about those rumors . however , my hair is healthy and no one has ever told me about the whole white hair thing .","300381":"no , not at all . i ve been coloring and bleaching my hair since i was years old , and my hair is extremely healthy . the most important thing is taking care of your hair on a consistent basis .","300382":"it depends on what the person did to make me question their friendship in the first place .","300383":"don t focus so much on getting a girlfriend focus on bettering your life and cultivating your own skills and experiences . the right woman will come along .","300384":"i don t use kik .","300385":"i would wish for enough money to fall into my lap to where i could afford a house , or at the very least , a nice apartment that isn t located in someone s basement .","300386":"i ve never really done anything wild for money . all i ve done is work , lol . i ve had various jobs since i was years old .","300387":"it really brightens my day when people compliment my hair , actually . when i first colored it blue in december , i had so many people in my office building say good things about it , even people i didn t even know , lmao .","300388":"there s no snow on the ground right now . it s supposed to snow tomorrow night , though .","300389":"i like yellow roses the most .","300390":"lol . if i were to go to canada , it would only be to hang out with you . i don t really know of any attractions in canada , rofl .","300391":"i value honesty the most i believe the truth is worth knowing , even if it hurts , because to lie to a person , even if it s meant to make them feel better , only prolongs the hurt . in the same vein , if someone lies to me , then my respect for that person plummets immediately .","300392":"i ve always wanted to travel to alaska or iceland ! ! as well as new zealand . all three areas look absolutely gorgeous .","300393":"i texted my boyfriend hey babe i m home when i got home from work an hour ago .","300394":"i ve never watched the walking dead before . however , i m a pretty big game of thrones fan ! !","300395":"my boyfriend used to have a few friends that i didn t like , but i tolerated them just the same because he was friends with them . i simply didn t like their personalities . i m not sure if any of my boyfriend s friends don t like me . if they don t , it hasn t been brought to my attention .","300396":"harry potter ! ! i ve always been a tremendous fan of the books , and although the movies aren t as good as the books , the movies are still pretty decent . i never read the twilight books , but i heard that the writing was terrible . i saw the first twilight movie i wasn t a fan .","300397":"last night . i bought a cheap bottle of wine that i never tried before , and when i tried to drink it , it literally smelled like someone s b tthole and tasted disgusting . i wouldn t even use it for cooking , that s how terrible it was .","300398":"some people can , yeah . it s called lucid dreaming . personally , i ve never been able to control my own dreams but i know a few people who have the ability to do so .","300399":"i think that was a really stupid decision on his part he can be charged for that sort of behavior , and i m not entirely sure why he thought he would be able to get away with it at all .","300400":"i answered this question minutes ago .","300401":"i don t have a library in my house , but i do have a few bookshelves with most of my books on them . unfortunately , i don t have any photos besides this one of the shelving above my bed , which only has a few books on it .","300402":"uh , as much as i think isole is a great person , i wouldn t want to subject her to the hell that is my household . i wouldn t wish that upon anyone .","300403":"i m doing fine . i got home from work not too long ago now i m attending to my daily ritual of listening to music and drinking a cup of coffee . my supervisor at work trained me in taking over more administrative duties with one of the programs my company has today , so i m a bit nervous but also excited to have more responsibility .","300404":"no , i ve actually never owned a playstation console .","300405":"honestly , there isn t a single person that i actually dislike . granted , i don t talk to most of my coworkers , but they all seem like really nice people . i m only really friendly with or of the people i work with .","300406":"yeah , they used to at least . i haven t had bangs since high school , though .","300407":"hey name , thank you for inviting me to your wedding . unfortunately , i m not going to be able to make it so i ll have to decline your invitation . however , i wish you two the best and congratulations on getting married ! you can give the reason as to why you can t go , but you re not obligated to .","300408":"put a thermos or bottle of water on the table next to my bed , turn all of the lights off , and say good night to my boyfriend if i m texting him . if not , then i usually just plug my phone in and put it on airplane mode for the night .","300409":"i don t like playing sports .","300410":"check its tags for a phone number or an address , and if there isn t one , then i would take the dog to a nearby shelter . they might know if someone is missing their dog , and they could post photos on their social media asking if anyone knows who the dog belongs to .","300411":"i don t remember when the last time i did something artistic was , unfortunately . however , my boyfriend just bought us some adult paint by number books , so i m going to try one out tonight ! !","300412":"i ve been watching big mouth lately it s friggin hilarious . i recommend it if you like gross humor , haha .","300413":"no , i m not a trusting person and i don t trust people easily at all . people have to prove their loyalty to me , trust isn t something i give away freely .","300414":"i m fairly stubborn , but i m also open to suggestions at the same time . it depends entirely on what the issue is .","300415":"he purposely appealed to the majority of what most americans value , even though those values are questionable in context . it s understandable why he had so many followers in the beginning , but after the past two years , i m not sure why anyone still sticks by him .","300416":"courrtana , shehitsback , urlsareshittbh , sweetnothings , littlesha , and babycadiexo are among my favorites . their answers are always interesting .","300417":"i m not entirely sure , i don t really go out into the public often enough to really witness any inequality . i do know that long island is pretty diverse with respect to race , though .","300418":"my weekend was fine ! ! i was dogsitting all saturday afternoon and evening , and sunday i basically did nothing because i was so exhausted from staying up until am . i saw my boyfriend sunday night and we hung out , swapped music , and got really high . lmao .","300419":"nothing much . i just got home from work , so i m waiting for my boyfriend to call me back to see when i should go over his house .","300420":"towards certain people , but certainly not everyone .","300421":"no , not generally . most of the time , i m good at staying focused on my tasks . the only times i m not are when there s too much sensory stimuli going on , then sometimes i ll go into overload .","300422":"no , i just don t want to go to work tomorrow yet . so i ve been laying down but not sleeping because i don t want to wake up yet .","300423":"i d love to receive your spam ! ! i probably won t answer much until tomorrow , though .","300424":"i m not normally a big sports person , but sometimes ice hockey is fun to watch .","300425":"the feeling of wanting to sleep , but also the feeling of not wanting tomorrow to come so quickly . lmao . like , i m tired and i feel like sleeping . but i m also not ready for tomorrow yet . can t i just sleep and have no time pass ? ? smh .","300426":"yeah , absolutely . as long as both partners are open to communication and willing to compromise on things like any other relationship , then there shouldn t really be an issue .","300427":"i don t believe that the person moving in should be directly and solely responsible , considering the pet is owned by the other person . however , it isn t unreasonable for them to take care of that pet in their partner s absence , because they re living in that space just as much as their partner is now . it should be a joint effort .","300428":"it s definitely possible , yes . some people simply don t place much importance on political beliefs because it doesn t directly affect their relationship , especially if those beliefs aren t typically seen as radical or extreme . a lot of people obviously can t be in a relationship with someone if their beliefs strictly oppose their own , especially if a person is pro life or something , but it ultimately depends on the couple s dynamics and what they can compromise on .","300429":"no , sex and intimacy are not the same things . intimacy is a feeling of being deeply connected to a person , which doesn t necessarily have to involve physical affection . sex can be a physical display of that intimacy , however , if those people are both consenting to that type of expression of intimacy .","300430":"no , that s hella gross , in my opinion . even though you share bodily fluids with the person you re dating anyway , you re basically picking up their dental bacteria by using their toothbrush and rubbing it all over your mouth and gums . it isn t sanitary .","300431":"it s traditional for a lot of families to value the partner asking the parents permission to marry their child , so in that vein , it can be seen as more respectful especially if both partners are family oriented and believe in those sorts of traditions . however , if someone wasn t close to their family or didn t believe in such a tradition , but their partner asked their parents permission and were turned down , then i think it would be disrespectful to the child if the partner decided not to marry them based solely on their parents wishes . if that makes sense , haha . personally speaking , it doesn t matter to me either way . i m not close to my family and i wouldn t feel disrespected if my boyfriend asked me to marry him without consulting my parents first . after all , it s ultimately our decision .","300432":"it wouldn t sway me either way as long as they re not judging me solely based on my astrological sign , then i see nothing wrong with being interested in astrology . i have plenty of friends who fully believe in astrology and whatnot . i . e . if a prospective partner suddenly didn t want to date me anymore because they found out i was a scorpio , then that would be pretty disappointing . then again , it also wouldn t bother me very much because i wouldn t want to date a person to begin with if they didn t want to get to know me before judging me first .","300433":"i think it ultimately depends on the couple themselves , because it ranges depending on each person s needs . when my boyfriend and i don t see each other , we usually talk on the phone once or twice per day for minutes each . we don t really text each other , though , because my boyfriend is terrible at texting and it s just easier to talk on the phone . this is what works for my relationship , though .","300434":"i see nothing wrong with gender reveals . it s literally just to announce the sex of your baby , and the fact that there are some strong opinions against gender reveals is a little ridiculous and overbearing . when children are babies , they have no concept of gender . so it s normal for parents to raise them according to their sex unless that child indicates that they feel otherwise somewhere down the line .","300435":"depends on how close you are to that friend . if you said yes initially and now you changed your mind , then that s pretty sh tty .","300436":"i don t really know why someone would do that unless it was for a malicious reason , so i suppose it would be fairly inappropriate .","300437":"probably , but i m not well versed in this kind of law at all . you would have to google this or perhaps ask princess tal .","300438":"spending time with my boyfriend and close friends , listening to music , writing , and creating new experiences .","300439":"yeah , their zodiac sign is only one facet of who they are it doesn t necessarily mean that their personality matches that of their zodiac sign . people s personalities develop based on their genetics and environment , and i ve always been questionable about astrology to begin with personally .","300440":"you were on anon , so i didn t even realize that was you before . lol .","300441":"yeah , renaissance and baroque art are some of my favorite art styles .","300442":"as my bio indicates , i live in new york .","300443":"i answered this already .","300444":"i only wear my fitbit , and i rotate necklaces that my boyfriend has purchased me in the past . lately , i ve been wearing a necklace that s shaped like a circle with a bronze tree in the middle . the circle is made out of opal .","300445":"arrogance ignorance any exhibition of discrimination against people s race , sex , gender , mental or physical health , etc etc . the inability to acknowledge that they were wrong and manipulative tendencies .","300446":"a few months ago when my boyfriend and i booked a hotel room one night to crash after we attended a wine tasting event at a local fish aquarium ! ! we got to the hotel pretty early , so we dropped our things off and walked around the small town for a few hours . we ended up at a really small brewery , and then we found a really cute pizza parlor on the way back to the hotel . after we took a nap , there was live music playing outside the hotel by their pool , so we sat by the outside bar and listened to music for a while .","300447":"yes ! ! me and courrtana met in real life after talking to each other for ages on askfm and through text ! ! i wish we could have hung out more when she was in new york , but i m really happy that we were able to spend an afternoon together . it was so much fun .","300448":"please don t call me gorgeous , it isn t an adjective that makes me feel comfortable . regardless , i m doing fine . i got home from work not too long ago , and now i m listening to music and trying to relax from the long day i had . i texted my friend to see if she wanted to celebrate national drink wine day with me , but if she isn t available , i m just going to pour a glass by myself , lol .","300449":"i used to deal with that when i worked in retail i had some coworkers who were on a lower level than me in terms of promotions , and i was technically their manager if the assistant store manager or regular store manager weren t available . they would take it upon themselves to make decisions that should have gone by me first for approval , and they wouldn t communicate what they did to anyone so there was miscommunication within the store , which was difficult to handle . thankfully , it isn t something i ve had to deal with working in office environments . granted , i ve never really been in a supervisory position with these office jobs , but it isn t something i really notice . if it happens , it doesn t happen around me , lol .","300450":"i have a lot of playlists on spotify , but the one i ve been listening to the past few days is just called feb music . it s just a compilation of all of the songs i ve been listening to in one place .","300451":"no , love at first sight doesn t exist . love is a deep , intimate connection you develop with a person over time . you cannot know if you love a person or not by simply meeting them for the first time . in those instances , the attraction you re feeling is simply lust .","300452":"my coworker told me it was national drink wine day ! ! when i initially looked it up , national wine day is actually in may . but apparently national drink wine day is different . i think americans just want any excuse to be validated while they drown themselves in alcohol . regardless . . . uh , yeah . i bought a bottle of wine after work . lmao .","300453":"there s nothing wrong with that . i don t think whiskey expires , lol . it s good to keep around for celebrations , special occasions , if you re having a guest over , etc etc .","300454":"that s not stupid at all , that s actually a really great thing that you seldom drink alcohol . most alcohol is absolutely terrible for you anyway , with the exception of perhaps a glass of red wine per night allegedly . i ve personally never been a fan of whiskey , scotch , bourbon , etc etc . it tastes too gross to me .","300455":"i m good at writing mostly prose , but sometimes poetry understanding people s feelings and worries and playing certain video games .","300456":"lol . honestly , disaronno is one of my favorite liquors . i only ever drink it on the rocks , and it s terrifying how it goes down like water . i haven t had it in a long time , though . perhaps i ll pick a bottle up one of these days , it s definitely a good winter night time drink .","300457":"i like being busy for most of the day , but definitely not all day . i need some down time each day to collect my thoughts , relax , and recoup from the day . for me , that normally happens late at night when i have no responsibilities left to worry about for the evening .","300458":"no , i don t have any plans for the summer . if anything , i ll be traveling to local places and perhaps spending a weekend here and there , so it isn t something i need to plan too far in advance .","300459":"lol . yeah , it shows how fragile their sense of masculinity is , because they re clearly insecure in themselves if they feel the need to constantly broadcast that they re a real man , or something along those lines . i don t have time in my life for people who think too much into masculinity versus femininity or feed into false stereotypes of what a real man or real woman should be .","300460":"no , not at all . family isn t strictly by blood you can be seen as a part of someone s family even without being related to them if your relationship is close enough . my boyfriend s family is going on an extended vacation next year and they included me in their excursion , so i texted my boyfriend s step mother sometime last week thanking her for including me , and she said , no need , you re family ! ! i ve been so close with his family for so long that they basically consider me part of the family now too , even though we re not engaged or anything , lol .","300461":"personally speaking , i don t . it s difficult to really keep track of them because it unfortunately happens so often . and i find that if i focus too much on current events , shootings , etc etc . , too much then i just wind up becoming angry and upset .","300462":"nope , i ve been at work all day . when you asked me this question , i had just gotten home .","300463":"lately , it s been listening to music . i don t really do much while i m listening because i prefer to focus on the music and vocals and lyrics and whatnot , it s pretty therapeutic for me . my boyfriend and i have gotten into the habit of sitting down , talking about our day and our daily thoughts , and then putting music on and discussing it while showing each other the recent music we ve been listening to .","300464":"i like being asked questions related to my interests , i . e . video games , mental health , cosmetics , television series documentaries , music , coffee , alcohol , etc etc . i m pretty open to most questions , though , as long as they re not invasive , inappropriate , or troll ish .","300465":"currently , my favorite song is apologize by grandson https www . youtube . com watch ? v wjili kavuy","300466":"it means that i want to have a positive self image because of the fact that i don t have one at all . it s pretty self explanatory .","300467":"pay off all of my debts , buy a house , and buy my boyfriend a new car .","300468":"no , i ve never cheated on anyone before . i never really saw the point in cheating unless it s an ab sive relationship that you can t escape easily , or something along those lines .","300469":"yes , my boyfriend bought me one for valentine s day ! ! i m not sure where he bought it from , but it s essentially a pound blanket , and there are ones with higher weights depending on your frame . i ve always been curious , and honestly i didn t think it would do anything different to my sleep , but i feel more well rested when i use it and it does help my nighttime anxiety a lot .","300470":"yeah except now it exists within capitalism .","300471":"no , i ve never pretended that my self image was positive . i ve always been quite open about the fact that my self image is nonexistent , lol .","300472":"it probably stems from the fact that humans evolved from being hunters and gatherers and were on the top of the food chain , so to speak .","300473":"yeah , considering it s something i always strive to have . a positive self image is important to most people because it gives people greater confidence in themselves .","300474":"sure , that works .","300475":"sometimes , yeah .","300476":"i m not sure what i m having for dinner tonight . i m honestly not even hungry .","300477":"i d probably choose to save them , then . however , that s assuming that you would even know in the first place who was in which group , which seems pretty biased .","300478":"depends on whether or not i want to die that day .","300479":"because it s obvious that more people being hurt is worse than less people , lol . that isn t something that needs to be explained .","300480":"this is a stupid question .","300481":"i haven t liked any of your answers , dude .","300482":"a similar sense of humor to mine , loyalty , honesty , creative , hard working , and passionate . it s changed with age , yeah . but my boyfriend has thankfully exhibited those qualities as we ve grown together .","300483":"uh , yeah . it s based on the number of people you wind up hurting overall .","300484":"because of the amount of people it ultimately affects . would you rather the families of people be grieving or the families of people ? ?","300485":"uh , hello . do you have a question ? ?","300486":"yeah he s super messy , lol . when he does clean , he does a terrific job at it , but in general he s just a fairly messy person and sometimes it frustrates me .","300487":"sometimes my paranoia acts up , but lately it s been manageable .","300488":"yes , i m quite happy . my boyfriend is one of the best things to have happened to me i m forever grateful for his support , love , and friendship .","300489":"if that meant that if i didn t let those people die then people would die , then yeah . is a greater number than and it would be for the greater good .","300490":"no . personally speaking , i only have social and emotional connections with a few people in my life . most people generally don t have connections to complete strangers .","300491":"well yeah you re the one who said humans , lol .","300492":"it s something we have in common with each other , sure . i thought you meant like a social or emotional connection , though .","300493":"when it originated in other cultures , it was meant to signify species . as time progressed , language changed so now it s mainly a historical homage to what it used to be .","300494":"in some ways , sure . there are some people who gain a little bit of knowledge about something from the internet suddenly they act as if they re an expert in the subject , even if the information they received was from social media .","300495":"no , not everyone is connected to everyone else . there are people with whom you have zero connection .","300496":"well yeah , that s why i m watching the video . lol

drinking beer instead of liquor , my medication made me gain a lot of weight , and i haven t exercised in about a year . i intend on going back to the gym , though . my boyfriend actually signed up for the same gym as i have , so we re going to start going together to motivate me more .","300568":"you surely aren t suggesting that i forego my own health simply because a person s personality is

, no . they listen really well , though . if i say stop or stay , they know not to move . if i tell them to sit or lay down , they do so . if i tell one dog to go outside and the other to stay inside , then they listen . they re all really well behaved dogs .","300599":"i ve never been in a physical fight before .","300600":"i m dogsitting three dogs i m not sure how old they all are , but they re all between and .","300601":"i m sorta talkative , but i m more of a listener than anything else . sometimes i have stories to tell , but when i m talking to people , we re mostly talking about events and feelings and opinions , not so much about other people .","300602":"no , i appreciate that they trust me enough to vent to me with their problems . it doesn t happen too often anyway .","300603":"i agree with him too ! ! after thinking about it some more , i can definitely see his point of view . cc urlsareshittbh","300604":"it probably won t affect my life directly , especially if i believe nothing will happen with the deal at all . but it s all speculation at this point , so it s impossible to say anything with resolution . and yeah , if the goal is to end poverty , then it s terrific in theory .","300605":"lol , i saw . i don t really think it makes very much of a difference either way , people will still know what the anon means .","300606":"considering you don t know much about my life at all , your conclusion is unfounded . lol . compared to some other people , sure my life wasn t as hard as their lives . however , that doesn t mean my life was easy . it s useless to compare who had it worse because oppression olympics is gross .","300607":"no , but i ve done the best i can do for myself despite the circumstances .","300608":"it doesn t matter if i agree with the goals at all , because i m not a politician , nor do i work for the government . i have absolutely nothing to do with the deal , so technically it makes no difference what i think , lol . i said its goals are great , in theory . implementation will be difficult . but it doesn t matter because that isn t my job , and there s nothing i can do about it .","300609":"it varies depending on the day . if my boyfriend is working early that morning , he usually doesn t text me until he s on break in the afternoon . sometimes i ll text him to tell him that i got to work safe and that i hope he has a productive day . if he s awake and he s working the late shift that night , he ll text me first in the morning while he s having a cup of coffee .","300610":"i swear when i m outside on breaks with my coworkers . other than that , i don t talk to anyone at work .","300611":"i said it sounds terrific in theory . they re goals that i agree with personally , and i can still think that they re good goals despite the fact that i also think it s going to be difficult to put forth .","300612":"most of my friends have different opinions than i do . it s unrealistic to expect everyone you re friendly with to hold the same views , considering everyone is their own individual person and has their own respective backgrounds and opinions . as long as we respect each other s opinions , even if we don t agree with each other , then it doesn t much matter .","300613":"my opinions have changed on things over time as i ve gotten older . however , it s not going to change if i m firm on a stance and a random stranger claims i m wrong , lol .","300614":"it s goal is to reduce greenhouse emissions , create jobs for americans , invest in the infrastructure to meet economic challenges , secure sustainable energy and clean air and water , and promote justice and equality among all people regardless of race , sex , gender , religion , etc etc . like i said , it sounds ideal . however , it s going to be difficult to actually implement because the government likely won t pass anything regarding the deal and a lot of the issues addressed have unrealistic conclusions .","300615":"no , if someone were to threaten me in a serious manner , then they would speak to me privately . it s useless to get worried over a threat from an anon because they re a complete stranger who likely has no information on you besides the information you choose to share online .","300616":"it sounds terrific in theory , from the small bit of information i ve read about it , but it s going to be difficult to implement in the foreseeable future .","300617":"it depends on the subject matter . it s easier for people to make me think twice about my opinion if i m uneducated on something , since in those cases i m willing to understand different sides of an issue . however , in cases where my opinion on something is firm , then nothing can change my mind .","300618":"yeah , just because it s from my boyfriend doesn t mean my skin magically stops hurting , lol . i obviously don t mind physical affection from him , but massages still hurt like hell .","300619":"lol . no , not at all . that s some juvenile , high school sh t . how could they even fight me if they re too afraid to come off anon ? ?","300620":"i absolutely hate massages . i don t like people touching me to begin with , and massages hurt my skin because i m sensitive .","300621":"i ve learned to accept the fact that not everyone is a friend , even if they say they re your friend . actions speak louder than words , and sometimes it s okay to distance yourself from people who don t put the same effort into the friendship as you do .","300622":"i ve never watched kids or cats before , lol . i assume it would be easiest to watch cats because they keep to themselves . these dogs keep on running toward the front door and barking even though no one is there , i think they re expecting my best friend s family to come home and they miss them .","300623":"i find it interesting because most of the time , it s instigated by anons who are too afraid to come off anonymous , lol . but in general , i don t pay attention to drama . most of the time , it happens when i m not even online .","300624":"i m watching three dogs ! ! two are pit mixes and one is a chihuahua weenie mix ."}}
