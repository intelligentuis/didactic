leadership , assertiveness , do they have initiative , are they problem solver , etc etc . i get people do have their own internal social communication issues . and i d be willing to allow that as

.","57832":"i think there s a lot more to it than just that , ha . if i was hiring someone , i d look at the resume first . to look and see the way it s formatted as well the way it s structured , how much you say , how much you don t say . it all depends on how much valuable detail you provide , and how much you don t . also depends on your job experience i d look at the job experience between each candidate to see who would work best . who has the right attitude , and compare and contrast them to see who d be the best pick for the company out of the bunch . also i d look at your references . i d check with the provided references to see what made them hire you , and what made you leave . you can learn a lot about someone just through their resume .","57833":"give up .","57834":"yezir !

why the hell would they be in love with me ? there has to be a reason . why am i usually mean to them ? is it because i to eo could in fact be in love with them ? then given some time , i would ve reassessed those feelings . what is it , that they could be seeing in me , that makes them want to love me . i d probably feel there s possibly something inside me worth loving . maybe it s something or a certain side of me from within which i m unable , yet anyways , to see or understand . perhaps the reason i don t see that happiness inside myself , is because their happiness comes from my happiness . and their happiness is what also make me happy . so essentially they both want the other person to be happy , and they know they need each other to achieve it . or maybe it s like how they would said back in elementary school that if a girl or boy was mean to you , it was because they like you . who knows . . . just an idea . so if i do have feelings or also loved them back . i would tell them how i felt , face to face . i d make sure i meant it first because i told them so . and lying and saying it to just say it , will be terrible because then they would be let on to believe

time . depending on the person anyways . they can only be taken down once there s be a solidified trust between the two . transparency is an absolute must in order for this to happen . it can be

can t expand it further than just that . for instance the obvious meeting that someone in person . after that , meeting up with them another time then another , then another . you may not know it at

it when it comes to falling in love , even with someone online it all matters on how much time and effort your willing to put in to push it further than that to . i say it like that because of course you can say , oh i love them ! referring to the person you met online and that could be based solely off of looks but i don t think that s love . love is a lot deeper than that . which is why i

further than that to make it more than just seeing them through a computer phone screen or just seeing them from afar . and from doing that , introducing yourself to them and talking to them more , to hanging out with them , and then getting to know someone on a deeper level from all that combined , you can and will find love . now whether or not that feeling is reciprocative is a whole other story

the last years . . . i couldn t tell you , not anymore anyways . . . i could and would ve had the same response to this as i did for my friends back home . . . . but a lot has changed in the last

my glass , and with contacts having the obvious benefits . lol .","58195":"hola","58196":"bonjour","58197":"i d say three , based off what i believed was serious . not taking away what they other person might ve thought of course , as the feeling was usually mutual . the last serious was also my last overall relationship . that was also my the longest relationship going for almost years . i haven t been in a relationship since .","58198":"i can t say which one is better because i ve never been . that being said , i m not sure my opinion would be best to listen to , but i would go with syndey . if it s the first cities in australia , me being a sucker for historical monuments i d love to see the landmarks and architecture in its first city . it being the oldest as well i d assume that comes with culture , so how could i not want to go see what they offer . also if it s said to have the highest rise buildings in australia , i d love to see them . i m a sucker for skyscrapers . that s one of the reason i used to live in dtla . i also prefer east west coastal cities over north south coastal cities . i like seeing the sunrise or sunset on the water properly

thing he does , which is quite unfortunate . i wish more people would actually learn what s happened , happened and what s actually been done through their own research rather than repeating what s been said on every other news channel or social media post .","58203":"translation look at the look negro what ? . . . . .","58204":"yea . it s really quite unfortunate and pretty sad honestly . especially if they re type of person who was always there for those who aren t there for you . and still would be . . all things consider . i guess that s one way of finding out who really gives a shit about you . i guess when the time comes to decide on whether you re gonna let it just burn all down or not . . . you gotta be the one who starts the fire .","58205":"my specialty dishes . saut ed

much as i d want to . because of that , i d just prefer the other person who s trying to communicate something , to actually be to break that ice . today s woke culture really fucked up how people communicate with one another . even when it comes to a someone wanting to tell the person they like , they have feelings . it s unfortunate , i wish things were how they used to be . why do you ask ?

everything was much simple and and less stressful . i knew what i was doing , i loved what i was doing and where i was with my career . everything was better then .","58215":"is it uncalled for ? considering i have absolutely no clue if your situation , why should i believe you re innocent . for all i know , you could ve in fact started to defend yourself from bullying but that doesn t mean you stopped there . shit . . . how do i know that you didn t go further with your defense ? perhaps you got such a rush from it , it became your new drug . from there you would terrorize that person who started the initial bullying . maybe there s several occasions where you would see them walking down the street minding their own business , then you would come out of nowhere and throw cheese slices at them while screaming hysterically and dump and bucket of goose nuts and gopher blood all over them ? all while having music blasting at full leaving playing girls just wanna have fun on repeat . how do i know you didn t just continue with your craziness and in the middle of the night , put a massive speaker next to their bedroom window , blast that song , throw an boulder throw their window , having disco lights and car horns blaring while still screaming hysterically . only to distract them so you can spray them with a hose filled with tabasco flavored banana pudding , then you d throw bags filled with of feathers . and you d starting laughing at them and act like a chicken poking fun at them ? ! how do i know this report isn t justified . the only way i can know for sure , or

lol","58220":"depending on what kind type of love you re referring to . love in the whole sense of caring for someone you know personally ? possibly , i m sure something can happen to change that . love in the sense of having feelings for someone ? yea i m sure they can . there are some who can t let go , and there are some that do . and for the ones that do let go , i m sure they still do in fact love that other person even after a splitting . as in the sense for caring what happens to them , and not in the having feelings for . this can actually have several types of answers . just fyi , i may give certain answers in this spectrum , but that doesn t mean that s how i feel about love per say . it might be easier to answer your question if you wouldn t mind clarifying the type of love you re referring to .","58221":"spring break ? what s that ? i m more of a think every week is spring break kind of person . of course handling work first . why do i need to wait till spring break to be irresponsible with my drinking wake up in random places , around random people , doing and acting out inappropriately while taking absolutely no responsibility for my actions when i can just do it any time i want . but like i said , making sure work gets done first .","58222":"if i m being literal , i was thinking about what was on my mind after reading your question . but in reality , i m thinking about someone .","58223":"the best way to apologize is not bitch out and just take responsibility to what it it is you re apologizing for . and of course consider and respect people s boundaries while you re in the process of doing so . i don t think i need to be clear about it , but obviously think before you speak . that s how shit slips and you end up saying stuff you didn t mean to . obviously i mean think about what you re gonna say before the actual moment of apologizing , not during . that s just asking for trouble .","58224":"well considering the entertainment industry is shut down , in terms of on set crews or just productions in general , it basically killed all of the post production work business i had scheduled . so it s changed quite drastically

sleep before i have to get up for school or work . ha . seriously . it s terrible living with insomnia . i m usually going to sleep hours before i need to actually be at work . it s a shit way to live . and it s even more shitty to try and adapt .","58227":"said the anon asking the question . . . . not sure . perhaps their self conscious about who they are when people identify them . thinking as them perhaps people cling onto the persona or pseudonym of the character they created . people can force themselves to adapt as another persona when they themselves are unable to . if that makes sense . like how people have stage names , or you see musicians or actors who can kill it on screen or in music , and are open and reach to others , and they re relatable etc etc in their art form , just to be clear , but as soon as you interview them they re shy uncomfortable . other perspective maybe they re lurkers . . . as weird as that sounds .","58228":"saturday probably .","58229":"traveling

elaborate what the scary scenario would be .","58232":"i don t know if that s my place to say anything . for instance if they said they d never want to see me or vice versa i d respect their wishes . i wouldn t reach out to that person . but if i knew that person was in some possible danger or harm , i d find a way to at least reach out to someone they know , and perhaps inform them of any possibilities . i don t know them , but i think they d deserve to know what they re getting into , and it d be up to them to decide . so it s a little tough to say .","58233":"why thank you . i hope

the event still happens in someone s future , but the path which we take to reach said event , can be changed through a person s choice and free will . it s choice and free will that allows us to make the decisions and mold and shape our destiny fate . so in a way , yes . i believe that we are destined to a particular fate , but it s through our own choices and decisions and drive to see through .
