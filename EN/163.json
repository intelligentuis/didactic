not a thing , and if it is , it s because something is seriously wrong . horses are friendly and curious by nature , and when they re not , there s a reason . in the case of bucephalus , it s pretty hard telling how he really was or what really happened with him because history doesn t write about every detail of people or animal s lives as they were actually lived . it s always from a perspective of someone else and sometimes that perspective can be greatly exaggerated or completely fabricated . if that really was true and bucephalus didn t let anyone other than alexander the great ride him , it definitely had something to do with mistrust , poor handling , or fear leftover from a bad incident in his life . nowadays we know so much more about horse s health , wellness , psychology , and training than we did back then , and our methods today are much gentler and more humane so it could ve been a product of poor or harsh training he received that made him like that . even today though , i honestly believe a lot of one person horses are human made . either their early initial training and handling was done by one single person most of their lives and they straight up were never socialized , or something negative happened in their life to cause them to mistrust humans early on and then one specific human was able to earn their trust back . the problem is it becomes a self fullfilling prophecy . it usually goes like this the horse is comfortable with their one person and acts just fine with them because they trust them . but if the horse gets introduced to someone else or handled by someone else they freeze up or flip out and the owner immediately thinks omg horsey has never done that before ! this is bad ! he can never be ridden or touched by anyone else otherwise he ll hate it , it s dangerous , and bad for the horse ! and then they claim that horse just doesn t like other people , won t let anyone else ride them , and that they re a one person horse . the horse is then never allowed to work through their fears or trust issues with other people and because of that they are never socialized . that just makes them become more set in their ways as a one person horse . even when people try to socialize a one person horse , it s usually only a half hearted attempt . maybe an hour or so , or several short sessions with a different person , but it sometimes takes a long time to gain the trust of a horse and build their confidence . it s much easier to just say no , he s a one person horse and leave it at that . building on that , back when bucephalus was alive , i m not really sure people cared all too much about letting their horses gain trust and confidence like we do nowadays because to them , horses were like machines . they were for transportation , plowing , war , and carrying heavy loads . as long as you could force them into submission enough to do what you wanted it was good enough . nowadays we understand that that s incredibly cruel .","150779":"yeah i love the snow it s way better than the freezing rain or ice that we typically get where i live","150780":"we had a nice day in since it was snowy and cold . we sat by the fireplace , had a cute italian dinner , took a bath with a nice smelling green bath bomb , and when it got dark we made a campfire outside and drank hot tea","150781":"no","150782":"i don t have that problem . you should first and foremost love yourself before you can give love to anyone else","150783":"possibly this week , maybe next . depends on how this interview went . i thought it went well . latest it would be is march","150784":"i graduated and don t go to school anymore","150785":"i think a red colored led collar for my pup would be nice . he s a black lab and it s really hard to see him in the dark lol . if he had a light up collar i could track him at night when he runs around on our walks i d like it to be red bc that s his color . everything he has is red like his collar and harness and stuff","150786":"feb th","150787":"he good","150788":"haha i def see why you d think that for sure . that would be kinda cruel fr i agree . totally correct me if i m wrong but it seems like there might be a bit of misunderstanding going on about the way hunting is accomplished tho ? chasing them and scaring them isnt how you hunt . that s the exact opposite of what you have to do lol . that would be waaaay too hard anyways haha . humans are super slow and it s illegal to hunt fire weapons from a motor vehicle . animals are too fast for that and if you scared them too much they d probs just leave the area and not come back and nobody wants that . wildlife is so pretty and nice and good for the environment i don t hunt and never have but a lot lot lot of my peers and friends do have as well as some of my family and they all tell me that instead , you have to track their movements for a few months beforehand with trail cams and look for footprints and signs of them around you to see where they naturally like to hang out . after you know where they like to be , when when hunting season comes around you go sit in a deer stand , in a tree , or in a blind and you be very quiet and sit very still and wait for hours and hours for them to come to you . you can call to them using special animal calls or by just using your voice if you can make a convincing enough sound . people usually go to great lengths to go undetected by the animals . i think that whole part is pretty neat . they make a bunch of soaps and stuff that literally takes away your person smell and makes you smell like absolutely nothing so the animals can t detect you sitting there . some people even rub dirt on themselves to be better hidden and smell more like the outdoors when you see the animal you want to choose and they come close enough , you take your shot and you hunt them . no scaring , no chasing , no cruelty , and no pain . i d say it s even less stressful for them than if they were naturally predated on by a pack of wolves , coyotes , or a mountain lion where they would def be chased and scared and probably eaten half alive and held down and ripped apart . hunting with dogs is where the cruelty comes in for me . thats a whooole dif issue haha don t even get me started . that s fucked up for real but a lot of people seem to agree that it s not good . dog hunting is illegal to do for that reason in a whopping out of the states . even in the states where it isss legal you can apparently onlyy do it in certain areas and at certain specific times also your point about rangers doing it that would be the exact same scenario as normal people hunting and would be accomplished using the exact same tactics of sitting still , being quiet , and respecting the wildlife . not quite sure what the difference would be except that it would be way harder to control the population since there are fewer rangers than hunters , more animals would die slowly of chronic wasting disease , more of the environment would be degraded due to overpopulation","150789":"show genuine interest in her life and hobbies , try them with her ! remind her you love her daily overuse it . be her best friend and be there for her when she needs it . tell her she s beautiful , do little things for her like make food or hold hands without expecting things in return . do it because you love her . treat her like a princess and don t put pressure on her to act or be or think a certain way . love her for who she is and was and who she will be . verbally and physically remind her she s important to you . and lastly , never forget why you fell in love in the first place . don t get too tied up in the bs and drama of life and forget where y all came from and that you re in love with her as a human . don t let the random noise of the day to day that tends to take over peoples brainspace make you forget your future feelings for her . he said , she said , doesn t matter . always be open and honest and non accusatory and talk out your feelings about everything . she ll come to understand appreciate you more for all of it","150790":"nissan frontier","150791":"ok so this is a long statement haha so i hope you read but if not it s cool . tldr i disagree that hunting is all bad for multiple reasons but acknowledge that killing is generally negative and that some people who hunt just cause they get enjoyment from killing are super messed up actual answer i find a lot of people think that way and expect me to say the same but i disagree . it s because of hunting that we can maintain healthy wildlife populations and raise money for conservation . states are required to monitor wildlife populations and set limits for each person , each season , for the amount of animals they re allowed to remove from the population . the total number of animals allowed to be taken is always based on the current population of that animal in the area that you re registering to hunt in . the money the state receives from hunting tags helps fund research and conservation efforts for those animals so we can better understand how to help them . that money serves as the funding to pay scientists to actually go out in the field and do studies and make and implement conservation plans . there are of course cruel people out there who enjoy hunting bc they just like killing things and tbh that s super messed up but most hunters i ve encountered are outdoorsmen and women who enjoy nature and want to save it for future generations it all sounds like a bad thing bc killing things is generally negative but when you zoom out and look at the bigger picture it s actually super good for the populations and the overall environment . especially considering humans wiped out all the top predators that would ve naturally kept game animal populations in check like wolves and cougars in most areas . without the top preds , herbivore populations grow too big , they eat all the food in their areas and trample everything down , then they slowly starve to death , get sick , and die painful , slow , awful deaths . being killed by a hunter s bullet instantly is much better and less painful than the alternative imo","150792":"https youtu . be wx nrveigfw https youtu . be rq zoeffy https youtu . be ztn h hoiuu","150793":"unedited raw file but still a cute

winter","150798":"yea","150799":"yeah i like to feel like i m making a difference for them i know that technically it s bad for the health of the environment to feed wildlife bc it encourages them to rely more on humans and discourages them to forage naturally but tbh there s so much urban sprawl in my area and so little natural habitat left i m sure it s already pretty difficult for most critters to forage completely naturally anyways especially in wintertime when food is scarce anyways","150800":"if i m thirsty i m p much only drinking water either straight up or in tea . i don t really go

peace . you can t live a good life if you re bitter , cynical , selfish , cruel , or mean spirited . also , having lots of money doesn t equate to a good life . you can be poor all your life and still have a good life . it all just depends on your attitude and the good you do during your lifetime for yourself and for the world .","150936":"same thing lol i usually wear a hoodie and pj pants if i m chilling at home . especially with the cold , wet , weather we ve been having lately","150937":"both extremely overhyped imo . never really got into either of them for that reason lol","150938":"i don t like discussing politics on my page . i go to this platform to get away from stuff like that cause i m constantly bombarded with it everywhere else","150939":"i like to keep common areas clean but my room and my car are usually just a bit cluttered . not like those hoarder tv shows lol but i usually have a pile of clean clothes on the floor somewhere or something","150940":"hmmm maybe an aquarium , horse stable farm , church , or a cottage","150941":"no lol","150942":"it ducks and it s rigged but you have to play the game and win in order to be able to cash out and step away from the machine","150943":"it d be like the zootopia movie where the mice had tiny walkways and cities and areas in the larger overall city that accommodated the bigger animals","150944":"that s your own opinion that you re more than welcome to have but i don t think that","150945":"idfk stop asking this i get this q at least once a month","150946":"just sitting there slumped like normal lol","150947":"the navy . i d probably have ended up some sort of veterinarian or environmental science personnel","150948":"chillin with them is nice too most trained horses will let p much anyone sit on them and walk around , but you re right for more serious riding it s much better to know your horse and be a good team together so that means you def do have to study them as you said lol","150949":"rap was ranked second in my spotify most listened to generas","150950":"haha thanks","150951":"yup !","150952":"we already found it in the form of bacteria and other microbes and nobody cared","150953":"no not really . i don t think they d have a problem with eachother . historically camels and horses have both been used together in the same spaces eg the silk road and there hasn t been a problem . it honestly all just depends on the horse s individual personality . like how some people like dogs and how some people don t . maybe some horses would like camels and some wouldn t . i don t think smell has anything to do with anything at all though since horses and camels are both pretty smelly animals . animals don t typically care about animal smell . also , as far as them not liking things that are bigger than them , that s mostly not true . as an example , miniature ponies are often great friends with giant draft horses that are times their size . again , down to individual personalities . you can also train a horse to do or get used to literally anything . so tbh even if your horse showed aversion to camels size , smell , or general presence at first , you could easily train it out of them so they could eventually become friends","150954":"nope","150955":"i like making plans in advance much better but i m capable of going with the flow of the situation calls for it","150956":"not too much . i ve gotten older and maybe a bit wiser but overall haven t made any drastic changes","150957":"too many to count tbh . i liked the aristocats , spirit stallion of the cimarron , brother bear , and the lion king but there are so many more i also enjoyed too","150958":"i haven t watched television in years","150959":"forever always by chance the rapper , rex orange county , daniel caesar , yebba , and peter cottontale","150960":"haha lots of people say horses are scary but tbh i ve found that they re basically just like giant puppies haha they re so cute and gentle","150961":"don t have one","150962":"tiny giraffe ! ants are gross looking close up so a giant ant would look super gross to me","150963":"no thanks lmao","150964":"thanks !","150965":"wow

day","150969":". . . the what now ?","150970":"that s a fact that we already know lol there is no believe . nasa has already found lifeforms of bacteria and some water on other planets they ve sent robots to","150971":"raspberries and blackberries","150972":"yes i have would totally do it again but only of it wasn t suspect super haunted lol cause i don t fuck with that","150973":"meh not

month old child . that explains how come you were too much of a baby ass bitch to come off anon when i turned it off and have a normal conversation with me","151017":"happiness and love for you and those around you","151018":"hi","151019":"who fuckin cares lmao","151020":"easier to forgive than waste energy and time holding a grudge","151021":"myself usually","151022":"i don t recall mentioning that anyone else has ever attempted to inform me so why would you even know that someone had unless you were that anon from before . . . anyways even if they are a catfish all their pics are the same

sweet","151061":"dislike","151062":"yes","151063":"not much at all unless i m stressed","151064":"oh that was nice of you , thanks ! i m not having a hard time or anything though lol","151065":"hi javi hope you re having a good thursday too ! thank you","151066":"no not since like , middle school lmao","151067":"yeah it was nice . had a fire with my bf and drank some wine while sitting and

and don t stress too much over what others think of you . especially people on social media . the people who matter won t mind and the people who mind don t matter","151074":"yeah definitely . chemicals originally from plants are what we derive a lot of modern day medicines from so there are definitely health benefits to having eating certain herbs","151075":"unfortunately i totally missed the pok mon craze i was living in germany when it really took off in the us so i was never really that into it . i know if i d been around it and discovered it earlier on in my childhood i would ve loved it though !","151076":"agreed lol","151077":"lol this has been sitting in my inbox forever and i finally have a good panorama pic for it p","151078":"being with people too much","151079":"thanks

stick to it unless i think of something else i need or someone from my fam calls me while i m at the store to add something to the list","151085":"nope","151086":"so strange . i ve volunteered doing doing hippotherapy for a number of years and none of those animals are ever intact . it poses an unnecessary risk for people participating in the therapy . stallions un neutered are usually jumpy , alert , quick paced , feisty , spooky , and get excited when there are mares nearby . they typically give me spirit stallion of the cimarron vibes . of course there are always exceptions . maybe you have yourself some very special , calm , stallions lol","151087":"helps to make him a nice , calm , easy going guy although i do sometimes wish i could know what little baby chances would look like . probably so cute !","151088":"male horses parts are usually sucked up into them unless they need them to be out lol . and chance has a few less parts than some other male horses since he s a gelding neutered","151089":"cool beans","151090":"haha it s okay it s not even in the pic . he s all bundled up for the cold with his blanket on","151091":"aw thanks chance is actually a boy haha but i think he s equally pretty either way","151092":"the last one i put out on youtube was this one https youtu . be tgpuexc vo","151093":"i haven t played that in years lol so neither","151094":"doing well thanks it s a very slushy , wet , muddy , snow day here . chance looks like a mud ball lol but waaay better than yesterday when it was spitting freezing rain all day","151095":"nope","151096":"no","151097":"country","151098":"my reaction summed up in a gif","151099":"thanks lol","151100":"that s what i mean . . . that s what you say every time i give you more than a one sentence answer","151101":"a million times . literally just did that this morning roping sandy fox his hot lunch . poured some super hot ravioli sauce on my finger when i missed the thermos a bit lol . i m okay it was more surprising than painful","151102":"maybe , possibly ? if i had help and maybe a map","151103":"hopefully still the same me but wiser , more sustainable , more patient , and a bit more wrinkly lol","151104":"uh i doubt that haha . maybe the idea of horses , but without actual real world experiences with horses idk how you could want to accept the responsibility of owning one . i ve already mentioned that a lot of times before and you seem like you kinda just blow me off every time . horses aren t like a goldfish that you can feed once a day and ignore completely . i don t think you like horses , i think it s just an easy convo starter with me and that s why suddenly , after a lifetime of not liking animals in general , you re now interested in them","151105":"it s always considerate to try to learn at least a few words of another country s language when you go to visit but it s not required . you just can t get mad if no none understands you , people stare at you funny cause you stick out from their culture , or no one is willing to help you bc of the language barrier","151106":"what do you mean by that lol","151107":"haha i feel lucky to have chance in my life fs","151108":"doing a snow day chance video . gonna see if he ll be cute and run around in the snow","151109":". . . uh haha why the ummmm","151110":"i m the one in red

actually started to get to know each other through a mutual friend","151112":"haha yeah sandy makes it easy","151113":"take everything i had , take sandy and my dog , and skip town . i m not going to prison lol .","151114":"yup he s very loved and cherished my ideal partner and my best friend","151115":"oh lol . i just got up to see sandy off to work . he wakes up at am to have enough time to eat breakfast and make lunch , defrost his vehicle , and get out the door on time so i did too this morning . gonna be a cold one today ! hope he isn t cold on the job site . he works outdoors all day","151116":"you taking a new job too ?","151117":"tacos","151118":"thank you lol","151119":"march","151120":"lol i m not comfortable talking money over the internet with strangers","151121":"hope

i own both","151135":"i have no idea , i ve never tried that","151136":"yeah there are domesticated versions of foxes","151137":"i guess but make sure you get one from a reputable source and not directly from the wild . do your research","151138":"my bf","151139":"generally yeah","151140":"per day ? probably like . per week ? maybe or times ? used to be obsessed with instagram but as i ve gotten it s started to matter less to me about likes and followers","151141":"oh okay","151142":"ikr lol and thank you","151143":"hi","151144":"alright . . . so ?","151145":"yup i have a younger sister","151146":"i m gonna give it a strong meh","151147":"stuffed shells , ravioli , or tortellini","151148":"haven t been to one since i was a baby and i don t really remember it that well since i was so young so no idea tbh","151149":"had a bonfire","151150":"i m out of school now so idk","151151":"lol hell no . it s still covid and people out here acting like just cause it s a different year

friendly","151160":"i used to need one bc my apartment was super hot in the summer and i got used to the noise but then i moved out of that place and get un used to it lol","151161":"the sunrise over the alps","151162":"no lol not really . i dress comfortably everywhere i go","151163":"finally figured out how to digitally paint horses realistically !","151164":"no ma am , i love it !","151165":"nice one","151166":"thanks but that s legit just common sense . . .","151167":"it can be . depends on what kind of change it is and how it s implemented","151168":"you don t like animals . you ve told me that multiple times . you don t even like horses . of course you re not familiar with those channels because equestrian doesn t interest you . . .","151169":"i literally do not care . it s fun for me . also that s a blatant lie lmao . there are a bunch of equestrian channels out there and lots with well over a hundred thousand subs like thisesme , yourridingsuccess , neddiesgun , and raleighlink","151170":"i d rather just make videos describing and showing horse stuff","151171":"yeah lol i guess . writing isn t my fav thing tho lol i m more into visual media p","151172":". . . sorry , what about it ?","151173":"dude idk anything about parenting . it s really not my thing lol","151174":"no idea , like i said i won t be seeing him until friday . probably still doing well though lol . here s a pic of him my bf sent me from the other day right before his feeding time he s always excited for his grain and stands patiently by his bucket and waits for you to pour it , so cute lol . hoping for some snow where he is ! he looks so pretty against a snowy backdrop","151175":"thank you i really appreciate that !","151176":"nah","151177":"grateful dead","151178":"in away yes , but we re all the same","151179":"cement block on my feet","151180":"there are signs that point to it and an entire death process that begins slowly as your body shuts down so yeah","151181":"yup","151182":"futurama","151183":"set the table","151184":"since you asked don t spend money on random stuff to make yourself look or feel rich or hard or g or cool bc that thing is trendy at the time . trying to flex money you don t have will lead you to keep investing in things rather than life experiences and it s an easy way to get stuck in a rut and get stuck in your hometown and never see or do anything else . stuff is just stuff and doesn t actually enrich your life . it s not manly , or chic , or cool or whatever to spend every single paycheck you earn on new shoes or parts for cars or new purses every single month if you re struggling to survive . prioritize things you want and things you need . it s important to have things you want and to treat yourself occasionally . i m not saying you should deny yourself the simple joys in life at every turn . but it s good to have realistic and attainable financial goals you want to meet and to save up to meet them so you can try to climb up a bit financially . just my opinion and everyone is of course entitled to live how they want and do what they want , just an observation","151185":"no","151186":"horses , nature wildlife , and scenery . here s my all time fav thing i ve ever painted i think","151187":"yay","151188":"heck no my dude it s covid times . i m staying right where i am in my house lol","151189":"no , i delete a lot of repeats , spam , and inappropriate questions","151190":"love","151191":"my next video will be out either tomorrow or friday","151192":"fuck no . i am uninterested . read again not interested . ever . and will ask him no such thing . my absolute disinterest in you will not change and i expect that you respect this clear rejection of your advances . never ask me this again .","151193":"he does not sexualize feet because they are not sexual . they are for walking . i do not want friendly ideas about how men can sexualize me . if i wanted your opinion i would have asked .","151194":"beaver slide","151195":"no . he would not . stop commenting on my body . it s not appreciated .","151196":"yes","151197":"ugh it makes me cringe so badly","151198":"no thanks","151199":"yup","151200":"are and crafting channels , equestrian content , and educational stuff","151201":"what you do with your own time is none of my business","151202":"spam","151203":"generally yeah","151204":"yeah crystals are nice and pretty","151205":"jan th ,","151206":"a red fox skull i found in the woods and re articulated","151207":"get off my page with your weird ass beastiality questions , your disrespect and blatant disregard for my repeated dissent , and your patronizing words calling me sweetie and shit . i will not be replying to this thread any further .","151208":"yes because that s invasive and no one likes when strangers kiss them . . . thought that would ve been a bit obvious lol","151209":"your patronizing tone is not appreciated . i already told you no . if you can t accept me saying no twice already then get off my page","151210":"google vocabulary terms , don t ask me . i m not google . also those terms don t have anything to do with eachother","151211":"no wtf ? for the same reason as a dog . . . drool , germs , plus that s invasive and weird and too sexually implicit . i only kiss my boyfriend on the lips . not animals . not sure why the fuck i would need to explain that to you","151212":"you do not kiss animals on the lips . that is disgusting . stop asking weirdo . this is the second or third time y all ve asked me this","151213":"yes it makes it much easier for them to move naturally and carry your weight on their backs if you remain balanced with them as they go . it also makes it much easier for the horse to understand your directions to them and they ll respond better because they re less likely to be confused","151214":"it takes a lot of strong muscles to remain balanced without gripping and remaining static and becoming bumpy and uncomfortable when riding . if i m not in riding shape , sometimes i do get sore if i do a lot of strenuous or high intensity riding . if i ve been practicing consistently for a while and i m in shape for riding then i don t usually get sore muscles","151215":"lol no worries","151216":"i don t like football","151217":"pretty good","151218":"i don t even know who s in it idc","151219":"thanks so much","151220":"it was something i went back to and changed over a long long time like a few months cause i still don t really like it lol so all in all so far it s taken me a whopping hours here s a time lapse of it so far . i think i still want to add more plants !","151221":"yes , thank you","151222":"congrats","151223":"no , the fuck ?","151224":"what is going on rn . . . what are you trying to ask rn","151225":"i have the potential to be and i was super athletic when i was younger but i m not able to get out as much as i d like to now that i m an adult so i know i could stand to work on it a bit","151226":"i m not , i m . . . why the fuck would i be in daycare in the first place . i wouldn t work there either bc i hate children lol","151227":"what does that even mean","151228":"this is one from a long time ago","151229":"i reckon","151230":"yeah sometimes","151231":"i don t care either way i react the same","151232":"crying can be cathartic and sometimes necessary","151233":"they re fine . i don t think i own any anymore","151234":"thank you , as do we all","151235":"yeah i mean i guess so if i have one handy and i need it but it s not really a regular thing for me to cry","151236":"it s neutral in my opinion . if someone doesn t want to reach their full potential that s on them and no one else","151237":"i don t really give a fuck lmao idk","151238":"i don t mind spending time alone and i do so often . i like nature walks , being with animals guess that doesn t count as being alone tho , and doing quiet activities like art .","151239":"for me those coincide","151240":"that s a personal choice","151241":"no i m not self employed or in a managerial role","151242":"no weirdo","151243":"thanks lol","151244":"relatively","151245":"yes they try and i hate it . i m not interested in any men and especially not ones in here being weird and crude and hiding on anon","151246":"no go away","151247":"idk actually . probably around the , lbs mark . don t exactly have a scale he can step on","151248":"no that s not safe","151249":"yes in middle and high school a

more difficult lol . it s easy to be a passenger on the horse s back , but difficult to be the pilot lol . like no disrespect or anything and not to sound like a know it all haha js . based on talking

going to actually enjoy going out of your way every day to take care of them and give it exercise and training every . single . day . and if you weren t going to personally go out and train and
