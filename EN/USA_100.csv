Question :- Do you have questions  ?

  I feel like it could go either way. This seems more like a classroom setting to me?
  
  you could say ""Yes, I have a question about _____"".
  
  And then with the yes, i do. You'd then ask whatever question you had.
  
  Or if you felt less formal, you could just state your question when being called on.
  
  ----
  
  When I do those ""ask me questions"" shoutouts.. I'm not looking for people saying yes or no. I just want the questions which is kind of another unformal way.

  When someone got mad at you because they called you ""my girl"" and you mention how you don't have anyone. He doesn't talk to you after that.
  
  He's mentioned before that he's the one who usually starts the conversation so I ended up asking if he was mad still a few days ago. More as a are you ok thing? I genuinely like him as a friend, only.
  
  We're talking but it feels forced. I end up being all ""someone isn't talkative"" and now he's all nobody cares about me. I can't wait to die stuff.  How i view him as a f:ck boy but yet our conversations haven't even been dirty.

  I'm not really sure which way you mean.
  
  Do one thing a day you love. Get up and take a shower or bath. Take that class. Be more open and positive outlook. Fake confidence until you believe in yourself. Take it one day at a time. Try not to compare yourself/life to others. Have more communication with family and friends. Know that dreams can change. Maybe seek a therapist. Don't feel bad if you need medication to help you get better. Distance yourself from toxic people, online and in real life.
  
  This was a good podcast about affirmations. Basically if you don't do x,y,z then you aren't helping yourself with just saying the words. It needs action.

  Why do you care so much though? Something broke which made it turn green since it couldn't clean itself. It's fixed now and normal color.  The guys come every Friday to clean it and they also test the levels.

   No. Hay is fully mature & ripened grass. Straw is the ripened stalk of grain crops such as oats, barley, wheat, rye, etc. . It needs to BARLEY STRAW specifically. Not strewn in the pond/pool, but in a cuboid bale.

  It's never really cured. Plus, not all people gain weight. I have insulin resistance which is another part of it. There's lots of different symptoms people could have.
  
  They also checked my weight yesterday, happy i lost 5 pounds but generally i usually maintain and gain the same amount lol even when I look way smaller -_-
  
  Also got metformin for it. It's mainly for diabetes patients but it's been shown to help with pcos to regulate the sugar, periods and whatever else. There's a lot of side effects but I've mainly heard of pooping or puking ones, nausea in general etc Happy that today hasn't been like that XD

  To see if I had pcos or not. Or something else going on.
  
  1st one - urine, bloodwork (hormone panel), got weighed. Talked about stuff. Vitals and blood pressure. It's more of a clinic for gyno and another dr (forget the name rn)
  
  2nd - the ultrasound to see if I had cysts or whatever else going on. That one was more of a hospital setting.
  
  The doctor sent two cortisol test tubes. I haven't got the results from those yet.
  
  Yesterday -
  
  To go over all the results minus the cortisol lab since it wasn't ready. But she was basically saying it's pcos which isn't surprising given the fact that my sister was diagnosed with it in December and it can run in families. I've read that even guys can pass it on too. Also a lot of the females in our family have had problems with cysts, surgery to remove stuff etc
  
  You don't always get the cysts with it. Which i don't. My sister and I are basically the opposites in everything, including our symptoms.

   Well I can say I’ve had sleep paralysis myself but never saw any shadows while that was happening to me and always beaten it. In general tho yeah I’ve seen shadows etc but not during sleep. Weird things that’s for sure.

  It's only happened once so must have been all the construction going on.

  Nobody can dull my sparkle XD
  "
537516,"
   Yeah ok that’s fairly full on to be honest. They say it’s sleep paralysis but usually that shadow is on top of you in bed like holding you down type thing. Regardless they say that dark shadows are bad spirits etc so not sure that’s if you believe in all that stuff also :)

  It was probably about a foot away from me. It seemed more scared of me since it literally vanished into thin air. Then the spell was broken. It seemed like maybe a minute in total but really long. Idk. Was very freaky.

  ","
  I've shared a few times. I'll just go with seeing
  
  My dad was remodeling his childhood home, basically gutted it. Weird stuff happened.
  
  I was sleeping then i remember waking up in the night. Across the room there was a table with chairs. There was a dark shadow thing that was sitting there watching me. I ended up moving along the bed to get a better view. I thought it was my mom sitting there in the dark or something. I just felt paralyzed like i couldn't get any closer, stand up or make a sound. Meanwhile i could still see the shadow shape watching me. Then a calmness settled over me, the thing was gone. I ended up falling asleep again.
  
  I don't dream about monsters, shadows or anything so I know it happened. Was very creepy.

  Best
  
  - my 1stphorm products. I'm actually running low on multivitamins :/ Also I've won some products on IG so that has helped a lot since they can be pricy. They just came out with a vegan formula, that's pretty cool!
  
  - NYX sunny bronzer. I hit pan and I usually don't with products like that.
  
  - some powdered foundation from Sephora. It ended up breaking though since I was in a hurry when picking it up, fell and smashed :(
  
  - these shorts from Old Navy! I literally feel like I'm not wearing anything. They don't make me hot or anything even though they are more sweatpant like material
  
  Worst
  
  - I'm happy i tried Adoreme but I really should have ended up going for practical instead of more revealing set? It was around valentine's day so I was probably feeling some way. lol
  
  - A white shirt from Old Navy. I've only worn it once. I kept moving it in place because it's too big. It looked ok the day i wore it but I tried wearing it a few days ago and it was like no thanks! Too see through looking with just a bra under it and didn't feel like always pulling it up/down. I should have really tried it on in store.

It was scary but I totally understood where he was coming from and felt sad lol
  
  He also had a d!ck picture on his camera and one of the shop students basically made the rumor go around. I think he got into some kind of trouble but not much either? If it was me, I would have just deleted and maybe share how he should get rid of personal pictures next time if I felt brave enough lol he was one of my favorite teachers. He has a wife and kids. There's no way that he'd do something stupid. Also the kid in question shouldn't have looked at everything in the camera, it should have just been about the one they needed for whatever they were working on.

  She was eating ice cream in her husband's car and the seatbelt ended up getting chocolate on it. One of the la Croix waters ended up getting flipped upside down in the drink console. We had fudge and she fed him a piece and it ended up falling down his seat instead of in his mouth.

  ","
  Summer dresses are so cute! Haven't worn when younger though. They didn't really make a lot of jr plus size clothing growing up or if they did it was catered towards 50 year old ladies. No thank you. Luckily, they have more companies that cater to everyone. I'm way smaller than I used to be and more comfortable in my body. I'll probably get a dress from Old Navy soon.
  
  I also wear more shorts instead of capri length ones...
  
  Just because I feel comfortable in my body  (while still changing it) doesn't mean I'm comfortable with the camera.

  You have some problems if you think I'd ask an anon, no, anyone on here to do that. I'm not stupid. I'm also not interested in strangers like that. Chances are you aren't even in Arizona so you're wasting both of our time being a perv when I didn't mention being horny or anything else.

538208,"
   I hope your dream was amazing
  ","
  I mean the last one, my friend's mom called the cops on me. I guess I was staying over their house for a couple nights. I kept coming in at weird hours based on the sound of things. She was waiting up one night. I obviously apologized for the millionth time again to her. Like you could tell in the dream that I didn't know her number or else I would have called to say i was going to be late kind of thing. Also in the dream, my friend was still pregnant so I didn't want to wake her up by calling her too. Obviously these were reasonable to me but the mom wasn't having any of it. I went into the bedroom to go sleep but it was more like a tent setting?
  
  I basically hear her outside of my tent talking on the phone to cops. Apparently she went through my things. And this is the more odd part to me and hopefully not something that will come true... I had an insulin shot/needle in my bag. So she basically called them because of that. I'm basically explaining what it is and how i rarely drink and that i don't do drugs so why call the cops on me besides that I was coming in at odd hours? Like basically demanding a drug test to the cops to prove how I'm not a user.
  
  ~
  
  It was very bizarre. Like her mom is a nurse and should know what it was? I also remember making that statement to the cop in the dream and he was like indeed. lol. Like I'm pretty sure there's insulin resistance going on and I hope that i don't need to have a huge needle. I hate needles and I just don't picture myself injecting myself nor my mom doing it to me lol like i got a shot when younger due to mosquitoes and that's when the weight came on and I was just like omg what if it makes me balloon up again instead of helping my weightloss
  
  It was a pretty fucked up dream. Like her mom always liked me but yet calling the cops on me for literally nothing in the dream! Don't do me wrong, Rose.

   For those who get periods. Do you know when to wear a pad/tampon? Do get signs or it catches you by surprise?
  ","
  My last period was last June. Like my period is so irregular! Before that it was literally years between getting one. That's also why I went to the ER during the summer last year. Since it was so unexpected. They wouldn't let me do the clinic since abdominal bleeding so they made me go to the er lol And the male doctor was so hot. It was so awkward!
  
  The only things I noticed was sore boobs before that but since I didn't have it for years, I didn't think about it lol Also that day i got it, I was sitting at the picnic table and my stomach felt all crampy. I thought it was the way i was sitting or because I didn't eat much that day. Ate dinner, used the bathroom - found some spotting happening. Luckily mom found a store that was opened to get some pads. She also got a bunch of chocolate items 😂 They close stores really early in Maine.
  
  Wasn't sure what was up so went to the er the next day. They didn't do anything exactly.
  
  Also craving chocolate and ice cream afterwards was like ya... this is definitely just a period and not something serious going on lol
  "
538316,"

  I was hanging out with my friend Jessica and we ran into some of our other friends while walking. They were going into Boston. I didn't really want to go because I didn't know the friend's boyfriend who would actually be driving. Plus, I didn't have a cell phone back then to check with my mom. We were probably 13 and the guy was 16. Wouldn't surprise me if the car was stolen either. Melissa, one of the friends, had been drinking and didn't feel like going. Jessica ended up going to Boston with them.
  
  Melissa and I ended up hanging outside behind Ocean State Joblot on the loading dock area. She had a bottle of Bicardi with her. We ended up mixing it with the peach snapple tea. So good. Talked about a lot of things. Basically felt like I knew more about her. It was my first time drinking bicardi too. Another friend of ours ended up seeing us and we all hungout.
  
  It's happy for me since Melissa passed away in 2007. It's just a fond time with her.

   I get the germ aspect, especially in primary care offices, where people come in with all kinds of stuff coming outta their bodies eeyuck! The smell, too, I know. How did the doctor make you faint? Something they said, or something they did to your body?
  ","
  Something they said. When younger I'd always get sore throats/strep throat. So, I've ended up hating throat cultures. Like it was even in my chart saying that I was deathly afraid of them or whatever term they used. The guy read it and figured that nobody could be like that so he was all joking about giving me a million at once or however many 😂
  
  Next thing I know, I'm on the ground instead of on the table.
  
  And I had to go back like the next day where it was the same doctor again And he also had some medical students there. He was all too bad you didn't faint today on the behalf of the students. -_-
  
  HOW ARE YOU A DOCTOR!?

  The one I went to didn't really seem aware of all that. She was all ""up the exercise"" which I already do about 3-4x. Like that isn't my problem. My body comp is way different but yet still not where I should be. There's obviously problems going on that she just pushed away. She also said something else that was completely wrong too.

  Pretty much or other stuff. The doctor mentioned something else but I don't really see that since I only have 2 symptoms whereas with pcos there are more. Also my sister was diagnosed in December and it can be in families. There's also more family history with cysts, ovary surgery etc. I don't feel anything but I'll be getting my results the 21st. Did the blood work, the sonogram. Just got the saliva kit today. It's been a long process so far it seems lol I also hate doctors so that hasn't been fun either! It would explain a lot.

   Do you care about eating healthy food or do you eat whatever you want?
  ","
  Why is everyone freaking out? 😂
  
  Yes. I like eating healthy. It makes me feel better. I know what's in it. You can save money. Meal prep. Moderation is good when I feel like it. Basically intermittent fasting without putting a label on it. I'm not going to get bent out of shape if I eat something ""bad"" since the majority is healthy food. I'd rather have a healthy relationship with food instead of restricting everything. That could just lead to ED. I know what works for me. I probably get fast food once or twice a month? It's not the end of the world lol
  
  I also didn't eat lunch and it was around 6pm when we got it.
  
  One bad thing isn't going to undo everything.

  One day of eating fast food isn't going to kill me. Everything else i ate today has been healthy.
  
  It's only 522 calories from there... I could have done way worse, man. It did make the carbs go up and even gave me more protein. I don't really see the problem. I'm not constantly eating out.
  
  My protein intake is low but with my protein powder it will up my protein and actually bring the carbs down a tad. Win, win.

  Doctors appointment. I overacted lol I thought it was going to be more like a pap smear but 50x worse XD It did hurt a bit since my bladder was full so that didn't help. My mom and sister were waiting in the lobby and were surprised i was done already. I was pretty anxious today and also ""let's get it over with"" kind of mood. The lady seemed nice and made me feel calm?
  
  Went to Goodwill. I didn't find much there. I wanted a tank that said ""but first cardio"". I would have got it but hated the material it was made out of. Tried a black bathing suit on, didn't care how it looked. Tried a pair of pink leggings. They were a size small but they were wider than usual but they didn't like my upper thighs lol Didn't really see much else that I really liked or wanted.

   Do you feel in your hosehold vacation trips and special fun activities will be earned not a must
  ","
  Hi Shelly. I don't have any kids yet so it's kind of hard to say.
  
  If they are young then i feel like they really don't have a choice in the matter. I'd be fine with bringing one of their friends with them so they have some interaction with not just adults. It could be more fun for them. I would love going camping, day trips to the beach or whatever.
  
  I feel like teens or older ""kids"" can be more independent and make their own decision. They might already have plans. Do they really want to tag along all the time? That can get boring being with parents. They would probably take it for granted and want to be anywhere else.
  
  I noticed with
  
   @littlesha_
  
  that you got into school trips. That's completely different. Obviously the parents ultimately decide when writing the permission slip. Honestly, I'd let them go because I've always enjoyed my school trips. I could even be a chaperone if that's what I wanted to do. Why hold them back from a fun experience like museums and such? Most people don't go to them on the regular. It's kind of like a rite of passage type thing to me. I think going abroad and stuff like that would need more consideration, maturity level and everything else.

  I don't have a fear of guns so it's pretty strange when I do dream about that.

  ","
  There's a 10 year age gap between my brother and I. So I don't have that many childhood memories with him because I was still young when he went to college. Then he ended up living with our grandpa when he did come back. He was never there when you needed him type of thing. Like even my high school graduation, he ended up moving to Arizona that day. He doesn't really know me much. We get close and then at other times it's like all that work getting to know each other dies. He was also all ""i can't wait to see you"" type thing in December since he knew we were coming out here and I've probably seen him about 3 times since we've been here. I'm pretty sure most of my friends forget that i even have a brother lol
  
  My sister is 2 years older so we've basically done everything together type thing. She was pretty mean when younger. First haircut by her, made me put my finger into a socket. She has a ""license"" to hate me. Stood up for me with that bully. Let me hangout with her and friends at times. Our relationship has always been good. She kind of has a protective vibe with me in some cases. Wants the best for me. Supportive.

  You act like we always have the choice of when we get pregnant too. Like no, that shit happens on its own time. Some even need IVF and other stuff so it's quite rude to tell people that they need to get pregnant straight away. Some also can't have children so that's even more rude.

   Did you ever have a relationship that lasted for a long time and you were sure that was ""the one""? If so, how did you move on after it ended?
  ","
  Can't really give an answer. I still feel like he's a part of me. Helped make me a better person in ways. Showed me the kind of love that I've never felt with anyone else. Really got to know him. Never got tired or bored with the conversation. Never a dull moment. My other half basically.
  
  Anyways, songs and time does help. Like the song ""A little bit stronger"" By Sara Evans. The pain goes away. You want the best for them even if it's not with you. You get those moving on feelings. If you are looking back at texts or emails then delete that shit. Chances are you know what was said by heart and you don't need the psychical copies anymore. Do one thing a day you love. Even getting back out there straightaway could help depending on the person. Talking about it with trusted people. Honestly, I felt like a burden to others so I stayed quiet when I could have really used the company back then. Distance can help at times.
  
  Not sure what else to say. You should really focus on yourself for a bit. Every relationship helps give you a better understanding of what you truly want and need in a relationship.

   Why do women want a feminist matriarchal system and government put in place but at the same time want men to be chivalrous by giving them lifts home when they’re drunk, holding the door open for them, carrying their shopping and buying them their drinks?
  ","
  Chivalry is nice but I don't want it all the time. I can open doors on my own, car or otherwise.
  
  My sister's husband does that nonstop and it can be annoying lol. Like he even shuts the door too. I know he loves his jeep but still, it's odd at times. He'll even open and shut the door for me and it can make me feel awkward in the moment 😂
  
  I have hands, I can carry my own stuff with me. If they wanted to help at times, cool. Otherwise I'd feel a bit bad. Also most men don't want to be at the store/mall for a long time. I wouldn't want to be someone who makes them do things. Like when I went to Old Navy this lady was telling her husband not to move from that spot. He couldn't wait outside for her. He talked about how they been there all day. I felt so bad for the guy. She was being pretty bitchy too. Like he was a little kid or something.

  2011 is a blur. I don't remember much. I suppose that I was on the right track of finding myself again. I lost my humor and love for myself in general. I only remember that we went to Maine in the summer. I was probably adjusting to eating more food too? Being outside and doing all the summer things. Probably not writing creepy stuff on FB anymore. Somewhat more happy. Positive outlook.

   that's just more political correctness gone wrong there are people out there that insist that even little kids have to give consent to any decisions that involve them rather than the parents taking the decisions for them which is madness
  ","
  Like with schools? That would be nice in an ideal world but if the parents don't have the money for charter schools and whatever else then sucks for the kid who wanted to go. I've only been to public schools. I didn't have a choice in the matter. I went to whatever school was in that district.
  
  The only thing I really had a choice with school wise was going from a shitty jr high (bad neighborhood) to the vocational technical high school two towns away. It was completely my choice. I even ended up in a different shop than I planned  - my choice again.

  ","
  I'mnot a parent. I must have missed a conversation. ....
  
  Babies can't make decisions lol
  
  As far as little kids, I guess it depends in what way you mean. I think it's cute when kids want to pick out their own clothing for the day. It can help them embrace what they like later on in life.
  
  Food is a little iffy. You'd obviously want to get them stuff they like but maybe some new things they might not have tried before too. I'd much rather just cook one meal instead of a bunch of different ones. Obviously depends how picky the kid is too.
  
  I will say that the parents should be in charge, not the kids. This is actually one thing that my brother and sister-in-law have gone wrong with. They just can't say no to them when it comes to new toys. Like with the fidget spinner, they had one of them. They have two kids. The younger one wanted his own. We were going somewhere with them and on the way, they kept stopping at different stores to find one and they were all sold out. Like the kids both have their own tablets for long journeys, school work, other toys but you two gave in straight away and Kayson basically had a tantrum each time when the places were sold out.

  My sister, her husband and mom left with the dogs. I had to put my bra back on (I literally took it off a few minutes before that) and my shoes and socks on. I filled my water bottle. They weren't anywhere in sight. I ended up looking for them then being all ""fuck it"" and ended up walking my typical 5 miles. I got back and the house was locked. Mom let me in... nice to know that she had no idea I went out. Like I could have been taken 😂 It was dark and I didn't bring a flashlight with me.
  
  THEY LITERALLY JUST WENT AROUND THE BLOCK TWICE....
  
  I did 5 miles in the dark lol
  
  One of the streetlights ended up turning off when I was crossing the street to get back and it felt so spooky XD Like um.. thanks lol. Thankfully, I didn't run into any coyotes or rattle snakes.
  
  Went night swimming since I was so hot from the walk. It's still hot out, 89F  so it was probably still in the high 90s when I was walking. Fun.

  Camp Kiwanee in Massachusetts comes to mind. Some girl ended up hanging herself on her wedding day in the attic? It's rumored that you can see her figure looking out the windows, crying. Rocking chair moving and stuff. There's also a tunnel.. kind of like how trucks back up to unload items but there's no explanation for why one would be there. There's no area for a truck to get down there. It's basically on a hill overlooking the water. It's always locked. I think it's basically Indian land and a lot of other stuff happened there too.
  
  There's a hotel in Jerome, Arizona that is haunted. We tried sneaking into it but you need a key to unlock everything -_- Tour seems cool since you get all the ghost hunting gear, can stay overnight since it's a real hotel too. We didn't feel any vibes but we weren't on the right floors either so who knows. It's been on ghost hunting shows too.

  ","
  Yes. My dad was remodeling his childhood home when it was passed down to him.
  
  His mom had this table with Spanish tiles on it. He was taking the kitchen ceiling off and one of the tiles came down and landed right in his shirt pocket. He also had ballet shells roll towards him when there weren't any previously there.
  
  In one of my prom pictures there was a silhouette of a person behind me. Someone commented that they actually saw two people. Like you could see all the facial details then the rest of it was more outline/blurry. Out of all the pictures that was the only one that had something in it.
  
  We moved in when construction was happening. We lived in a three family before that so we were used to hearing noises at times. Mom and I were downstairs and we heard furniture moving. Like heavy stuff... The whole upstairs had nothing up there. Also heard footsteps like someone was going up or down the stairs. we noticed at the same time that it was obviously a ghost because nobody was up there, no furniture to be moved etc it was so freaky.
  
  My sister and her ex bf were there alone one day and they were going at it. Our grandpa hated him and I'm pretty sure the grandma wouldn't have approved because it was her old sewing room. The smoke detector in that room kept beeping. They also took the battery out and it was still going crazy. Like she said it was basically giving a code over and over again type beeps.
  
  I remember seeing a black shadowy form. I was sleeping, woke up then I saw it just sitting at the table. It was basically watching me. I sat up to get a better view. Then I felt weird like i couldn't move, couldn't say anything or scream. The whole time it was still there staring. Then I felt a calmness wash over me. The thing was gone and I ended up falling asleep again.
  
  Once the house was finished, everything stopped.

I don't have a personality disorder so getting bombarded with being a different person is really annoying. I'm also single and he keeps making up lies about how I'm seeing someone. I just reported everything he sent as harassment. He always talks about wanting to be friends yet YOU DON'T TREAT FRIENDS LIKE THIS.

  What ways are you thinking of then?
  
  My idea of the right person making me want to be married was shit to you.
  
  Love is probably laughable to you.
  
  Knowing how to cook/clean and other things is terrible, apparently.
  
  Like I'd want kids, the next step but that's not mature either?
  
  Sharing a house, name and all that is a no, no.
  
  I'd love to be with the person for years before marriage so I'd know that we'd be a good fit.
  
  Being well off in the money department would be nice.
  
  Either I'm not understanding everything or you are being a d!ck over literally nothing. Why is any of this even a concern for you?
  
  Are you married? What makes you mature?
  "
540476,"
   you cutie ! :P
  ","
  lol aw
  "
540477,"
   You've gone on a bit of a tangent. The original question was about your own personal maturity with respect to marriage. I didn't ask about sex, or living together with someone, or anything else. You said you are mature enough to marry, and I wondered how your maturity in this sense has been tested.
  ","
  I took it the ways you just mentioned.
  
  It's funny since people think I'm mad now 😂
  
  Can it ever really be tested? I guess it's just the next phase of life. I'm single right now so marriage isn't really on my mind. I didn't say that I'm ready at the moment but would be nice in a few years, hopefully.

  ","
  How would intelligence even fit into the last question asked? It's about relationships not intelligence. Also I don't think sexual things with past relationships = maturity either. You can be very mature without having a bunch of experience as well. Living with men also doesn't tell you how mature a person is either.
  "
540482,"

  "
540484,"
   Maturity is about you, not about ""the right person"".
  ","
  I was talking about the marriage part. I wouldn't want to be married to just anyone. I'd want someone who would want the same ideals.
  
  I'm pretty mature. I know a lot about myself. Strengths, weaknesses. I might not always come off that way since tolerating sex questions and stuff like that can be pretty immature in ways? I just don't care. I'm not hurting myself or anyone else. I'm mature enough to make my own decisions.
  
  Wouldn't maturity be for BOTH of us? I wouldn't want someone who had no idea of their self awareness. Marriage isn't a one way street. I wouldn't make the decision lightly. I want that grow old together kind of marriage. I also wouldn't want kids with any random person either.
  "
540485,"
   One definition of maturity is to understand yourself well. A lack of maturity contributes to marriage failure since immature people don't know themselves well enough to adapt to marriage or to life with another person. Do you think you're mature enough to be married? Why do you think so?
  ","

   Hypothetical question ( stolen from somewhere, to be interpreted however you like), if you were going to ban either hard drugs, as in recreational use or guns - other than those used on animals- , which would you ban?  Or neither?
  ","
  I see nothing wrong with recreational use. But if you are doing hard drugs 24/7 then I could see the problem there.
  
  Honestly, I don't think a ban would help drug use or gun use.
  
  They obviously have the gun and will use at will. They can find the drugs or make it themselves if they were smart enough.

  This guy ended up messaging me elsewhere that his gf wanted him to write a sexual story for her. Apparently, he doesn't show all his feelings? Anyways, he wrote it and wanted my opinion on it 😂 So, I read it and gave a few better ways to write certain parts of it. He didn't do too bad. Got better in the  middle /end. Lots of run on sentences but I didn't feel like changing too much for him lol just when I felt the flow would be better.

  Subway or Starbucks then. I think I'd go with Starbucks because it seems like i could try more healthy items instead of just getting tired of subs from Subway. Again, my order doesn't change much. I'd also want to limit the carbs from bread as best as possible.

  We have the brand Bragg and omg that stuff smells so strong. There's no way I'd want it in my body. I just can't get over the smell. I think it could probably mess up your body?

   Tips on how to lose weight ?
  ","
  This is  obviously in general  because I don't know what you look like, size, or anything  else. So disregard if certain things don't apply to you lol
  
  It won't happen overnight.
  
  I believe in moderation so I might have something unhealthy at times. It also helps me not crave bad stuff. Healthy balance. If it fits my macros, even better. Try not to let it get to you. One day won't mess everything up, ya know? One day at a time.
  
  Drinking water helps loads.
  
  There's a formula that tells you how many calories you should consume. I don't remember it off of my head. That is nice to know and to see if you are eating more or less  than that *limit*
  
  Limit carb intake. I'm not saying join keto or anything. Maybe track what you eat for a full week and see how you feel then try limiting  the number a tiny bit. Keto can make people sick since they lower it too low etc Focus more on eating protien and healthy fats. Look into  tracking macros (fat, protein, carbs) if you  don't feel like looking at calories.
  
  Meal prepping is pretty great to do. You don't really have to think about food, just grab and go. Especially good if you have an office job and access to a microwave instead of spending a bunch of money on office food.
  
  Take a walk, run, swim, bike, use your body weight if you don't have access to weights or a gym. Little things will add up.
  
  Join a class. Do something new.
  
  Limit alcohol or soda. Or even find a lower calorie one if that's the problem. Personally, I don't like drinking my calories, I'd rather have the food lol. I like water and tea.
  
  You might want to see your doctor or dietician if you don't have a good relationship with food or possible medical conditions that could be making you *bigger*

  I can't imagine doing that to someone. I'd actually want that type of love where both are in the picture.

  Ok? But I don't need to watch a video on it. I've been around too many people who do smoke. Why be another statistic? Why go around smelling? I didn't bring a hoodie with me because it absolutely reeked. They are the kind of smoker who literally lights up every minute. Most smoke to get rid of their problems, my life isn't that bad. I don't have any health problems that would benefit getting high. Like I know people who even grow it. I could get some if I really wanted to.
  
  It's just not my thing. I don't care if other people smoke. Do what is best for you. It's obviously way better than doing harder drugs. I don't need drugs to go on adventures. I don't need something that doesn't last or makes me question myself or behaviors.
