And i take most of blame for the downs because i clearly took everything you said the wrong way. You are still capable of understanding things very well, i wish i was better at explaining them because it seems like you are very curious about other lifestyles. You really are a super nice person, and you are open minded to learning new things which a lot of people arent anymore. I also like the questions you have, they are really thought out and interesting ?\n  ","628695":"\n  I wish i knew you so i had lots to say about you. You are very attractive (assuming thats you in the dp) and you kind of have an interesting look to you.

I was in psychological pain, there was something subconsciously hurting me. I learned that no matter how hard i tried to make myself look like i was confident, i hated myself down to every single cell of my body. And i needed to learn to love myself, because if i dont love myself - how could someone else. I learned that i have a beautiful imagination, that i can feel things deeper than most people and im a lot stronger than i ever believed. I learned that i was capable of so much more than i was giving, i had potential to offer this world. I learned that those who called me worthless were intimidated by me and were making sure to bring me down to their level, so i wasnt becoming the person i should be.\n  ","628724":"\n  Yeah, while i was on shrooms.

I have two older siblings, which made growing up super fun for me. I had a nanny till i was 4 years old, and because of her i met my best friend because my nanny was their maids best friend so she would bring me over and thats how our lifetime friendship has started! I sadly didnt have a mom really, she stopped being a parent to all of us. My dad was never around, he was constantly working. Luckily, i had my brother and sister who always were there, and my neighbors who all had kids the same age as me.\n  \n  I went to a school that was filled with millionaires\/billionaires. A lot of my friends had a tough time fitting in, either they werent wearing oufits worth $500 everyday or they were just kinda weird but for me i was pretty much accepted by everyone and because of that i was friends with everybody. Ive always been that really shy kid who just happened to be super adorable. School was easy for me, which lead me to just not try and slack off all the time. I didnt find out till later that i was actually considered popular lol.\n  \n  My home life was hard tho. My brother was my best friend but my dad thought i was stupid because i wasnt trying that hard in school. I was just getting by, and my teachers always told him im super smart, i just rather talk to other students.\n  \n  I remember my first bf was a model and in commercials. We were in 4th grade but i actually went to his house and shit haha\n  \n  High school for me was a journey of heart break, depression, and partying\/drugs. Nothing about high school was really easy, except my grades. But i was way too focused on doing drugs and hanging out with friends and scoring the hottest guy at school. Graduating high school was the most shocking thing for everyone i grew up with, because i was just the definition of REBEL.\n  \n  When i got my first job, it was the best experience ever. Granted i only got hired because \"i was insanely beautiful\" but it ended up being the best time of my life.\n  ","628757":"\n  2\n  ","628758":"\n  I was just thinking about all my fav movies as a little kid and if you dont like any of these, we have a problem.\n  \n  \u2022 Grease\n  \n  \u2022 Gone in 60 seconds\n  \n  \u2022 Titanic\n  \n  \u2022 Silence of the Lambs\n  \n  \u2022 Blade\n  \n  \u2022 Swordfish\n  \n  \u2022 The Sixth Sense\n  \n  \u2022 Pulp Fiction\n  \n  \u2022 Jurassic Park\n  \n  \u2022 Fight Club\n  \n  \u2022 Matrix\n  \n  \u2022 The Big Lebowski\n  ","628759":"\n  I don't like traditions honestly\n  ","628760":"\n  I need to make myself food lol\n  ","628761":"\n  I DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT WHEN I COME OUT OF WATER I LOOK LIKE\n  ","628762":"\n  That's what I do ?\n  ","628763":"\n  I tend to give too many chances ?\n  ","628764":"\n  I feel like people don't like gifs as much as I do lol\n  ","628765":"\n  I love yoooooouuuu?\n  ","628766":"\n  LOVE YOU SO MUCH\n  ","628767":"\n  I'm just gonna post some of my favorite girls on here\n  \n\n   @hateuandurbrows\n  \n\n   @JessicaStonebridge\n  \n\n   @littlekri\n  \n\n   @CelineM96\n  \n\n   @ImDaraAndNerdy\n  \n\n   @emsemsboo\n  \n\n   @oxjadeee658\n  \n\n   @maheen70\n  \n\n   @NicoleBuckleyyx\n  \n\n   @kattandy\n  \n\n   @sammanthaclassyy\n  \n\n   @anya4ya\n  \n\n   @ayeshaakhter\n  \n\n   @BeccyOfficial\n  \n\n   @Serenityjomallett\n  \n\n   @Stophate26\n  \n\n   @sf10154\n  \n\n   @Aayeshaw\n  \n\n   @actress_kellik\n  \n\n   @chelsmatthewss\n  \n\n   @poetalunam\n  \n\n   @DjentJunkiee666\n  \n\n   @NineGDxFour\n  \n\n   @elliecheers45\n  \n\n   @ManicMartyrdom\n  \n\n   @ItsKendrahhh\n  \n\n   @fabbielousxo\n  \n\n   @maddiegav27\n  \n\n   @littletrust\n  \n\n   @iamkira98\n  \n\n   @EbonyRamus\n  \n\n   @LeanneRoseB19\n  \n\n   @bebelevine7\n  \n\n   @HannahViolet19\n  \n\n  I feel like I forgot some and I'm sorryyy\n  ","628768":"\n  Before bed - listen to music\n  \n  When i wake up - check what time it is\n  ","628769":"\n  Can we bathe in glitter after\n  ","628770":"\n  Awh thank you so much ?? but I think shes better\n  ","628771":"\n  Pitch perfect 2\n  ","628772":"\n  Omg you understand.
