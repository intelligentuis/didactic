  over streesed; under paid. I can't be two places at once. I am getting ""Needs Meet""; not teaching the children anything. I need to be in an environment where I can teach; I am a professional Teacher, not just a babysitter. When I got hired; the director told me it was low numbers and staff all gets along- LIES. I don't associate well with Liars. I try to avoid it like the plague.

  The gas lighting that you’re trying to pull on me right now sounds like you just got done sucking Trump’s dick. I don’t have to explain myself anymore about this subject cuz I’m done trying to talk to a wall.
  "
302605,"
   Come off educated you came off a complete fool who thinks the feds are on him for posting a mitt Romney picture on YouTube. Nothing you said made me rethink anything on any of these topics.. sounds like half of it you did some vague research on biased outlets and the other half you believe the news
  ","
  First off, I’m not a man, second off I didn’t personally leak the photo, I’m just saying I listen to my family more than any other bullshit that’s going around because they’re educated.
  "
302606,"
   Well it doesn't seem like you're too informed on global politics to understand why he hasn't brought the troops back.. the real topics been brought up very vaguely and the ones who do bring it up are silenced or fired. But he has brought some back and is pulling out of Afghanistan finally.
  ","
  I know, they’re fighting over oil bullshit, but it still isn’t fair.
  "
302607,"
   Thats great you ""ruined"" a presidential candidates career, that doesn't really solidify anything for the government hating your family.. if anything just republicans.. all the big industries favor Dems anyways. The real people doing the real work exposing things fled the country or are in prison..
  ","
  My family is made up of Republicans like I said I don’t go for either side
  "
302608,"
   You're trying to come off as some huge whistle-blower. You aren't it seems. You keep citing youtube even though its heavily monitored and anything disproving trump allegations or other things is removed quickly or hidden
  ","
  No, I’m trying to come off as educated, to bad you don’t know how to read right.
  "
302609,"
   No you claimed to leak pictures of mitt Romney. And that you called the fbi or something. Point is, what significance does that hold?
  ","
  My family leaked them, I was like 13-14 when they did, but I had nothing to do with that.
  "
302610,"
   How am I avoiding the issue? You're bringing up hillary and Romney to brag it seems like
  ","
  I’m clarifying why my family is the most hated. You didn’t believe that, but it’s whatever.
  "
302611,"
   If youre a man of God. This LGBTQ thing is out of hand and quite frankly bizarre.
  ","
  I love women, and he seems to have a stick shoved up his ass rather than face real issues. Like why hasn’t he brought the troops home yet? Also why are so many women being raped on base? I could go on for years dude
  "
302612,"
   Yeah for epstein not trump.
  ","
  I’m talking about both of them together, but let’s keep playing “avoid the issue” cuz why not?
  "
302613,"
   What does that have to do with anything. You didn't leak anything on the emails. The person who did is still in prison.. just do your research on this stuff
  ","
  I didn’t say I leaked anything, I’m saying that the media didn’t “do its job” trying to make me support her twisted ass.
  "
302614,"
   You exposed nothing on them. You repeated what the news told you. Watching YouTube conspiracies that hold no concrete evidence doesn't make you a pro
  ","
  Actually, I personally called the FBI out for not looking into Hillary enough for the emails as for Trump, it was mainly his anti LGBQT+ agenda he has.
  "
302615,"
   Yeah I'm sure your family is, I'm calling your bluff on that based off what youre saying in this thread alone. Stop speaking for your family and just showthe evidence behind your claims if you want me to believe you
  ","
  We ruined Mitt Romney’s career with a single photo, my parents got blocked on Facebook by several politicians because of how much they were exposing the government while boosting veterans benefits. But go off.
  "
302616,"
   Like I said there's only a party picture of him and his wife because they did property deals. Epsteins cover was real-estate so its only natural he works with big names to ensure his cover.. And no it doesn't make it top three or even top 5, how old are you if I may ask?
  ","
  I’m 22, and it’s not only a party picture, you’re just trying to cover for the fact that you’re supporting a rapist.
  "
302617,"
   History will lie and tell you democrats didn't start the KKK also.. but they did that..
  ","
  Also I am not a democrat, I’m undecided, I just go where the facts lead me, and do you honestly think I would vote for Hillary? I’m not saying I voted for Trump either, I just exposed the shit out of the both of them. I still voted just not for either of them.
  "
302618,"
   What connection other than a picture from the early 2000s does trump have to epstein? Dont say flight logs because that's not true either.
  ","
  Several videos, go look it up on YouTube.
  "
302619,"
   They weren't debunked they where covered up by whatever media you refer to for answers because their is video of it.. do you do any research for your initial research? In response to bidens KKK friend
  ","
  My family is one of the most hated families for exposing any and all government secrets, so if it wasn’t true, we would know.
  "
302620,"
   I wish you where right but china is still getting away with it so it doesn't matter about social media, if awareness is brought and no action is done its pointless then. Biden called trump racist for closing china's flights during a pandemic, during a time we didnt know the sereveness of it
  ","
  Honestly, everyone was shutting it down, I think that just had to do with the supply issue cuz we get a lot of stuff from China.
  "
302621,"
   The picture of trump his wife and epstein are at a party because he had a business deal for some property.. Didnt biden say rape victims deserve to be believed? Then he gets called out and there is little coverage for some days
  ","
  No, it wasn’t proved, also, he’s in Epstein’s little black book, and he was even in his flight log, he was even recording dancing at a party, hugging Epstein on several different occasions, etc.
  "
302622,"
   Spanish flu killed an estimated 100 million..
  ","
  So that makes it in the top 3
  "
302623,"
   Well your step dad should look harder because he would find that Joe Biden has ties to actual KKK members in 70s. Thats factual he spoke at ones funeral..
  ","
  Well he’s not about to choose someone who has ties to a child sex trafficking ring, and multiple rape allegations/pay offs to minors. Also those claims about that whole thing was debunked a while ago.
  "
302624,"
   Thats besides the point though. We have facts in our faces, doctors being covered up and silenced, with GAG ORDERS, Think about that for a second.. we have been scared into thinking it IS a plague
  ","
  Well the fact that China did want to hide it, but due to their laws there it was expected because they’re extremely strict about that stuff. That one was actually not Trumps fault for once cuz they got a whole massacre of Muslims happening over there, that they’re trying to hide, and they just can’t get away with nothing now that the people are educated & have access to social media.
  "
302625,"
   And wrong.. biden passed a bill he helped right in fact.. to make it so that African Americans are more likely to be arrested and he made tons of money off of it with private prisons, even Kamala, his running mate called him out for this in previous debates. Now theyre best friends. And I'm the fool
  ","
  I’m not wrong, I watched it, got educated on it, and my stepdad who is African American who is very known to expose anything like that wouldn’t have approved of it.
  "
302626,"
   Oh and who told you this was the worst thing next to the plague, Its far from the plague.. the news did its job in scaring you. This is a flu and it was altered in a lab. Proven by Hong Kong scientists.. research it..
  ","
  Name one flu that killed 200,00 people
  "
302627,"
   Also his disinfectant thing was a joke. The CDC says you have a 98 percent recovery rate from the virus. Its time to open up. This is a trial run for socialism. Look at history
  ","
  This is the worst thing next to the plague, and usually by now we have a vaccine, and yes ik he made one, but since he didn’t listen to scientific evidence & the doctors told him that it wasn’t safe yet, patient zero has died from an even worse disease that was in the vaccine.
  "
302628,"
   Joe biden has rape allegations too. Whats your point?
  ","
  Actually, those were withdrawn & was from one person who admitted to lying. Your president has recorded proof alongside him hanging out with Epstein.
  "
302629,"
   Obama made those cages at the border and used them more than he did, Trump used them because a caravan traveling for months on end was trying to enter America Illegally and they where processed there. I agree some of it is a mess with the missing children its terrible, and ICEs fault. Not trumps
  ","
  Actually, it was proven that Obama didn’t put those cages there. They’ve actually been using abandoned prisons, that were emptied by Obama. You’ve been very misinformed.
  "
302630,"
   You're right because when Joe was in office he passed bills to make African Americans more likely to be arrested than any other race, also the evidence of his business deals in Ukraine are Damning and speak for themselves but you won't find any of that on traditional news because they favor biden
  ","
  Last time I checked he helped a bill to get African Americans out of prison for crimes they were wrongly detained for, and there was literally nothing found in any type of search they did, but didn’t your president just get caught by the president of the Ukraine for trying to bribe him to “help” Trump win again?
  "
302631,"
   Well he didn't avoid every question he's asked
  ","
  Joe answered honestly to every single one, including the shit allegations that Trump tried to make about him & his son. Trump however just spewed absolutely bafoonary the entire time.
  "
302632,"
   Shoutout to sleepy joe dodging all the allegations and questions once again. When are the American people going to see that we've been fooled by the media to hate
  ","
  Your president is locking Mexicans in cages, forcing the women to take out their reproductive organs, and are separating children from their parents to the point where 542 children cannot find their parents. Not only that, he allowed North Dakota to put a pipeline down that bursted & ruined the sacred grounds, and he has real allegations towards him from aging from 10 years old to women in their 50s. Oh, and he told you to drink bleach, take a drug that wasn’t regulated by the FDA, and killed over 200,000 people due to him not listening to scientists, so they could find a cure, and it literally took an 8th grader for him to actually listen to science. Shoutout to Joe Biden because at least when he was in office, shit like this, didn’t happen.

  What you need is a spiritual getaway. Which is basically where you have no electronics, you just go to like a remote place with people that only build you up, and you just break free from the world a bit. Also, if you’re having sexual relations of any kind, the person you might be laying with, might be feeling the same exact way because sex is really just an energy release onto who ever you have it with. Maybe that person isn’t opening up about their pain and is just rubbing their energy off onto you.

   Do you think consciousness is simply a manifestation of atomic and evolutionary processes peculiar to organisms with highly developed nervous systems? or perhaps it's an emergent property of higher dimension or something else? what's your take on this subject? please be specific.
  ","
  Well honestly the nervous system itself is very complex, but I feel like it has nothing to do with consciousness at all because of the fact that the nervous system wouldn’t be able to react the way it does without the chemical reactions in your brain that gets the messages through your body. I mean, basic anatomy is very big on the whole idea of the nervous system, but really without the emotional (chemical) reactions happening the heart wouldn’t know how to beat and therefore the nervous system wouldn’t know how to make everything go if that makes sense.

   If you played the bad girl in a film and in your scene a woman said she wants your boyfriend and belongs under him. So you watched your boyfriend (who you adored) beat her in a fight and stand with one foot on her face! What would you say to her as you looked down at her to mock her..?

   Could an annexation, invasion, conquest, or colonization of a land or a region by a certain empire ever be justified if there were already indigenous people living there? What about purchasing the land through diplomacy, would that be justifiable?
  ","
  Well I believe what you’re talking about is America in general. But the whole purchasing land through diplomacy is ok in some cases like Alaska. Us Natives had to fight off the Russians and beg for America to buy the land in the short period of time that the Russians were recollecting themselves. I believe that was a good move on America’s behalf
