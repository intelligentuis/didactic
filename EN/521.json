decade no one believed me . they have figured out that our dna has a marker or a stamp . like , when you buy something and theres an engraving on the bottom of who made it or where its from ya we all have that on our dna . they never understood what it meant till recently , since they figured out that of our dna is considered unidentifiable exterrestrial dna that the little stamp on everybody s dna is most likely the signature of the creator . the only issue is they still havent figured out what exactly it stands for since its considered alien . they are releasing a lot of the scientific proof for this since the evidence is irrefutable .","482011":"i feel like in order to love , you have to trust . you have to be vulnerable to be able to love someone else and that means putting your

only ever comes out of love . when you dont care about someone , you dont care what they do so its hard to be disappointed .","482015":"no , im not practicing witchcraft . theres a lot of information

it was just a chill way to start the new year ! ! hows your new years ! ?","482101":"i love you so much darren . this made me feel so good ! ! thank you so much","482102":"you must be straight danger","482103":"actually , you are not gonna like what im gonna say and its probably not gonna make sense to a lot of people . i watched a documentary about someone else kinda saying the same thing but its not exactly nothing . many many scientists are starting to discover the truth in this its because our universe has infinite amount of layers and whenever the sun finishes its star cycle is burns up everything and everyone but because of the layers the universe is capable of restarting an infinite amount of times unless we create a massive hole in just one of the layers then we will be completely and utterly destroyed forever . no coming back from that . nuclear bombs can create that hole .","482104":"its not a lie when people say when you dress really well , you hold yourself up better . you walk with confidence . it makes you feel good . i ve had people never understand why i put a lot of effort into my outfits or i just randomly dress up until i forced them to dress up with me their body language changed . they stood with such confidence . clothes make a huge difference . thats why in the business world , attire is very important .","482105":"thank you so much ! there s something dangerous about someone who s beautiful and smart . so you just said im dangerous","482106":"so wild right ?","482107":"oh god no . you cant trust the chemicals they put in our water . . .","482108":"ive always wanted to be an engineer because ive always wanted to be an inventor .","482109":"omggggg thank you","482110":"i love the smell of rain but i love the way snow makes everything look","482111":"im currently really into pesto with roasted bell peppers , cherry tomatoes , feta . its so fresh and delicious","482112":"the explanation for our existence is much more complex and extremely scientific physics that people cant really understand right now . as a society , we truly havent expanded our minds enough yet to understand . you know what , who knows if its even a positive thing too . . . we might not even want to know the truth . the only person that got truly close to understanding where we come from was stephen hawking . he believed in some pretty awesome theories . big alien believer because he actually proved the probability . you literally cant argue with math . lol . anyways , ive always believed that there s something greater than us we just dont know the truth .","482113":"holy hell yes i would . they are the sexiest women alive i swear . it would be an honor","482114":"tell me about your dream ? ! i wanna know all about it","482115":"uhmmmmm ya . . .","482116":"why iowa ?","482117":"awh , you really think so ?","482118":"i am actually feeling really good this morning","482119":"i have met a ton a famous people , i grew up in a super elitist area of san diego . now i havent met that many like celebrities though . . well wait ive met people in all different realms of fame . ive met a lot of famous nba nfl players or coaches . heres just a few that most people would probably know steve kerr coach of golden state warriors jesse buss owner of the lakers peyton manning his fam dave mustaine megadeath warren buffett th wealthiest person in the world victoria weick beverly hills jewelry , and jewelry tv scripps family owner of the best marine biology hospitals","482120":"not anyone from ask , at least not that i know of unless someone was anonymous and then pretended to not know me in person and become my friend idk","482121":"i would turn myself into a full blown lesbian if lana del rey said she was in love with me and wanted to be with me forever . no joke . i love her so much","482122":"i never said it came from nothing , i said that we aren t capable of comprehending where everything comes from .","482123":"instead of telling me i lack proof , why dont you explain your evidence ? where s your proof or logic ? i am not worried about afterlife because i am secure in myself . regardless of what comes after , if i am a good person in life who the fuck cares about after ? i am enjoying life because thats what we should do . we should choose to live . not live in fear . why dont you try and convince me that i am wrong ? i also sound extremely logical darling . if we going by the definition of logic religion isn t very logical .","482124":"im boring but im a huge fan of water","482125":"the proof that death is like that is the lack of proof that death isnt like that .","482126":"it was awhile ago . i vaguely remember it now . i have no idea where the location is either . i couldnt recognize it at all . there was a group of guys like getting in a fight and it was getting pretty gruesome so i was trying to stop it but i couldn t .","482127":"the movie made me laugh . i saw that when i was little i remember laughing so hard . i even looked at my brother in full confidence and said , thats not even remotely accurate kinda freaked my brother out cause like when i say i was young i mean i was ish when i watched it .","482128":"ya i cant watch those cause i literally just explained how it literally feels like i am being burned alive like it triggers something in my brain , like its happened to me before .","482129":"i dont drink soda .","482130":"no , not really i wish","482131":"i saw way more than that . it was like i was there but they couldnt see me . . . like i was some outer body looking in . i just remember trying to warn them but they couldnt hear me . it was like i was a ghost in my dream . so wild .","482132":"food . always food .","482133":"why do you need to know what happens after you die , you re gonna be dead ? do you remember what it was like before you born ? death is gonna be like that . also , it can go both ways . theres a lot of people who do bad shit because of religious beliefs . if you are just a decent person , you wont have any issues of death . the reason so many people are worried about what comes after is because of regret . i logically don t understand why we are so concerned about afterlife and not focused on this life and trying to make the most of it when we dont have any proof of what actually happens when we die . zero proof . people fear death when its a huge part of life . death restores the energy in our universe . stop living in fear .","482134":"im a little too hopeful sometimes . . like annoyingly hopeful . i somehow have a lot of faith in myself so that creates a lot of hope . sometimes it can be unrealistic though","482135":"thank you i am so happy you understand .","482136":"god isn t expecting shit from us cause you know logically it would be a god who would be all powerful . its idiotic to think god would need anything from us . you can make wise decisions without needing to accept a god , just be a good fucking person . is that so hard ? if you just believe in something beyond yourself , thats all you need . we . arent . smart . enough . to . actually . comprehend . god . kinda the whole point cause you know , its a god or gods . who the fuck actually knows . just live your life with passion . ricky gervias honestly says it perfectly . https youtu

? it just seems terrible . maybe i was a witch or something in my past lives cause ya it literally hurts to watch it .","482142":"truth","482143":"not a movie but certain scenes . i get panic attacks when i see someone get burned alive or drowning . i cant handle it . like i can feel it in my stomach , like as if its happening to me .","482144":"pm","482145":"a clusterfuck of confusion","482146":"awh , you didnt bring up any bad memories . but thank you for being considerate","482147":"yes thank you ! ! hows work going for you ?","482148":"that makes a lot of sense . when

completely honest , i don t really understand . where is this fixation coming from ? what is it about me that draws people towards me like a moth to a light ?","482228":"i can understand that but i actually accomplished everything i needed to accomplish this year . december is a hard time of the year for me because my biological mom died on christmas day in . ever since then , its always been a hard month for me .","482229":"actually yes . i am so curious . obviously i would be one of those privileged people who would hire like special individuals in those areas to guide me around so i dont do anything stupid ! i used to chat with the most traveled man in the world there isnt a spot on this earth he hasnt been . he told me theres great people everywhere you go . just be careful but also

ive made that my strength because it really makes people go whoa when you pay attention to the little things .","482239":"we all have magic inside of us","482240":"dude , i swear everything is better while stoned . especially on here because your mind is more open so ive noticed my answers will be better when im stoned but also all the dumb things people say are just pure comedy relief","482241":"i think i am going to meditate this morning as the sun rises","482242":"omfg stoppp it","482243":"i think if you really really tried hard enough like for example google , you d

someone .","482322":"right ? the arrogance","482323":"wait are you serious ? where did you read this ?","482324":"i am watching so many shows right now lillyhammer if you like nordic mafia humor into the badlands if you like mma comic book type entertainment my favorite out of all of the the magicians if you like magic and an easy but entertaining storyline","482325":"hahahah oh boy i was called the wild child","482326":"omg i would love you forever if you got me groceries omfg","482327":"i stopped caring as much i took it way too seriously before and i realized it wasn t

you","482330":"you just sound extremely insensitive .","482331":"to some people doing your best still means having to wake up and deal with this excruciating pain inside of them . also , maybe they are doing their best ? have you ever thought of that ? maybe their best isnt working for them and they are exhausted ? doing your best still requires doing mundane activities everyday , requires stress management , and having to accept failure and pain . some people are just tired of doing their best and it never feels good enough . for you it might be simple , but i promise you for them dying is simpler .","482332":"when you say life really isnt that bad thats your perception of life that you are trying to make others understand . so its about you . you re not thinking of others when you say things like that , theres zero empathy for those who struggle and experience a deep pain . instead of telling people life isn t bad , you should view that as your strength and be a rock for those who dont feel the same about life . show them life isnt bad with your kindness .","482333":"hahahhahahahhaha im so happy you got it oh really hmm . . . what kind of food do you suggest for kitties and like something healthy ?","482334":"maybe life for you isnt that bad . but not everything is about you . you can t compare yourself to everyone else . the only thing you can focus on is doing your best . everyones pain is valid . something that happened to you could effect someone else in a completely different way . we all perceive life in such different ways .","482335":"i haven t really seen any posts of that nature on here , i don t really think you can really talk about that subject . . but since we are . . . . lets discuss why people are uicidal . they believe everyone around them and the world in general would be better off without them . or life just isnt bearable , it almost seems pointless . some peoples suffering is greater than others . or extreme version they have information that cant be shared so they have orders to take their own life . people who experience uicidal thoughts aren t able to just changed their mindset in that way , if they were able too uicidal wouldn t happen . people think suicide is selfish but i think its selfish to force someone to be alive when they are in so much pain just because we don t understand what they are going through and we dont want to go through the pain of losing someone . we should try to be there to support these people and not just tell them do your best its so much deeper than that .","482336":"yay

watched a documentary about it lol","482361":"well considering most of us are growing up in a self absorbed selfish society it makes it hard not to have some narcissism . i can be narcissistic to a

would love to be a filmmaker to be able to create what i see in my head and share it . to have other people view it just so they can tell me what they ve perceived from it would be one of the most

issues others are projecting on to others that they have to deal with but your support still means the world to me .","482622":"this is brilliant !","482623":"literally anyone who s actually intelligent or wise usually over the age will tell you exactly that , would actually recommend it .","482624":"i actually saved enough money from working jobs for years but my parents are like no you

believed for a long long time that there s several soulmates and it doesnt only mean relationship wise . i believe soulmates literally means your soul connected with another soul in someway . i have friends that understand that our friendship is because our souls are just connected somehow . but i also have a darker belief where i dont think everyone is lucky enough to possess a soul to have a soulmate . just like how in video games theres computer generated characters , in my life i have been around people who literally feel like they are just npcs . have you ever met someone who just says the same shit over and over almost like they only have three types of responses ? i have . its terrifying .","482637":"how is all your work going ? !","482638":"its a comedy about zombies . its

of obsession . is this a controlled obsession or an impulsive obsession ?","482700":"well , my house had a lot of bedrooms so my dad thought it was a good time for me to move rooms we just kept that room as a guest room that nobody used so eventually i turned it into a bunny room .","482701":"hey","482702":"yes i do . i will tell you about the time when i was years old . i was laying bed but my back was towards the door and i was facing the wall . i had the hall light on which was shining on the wall . i remember it being around . well a shadow of some sort starts to form up behind me then i see an arm rise over me with a knife in its hand . i quickly turn around and theres nothing there but a knife on the ground . i ran and screamed for my dad and he didn t believe me until he saw the

believing in organized religion . ive always believed that there was something greater , but my parents didnt teach us what to believe in they wanted us to decide that for ourselves . i came to the conclusion that we are nowhere intelligent to actually know or comprehend what is beyond us .","482715":"how is your beautiful day ?","482716":"i would love to be the one that gets to come up with

i practiced by getting a piece of paper and a rubber band . at the top you fold the paper really thick then wrap the rubber band around it , you do it until you created the muscle memory of how to hold the chopsticks . then its pretty easy after that , it takes practice and it honestly helps using chopsticks with everything to get good at it . like salad or pasta .","482740":"im so glad that

recently learned about sabbatical witchcraft occult grimoires from knights templar because they follow after baphomet a demon also learned that astroth is the first male demon recorded ever in history because actually he was created after a female . just think about that one for a second . then i read that they say most serpents will come as women thats why these demons all have the gift to show

generous even in the moments i have nothing . whenever someone saw something of mine and was like omg i love it my response is do you want it ? without hesitation . i have an issue of blindly being generous sometimes . like whenever someone has stolen money from me , my response is always , they must have needed it more than i do if they needed to steal it so ill think of it as a gift and i move
