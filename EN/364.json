COVID is real, it has k*lled hundreds of thousands of people, and more have been infected who haven't d*ed. i know dozens of people who have been infected with it and recovered, and i also know of people who have passed away from it.\n  ","390575":"\n  maybe? lmaoo. i've never exactly analyzed my ankles before in that respect.\n  ","390576":"\n  i agree. also, looking at a screen for too long hurts my eyes, so i can't envision myself sitting down with a tablet and reading a book electronically for hours at a time.\n  ","390577":"\n  it was completely empty (probably should have mentioned that first). my guess is that they bought a new bag while on the cruise and left the old one behind.\n  ","390578":"\n  yeah, i just kept it. it's not as if they were going to give it back to whoever owned it last, if they could even track down who that person was, especially with respect to COVID (this was back in february).\n  ","390579":"\n  i prefer paper books. i've never read an electronic book before, and the idea has never appealed to me.\n  ","390580":"\n  i found it under the bed when i went on the cruise, LOL. the people who previously had the room before us must have forgotten it.

i used earlier this morning prior to leaving the house.\n  ","390586":"\n  i honestly can't remember, tbh. it was probably when i had my last car accident 3-4 years ago and filed a report with the officer.\n  ","390587":"\n  i believe it's fair to divide responsibilities up between partners. you both share that home; therefore, you're both responsible for it. the idea that a man should work and a woman should stay home and take care of everything in the household is an archaic model.\n  ","390588":"\n  if a partner doesn't have a job and stays home all the time (assuming no children are involved), then i believe that they should take care of some of the chores. however, a partnership includes mutual responsibility, so it shouldn't fall all on that partner.\n  ","390589":"\n  having a job is no excuse for not doing essential chores around the house, lol. me and both of my roommates work full-time, and we still find time to do things around the house that need to be done.\n  ","390590":"\n  a child(ren) growing up with two unhappy, angry parents is going to be worse off than a child(ren) growing up with a happy single parent. the happiness of the parents is recognized by the child, and if a child is raised in an abrasive or volatile environment, then that's going to negatively affect them.\n  \n  in most cases, divorce can be for the better in the long run.\n  ","390591":"\n  i eat healthy food, lol. i have fruits and vegetables often instead of things like potato chips, i don't snack at night or eat candy, i very rarely have ice cream (it's been a few months, actually), and i don't drink soda, among other things.\n  ","390592":"\n  i'm most definitely not a health freak, haha. i'm healthy for the most part, but i'm not one of those health smoothie, yoga practicing, drinking a gallon of water per day, type of person.\n  \n  i enjoy treating myself to cheeseburgers and tacos occasionally, i drink alcohol, and i have iced coffee every morning. lmaoo.\n  ","390593":"\n  i don't really think i understand the situation fully ... are you saying that your boyfriend and you broke up for 6 weeks, and during that 6-week period, you slept with someone else and was contacting your ex, prior to getting back together with your boyfriend?\n  \n  if he's asking for details and you're not comfortable sharing them, then i would simply tell him that. there may be a time and place where you *are* comfortable sharing those details, but try to emphasize that the past is in the past, and your previous relation with whoever the other guy was doesn't matter anymore. especially considering it was many years ago.\n  ","390594":"\n  i'm assuming she follows people who also speak her native language, so her questions can go out to both english speaking people and people who speak in that language as well.\n  ","390595":"\n  for the most part, yes. i'm serious in situations that require it, and i'm also not so serious in other types of situations where my friends and i are just being silly, hanging out, etc etc.\n  ","390596":"\n  i enjoy your questions. however, you should do whatever makes you feel comfortable and what you enjoy.\n  ","390597":"\n  nope, lmaoo.\n  \n  (just like i didn't actually laugh when i typed \"lmaoo\").\n  \n  some things do make me chuckle, but for me it's just a way to break up the sentence so i don't sound serious 100% of the time.\n  ","390598":"\n  i'm currently listening to a halo music compilation, haha. i'm attempting to continue writing my essay, but i haven't gotten anywhere. :\/\n

moment in your life.\n  ","390600":"\n  no, i never said that. if i did, then i likely meant it in a way in which i was attracted to him on first glance. i didn't actually fall in love with him until months after we started to actually date.\n  ","390601":"\n  ah, that's a difficult situation -- especially since you've already talked to him so often about this already. my go-to answer is always open communication, but considering you've already been doing that, i'm not sure what else to suggest. :\/\n  \n  i'm lucky in that both of my roommates clean up after themselves, so i never have to pick up after them. but i can definitely understand your frustration because that would get on my nerves too.\n  \n  perhaps approach the topic differently? instead of saying, for example, \"hey, you need to clean up after yourself\" -- go for an approach where you tell him that cleanliness is a value you appreciate, and you feel much more comfortable in your place when things are in their rightful place, and he would likely be more comfortable too.\n  \n  i'm just throwing things out there ... idk. i would most definitely be angry in your situation too. :\/\n  ","390602":"\n  PSA ;\n  ","390603":"\n  no, love at first sight does not exist. what a person feels when they see someone is lust at best, their own interpretation of what love *may* be with them, not how it actually is. it's an illusion and a fantasy.\n  ","390604":"\n  i'm watching a youtube video of a playthrough of a video game called \"green hell,\" and it's pretty funny.\n  ","390605":"\n  yeah, i routinely (well, every time i get my hair done at least) shave my head to a 0 or a 1 setting on the buzzer.\n  ","390606":"\n  your main question was a ridiculous question that i had no interest in answering, lmaoo. in addition, your follow up statements were equally as ridiculous -- especially the assumption that i've used or my friends have used crack solely because i live in new york, LOL.\n  \n  unless you have a legitimate question, this conversation is ending. this is silly.\n  ","390607":"\n  there's a bigger heroin problem on long island than crack, tbh. i'm not sure about the city or upstate new york, though.\n  \n  perhaps when you were in elementary school, they reinforced the idea of \"no silly questions,\" but definitely not in high school and for sure not in college, rofl.\n  ","390608":"\n  LOL. it isn't a serious question, it's a silly scenario and not a question i'm interested in answering. it's trolling at best.\n  ","390609":"\n  LOL. you've never asked me this question before.\n  \n  this is something i would normally delete because it's trollish and ridiculous.\n  ","390610":"\n  i answer pretty much everything in my inbox that's actually a question and appropriate.\n  ","390611":"\n  ask me some questions, friends. i have no plans for the rest of the afternoon ~~\n  ","390612":"\n  lmaoo. i mean -- if you want, but you're probably not going to get anywhere with it.\n  ","390613":"\n  i've been working on a short essay, something that's much longer than the essays i've written in the past.\n  \n  i don't really think it's worth remembering, but it's something that makes me proud of myself because i haven't written creatively in a while.\n  ","390614":"\n  ah, thanks. i'm so tired of the color -- after it's safe to go to salons again and my friend is comfortable doing hair, i'm going to color it dark brown and red (like a balayage).\n  ","390615":"\n  yes, i'm left handed.\n  ","390616":"\n  this is how long it is now, lmaoo.\n  \n  god, i can't wait for my friend to open her salon again so i can shave this off.\n  ","390617":"\n  they're only hanging out with each other -- it's not as if we're throwing parties with multiple people or something. it's gotten to the point where it's fine to see one person, or even two, as long as you're not congregating in large groups.\n  \n  the people who *are* throwing parties and showing up in large groups and pretending that things are \"normal,\" i.e. the people going to the beach, are the ones who are making the cases skyrocket again.\n  ","390618":"\n  lol, thank you. my hair is at least 3-4 inches longer at this point (including the shaved part, since i haven't shaved it since november).\n  ","390619":"\n  like i said, it's under settings. you can choose whichever one you want from their selection of moods.\n  ","390620":"\n  not before, but this is immediately after getting it done for the very first time over two years ago.\n  ","390621":"\n  yeah, haha. i mean, i'm a fairly impulsive person to begin with so it isn't really out-of-character for me. i was sitting in the salon chair for a regular cut and color, and i told my stylist, \"hey... shave half of my head.\"\n  \n  i already had an undercut on the right side to begin with, but i really wanted half of my head shaved right up to my natural part.\n  ","390622":"\n  not as much as i wanted, LOL. i ended up taking the recycle out, putting some cardboard boxes in the garage, wiped down the bathroom, uploading the dishwasher, and changing the garbage bags.\n  ","390623":"\n  we all do our own separate laundry, lol.\n  ","390624":"\n  it was an impulsive decision that i made last minute when i was already at the salon.\n  ","390625":"\n  no, we all have different tasks around the house. i normally clean the dishes and mop the floors, my one roommate vacuums and cleans the living room, and my second roommate does all of the cat litter and cat maintenance (lol).\n  \n  i feed the cats sometimes when no one else is home, but that's all.\n  ","390626":"\n  haha, thank you. :'))\n  ","390627":"\n  this is a pretty accurate representation at the moment. my roots are horrible.\n  ","390628":"\n  lol, i absolutely *hate* clutter so i try to have things as organized as possible. even when there are a few dishes in the sink, i try to clean them immediately because it just bothers me so much.\n  ","390629":"\n  thank you !! it's an HP. my previous laptop was also an HP, and it has never given me any issues besides slowing down after using it for several years, so i wanted to stick with the same brand. it's a very reliable brand.\n  ","390630":"\n  it's just an iced coffee in a thermos, lol.\n  ","390631":"\n  no, i don't work on saturdays.\n  ","390632":"\n  your feelings are completely valid and justified, i believe i would feel hurt too if i wasn't personally congratulated or asked how i was doing in that circumstance. your husband's family is essentially your family now too, so they should have taken your feelings and experience into consideration.\n  ","390633":"\n  why wouldn't it be allowed? restrictions are lifting here regarding COVID, and she's been coming over once per week for the past month or so, lol.\n  \n  she's moving out of her current house, so my roommate is helping her move this weekend.\n  ","390634":"\n  ab*se, addiction, mental illness (although i still struggle with my mental health to a certain degree), and toxic relationships.\n  ","390635":"\n  i support the black lives matter movement, and i believe that all lives cannot matter until black lives matter.\n  ","390636":"\n  to a certain degree, yes. there's always that whole \"seven degrees of separation\" thing going on, and you know a lot more people than you actually think.\n  ","390637":"\n  no, i don't generally hate anyone. hate is a very strong word and only reserved for a certain number of people in my life, and i have good reasons to hate them.\n  ","390638":"\n  something involving eggs, because they're a good source of protein for me. whether it's scrambled eggs and bacon with toast, or just scrambled eggs by themselves (depending on how hungry i am).\n  \n  this morning, i had to drop my roommate off at his girlfriend's house, so he picked us up some mcdonald's breakfast sandwiches before we left the house.\n  ","390639":"\n  most of the time, i brush my teeth twice per day. sometimes i forget and only brush them once, though. lol.\n  ","390640":"\n  i post photos fairly often, perhaps not every day but multiple times per week.\n  ","390641":"\n  remember when i said, long ago, that i didn't participate in askfm drama and gossip?\n  \n  find something better to do with your time.\n  ","390642":"\n  i think it's gross to speculate on complete strangers' personal lives, particularly those of celebrities. it's nobody's business who his father was or was not, and these types of rumors (among the others floating out there) are disrespectful to chester's friends and family.\n  ","390643":"\n  no, i don't.\n  ","390644":"\n  life is great rn.\n  ","390645":"\n  no, i don't.\n  ","390646":"\n  no, i just proofread my answers thoroughly before posting. lmao.\n  ","390647":"\n  because i like the feeling of being tipsy and numb from pain and worry.\n  ","390648":"\n  you guys tell me, i've been drunk for the last 3 hours. lmao.\n  ","390649":"\n  i don't follow people upon request, sorry.\n  ","390650":"\n  i've been feeling pretty fine.  then again, i'm drunk rn so i have no recollection of how i've been feeling over the past few weeks, lmaoo. i feel great rn, which is all that matters.\n  ","390651":"\n  yeah, it was last october.\n  ","390652":"\n  i was 27 years old.\n  ","390653":"\n  no, people can't control how their anatomy looks.\n  ","390654":"\n  this sounds like a conversation you should have with him, not me.\n  ","390655":"\n  definitely not, lol. that's 11 years younger than me and they're not even an adult.\n  ","390656":"\n  it wasn't awkward at all, tbh. she was a cool person from the few times i've met her, and as long as he's happy with her, then that's all that matters to me.\n  ","390657":"\n  yes, i've met her on multiple occasions.\n  ","390658":"\n  probably not, but i've never looked into it very much. i can assume it's based primarily on your relationship to that person, whether it's a personal relationship or a professional relationship.\n  ","390659":"\n  you only stated the first part of that sentence. regardless, it's just a sentence -- it isn't a question, so i deleted it.\n  ","390660":"\n  he already has a girlfriend, lol. it doesn't bother me -- all that matters to me is that he's happy.\n  ","390661":"\n  i would assume it's a combination of being inherently good at seeing things from an artistic angle and then also practicing a lot.\n  ","390662":"\n  i enjoy painting, but i wouldn't really say that i'm good at it, lol.\n  ","390663":"\n  i did when i was a child, up until my parents entered my room and read my entire journal front to back. after that, i didn't keep a journal anymore.\n  ","390664":"\n  i don't live with my parents.\n  ","390665":"\n  on plenty of occasions, yes.\n  ","390666":"\n  surprisingly, no. i drank a decent amount of coffee this morning, and i worked all day (until 4:30pm, at least). it's currently 9:15pm and i have no plans of going to bed anytime soon.\n  ","390667":"\n  that happened to me this morning actually, lol. i woke up around 6:00am and couldn't fall back asleep, so i stayed awake.\n  ","390668":"\n  they likely weren't questions, or they were ridiculous questions that i felt didn't warrant an answer. if you were to repeat the questions, i would tell you why i didn't answer them.\n  ","390669":"\n  fear me, i am the epitome of satan.\n  ","390670":"\n  well, the more you know ~~\n  ","390671":"\n  take multivitamins and vitamin c supplements.\n

more numb than anything else.\n  ","390674":"\n  no, i've always been too afraid to call into a radio station. lmaoo.\n  ","390675":"\n  not really, no. as long as there's open communication regardless of who is the one contacting first, then it shouldn't matter.\n  \n  i'm also coming from the age where when i was first dating my ex, we did phone calls instead of text messages ... so, yeah.\n  ","390676":"\n  i've always considered myself quite timid.\n  ","390677":"\n  probably? i wouldn't know, i don't believe i have a \"strong\" personality, lol.\n  ","390678":"\n  no, he wouldn't be okay with it unless i was okay with it. and because i expressed my hesitation with it, he wasn't interested in doing it anymore.\n  ","390679":"\n  probably my own insecurities about my partner leaving me for the other person, lol. i've never been able to envision myself in a poly relationship, i think i would overthink the situation too much.\n  ","390680":"\n  i get some decent anons questions, and most of my questions come from anons, so i see no reason to turn it off.\n  ","390681":"\n  i'm indifferent to anons. i'm only interested in actual questions.\n  ","390682":"\n  i'm actually pretty cold rn, lmaoo.\n  ","390683":"\n  stereotypes are fine to acknowledge, but it's *also* important to acknowledge when\/where stereotypes are wrong and why they're stereotypes to begin with.\n  ","390684":"\n  probably? i don't remember much of when i was a child.\n  ","390685":"\n  yes, i vote in every presidential election.\n  ","390686":"\n  no. people should only be taxed based on the tax bracket they're in in terms of their financial status.\n  ","390687":"\n  no, i wouldn't be able to do polyamorous relationships, lol. my ex and i talked about it for a while when my sexual libido was nonexistent, but it wasn't something either of us were interested in doing.\n  ","390688":"\n  i believe everyone has the right to maintain any sort of relationship(s) they want to maintain, as long as everything is consensual.\n  ","390689":"\n  yes, there are a plethora of health issues that run in my family, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, alcoholism, etc etc.\n

","390691":"\n  not as expensive as most people like to believe. it's easier to buy food from the grocery store than to buy fast food all the time -- it lasts longer, and most healthy food products (like fruits and vegetables) are pretty cheap on their own.\n  ","390692":"\n  yeah, it's a decent song.\n  ","390693":"\n  as my bio indicates, i live in new york.\n  ","390694":"\n  i literally just

drinking. it's my way to relax at the end of the day.\n  \n  honestly, i've always wondered if i was in denial about potential alcoholism. there are some nights i do drink to get drunk, but it's maybe once per week if anything. otherwise, it calms me down and puts me in a relaxed state of mind and body.\n  \n  my father was\/is an alcoholic, so my family has always been concerned about my drinking habits. they obviously don't know that i drink every night, otherwise they'd freak out. my mother also always gave me a hard time about going out and drinking with my friends on friday or saturday nights, so there's a certain stigma associated with it in my family.\n  ","390709":"\n  LOL. i honestly didn't even pick up on the typo, lmaoo. i'm also a bit tipsy now, so yeah.\n  ","390710":"\n  i've tried that, and they've always looked at me weird, LOL. like ... when my ex's goddaughters and godsons were young, like 4-5 years old, i tried talking to them but i felt so weird about it.\n  \n

don't give myself as much credit as i deserve at times, and i'm often incredibly hard on myself even though i'm not as hard on my friends for the same reasons. i made a splendid breakfast for myself

shown an interest in dating while knowing who someone is, at any rate.\n  ","390742":"\n  toxic masculinity *does* exist, and it's exhibited in the mental health stigma men face on a regular basis. men with mental health issues aren't taken as seriously as women's mental health issues because men have been conditioned to suppress their emotions, being told that having emotions is \"weak\" and \"not manly.\" more men attempt s*icide than women, from my understanding, in light of this.\n  ","390743":"\n  a better house to rent or an apartment, lmao. i enjoy the house we live in now, but there are some issues with the house that we didn't realize existed prior to moving in. the electrical system sucks (we had to finagle our way around electrical cords in order to get the air conditioner to work without blowing the breaker). additionally, there's really little insulation throughout the house, and the toilet isn't big enough.\n  ","390744":"\n  i'm honestly not looking

life was much different one year ago than it is today. i was still living with my parents back then, and i was on the verge of my ex and i breaking up, so i was very uncertain in our relationship. i wasn't happy at all with my living circumstances, and my depression was high at that point in time. i was also experiencing panic attacks still because it was before i was prescribed xanax for my panic attacks and generalized anxiety.\n  \n  now, i'm living on my own with two roommates away from my parents, and although i'm single now, i'm still close friends with my ex and our friendship is pretty strong, stronger than it was during the last few months of us dating. i have my anxiety managed for the most part, and i haven't had a panic attack in months.\n  ","390746":"\n  there are tons

oof, that's a difficult question. i would respect both of their opinions, but i believe i would try to hear them both out first and then try to make a determination based on how i feel after listening to their accounts.\n  ","390756":"\n  yeah, i believe i have a really long time ago. i don't remember much about the series, though.\n  ","390757":"\n  LOL, yes. however, it wasn't really because i was fed up with their presence, it was more along the lines that i was tired of socializing and wanted to be left alone.\n  ","390758":"\n  there's a difference between offering the option to someone and then downright telling them to seek a nutritionist. if someone goes, \"if you're able to see a nutritionist, then i suggest you try it out,\" then i see nothing wrong with that. however, if someone says \"you need to make an appointment with a nutritionist,\" i can see how that's problematic.\n  ","390759":"\n  why would that be creepy ... ? there's nothing wrong with liking tarot, astrology, etc etc. it's a very common interest.\n  ","390760":"\n  sure. i don't really see a reason why someone would post those types of things if they didn't have an inherent interest in it. it

something my company would pay for.\n  ","390766":"\n  oh, i understand. i'm not sure what the cost of living is in the UK, but i'm assuming it's a lot cheaper than in the united states, and particularly where i live in new york. lol.\n  ","390767":"\n  didn't you just say that the salary was 20k per year?\n  \n  unless you mean that it would be $25 per hour. regardless, even if it is that much, the fact that you're only making a 20k salary per year doesn't add up to much, especially if you're paying for college expenses.\n  \n  obviously it's up to you, overall. i made minimum wage when i was working while attending college, but i also worked 35-40 hours per week, lol.\n  ","390768":"\n  i used to believe in the whole wayfair sex trafficking theory, but the more that i read about it, it just seems awfully suspicious that major retailers would take part in something like that. people who are involved in that black \"market\" are much smarter than to use such mainstream avenues like wayfair or amazon to conduct their business.\n  ","390769":"\n  i think it may be a combination of both, in my experience. some people are just naturally gifted at writing while others aren't -- something i've learned over the years through editing other people's work throughout high school, college, and in my regular workday.\n  \n  i think you can be taught the ins and outs of writing, but the idea of \"good\" writing is fairly subjective.\n  ","390770":"\n  that isn't a livable wage where i live, so that doesn't really seem worth it unless you're still living with your parents and don't have to pay for a lot of bills or health insurance.\n  ","390771":"\n  favorite cartoon movie ; spirited away (although that's more anime than anything else).\n  \n  favorite cartoon

which company you end up working for, your experience, where you live (cost of living and wages differ depending on where you are), etc etc.\n  \n  this wasn't an entry-level job for me \u2014 i had 2\/3 years past professional experience in writing prior to getting this job. it pays me well enough for me to sustain myself right now, but i obviously do want more money.\n  ","390783":"\n  i'm a

become very paranoid after watching a horror movie.\n  ","390786":"\n  no, that would be pretty classist to do so. not everyone has had the privilege of obtaining an education that allows for advanced

process so it doesn't feel like you have this large project ahead of you. take things step by step, and space it out over the course of a few days or weeks instead of expecting yourself to do everything in one shot.\n  ","390789":"\n  i overthink in my daily life, but not really while i'm writing, lol.\n  ","390790":"\n  write consistently, every day if you're able to do so. the writing doesn't have to be good or perfect, but the only way to get better at your craft is to practice on a routine basis.\n  ","390791":"\n  not that i'm aware of, no. writing is a release for me \u2014 a release of my emotions, of the things that are troubling me. it comes out of me naturally, so there's really little thinking involved unless i'm trying to remember a specific word i want to use.\n

and good, but you don't really have a say in the matter. :'))\n  ","390812":"\n  honestly, i don't really think you should be thinking that far ahead. dating someone is different from moving in with someone, and you'll probably date quite a few people before you make the decision to move in with someone. at that point, the feelings you have for that person and your compatibility will trump everything else.\n  ","390813":"\n  no, i definitely do not have the stamina for that. lol.\n  ","390814":"\n  LOL, yes. every single time. i know most of the words to the songs in les miserables, as

when to spend it and when not to spend it, and if we were low on money, we'd do our best to conserve it by not going out and whatnot. we'd take turns paying for things for one another depending on who

automatically an idiot.\n  \n  there are also more relationships that cishet and lesbian relationships, lol. you're not taking into account the full gender spectrum where women may be involved.\n  \n

experiencing something personally doesn't make it factual, lol. insecurity doesn't discriminate by gender. your friends who are men probably do feel insecure, but there's a large stigma placed on men to not express emotion so they likely keep it to themselves.\n  ","391090":"\n  i think people in general are insecure because they feel pressured to look or behave a certain way by how our society

opening up a line of communication with your boyfriend discussing these feelings and how you would like to see him more often (if you haven't tried that already).\n  \n  it doesn't mean you're clingy or too much. your feelings are justified.\n  ","391106":"\n  i suppose when someone first meets me, they find it difficult to believe that i struggle with a lot of mental health problems. i'm often in

time, so we only saw each other maybe 2-3 times per week (along with our work schedules being opposite, etc etc). it wasn't unusual or bad if one of us were to say, \"hey, i don't feel like hanging out today. i just want to be alone.\"\n  ","391109":"\n  this is difficult for me to answer because how i behave around other people changes depending on what sort of group i'm around. different groups of friends make me act in different ways -- it's a bit hard to explain. i notice i'm more outgoing around one group of friends than others, and other groups of friends, i'm more reserved and quiet.\n  ","391110":"\n  this was me in 2009, so i was 17 years old.\n  ","391111":"\n  i've been reading books since i was a toddler, so i honestly have no idea what the first book i spent my own

grasping for straws to find meaning in something. in anything.\n  \n  if i had to describe the emptiness in a few words, it would be feeling simultaneously hollow but also numb at the same time.

open about my experiences and want to educate people as much as possible.\n  ","391542":"\n  going to bars and restaurants, haha. new york implemented outdoor and indoor seating to a certain extent,
