  Its been a bit of stayed the same and lost. I'd say that's within the last two months. Getting my period last time didn't help because I was a little bitxh and ate all the keto chocolate my heart desired and wasn't active at all during that time.

   Right now would be a good time to go to a house on 100 acres and have enough canned goods and frozen meat to last a year. You could have chickens for eggs and plant lettuce and tomatoes and veggies in a massive garden. Then you don't have to go anywhere.

   Idk the doctors are out there telling the truth. The UK is asking all persons over 70 to not leave their houses now.

  He was in the pool area being annoying too. All saying he hope the gym stays open , he'll sue if they dont because it messes with his routine 🤣 he'll fight the people who signed for it to close. how they claim that they clean it but its filthy. I noticed it seemed less clean yesterday than it did so maybe he did something beforehand to be a weirdo? Its usually spotless and seemed like lots of sandy stuff on the floor. Some of the windows looked oddly done up compared to how they usually look. How he took video of it... like uh when? Because the while time I was in the gym with him he was talking about other stuff to his phone.. how long you been there? He was also only on ONE machine the whole time. Guy was just having a field day with every thought possible XD
  
  Think he even mentioned me being shy.. like uh you talking about me? Here to workout not say stuff to you as I pass you to go on the stationary bike. Don't think I noticed him before... bigger guy. Must be 40+ years old. Loud l.o.l voice :p

  Two things. Was crushing a little bit and then they told me out of nowhere how they didn't want a girlfriend. I wasn't really thinking about that but it kind of hurt still. Also later on, it seemed like we were the only ones talking that way only to find out on my own that that wasn't the case. I was the one that had to confront him about it. It just hurt more because I had some other things going on at the same time, made me feel bad that they weren't truthful with me, that I was never good enough for anyone/nobody's #1. I think it was more because they were the first person I really let in since my last ex so it was definitely a wtf why me type situation ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  
  It's just whatever at this point.

  Nobody says you have to buy it. People have made gains too. It's more about putting in the work instead of the actual products. Most people change their lifestyle,  not just a diet cult. They do 8 week challenges and people of all shapes and sizes join for their own personal reasons.. its not strictly a diet thing for the people involved, myself included.
  
  Most pyramid schemes are worse and just after the money. Herbalife is literally just sugar, soy protein. People get results but not for long. My stepcousin and his wife actually sell those products. All about  the commission instead of actually caring about the people they are ""trying"" to help. He even tried getting my sister into it at one point and she was still skinny at the time. I'd rather have a company that cares instead of a person who is just after the money. Wanting to create more ambassadors etc

  Eh more so when they are all ""I'm ugly, no one wants me blah blah blah"" way. That sh!t holds you back from even trying to find someone. You don't see them actively trying to get someone either, just b!itching about their injustice and not doing/trying a thing about it. I dont think anyone who sees that would be all ""I want him!"". There's probably someone out there that likes him/them but they are so focused on the ""nobody likes me"" that they dont notice when someone does or they push them away etc mindset is everything. Law of attraction, how you feel about yourself. If you say mean things about yourself it just shows that you'll approve of others doing that to you too. Have some respect for yourself and others.

   would you break up with your partner if you thought they were flirting with your cousin? but they said they weren’t but you insist yourself that they did it. when they asked how they flirted, you would just say “doesn’t matter. i know what i saw.” no explanation given.
  ","
  Considering most are guys that would be interesting. I only have one actual girl cousin whom I haven't seen since she was 5 years old, she's in her 20's now. Good luck finding her :p
  
  And then the one that's getting married is a step cousin by marriage. She's 30-40s but acts 15+ at times...
  
  Either way, I wouldn't be like that. It seems like they are just being insecure for whatever reason. Trying to start a fight that they aren't fully into. Being vague. Not saying proof of what they think happened. Maybe it's not even about the cousin, skirting over the real reason why they don't trust you. With any girl, nevermind a cousin.

  Bit of both. Ex military and then gained a lot of weight. The kind of guy that looks pregnant rather than fat. Drank and smoked a lot. Ended up getting diabetes, no real surprise there. A few months ago he went to the doctor for his feet.. he declined and then a week later had to get some of his toes chopped off because it kept getting worse there.
  
  He would have definitely been the creepy uncle if there was one lol Had a naked female tattoo on his arm and would make it dance, stuff he's said etc
  
  I think he got way worse after his ex-wife ended up dying two years ago. Sad that both of them are gone now, they have grandkids.

  Had some spotting last night after my walk. I did read that sometimes ovulation can cause spotting if egg released. Also been stressed and working out a lot.
  
  If I'm regulating then ok... but I literally just got rid of my period lol like this isn't fun. Last time it was 50 days between getting it.. well the first time was more spotting then turned into a phantom one without the blood, cramps.
  
  Last time spotted then actually got but didn't have much cramps.
  
  If it's going with the 50 days theme.. should get march 24/25... but my tracker on fitbit is saying the 13-19th is when I should get it next. So who really knows. Guess March isn't going to be a good time 🤣
  
  Need to go to the doctors anyways but ya.. hopefully it's not something else going on.

   Hi 🖐 Just wondering, do you ever get to that stage of alcohol consumption where you're absolutely ravenous for food, like you could easily smash an entire tube of Pringles, but you hold out for as long as possible as once you start eating it dilutes the buzz from the drink, or is that just me?

  even smaller than the one that almost fit. Made me look flat chested instead. Straps were wicked long too. Was very bizarre.

   do you agree with this?
  ","
  They act like policies would fix everything instantly.
  
  I understand how it could be seen as ""doing it for the good feeling "" but I view it more as a selfless act instead. Being selfish is more about yourself, not helping at all. Some might have that feeling of getting free stuff whereas others could genuinely be grateful for a meal and other things, not wanting to feel like a burden etc
  
  You also don't know the reasons why the person is homeless either. It's a very grey situation in a b&w world. Just because a policy might be in place doesn't make it sure that people wont be homeless either. There's no guarantee. They also don't specify what the policy would entail or any sort of information besides ""its selfish"" o.o

  No. I overshare too much (especially here). I do sometimes keep things private but in no way do I pretend that everything is fine. Just some stuff should remain private especially if more personal. I don't think you need to air out every single thing on social media.
  
  I rarely write things on FB. More of my pictures I take are either on here or IG.
  
  I can kind of understand the question with IG... lots of travel pictures, books, fitness, food but most of the descriptions can tell a different story than the actual content too. I think my stories can paint a different picture too. Lots of quotes, random stuff etc

   lol... it drives my s.o. crazy when I call her dear all the time or answer ""yes dear"" to everything.
  ","
  That's kind of cute.
  
  But this person literally did it 3 times then I said something and they replied with ""yes dear"". Like I don't know you, don't need pet names from people I'm not involved with. I get how it can be respectful in some cultures but when someone says to call them by name, It shows more respect than just writing ""dear"" over and over again.

   My brother is in his room crying. His girlfriend of 7 years broke up with him because of a rumor that he cheated on her. Even though he was at work.

  ","
  Just be there for him. Not really sure on the dynamic so that can be harder to say what to do.
  
  Crying is probably expected with that long of a time together. Why the past tense? Clearly he still loves her if crying and wanting her to know that he didn't do anything. They should really talk everything out. Guess it depends who made the rumor.. bit sad she'd trust them over her long term bf who was supposedly working at the time and not wanting to hear anything. She could be the guilty party and trying to let him down easier?

  ","
  Affiliate marketing was easy to do. Other people did it so I tried and it was going well until that site died. Dog/housesitting.. people were away and I stayed there for however long until they came back while taking care of the animals. I love animals but can't see that as a full time job. I would never want to be a vet or anything like that. It can be pretty infrequent. Probably should branch out more but a little lost on that.. whether to seek some dog watching app, craigslist, FB groups or what have you.
  
  No, I need more. Retail job or college (psychology) seems like my only real options at the moment. Also the writing project that I'm currently working on.

   Чем любовь отличается от влюбленности?
  ","
  ""How is love different from falling in love?""
  
  In a friendship way, you have love for them but you aren't in love with them. Same with unconditional love.
  
  Falling in love is the process of loving someone more or even falling more in love with yourself. Love vs the act of falling, cause and effect... you have feelings and they blossom into actual love.

  ","
  Roller coaster ride after ending my period. Lots of gym and walking, again. Been shopping but haven't purchased anything since in a ""save up"" attitude.  Buy only what I need in that moment. Wants can wait :) I did buy some moisturizer because I was out but besides that haven't spent on clothing or whatever else.

   sounds like my parents lol. my dad wouldnt even allow me to shower more than twice a week. sun & wed. felt it was a waste of water. i would try and sneak bathe using the sink in the middle of the night. middle class family.

  Do you shower with people to save water? ;)

  I don't remember lol definitely would use a bath more. Had a clawfoot one.
  
  I don't remember whose idea it was for showers. Think it just happened.
  
  2nd house had both options so I'd imagine from that one.  that one was odd because you literally went up the stairs and  there would be a big den area and a shower there then hallways leading to different bedrooms.
  "

   how would you respond to that? should you say “what do you wanna do with this relationship?” or what?

  I'd want to understand their feelings. Why they feel like they don't deserve me (and love in general or if it's just WITH me). If there's someone else perhaps that is deserving of them. I'd want to know what they doubt about me. I feel like the future part is pretty self explanatory but at the same time would be interested to know what they picture their future person with so I can see if that is relatable to me or not. I'd assure them that I don't see them as a f*ck up regardless of how they are acting. Bring up what they want to do.. work on it or end it etc
  "
480164,"
   if they say you deserve better then they can be better for you if they really want you, right? i feel like that’s just an excuse tho.
  ","
  Yes, think so. Clearly they aren't trying to be that person for the relationship and themselves. If they really cared they wouldn't d!ck around like that. Just end it if that's what they want instead of going on and on like a riddle. Just scared it seems like to me and putting it on the other person instead. Just seems like a line instead of what they might actually be feeling? It's one thing to be unsure of how you feel but another to be all dramatic about it like that. Mixed signals can be annoying. You either try not to take it as serious (thinking about a future with them) or move on, ya know? Very odd circumstance to be put in. Tone says a lot more than the words as well.

   when someone said “you’re amazing and i don’t deserve you. you deserve someone who won’t doubt you or the things you say. someone who sees a future with you. not a fucked-up person like me. you deserve so much better.” what does that mean? is that an excuse to break up or what?
  ","
  Seems so or validation. Knowing they aren't good for you or just a chance to escape. Seeing if they still want you regardless of all that. ""Someone who sees a future with you"" clearly means they aren't that guy/girl for them.. that it's not that serious for them. Seems more like a cop out than anything else even if everything they said was true.

  No. It would have to be a lot of things at once instead of something minor like that. I think it depends on the behavior as well.. might be a little wary but should be adults enough to talk about whatever is going on. Communication is a huge part of relationships, trust etc

  ","
  That's cute. Eh.. seems like a lot to catch up with lol
  
  I had a crush on this guy before. Apparently he had one on me but never acted on it either. I moved and went to a different school and a few years passed then saw him at a carnival and he was all excited to see me. This happened a few different times throughout the years too at the same carnival. Always friendly, would move away from his friends just to talk to me. But he never asked for my number, to hangout or anything like that. Obviously I didn't have a crush on him when that happened but who knows what could have happened there. I liked his mom and little sister though. Think it was more the whole ""what would his friends think"" kind of mentality for him. He wasn't that shy when we'd see eachother ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

480896,"
   when you think to yourself or read something, do you experience an internal narrative in a particular voice? if so, is it your voice? if you don't experience this, then how would you explain your comprehension of written words (i.e. abstractions or maybe even images)? hope this makes sense!
  ","
  Read something- that depends. Sometimes I'll read it how I think the person would sound. Other times it could just be my voice.
  
  I'm not sure if I notice when reading images. I'm sure some might sound a bit whiny depending on what it was lol like memes.
  
  For the other parts, it's definitely my own voice.
  
  When I read something from British authors I feel like I go full on British voices when reading lol like those ones that are so soothing like a bedtime lullaby, newscasters, old world like Jane Austen etc

  7th grade was actually at the jr high/high school so got to experience that at a normal one.

  My sister ended up dropping out. Did GED, bartending license. Grew up some and decided to go to the community college. Did so well that she got a scholarship to a university. Biology degree and yet she's in marketing instead lol

  No. But I've watched the old Her one.
  
  Hm reminds me of a movie I watched not too long ago. A guy built a siri voice app. His wife ended up being the voice of it. He ends up falling in love with her voice and ignoring his actual wife. Can't think of the name of it. ""Her"" just keeps coming up when searching for it instead. Might have been an Netflix original?

  Clearly eat better and be active together again. I feel like putting blame on one person is dumb. Neither should have let themselves go.  Someone can't force you to change all habits like that...
  
  If it was more in a not trying way then obviously it seems better to question the relationship, whys, if they still love you as well. Have they stopped too? Just comfortable? Rut? Any future? Just convenient now?

  She's 31. Seemed normal when we were actually friends. Haven't seen her in years. Reconnected on FB a few years ago. It doesn't seem good lately. In the time we connected she had back surgery for her scoliosis. Was dating some guy, then it was the engaged one. Then she met the baby daddy. Had her son and then got pregnant right away again. Which that one was harder for her. Lots of complications. Her daughter's head was misshapen (forget the term) and has to wear a helmet to make it normal. On&off again with the daddy. Her fb says single on it right  now and has some FU type of meme things on her page. She mentioned feeling su*cidal there lately. Her doctor mentioned that she has fatty liver and she+everyone on there was acting like it was a death wish.. most likely just the prebaby weights, appendix scar and eating bad wrapped into one. She literally sent a picture of herself with ben and Jerry's ice cream the next day after announcing her diagnosis. Definitely post partum depression and probably normal one there too.

  I had a vday quiz on there and she replied to it with her own situation which was basically how she wants him to propose on valentine's day but says she knows he wouldn't 🤣 like why waste time on him? She seems like a single mom already and he gets her flowers or something to worm his way back in her good graces.
  
  She was literally engaged to a different guy before him and they called it quits twice too. I think she didn't really love him.

   why u even dated that person
  ","
  I really have no idea 🤣 think I didn't want to be alone but that's all I was? He didn't go to my school and rarely saw. Think that's another reason why I don't care for dating younger people. He was 2-3 years younger than me. I was just fed up with everything, going into my senior year and clearly that relationship was not going well so ended it to do whatever I wanted during the summer and senior year. I even got him a gift (book he liked/didn't read yet) and got nothing in return lol wasn't really my type either. It's more funny to me now but ya.. def time wasted on that guy 🤣

They could have said something else. Just made me feel awful and small. You make a mistake once and branded that way for life, I guess. Just fu.cking sucks.

  Hate gstrings. However, have two of them. One of a lingerie piece and the other from a schoolgirl outfit that is freaking small eventhough it's in my sizes. The gstring was normal though.
  
  Thongs are way better! Actually almost bought one yesterday but iffy on what size I'd be and don't think they let you try them on there.
