You're still considered a murderer  in the government's eye, even if it was a good reason as to why you did so. Such as a guy being a p.e.d.o.p.h.i.l.e and luring on young kids and you found out and killed that person and saved others from having to ever experience their child doing that or their victims knowing about it and thanking you ... so in a way the number of murderers will never decrease as long as someone is out there still killing people for good or just bc\n  ","894149":"\n  A good resolution to those who created crimes that should be punished more severe and get what they did done to them.
