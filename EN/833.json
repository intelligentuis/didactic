growing up bc people are strange and like to claim other people s children as their own or judge based off what the child chooses to be and do later on in life . you would have a big supportive family so no moment would go uncelebrated and there will always be someone around to talk to or hang out with . you would have a family that is hardworking , compassionate towards the things they love and talented in many areas such as music and construction related things . you re aunts would be the ones who share their passion for music with you if you wanted to , or your uncles would teach you the ways to living life on the wild side sports , camping , fishing , driving four wheels or you can have a jam out session with michael and play guitar . your grandpa would be the fun goofy one who you adore and grandma would be the one with a generous heart who would probably always make you snacks and spoil you lol . i would be kinda strict but also the fun parent as well . only be strict when it is needed like you acting out or doing something wrong like hitting and adult . i want to home school all my children bc i feel a child should learn at their own pace and not be forced to advance or be left behind because they can t compete with their peers . i know the anxiety children get when their friends can count to and yours can only count to . . . and many children feel something is wrong with them and get bullied because they re a bit different then their peers . . . as for religion i would love for you to follow the catholic faith as religion is very important to me , but if you choose to be interested in another religion that would be fine . as far as expectations always do your best towards things that may be a challenge and never be afraid to do what makes you happy","770797":"i believe in most , some come true while others i m still wishing upon but i guess you just got to believe they can actually come true if you actually believe and work hard to making
