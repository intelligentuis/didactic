i ve always thought about streaming , but it s not ideal for my situation . the most i do with game clips as of current is make edits or transparent gifs ! those get posted casually every so often on my tumblr .","723507":"no , but i have had premonitions in dreams about a few of the animals i ve cared for passing away . also one time , i had this premonition dream of exactly where my missing headband was .","723508":"valentine s day is a feel good day , and it gives an excuse to show all of those we love our true feelings .","723509":"aaaa thank you , happy valentine s day to you as well . it s not much , but have this virtual rose . i hope you re having a lovely day !","723510":"this doesn t feel like a fair situation to cast blame onto anyone for . no one is at fault it was an unexpected and unrelated freak accident in the middle of a heated moment .","723511":"i don t open links .","723512":"it really does warm my heart that you would say so !

i don t see the harm if the person isn t a kid anymore .","723526":"something i love doing but kinda suck at is making transparent edits of gifs . . . i don t have photoshop , and there s hardly any good mobile tools that properly isolate an animated object . some of them end up a little crusty so well it is what it is . .","723527":"right ? ? i m in shock","723528":"you should start getting a life instead of wasting your time sending anon hate , fix yourself but go awffff","723529":"imagine getting big mad at receiving public advice you didn t like , even when you made the conscious decision to put it in shoutouts . which sends it to random people . smart","723530":"i haven t been able to change my display color since december , if i remember correctly .","723531":"vanilla !","723532":"i don t go out of my way to watch them . . i m not interested in romantic drama . but i will never forget when my old high school spanish teacher had our class watch la tempestad with her every period . you know , for educational purposes i still remember all of the lyrics to the shows intro song , hoy tengo ganas de ti . . do i speak a lick of spanish ? nope ! but i sure do remember that !","723533":"apparently by just using celebs as their profile picture and starting drama so people pay attention to them . well , at least that s all i ve seen ! i really don t understand having an rp account on a place like this . . makes no sense to me !","723534":"someone s heart ?","723535":"no clue i m not a man nor am i in miami . perhaps you should ask men who are , in fact , from miami and seeing younger women in their s to mid s . . ?","723536":"pro tip shoutouts reach faaar out of the state that you re in . i m nowhere near miami , just as an example . like not even close .","723537":"your man ? take him to your can i mean the kind that stores trash and dump him . oh my god just . please for your own sake just dump him . you should never have to explain to a grown , s xuaiiy active adult that using a frigging balloon as a c ndom is unsafe . and the fact that he got mad at being turned down from s x , even without context , that s toxic . do yourself a favor and find a new one . . this ain t it . . .","723538":"my stance on having kids has always been and will always be the same i don t want any , and i want nothing to do with any . if you mean my thought process about other people having children during the pandemic if i m assuming correct ? not my business . no one else s business but the person s involved with creating the child , and providing for the child frankly .","723539":"i mean the only thing to say is the obvious . if the person you are in love with isn t poly their partner isn t okay with them having other partners . . they need to dump their partner . it s a really sh tty thing of them to do stringing their current partner around on the side while they dabble in interest with you . thusly stringing you around as well . if they aren t willing to end it , but they still wanna keep you on the side , you should end the relationship you have with this person . they re indecisive , and likely just enjoy the attention with no real motives for solid commitment if that s the case . i mean i wouldn t even touch this situation or the person it s surrounding personally . people like that tend to be fickle hearted . the possibility of them tiring of you the way they are tiring of their current eventually is a possibility with these types . just my two cents !","723540":"i ve never had my cards read ! and i know next to nothing about tarot unfortunately , so i can t say .","723541":"nope ! still forever scarred from when a coworker at a former job would sit in the lunch room , smacking their chops loudly as they ate , while playing that game at full volume . eugh not happy memories . . but anyways back to your question , uhh . . nope ! mobile games aren t really my thing anyways . if i play games on my phone at all , i usually emulate older consoles ds , gba , ps , etc .","723542":"even without the two controllers , it wouldn t be worth it . you d be better investing in a pc .","723543":"most winters , i ve struggled to find energy . but this winter has been different !

i slept pretty well . there was a point where i woke up around and contemplated staying up , buuut i turned back in for a few extra hours . safe to say i feel more rested ! also i m about to go down and make some cheesy scrambled eggs with orange peppers and tomato . how has your friday been coming along ? i hope that it s been off to a good start for you thus far !","723548":"you re on anon , so that s not possible ! also just to be clear , i don t have any intentions of giving out my socials to directly communicate . i m not interested in that . but if you wanted to converse on here , i wouldn t be opposed !","723549":"nope ! to be honest , a lot of my early childhood is . . kind of like a fever dream . any memories i even have from back then are scattered . oddly enough i remember the name of my first boyfriend i tried to look him up because i thought it would be interesting to see who he became . but i cannot spell his last name . i know how to pronounce it , but since i can t spell it . . . he s the only person i even remember from that point in my life , and i can t even show anything for it .","723550":"no way , you really mean that ? ? thank you so so so much !

but just like with many other things , i just never took the time to get into them . it s on the back burner with a bunch of other stuff i still have to look into","723554":"you think so ? well thank you !","723555":"let me know what you think ! ! it s an all time favorite of mine .","723556":"most of my energy is derived from future motivations ! positive reinforcement of the things that need done ahead of me really helps .","723557":"not a fan of the ones who have this really weird fet sh stic take on it . but the ones out there that are just in it because it makes them innocently happy ? hey why not , go for it . it doesn t bother me .","723558":"oh no , not at all ! that s nothing you have to worry about . the only thing that wakes me anymore is my alarms ! i typically wake up between am am if i can help it . i just had a few days where i was waking up too late am , and wanted to shift myself back to where i was . i appreciate your concern though thank you for checking . that was very considerate of you .","723559":"i probably was , until this message made me throw up in my mouth .","723560":"it s an oldie at this point i feel most everyone knows about it but a goodie . . . coraline !","723561":"hey hey !

she s just a really warm , kind hearted , understanding person . i don t even see her often , but i still get along with her the best .","724214":"yes . my party trick is slinking away from the crowd to pet the household animals .","724215":"my first pet was a dog !","724216":"neither i ve always found apple products to be senselessly overcharged .","724217":"myself","724218":"i m absolutely terrible at remembering where i put left something .","724219":"unwinding with a glass of aloe juice and trying to find a video game worth playing rn","724220":"i don t really ever watch movies to begin with , so i suppose not ! i wouldn t be opposed to watching any , if one were brought up to me . i spend most of my time consuming horror media in the form of video games , manga , and comics .","724221":"a heart ? look i love riddles , but i suck at them","724222":"the mistake that i keep making , every single day . . . is stepping on niella s squeaky toys on accident . . . i keep making this mistake because she keeps dropping them in random spots on the floor . . .","724223":"okay i m late to this , , but . thank you so much !

they always have good deals . i find a lot of discounted clothes from forever there . most of the stuff i ve bought actually still has tags and everything , so it s usually brand new clothes at a cheaper markdown !","724231":"ohhh the fire coins ! i gotcha now . yeah , they really do have no value . i mean when they were first introduced , it was incredibly easy to get coins . then they made them more difficult to earn , trying to make them seem special and exclusive . when really they aren t anything of significance . the feature is a real letdown tbh . .","724232":"i collect all sorts of things !

honest and reliable news sources are hard to find . i consume the media i consume critically , and will do research on the things i discover more often than not . gathering information from multiple sources is always best .","724238":"all different kinds , really ! it would be easier to say what i don t like , to be completely honest . dishes that are dom nated by vegetables , for example . i don t like an overabundance of vegetables in my meals , most especially if they re cold uncooked . also i don t really like fast food all that much , or anything greasy .","724239":"i do , yes . gotta have that calcium !","724240":"i ve seen this one spammed out so many times since the vaccine was invented . i m surprised it took this long to make its rounds to me . i plan on getting the vaccine , but i m not in a rush to . my local healthcare locations are overwhelmed with business , as we are at level covid exposure risk . i will get it when i am able to . perhaps when it is safer and more time efficient to .","724241":"earlier when you sent this in , i didn t . but a couple of hours ago , it started to snow lightly !","724242":". . . .","724243":"i do have those nights , yeah . it s usually a gut feeling . it hits , and i just think to myself , yep , there s no sleep for me . i hope that you are able to get some peace of mind and become better rested soon !","724244":"to the little feral goblin piloting my brain , there is only one choice . . .","724245":"self defense is , in most people , a learned behavior . not everyone is able to utilize their feelings be it fear , anxiety , stress , etc to channel their defenses . for those , it can take a lot of guidance and practice to be able to hone their ability to defend themselves . so that being said , it s important that those of us who do know how to defend ourselves lend a hand to those who do not . all it can take is one helpful hand to guide someone . and that helpful hand might just save a life , for one reason or the other . no one should try and be a hero but serving acts of kindness to those in need shouldn t be looked down upon .","724246":"i love berry blended smoothies , like the triple berry smoothie from dq !

i ve finished my morning routine . now that that s done , i m about to dive into emulating some ps games for a nostalgia trip .","724255":"not so much anymore , unless they re really terrible . it seems like the worst ones stick with me i used to remember so many , but it seems like most of my dream memories dissipate within an hour after waking .","724256":"whoever is controlling my sim from the other side","724257":"kffjdhfhf right ? ? ? i just think these kinds of toys are a horrendous idea . a child s toy with eyes that move when it s moved , talks , and sh ts the orange stuff you feed it ? ? genius some ceo somewhere . they sold really well i think , because there were several different models . but personally , even as a kid , i never saw the appeal .","724258":"i took a lot of interest in oswald cobblepot the penguin specifically from gotham . i never really had much knowledge of the batman universe outside of a couple of things i d seen , so gotham was my biggest dive into it . a lot of the villains from the batman universe were present , so needless to say it was my first introduction to a lot of these characters . but i really do think watching the parts with the penguin were my favorite . for some reason , the build of his character throughout the seasons was really fascinating to see unfold . he starts off as a nobody who would eventually start conniving and manipulating his way to the top , being kicked down and climbing on back over and over . he s a sneaky b stard , and the sneaky b stard characters are so interesting because they re psychologically complex . the whole journey that was showed with this character made me keep wondering what s next . genuinely , i felt that he was written out and acted out excellently .","724259":"if you would like , i can send a few your way !

as much as i want to believe in the supernatural , those wants are compromised by critical doubt . thusly , i m left being completely unsure about the matter . intrigued , and very interested but also just very unsure .","724273":"i m doing pretty alright , how about yourself ? .","724274":"eep i missed this yesterday , i m so sorry !
