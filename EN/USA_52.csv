278928,"
   So, Derrick, are you ready to reveal some spoilers/anything?
  ","
  Nope!
  "
278929,"
   How will the present-Cooper be? Like AF or like UA?
  ","
  He won't be.
  "
278930,"
   how are you derek :)
  ","
  Not super happy when people can't even spell my name right.
  "
278931,"
   I think the same question applies to David Kaye too. Is he really that good or some of his voices are filtered (e.g. Deefus and Skurd)?
  ","
  When you have a hero that turns into 60 or 70 or whatever other characters, you need a very versatile cast. David is amazingly multitalented.
  "
278932,"
   Why are you so based?
  ","
  What?
  "
278933,"
   If you could voice a character in Omniverse, who would you voice?
  ","
  I'd like to play the mayor of Bellwood when Argit runs against him.
  "
278934,"
   What color is Skrud U think? Lime? Green? I must know ;^;
  ","
  Slime green.
  "
278935,"
   So wait? Ben 10k Returns WASNT the conceptual seed of the Omniverse Time/Multiverse stuff? Then what was?
  ","
  No, of course not. We just wanted to do alternate Bens. It's that simple.
  "
278936,"
   I know you did some work for TMNT like the kraang human suits and metalhead, also some concept art for Rahzar the wolf dude and Wingnut and Screwloose. Are there any other characters you've made concept art of or were those the only characters you did art and design for?
  ","
  I did a Leatherhead, maybe a couple others, It's hard to remember.
  "
278937,"
   Will Ben transform into an Highbreed? (Is this a better question? :D)
  ","
  No. Terrible. You can know the answer to this with a simple guess. And it was already stated a million years ago that we weren't adding any new transformations after a certain point.
  "
278938,"
   If I asked a question, how long does it take for you to read and reply to most questions? Do you have a back log of questions that takes time to get to?
  ","
  I answer questions in my own time. I usually have a huge backlog of questions, but once it gets too big I just delete everything.
  "
278939,"
   Who voices Skurd?
  ","
  David Kaye.
  "
278940,"
   It's not too scary at the boneyard, besides I gotta get away from these friggin ponies dude. At least the dead ones dont friggin bother me......or anyone that matter.
  ","
  I need to get away from aliens in a watch. I'm thinking robots or turtles is the way to go.
  "
278941,"
   I'm really curious what happened to Jarret. Did he survive the fight?
  ","
  He's probably fine.
  "
278942,"
   Things just got a whole lot interesting with skurd hanging around. Good episode.
  ","
  Yes, and he will play into the time war as well.
  "
278943,"
   That sounds like a good deal.
  ","
  Good!
  "
278944,"
   Is Kenny Tennyson 11 in Omniverse?
  ","
  No.
  "
278945,"
   Let's make a deal, if I don't ask stupid questions like ""Will Jetray appear in Omniverse?"", will you answer my  official art questions?
  ","
  How about, you don't ask annoying questions, and I won't block you?
  "
278946,"
   Yo dude, you wanna go hang out at the pony boneyard?
  ","
  I don't like the sound of that at all.
  "
278947,"
   Do you think it would be okay for me to start Transformers with the Animated series? Does it have any prequels/sequels I should watch before/after?
  ","
  Animated is it's own thing, you can watch it first. There are a lot of homages to previous series, but you can look them up on the TFWiki.
  "
278948,"
   Hello Mr. Wyatt! OV has brought Argit onto my faves list and I know he's one of your favorites, so I was wondering- Do you have any Argit trivia you'd like to share with us unwashed masses?
  ","
  He has an exciting future ahead!
  "
278949,"
   Okay the ratchet dude does not know where pinkie is, he made that clear enough. Eh doesnt matter anyways turns out fluttershy took it too buy whatever, she gave that bunny of hers as reimbursement.
  ","
  He's such a liar...
  "
278950,"
   I want to ask something about Eric Bauza. Is he really that versatile or he has a few of his voices tweaked by computers?
  ","
  We filter some of the voices, but he is just genuinely that good.
  "
278951,"
   I'm pretty sure that making people step on Legos was deemed to be unnecessarily cruel and was banned by the Galactic Geneva Convention. Ben will probably need to appear in intergalactic court again after that.
  ","
  You may be right.
  "
278952,"
   Gosh! Skurd is the adorable dodger :3, and powers which he gives Omnitrix's so awesome :D
  ","
  Good, good!
  "
278953,"
   Why don't you answer me?
  ","
  Ask better questions.
  "
278954,"
   After seeing the episode I'm curious, what was the concept that Bandai asked for that produced Skurd? What did they ask for?
  ","
  Something that would affect the Omnitrix in a way that would allow one alien form use the abilities of another.
  "
278955,"
   You do realize that even if Omniverse ends, you'll still probably going to be getting Ben 10 questions, right?
  ","
  Do you realize that I have a handy block button, built in to every single question?
  "
278956,"
   Is Khyber gonna turn into a alien/Tyrannopede hybrid like how Phil turned into a human/Terroranchula hybrid?
  ","
  No.
  "
278957,"
   I loved ""From Hedorium to Eternity"" It reminded me a bit when I was little and I hung out with my cousins and my friends and we were playing all the day :3 Thanks for that episode! 
PS: Lucy and Jonesy ❤
  ","
  Yeah, that episode felt really different to me, very fun. It has a kind of Goonies/Monster Squad type vibe.
  "
278958,"
   Can you show us  Atasian's in Omniverse official art?
  ","
  Who?
  "
278959,"
   Alright Mr. Wyatt, legitimate question in the last two weeks. Steve Blum played Heatblast in the first series of Ben 10, as well as Vilgax and Zs'skayr. He came back to play Vilgax and Zs'skayr so did he either not want to play Heatblast or had David Kaye already been cast before he came on board?
  ","
  We didn't have Mr. Blum in until arc 2.
  "
278960,"
   What character did you enjoy designing most on Omniverse?
  ","
  I always liked doing civilian characters based on Ben's watch aliens best.
  "
278961,"
   ...Whatever.
  ","
  Exactly.
  "
278962,"
   Pesky Dust + Hummungosaur? (the omnitrix failed again xD)

  HeatMix.

  Well, they are episodes, and they are all a little over 20 minutes long. OH! there will be credits at the end (possibly wrong).
  "
278975,"
   Does Maltruant know he's evil or is he one of those villains who think they're doing the right thing?

  He might.

  He's such a liar. You could try bribing him with some fresh fish!
  "
278978,"
   Why are people asking questions about the Skurd when they can just wait 8 hours?

  Because Ben 10 fans.
  "
278979,"

   Mr Wyatt you said you found Ben 10k Returns the weakest of UA. But given how much of Ov stems from that (Time Conflict, The Mulltiverse, Eon vs Paradox) it seems like it was a fav of the OV crew. It's one of my favs, aside from the lame Ben 10k it was classic comic cosmic stuff , one of DMD's best.
  ","
  No, I've never heard anyone say they liked that episode. The Ultimate Ben concept was just too weak after having seen Ben 10K in the original show. You're just doing the totally typical fan thing of reading in what you want to see, and it's just not there.

   Are dimensions and timelines basically the same in Ben 10? Mad Ben's world was called a dimension and a timeline too.
  ","
  This could really be a complicated question. When the timestream splits, creating an alternate timeline, that is also an alternate dimension. But in theory, you could have an alternate dimension that is not the result of a split in the timeline. It could exist without being affected by Ben's reality. I guess it partly depends on if the Big Bang created the universe, or the multiverse.

  If it's for the wiki, you should probably ask one of our guest writers who were only there one day a season or so. The wiki doesn't like me as a source because my facts don't fit with the wiki's head canon.
  
  Honestly, I think I answered this already. Some Khufans sleep in sarcophagi. The more well off of them do. The poorer mummy citizens can't afford them. So they are a kind of status symbol among the Thep Khufan wealthy elite.

  The bios are mostly right. We need to update Chromia. And Tux's body still looks nothing like Animated. So there are parts that work. But there are some parts that are pretty much just fanart/fanfic and do not line up with our intentions for the show, or the aesthetic of the show. Most people point out the board game, and the timeline. Sideways and the Omega Sentinels section are particularity egregious to me.
  
  You have to understand, we are given these hefty things to review WHILE we are working our normal full time day jobs. And Marty and I get no compensation from the Almanacs. So, I tried to do the best I could. I mostly concentrated on the bios, trying to get them in show style (because a bunch weren't), and trying to get the text to hook up with my head canon.
  
  My hope is that we can fix the book a little at a time, whenever IDW will do a new printing. It's still the best place to find the actual TFA models. People shouldn't be nasty to Jim and Bill.

   I'm curious as to how the storyline for the ""Charmcaster Trilogy"" (funny themed episode names, BTW) came about. Was it Matt Wayne's idea, Charlotte Fullerton's, or both? And how much of it was planned in advance compared to how much of it just came about as the writing team went along?
  ","
  I can't really remember in that instance. Usually it's a combination of the four of us and the writer. Although sometimes we have a solid idea going in to the storybreak before we've met with the episodic writer.

  ","
  I know a lot of people have been asking about Aggregor, so I'm going to use this question to explain my original idea for him. Before we started the Rooters, when I was first starting to think about the concept, I had the thought that we could kick off the arc by having Aggregor seek out Kevin. Aggregor's genetic material was to be breaking down, coming undone, he was degrading to a point that it was difficult for him to hold his human form. So he would go to Kevin for help, ultimately disclosing to Kevin that Ag was a Rooter experiment to duplicate Kevin's powers. Perhaps Ag's mind was wiped as well. The episode likely would have ended with Ag melting into ooze (dead?) and Kevin would have ended up pretty much where he did at the end of the first Rooters episode.
  
  I don't remember why we didn't go that way, I think maybe no one could work up any enthusiasm to do an Aggregor story. As a large part of the crew had worked on Ag's UA story arc, I don't think anyone was in any hurry to get back to him.
  
  One other thing that didn't get left out, but it did get kind of confused was the Prototech Armor. My original intention was that, unknown to Rook, he had been field testing this new prototype Prototech Armor FOR The Rooters. The Rooters would have been wearing the Armor because of Rook's successful testing of it for them. I can't really remember why this didn't get fixed either. Probably either it was too late, or no one cared enough to change it.
  
  Here's a little list of original ideas for the Rooters I put down on my phone so I wouldn't forget. The second name on the list was supposed to be the African American Plumber with the visor from the flashbacks. I'm blurring it out in case we want to save it for something else.

  No. Despite what the wiki says, every tiny little insignificant thing you somehow manage to imagine you see being some kind of homage is not always the case. Our homages have never been all that subtle. It's actually pretty easy to tell when we are homaging. All the wild grasping at straws really makes the crew shake their heads. If we intended for the Red Knight to have Batman ears, THEN HE WOULD HAVE THINGS ON HIS HEAD SHAPED LIKE BATMAN'S EARS. Ugh.

  Maybe a little similar. There are basically two ways I start with a designer working on a specific character. Either I provide them with a rough sketch of what I'm looking for, or I have them start the new character from scratch. When they turn their first pass in, it will either be approved for clean up, or I will draw notes on a post it over their drawing to show them what I am looking for.
  
  This is the character process, the BG, prop, and color design process is similar, without me doing so quite much drawing. I guess since I started as a character designer, that's where I put most of my drawing energies.

   Dear Mr. Wyatt, who are some of your favorite fellow Transformers artists? My three top favorites are Alex Milne, Sarah Stone, and Josh Nizzi. I hated Transformers 2 but I LOVE Nizzi's work, especially for Long Haul.
  ","
  Milne has evolved into something absolutely amazing. He has become one of my favorite TF artists of all time. I also love Sarah's work, it's amazing to have someone of her incredible painterly skill & talent on Transformers (Especially drawings Swindle as great as she does). I'm not as familiar with Nizzi, but I just recently saw a page he did that looked really fantastic. I definitely need to check out more. I always love to see Roche come back and do Transformers too, love his work.
  
  Tom Scioli is blowing my mind every issue with his whimsical crazy over the top retro take on TFs. I love it. If the Marvel comics looked like this back in the day, I probably would have liked them a lot more. I love both the Joshes, Perez and Burcham. Both have really amazing (and wildly vividly different) color skills, and both are also great TF artists in their own right as well. Oh and Guido too (though not as much when he does the Marvel G1 style). I'd love to see him do something set in the G1 cartoon universe. I miss EJ Su, he was turning into something quite unique and fascinating right before he left TF comics.
  
  I'm sure I'm missing someone (I didn't mention any of the current crop of amazing Manga artists), but that's a pretty decent list to start with.

   What's the bigget mistake about the wiki. Just tell me and please don't joke this time. I put a lot of effort to that wiki.
  ","
  I was only kidding about the fake wiki thing, Jeez!
  
  You guys have already taken a big step by trying to fix people's posting somewhat. The single biggest problem has always been that the wiki looks like it was run and written by non-English speaking foreign children and lazy illiterates (SPELL CHECK IS FREE AND TAKES NO TIME). Please understand, I'm not trying to bash people who speak other languages, Ben 10's international fans are hugely important to the franchise, and they should be welcome to contribute to the Ben 10 community because they love the show too. But there should be a moderator who fixes grammar and whatnot. And it does look like that is happening more now. But that's the single biggest issue, getting the articles to look like they are competently written.
  
  Here's a  paragraph from the wiki. It isn't riddled with spelling/grammar error or anything, but let's look at how it's written:
  
  ""In Omniverse, Hope returns to wearing a pink and purple color schemed coat. She has a bigger ponytail and her hair also has been dyed purple in some places. She now has black marks under her eyes. She is also now able to don heavy armor with skulls and the color of her stone creatures. Her ears also have two golden earrings.""
  
  What a clunky and strangely worded mess that is! I'm no writer, but isn't something like this nicer?:
  
  ""Omniverse's Charmcaster returns to a color scheme similar to the original series, while retaining the skirt and some thematic elements from her UAF appearance. Her stark white hair is now framed with purple highlights, and like the original series, she has her hair in a ponytail. She wears gothic ""Eye of Horus"" styled eye makeup and golden earrings. Charmcaster has developed the ability to merge with her Rock Monsters to create a secondary armored form, that retains the stone texture and color of her creatures.""
  
  Also, those ""trivia"" section factoids feel like they miss the mark like half the time. Just because YOU think something in the show reminds you of something else in pop culture, does not mean that was the creator's intention. The trivia section looks like it's written as if the info comes right from the creators, and it doesn't. If you are going to put those opinions in, at least write them as opinions, not as ""facts.""
  
  Sometimes it's really outrageous, the things that are considered to be ""canon"" or ""jokes"" over there. The whole Darkstar totem thing is still vaguely annoying. Whoever made the judgement call on that thing made a very foolish error. The counterpoint argument was groundless, and absolutely absurd.
  
  Everyone who works on the Ben 10 wiki should be looking at the Transformers wiki. TFWiki.net is widely considered to be one of the best fan wikis around.
  
  I hope this will be taken only for what it is: My personal opinions and constructive criticisms that I am giving because I was asked for them.

   It's me, Cheshire. Just wondering, have you guys moved to the renewed studio? I've only seen the first floor, but it was beautiful.

  It seems for now we are staying in the other building. It would be a pretty terrible time for us to move now.

what was the last movie you saw in theaters?

  I think it was Expendables 2.

   if formspring doesn't end up shutting down will you stay on this site or switch back to formspring?
  ","
  I'm thinking about just staying here anyway. Every time I look at the comments and questions on my formspring, it just depresses me with the state it has sunken to. It used to be super fun in the beginning, but now it's really not anymore, and that was the whole point to begin with.

  So far it's not quite as horrible as formspring. Let's hope it stays that way.
  "
281227,"
   Do you think that Omniverse is popular enough that the idea of an art book for Ben 10 is in the works like what happened with the AllSpark Almanac?
  ","
  I'm not sure. Ben 10 has a huge fanbase, especially internationally. But the fandom hasn't been around as long as Transformers has.

   Hi, I'm just getting into Ben 10 in general. I love Omniverse! I find it cool that Corey burton is using a Megatron-ish voice for Malware. It's like seeing Megatron again! Love this show, keep up the good work!

  Corey is pretty amazing. We try to have him back as often as we can.

   You've done it again, Derrick. How do you do it? I mean, you made Attea the most adorable girl in Omniverse so far, and she's a FROG. Are you a wizard?

  Cute girls are a good thing. Even if they are frogs.

281233,"

  Nope, no Sari Way Bads.

  She's your other wife.

281243,"
   How much would it take to get DiMaggio to do Rath in my cartoon?

  Let's see, you have to pay him at least union scale minimum, then you have to officially license Rath from Cartoon Network, THEN you have to pay John and CN residuals every time it airs until you die. Maybe like $90,000?

   Hello, Derrick! We're finally here, on this new spot of awesomeness! And once again, thumbs up for the one-hour special episode, The Frogs Of War! Say, Is it true that you design the Incursions for Ben 10 Alien Force?! Now, that's a surprise! Later!

   - أزمة العشرينيات .. لا أنت طفل فـ ترفض مواجهة العالم وتنعزل في غرفتك، ولا أنت كبير بما يكفي لتتحمل كل هذة المسؤولية والألتزامات والأضطرابات النفسية الأجتماعية، بعض أصدقائك تزوجوا ومنهم من هاجر او أسس مشروعه الخاص وهذا يشعرك إنك متأخر عنهم بكثير، و آخرين لا يفكرون الا في التفاهات وإضاعة الوقت بلا هدف حقيقي وبالطبع هذا يجعلك تشعر إنك اكبر منهم بكثير، لا تعرف بالضبط ما عليك فعله، الأيام تمر بسرعة مذهلة لكنك لا تشعر بها، كل يوم تكتشف كلمات والتزامات جديدة لكنك لا تفهم متى حدث كل هذا .؟!

   السبب مرات يكون بمحيطك

   يفكرون ب فشل المشروع او خسارته

   { أني أستاهل أنحب } ؟؟ ، عمركم سألتوا روحكم هالسؤال ؟ وشنو چان الجواب و لیش 💜🌻
  ","

   هذا السؤال يراودني من أشوف أشخاص يحبوني ويسألون علية وبعض الشغلات دون ذكرها .. ف اصفن أگول شنو بيه ينحب ؟؟ لأن دائماً الشخص مَ يحس بالصفات اللي يمتلكها ويحس بيها المقابل
   
   بس القريبين مني يحچولي انو اهتمامي او بعض الاشخاص چانوا يوصفوني ب
   
   ( حنان الام ) دائماً الشخص اللي يصدر منه شيء حَقيقي مَراح ينتبه ولا يحس ع نفسه
   
   مع ذلك كل شخص يمتلك ايجابيات وسلبيات بس أكو شي يطغي ع شي .

   ‏وقد صمم الزوجان الكبسولة على شكل بيضه

   ويضلّون طريقهم غالباً ومن ثم يجلسون يبكون بتفاهة مستفزة، ورغم ذلك فإنني أعتقد أن الأسوأ من هذا هو كوني شخصاً متناقضاً ومزاجياً إلى حد يسبب الدوخة، لي أولاً، ستجدني تارة مغنياً مجنوناً مولعاً بالصخب،
   
   مرة أخرى ستجدني كاتباً كئيباً توشك أن تكون أطراف أصابعه زرقاء داكنة أو رمادية اللون، مرة ثالثة ستجدني طفلاً طيباً له عينين صافيتين، وقد تجدني أيضاً شخصاً عادياً ومملاً كالذي يقوم بدور أحد المارة في مشهدٍ ما، وقد تراني ذكياً جداً أحياناً وغبياً بفداحة أحياناً أخرى،
   
   ولا تتعجب إن رأيتني أحبّك بشدة في لحظة وفي اللحظة التي تليها مباشرة أطردك.

   من المؤكد أنك ستصادف في حياتك شخص ،
   
   يكسر قلبك ، !
   
   ثم يرحل عنه ،
   
   و بعد زمن ليس بقليل يرسل لك قائلاً
   
   "" أردت الإطمئنان عنك ""
   
   لا تقع بذلك الفخ ،
   
   و اقطع باب الإطمئنان من المرة الأولى ،
   
   لا يخفى لك بأن رسالة الإطمئنان هذه ،
   
   ستعقبها رسائل ،
   
   و بعدها اتصالات ،
   
   و من ثم لقاء ،
   
   و من ثم كسر جديد ،
   
   البعض لا يحب حقيقة أن يتم تجاوُزُهم ،
   
   لذا تراه يحاول ربطك بماضيك معه بأية وسيلة ،
   
   هو ليس قلقاً بشأنك ،
   
   إنما قلق بشأنه عندك ،
   
   لا يريد أن يكون نكرة لديك ،
   
   بعد أن كان كل شيء ،
   
   ستصادف الكثير من القُبح في حياتك ،
   
   لكن الأقبح هو هذا ،
   
   من يؤلمك و يغيب ،
   
   ثم يأتي ليطمئن على وجوده في قلبك ،
   
   بينما هو يعيش حياته كما يحلو له ..!!

  *    سياسة  الاستجداع  العادل  *
  
  كيف تصبحين مقصرةً في شيء ليس واجبًا عليك من الأساس؟!
  
  قدمي خدمة لأحدهم مرة، وسينبهر، قدميها ذاتها للمرة  الثانية، وسينظر إليكِ كملاكه الحارس، قدميها للمرة الثالثة وستصبح تلك لمستك الخاصة في حياة هذا الشخص، قدميها الخامسة وسوف يتلقاها كحق طبيعي دون أدنى رد فعل. توقفي عن تقديمها في المرة الثانية عشر، عندها ستكونين مُقصِّرةً في حق هذا الشخص، بل لستِ جديرةً بمكانتك في حياته، بل إنه يستحق من هو  أفضل
  
  نحن نُربي فيهم الأخذ كل يوم، نزيد الجرعة كلما اعتادوا على تضحياتنا ولم تعد مبهرةً كفاية، لا نتوقف لنعد ما أنفقناه من وقت وعواطف، ونقارنه بما تلقيناه في المقابل، فنصبح مؤسسات، ثم تأتي عاصفة، نظن وقتها أننا سنجد كل هذه السنوات من التقديم والتضحيات، فلا نجد إلا أشخاصًا تلومنا أننا لم نعد نعطي.
  
  لا تتبعي ""الاستجداع"" بالآخر، لا تُسهِّلي كل شيء، لا تبتلعي التقصير، ولا ترضي بأقل مما تستحقين، ارحلي عندما لا تجدين تقديرًا، وإن سمعتِ قصة نجاح أخرى.. فكري مرتين، أتلك هي القاعدة، أم مجرد استثناء؟!

  أعلم أن رسائلي التي تحويك انقطعت ، و أنه لم يعد بمقدوري الكتابة عنك علناً ، هذا ما يُفرض عليّ لعدة أسباب بالطبع ، أولها ""مين انا""
  
  وماذا نكون، وما المُسميّات التي من الممكن أن تُطلق علينا
  
  لاشيء ، لا احد ، اثنان مُنفصلان منذ مُدة كان من الممكن أن أبدأ بها حياتي بعيداً عن هذه المتاهة عدة مرات، كما فعلت انت ، وكما لم استطع فعله انا ، كما نجوتَ انت وتركتني للغرق هُنا، كما هو الحال اليوم
  
  بدأت مرتين وثلاث وأربعة ، ثم علمت أن لا فائدة من البدايات المُتعفنة ، بداية تحمل رائحة سيئة لا يُمكن تحمّلها اكثر من بضعة أسابيع ثم إلقاءها في سلة المُهملات والهرولة للسرير والنوم ، النوم لأيام عديدة دون الوعي على ما يجري حولك
  
  انت لازلت مُلتصق بي، لا تسمح لي بالرجوع خطوة أو المشي أُخرى
  
  وها هي إحدى أُمنياتي في هذا العام أن أقوم بإلقاءك مُجدداً ، كما العام السابق ، وأعجز عن فعل ذلك مراراً ، ظننت بأني ذو إرادة ضعيفة ، ولكن لا علاقة بإرادتي في ذلك ، الأمر مُعقّد ، ولا يُمكن حلّه أبداً ، كالمعادلات الرياضية بالنسبة لي ، وإعراب جملة كاملة ، و شرب كأس من الحليب و الرجوع لحُب الشوكولاتة و شُرب الشاي ، أُحاول فعل كل تلك الأمور ، ثم بعد يومين ارى اني لم استطع ،
  
  وددت أن أُخبرك عن حالي والله ، ولكن استوقفني اليوم سؤال إحدى صديقاتي البعيدات ، لم أُحدّثها منذ أشهر طويلة ، ثم حين سألتني عن حالي نظرت حولي ، لم يتغير شيء ، ذات الملابس و القهوة الصباحية ، ذات الأحذية والمكان المُعتاد للجلوس ، جلدي ذاته ، وعيناي وقلبي ، وشوقي لك ذاته ، انا نفسي منذ عامين ، اجلس في ذات الزوايا ، أعدّ الايام ، انتظر مُعجزة لن تحصل ، وأُطالع الصور و ابكيِ ، حتى أن مُحاولاتي كُلّها وضعتها بجانب السرير وعدت للنوم .

  أهلاً وسهلاً ..
  
  الغيرة نابعة من الحب .. لكن في بعض الأحيان تكون سبباً للخلافات اذا ازدادت عن حدها الطبيعي ، ف تصبح الغيره هنا مبالغ فيها وهذا يأتي من عدة اسباب : منها تجارب او مواقف مسبقه تركت في داخلك شيئاً مما ادى الى انعدام الثقه في الطرف الآخر .. ويصبح الشك يلازمك لذلك تصبح الغيره عندك بما تسمى ( مرضيه ) بالتالي تؤذيك اولاً ، وتنفر عنك المقابل ثانياً ، وتسبب الملل والاختناق ثالثاً
  
  لذلك أساس كل علاقة ( الثقة ) .!

  لا اعـرف لماذا يضعون حـارس لثلاالموتى . لا اظن أحـدهم يـريد الـهرب ليلاً لأمنعه . ولماذا وافقت على هـذا العمل ؟؟ كلـها مخـيلات تـاتيني عندما أدخـل لتلك الثلاجه . و أجـد المـوتى يـرقدون دون أي صـوت ..
  
  فجأه كـأني أسـمع أحـدهم ينادي عليه !!  يـقول أنا لست ميت هيا أخـرجني بسرعة مـن هـنا الـرائحة تقتلني التفت لا اجـد أحـد .. لأخـرج وأكـمل الحراسه بين الممرات
  
  لـن أنسى ذلك اليـوم الـذي أتوا بجثه كـانت الـدماء تغطي القماش الملفوف عليه . لست شجاعاً لأرفـع الغطاء عـن وجة قال لي أحـدهم هـذا الشاب عمل حـادث  مؤسف فتحت بـوابة الثلاجه ووضعته كـأي جثه مرميه
  
  لحين أن يأتي المختصون لمعرفه أسباب المـوت . خـرجت من الثلاجه وجلست ، ثـم أخـرجت هاتفي لأجـد مـا يحدث في العالم وجـدت رساله مـن صديقي يخبرني بـها إن اذهب له مسرعاً ..
  
  بسرعه أخـرجت رقـمه وأتصلت علية . لأسمع صـوت الهاتف يـرن داخـل الـثلاجة .. تجمدت بمكاني لـم أصدق مـا يجري يا له مـن يـوم كئيب ..
  
  مرت سنة علـى هـذه الحـادثه أتفـقت مـع أصدقائي أنه لا يمكن مـسح أرقـامه مـن هـواتـفنا . لتبقى ذكـرى وحتى الـرسائل مـعة لـن نحذفـها وقمنا بالأحتفاظ بهاتفة ..
  
  وهـا أنا  مـازلت أرسل لـه رسائل أعتذار على عـدم قـدومي اليه  لعله يـرد علية . أرجـوكم لا تتركوا رسائل معلقة لعلها تـكون الأخيره  ..!

  علم السلوكيات .. ونصائح نفسية مهمة  ..

  أنصحك بأن تعطي كل شخص على قدر اهتمامه بك
  
  2- ستُدرك أنَّ نصف حُزنك لم يكن إلاَّ بفعل تحليلك العميق و تأمُلك الدقيق ، بينما الأمر لم يكن يتطلَّب إلَّا أن تتخطَّى الأمر دون تفكير .
  
  3- من كوارث البشر أنهم قد يمحون كل مواقفك الجميلة معهم مقابل موقف واحد لم يُعجبهم ... و هكذا أشخاص تركُهم أفضل لأنهم سوف يتعبون عقلك و قلبك.
  
  4- لا تكن هشاً ... أي ضربة تُسقطك و أي صدمة تضعفك ، و أي فشل يُعقدك ، كن قويًا ، فلا مكان للضعفاء في هذا الزمن.

   جدا احترم رأيج بس اني مسويت شي مجرد نشرت الاسك وهواي عجبتهم الفكره وقلدوها سؤال هو شنو الضرج اذا انتي فاهمه قصدي وهواي فهمو وقصدي واكو بالبدايه مفهمو بس من وضحت فهمو وضحكو واعتذرو زين هالشي مراح يفيدهم يخليهم المره الجايه يتأنون بالحكم ويفهمون اكثر يالله يجاوبون؟؟ اني هاي نيتي اخلي ثقافه الصبر للكل

  يعني اذا سؤالك حتى يتأنون بالحكم ، اكو هواي طرق .. شي طبيعي مثلاً اني قبل فتره كتبت بحسابي ( أنا أكبر من الله ) اكو ردات فعل جانت انو مصدومين اني داكفر و اكو فهموا قصدي
  
  بس هنا انت تختلف تماماً .. نفس الوقت ليش حددت الشيعه .؟ مثلاً السنه شبيهم ؟
  
  قصدي انو منستهدف فئه معينه
  
  نبتعد عن اي طائفيه ننسى هالشي .. هذا قصدي فقط . فاهمه انو قصدك شنو وتحياتي الك 🌸

  هيج اسكات ما اجاوبها بس گلت خلي اجاوبك عسى ولعل تاخذ ببعض الكلام ..
  
  عرفت انتَ قصدك ( ذبحهم من يذبحون الحيوانات ) لأن دخلت ع صفحتك ، طيب ليش بس الشيعه ذبحهم للحيوانات حلال .. والسنه كفار لو نكسين مثلاً ؟؟
  
  واذا كان قصدك للإستفزاز ف بهاي الطريقه راح تشبع اهانات من ردود بعض الناس يجوز انت عاجبك بعد ماادري
  
  شنو الفائده من الاسك هذا ؟ استفاديت شي لو راح نگول يا الله شوف هذا شگد لوتي وعبقري يا عيني احنه معايزين مشاكل حتى تدز هذا الاسك خلي نرتقي شويه
  
  لتضوج من كلامي بس ياريت نبتعد عن هاي الامور سواء مزح او غيرها وخلي نفكر بعواقب الأشياء قبل مَنسويها .

  ثُمَّ تهدي وروداً ..
  
  كُنْ واضِحاً ولا تشتتني
  
  كَفاك وعوداً ..
  
  لا تكن اليوم هارِباً مني ..
  
  وغداً عاشِقاً ودوداً ..
  
  الحُب ليس بين البين ..
  
  الحُب لا يرسم قيوداً ..
  
  فلِتَنتَبه لِقلبي .. ينجرف بسرعة
  
  فإن أعطى لا يعرف حدوداً ..
  
  وإن أعطى تراه جمراً ملتهباً ..
  
  تقابله بروداً ..
  
  أدر مشاعرك الى وجهتها ..
  
  فإما يكون ميتاً نحوي .. أو مولوداً ..!

  من الأخير : لتخلي جهازك ب إيد أي شخص ،
  
  ب ثواني يخترق اي برنامج وخاصةً واتساب :)
  
  اما الأختراق عن طريق USB
  
  في هذا الأسلوب يقوم المخترق بصنع فلاش usb بمجرد أن يضعها في الجهاز المستهدف يقوم بجمع الباسوردات المحفوظة بالجهاز
  
  لكن كيف برامج الحماية لاتكشفها ؟!
  
  يقوم المخترق بتثبت برنامج خاص بعرض كلمات السر المحفوظة في الجهاز لكن كيف يعمل البرنامج تلقائيا يقوم المخترق بأدارج أوامر تشغيل البرنامج وبذلك يشتغل البرنامج بمجرد وضع usb في الجهاز وعند فتح usb يجد المخترق ملف text به جميع كلمات السر المحفوظة في الجهاز .!

  حَسناً ، سَأُخبرك عنّي :
  
  ذَوقي غير مُستقِر في الأَغاني ، مِثل مَزاجي تماماً .
  
  أحياناً أَجِد الإستماع للأغاني القديمة مُمل و أحياناً أُقدّسه .
  
  أحياناً تُزعجني الأغاني الصَاخبة و أحياناً أنا أُزعِجُها مِنْ فَرط إستماعي إليها !
  
  مُشكلتي أنّ إعجابي بالأشياء لا يَدوم طويلاً ، و بالأشخاص أيضاً !
  
  أُركّز جداً علي تفاصيل كُل شيء ، كأنّني أبحث عن الكَمال و أنا نَاقص أو بمعنى آخر أبحث عن إكتمال نقصي .
  
  أَغلب الأحيان ألتزِم الصَمت ، لا أَفرِض وجودي في التُجمعات ، لكن هُدوئي يَفرض وجوده !
  
  لا أَتأثر طويلاً بإنتقاد أحد لي ، هذا إذا تأثرتُ أصلاً .
  
  أُحب الأشخاص الغريبين ومن لديهم هوس بالملاحظة و ( التدقيق )
  
  أُفكر كثيراً في نهايتي . .
  
  مَاذا أُريد ؟ و مَاذا أكون ؟

  يضيفك شخص بأسم بنت اي حساب وهمي و يراقبك بوقت انت مموجود عالفيس ، راح يخليك ادمن بصفحة مسيئة ( بيج ) ... مثلاً صفحة اسمها داعش و يحط عليها اعلام و رايات و كتابات ونعرف انو الفيس بوك يحارب هاي الانواع من الصفحات و يروح يبلغ عالصفحة من حساب ثاني انها منظمة ارهابية راح تطير الصفحة و يطير حسابك وياها رأساً .!
  
  --
  
  شغله ثانيه يضيفك حساب ب اسم صديقك لاتوافق اللا تتأكد هو صديقك فعلاً يلا ..
  
  لأن هذا الحساب يضيفك حتى ينتحل شخصية حساب صديقك ، بس يبلغ ع صديقك ع انه ينتحل شخصيته راح يطير الحساب .!

  داومت اول سنه محاضرات مجانيه
  
  مارست اختصاصي اتطلعت على الماده
  
  يعني صار تغيير حسيت داسوي انجاز
  
  وان كان بسيط
  
  حلو انك تمارس عملك وتتعب والاهم من ذلك انو تنجح ب إيصال المعلومه ومدى تفاعل الطلاب وياك هالشي مو بسهوله ترا لأن
  
  الطالب اذا كره الاستاذ راح يكره الماده
  
  ف يحتاجلها شويه تركيز حتى تكسب طلابك .!

  بما إنو بعض الإجابات ع سؤالي الأخير بيهم اللي عدهم اصدقاء من الجن والبعض عدهم قرين عاشق
  
  وسمعت كم قصه .. صادفني قبل كم يوم اعراض الجن العاشق وتعالوا إقروها شوفوا عدكم .؟!
  
  ..........
  
  اعراض الجن العاشق
  
  ● أبعاد والتقصير الانسان عن واجباته الدينية .
  
  ● كثرة الاحتلام (تكراره) في النوم واليقظة .
  
  ● أن يشعر أنّ هناك من ينام معه ويحتضنه في الفراش .
  
  ● أن يشعر بالإثارة دائمة وهو لوحده ( حب العزلة ) يشعر الإنسان بالمعاشرة الكاملة ( كأنه زوج مع زوجته )
  
  ● يشعر بالأرق والقلق والإرهاق عندما يستيقظ .
  
  ● عدم الرغبة في الزواج والنفور منه .
  
  ● إذا كان متزوج فأنه لا يطيق الطرف الآخر ( ينفر منه نفوراً شديد )
  
  ● عدم الرغبة الطبيعية في المعاشرة الزوجية ، وإذا تم فإنه يتم عن غير رغبة داخلية ولكن يكون لإرضاء الطرف الآخر .
  
  ● إذا تم معاشرة زوجية فإنه يصحبها ضيق نفسي وبعدها يصاب بإعياء وتعب شديد .
  
  ● بعض النساء ترى من يظهر لها عاريا ً.
  
  ● الكسل و الخمول وكثرة النوم .

  وبعدها نقلت مهنتها للولايات المتحدة الأمريكية وتوفت سنة 1933 ... لو هناك مقاييس جمال الإنسانية .. كانت تكون ماري آن بيڤان تحصل على لقب ( أجمل إمرأة في العالم ) ❤️

  استراليا تشيد طريق طوله 2000 كم
  
  خاص للسيارات الكهربائية  !!!!!
  
  بعد إعلان بريطانيا وفرنسا ، بأنهما سيوقفان بيع
  
  السيارات التي تعمل بالبنزين ابتداءاً من عام 2040
  
  فاجأت استراليا الجميع ، اليوم بأنها تشيد طريق
  
  خارجي طوله 2000 كم ، خاص للسيارات الكهربائية
  
  إذ يحتوي على 18 نقطة أو محطة شحن كهربائية ،
  
  تشحن السيارة خلال 30 دقيقة ..!!
  
  جاء هذا بعد إعلان أعلنه وزير البيئة الأسترالي ووزير
  
  الطرق بالإنابة السيد ستيفن مايلز .
  
  وايضاً سينفع هذا الطريق بتقليله مخلفات البنزين والديزل ، الشعب المرجانية الاسترالية المهددة بالموت
  
  نتيجةً الحرارة الزائدة والتلوث البيئي ، لتنتعش ثانية
  
  وتنمو ..!

  كثرة الكذب تغير من تركيب الدماغ ..!!
  
  هل شعرت بالعار أو الذنب ، حين تكذب ؟  نعم فهذا شعور عام تقريباً مسؤول عنه جزء في الدماغ اسمه الاميغدالا amygdala .
  
  في دراسة حديثة نُشرت في in Nature Neuroscience ، عن عادة الكذب ، فقد وجدت الدراسة ان الكذب يغير من تركيبة الدماغ .
  
  حيث وجد العلماء بعد دراسة أجريت على مجموعة متطوعين ، بأن كثرة الكذب تؤثر على منطقة العواطف والدوافع ، وهي تحديداً في منطقة الاميغدالا amygdala .
  
  فعندما نكذب لتحقيق مكاسب شخصية او مالية تقوم  الاميغدالا amygdala  بأنتاج أستجابة سلبية لهذا التصرف الخاطئ و السيئ ، وهي بذلك تحدد من استمرارنا بالكذب .
  
  ماوجده العلماء ان الاستمرار بالكذب ، يؤثر على تلك الاستجابة ويعمل على تحجرها والتخفيف منها ، وبالتالي يتساهل الدماغ مع الكذب ويصبح الامر عادياً بالنسبة له وهذا يقود لآصابة الدماغ لما يسمى بالكذب المرضي .!

  سؤالچ بصورة عامة م خصصتي شي معين .! لذلك إجابتي حتكون طويلة ، لكل شيء تاريخ صلاحية  الأشياء الجميلة تنتهي لنفاذ وقتها مثلاً أيام الجامعة بالنسبة الي حلوة وانتهت كيف اعيدها ؟
  
  اما بالنسبة للعلاقه ك ان تكون حب او صداقه كثير من الاسباب تنهيها هذا يعني أساس هذه العلاقه لم يبنى على اسس صحيحة قد تخلوا من ( الصدق والإحترام ) او قد تكون علاقة مصلحة تنتهي بإنتهاء المصلحة
  
  بالنسبة الي اخر شي حلو انتهى كان مع صديقتي والسبب ( استغفال وكذب وخيانة ) والخاين عمرة م راح يتوب ولا يتعدل لذلك ( لا أسعى ) لإعادتها بأي شكل من الأشكال ..!

  ( حتى اذا حبيت شخص وعرفت هو مرتبط راح تتـركه ) .. !!
  
  اوك بس مراح تبطل تحبه لأن انت حبيته مو بيدك لحتى تبطل تحبه و' الحب ' اني اخذته بصورة عامه يعني ميقتصر على حب شاب لـ بنت او العكس  .!!
  
  زين حبيت شخص قبل متشوفه مثلاً وبعد فترة شفته وطلع محلو ، راح تبطل تحبه ؟ اذا جوابك ( اي ) معناها الحب هذا بسبب چنت متخيله حلو .. مع زوال هذا السبب زال حبك اله ، و اذا شفته محلو وضليت تحبه معناها انت حبيته بلا سبب مو لشكله
  
  نجي نقطه ثانيه .. حبيت شخص ورا فتره اكتشفت انه مطلوب للعداله ..!! راح تعوفه ؟! طبعاً لا
  
  مع ذلك كل شخص ورأيه وآني هذا رأيي ..!!

  - نحن الجيل الذي كثيراً ما أفسد الشرائط الكاسيت بالضغط على الزر الأحمر .
  
  - نحن الجيل الذي شاهد نهاية بث القناة بعدما ينتهي بثها شششششششش .
  
  - نحن الجيل الذي كان يجمع اعواد المثلجات وعلب اعواد الكبريت
  
  نحن الجيل الذي قضى طفولته على قناتين فقط شاهدنا فيها توم وجيري ونيلز وماروكو وخماسي وكابتن ماجد .
  
  - نحن الجيل الذي كان يأخذ في العيد ٢٥٠ دينار يصرف منه ولا ينتهي .
  
  - نحن الجيل الذي كان يخاف لو قال له احدهم هذا عيب ويقول اسف لو أخطأ .
  
  نحن الجيل الذي كانت جمعته العائلية تفرح وفرحته تخرج من القلب .
  
  - نحن الجيل الموجود الان ولكنه ميت من الداخل ..!!

  نجحت فتاة في قبول طلبها لمحكمة بريطانية ، بتجميد نفسها .
  
  فقد طلبت فتاة تبلغ من العمر 14 عام بعد صراع طويل مع مرض نادر من امراض السرطان ، من قاضي محكمة بريطانية ، أن تجمد بعد موتها ، بناء على طلبهم وفقاً لشروط معينة طبقاً لتقنية أسمها cryonics ، حيث تتم عملية تجميد الانسان مادام هناك نشاط عصبي في دماغه ، أملاً ان يتم بعد مئات السنين ربما أيقاضها ومعالجتها من مرضها العضال ، عند تطور التكنولوجيا .
  
  حيث ذكرت الفتاة في رسالة لها للقاضي :
  
  (( أنا فقط في الرابعة عشر من العمر واني لا أريد الموت ، ولكني أعلم أني سأموت .
  
  وأعتقد ان حفظ جسدي بواسطة عملية cryonics ، ستعطيني فرصة للشفاء والاستيقاظ حتى لو بعد مئات السنين ))
  
  وقد تم بالفعل الموافقة على طلبها والذي تم بظروف قانونية غير مسبوقة في بريطانيا ،  وارسالها للولايات المتحدة ، وادخلت لعملية التجميد في الساعة ال 5 مساء ، يوم 25 أكتوبر 2016 ، بعد أيام من وفاتها ، واصبحت المريضة رقم 144 الذين تم تجميدهم  .
  
  * حيث تتم العملية بأستبدال الدم بمادة cryoprotectant ، وهي مادة تحفظ أنسجة الجسم من التضرر ، ثم بعد ذلك يتم تجميد الجسم بالنيتروجين .
  
  ** يجدر الذكر ان ابتكار عملية الحفظ بالتجميد تم العمل بها في ستينيات القرن الماضي وتوقف العمل بها لمحددات أخلاقية ودينية .
  
  ملاحظة / عملية التجميد هذه لم تثبت علمياً ، وهي مثيرة للجدل في الاوساط العملية .

  لو تشوفيها محجبه ولابسه قصير || زين من ضميتي شعرج ولبستي قصير شگلتي ؟! او محجبه ولابسه قميص عالخصر وجينز كلش فاهمين الحجاب غلط ..!!

  ﴿ أنـتِ رائعـة ﴾ كلمة قد تجعـل امراة عاديـه تسيـر كالـطاووس بـين حشـد مـن النسـاء الفاتـنات .
  
  ﴿ أنـت غـبي ﴾ كلمـة قـد تكـسـر هِمـّة طفـل نبيـه وتقفـل أبـواب عقـله عـن الاستيعـاب .
  
  ﴿ أنـت سـاذج ﴾ كلـمة قـد تحـول أنسـان طيب القـلب الى انسـان شـرس يقـسـوا حـتـى يـغـسـل كل سـمـات الطـيبة مـن شـخـصـه .
  
  ﴿ أنت قـادر ﴾ كلمـة قـد تحـرض معـوق على كسـر حـدود الاعـاقـة بـما يعـجز عـنه أصحـاء الـبدن هـي كلمـة واحـدة
  
  أو كلـمـات عـديـدة قـد تشكـل فـارقـاً كبـيراً...
  
  فَ أحـرص على انتقـاء كلمـاتـك فالإنسـان الأنيـق فـي تعاملـه وحديثـه : يقتـحـم أعمـاق كـل مـن يقـابـله ويحظـى بإحـترام الجمـيع بطـريقتـه || كـن بسيـطاً تكـن أجمـل ™..!!

  والنساء لهن الجمال الذي يفوق الحور ،، البعض كانوا يعتقدون حور عين للنساء والرجال وهذا خاطئ لأنه حور عين نساء فقط حسب ما اطلعت عليه مسبقاً والبعض الآخر يعتقدون ان النساء لهن حور عين بمعنى ( نساء ) وهذا ايضاً مفهوم خاطئ .!!

  أن قلنا سنة و قتلوه فَـ هـذا يعني إستغـنوا عن سنـة رسـول الله فقتلـوه أي أنهـم لا يتبعـون سـنن النبـي و شرائـع دينـه
  
  و أن قلنـا شيعـة علي قتلـوه أي أنهـم خرجـوا عن ملة الإمـام و العـروة الوثقـى فَ غـدروا بـالـحـسـين
  
  فَ هم لا سنـة و لا شيعـة هـُم يتظاهـرون بالإسـلام
  
  والإسـلام منهـم بـراء هـذا السـؤال نتيجـة اللبـس و الخلـط بالأوراق .!!
