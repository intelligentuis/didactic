like that s just messed up and saddening . i just wonder what is going through their minds when they decide to cheat on their loved one . and then their significant other starts to think negatively like they weren t good enough or worth it to their partner and that s sad . i wouldn t take a cheater back because once they ve done it what makes you think they won t do it again ? like i ve seen it once someone does something they re very likely going to do it again .","837478":"just read what was said above","837479":"you just have to show them that they can trust you again not only by your

anon we are just being super cute with each other ! and yes , i have the crown currently and it s going to be very hard for you to get it back like very impossible but i love seeing you try !","837515":"well i know it takes time to get over someone believe me i would know . but the best thing to do is to try and get closure from the person you re trying to get over but if they can t give you closure i suggest you just slowly forgive them and try to forget and think about other things that make you happy . do things you enjoy so you can keep your mind off of them . and do not look at their social media you should just block them so you don t get the temptation to look at it . trust me you ll get over them it just takes time . the most important thing to do is to go out and do things you enjoy and things that make you happy .","837516":"no i wouldn t want him to do that","837517":"yeah , i get what you re saying","837518":"no no that s not true at all . we both put the same
