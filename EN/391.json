something to be taken lightly regardless of how obnoxious a person is being. you're not acting any better than they are by literally telling someone to end their life.\n  ","419834":"\n  depends on

probably stems from the idea that women were (and still partially are) considered \"dumber\" than men so a dumb women would have been more attractive to men in the past. the tradition has probably

talk about this fuckin sweetheart of a puppy, omggg.\n  ","419846":"\n  ???\n  \n  allison isn't copying me, she's waiting for my results from 23andme to see if it's worth it. i don't blame her, the

 there's evidence that puberty blockers are detrimental to the natural development of children from adolescent through the teen years, so it would be harmful to stunt their puberty.\n  ","419849":"\n  if they can afford it, then i see no reason for the parents not to contribute. however, the price of tuition is absolutely ridiculous so i can never expect a family to pay for the entire thing.\n  \n  there are also options such as scholarships and grants that the student can look into while applying to colleges. or they can take out a loan & pay it back after they've graduated.\n  ","419850":"\n  what country do you live in ?? that sounds ideal.\n  ","419851":"\n  lol, hell no. i live in the united states and education is very expensive. the only way people get through college for free is if they get in on full ride scholarships.\n  ","419852":"\n  our last disagreement was over politics, haha. it was a long time ago, though, so i don't remember the details of the disagreement but we ended up agreeing to disagree and left it at that.\n  ","419853":"\n  no, it isn't his decision to make. regardless, he's never had an issue with any of my hair colors because he knows it's my decision alone.\n  ","419854":"\n  needing space is normal in any kind of relationship, especially if a person requires more alone time or works through their issues better when they're alone. my boyfriend and i take space from each other occasionally, since he's the type of person who needs alone time to really think and get his sh*t together.\n  \n  the silent treatment, on the other hand, is borderline abvsive. you're purposely withholding contact from someone to hurt them, and that isn't healthy by any means.\n  ","419855":"\n  yeah, that isn't fair to you -- relationships should be about compromise, which means that if something doesn't work out then you come to a mutual agreement that benefits both of you. it ideally shouldn't be one way or the other.\n  \n  you're worth more than that, and you shouldn't have to rearrange your life to fit around his schedule and needs. you're just as important.\n  ","419856":"\n  occasionally, yeah. however, it's also a bit destructive to think about ideas like that because you realistically should be focusing on the present moment with your partner and making the best out of the moments in front of you.\n  \n  the thought crosses my mind since i'm always terrified of him breaking up with me, but being mindful of the present and the things he does every day to prove his love helps.\n  ","419857":"\n  well technically there are a few shades of purple in there. but i didn't really decide on a color, i just told my stylist that i wanted a magenta to lavender to purple gradient and i gave her the creative freedom to do what she felt looked best.\n  ","419858":"\n  yooo, my stylist came through with those pictures !!\n  \n  check out the (much better) photos from today. i'm legit in love with this transformation.\n  ","419859":"\n  i have a lot of apps on my phone, so it depends on which ones you're talking about. i use various social media apps like fb, instagram, snapchat, tumblr, and twitter. i also have a few photo editing apps, such as vsco & afterlight.\n  \n  i also have apps for banking, shopping, music, and food.\n  ","419860":"\n  so i took some crappy, amateur photos of my hair since i'm too impatient to wait for my hair stylist to send me the photos she took this afternoon.\n  \n  soooo... here's my hair !! i'm obsessed.\n  ","419861":"\n  i went to a comedy show last night for the first time, and i was nearly crying from laughing so hard. stand up comedy has always amused me, especially when the comedian talks about really dark material and makes light of their life and struggles. it's always been more relatable to me.\n  ","419862":"\n  i personally don't believe it should be legal for the drinking age to be lower than 21 in the united states. honestly, i even think 21 is a bit young for people to be able to legally drink because there are still a lot of issues regarding young adults and drinking, especially when it comes to driving.\n  \n  i can't imagine the drinking age being any lower than it is now because that would only increase the risk of drunk driving.\n  ","419863":"\n  yeah, but it's a few years old. i don't necessarily need a new one, but my boyfriend definitely does so i would buy him a car.\n  ","419864":"\n  if i magically woke up with $1 million in my bank account, lmao.\n  ","419865":"\n  i feel as if i've been losing control of my life and i'm so close to hitting rock bottom again. idk how to fix what i've done and i have absolutely no self control, my impulsivity is skyrocketing and i don't even care about the consequences of my actions. i put on a good front but in reality, i'm a fucking wreck.\n  ","419866":"\n  my boyfriend and i were playing with his dog, his dog ended up tripping over himself because he's so clumsy.\n  ","419867":"\n  i never understood why people post pictures or videos of themselves crying on social media.\n  \n  idk about you guys, but i have an ugly af crying face. i definitely wouldn't want that on display.\n  ","419868":"\n  i buy cost effective products. most off brand products generally have the same active ingredients as their brand counterparts, so most of the time, you're just paying for the brand name.\n  ","419869":"\n  writing, editing, painting, time management, and drinking copious amounts of coffee in one sitting.\n  ","419870":"\n  just be upfront and honest with them -- they deserve to know the truth, as difficult as it will be. explain your feelings to them as well as you can and answer any questions they have.\n  ","419871":"\n  no, not that i can recall.\n  ","419872":"\n  people who sacrifice themselves for the betterment of their families, like parents who have to work long hours to bring food to the table for their children and others who put their own lives at risk to help other people on a daily basis.\n  ","419873":"\n  when i traveled to austin, texas, for a gaming convention, i experienced quite a culture shock. as i'm originally from new york, i'm not used to people actually being nice to me on the street or in facilities, so it was a dramatic change to actually be in a place where people were friendly and courteous and had hospitality.\n  ","419874":"\n  ideally, i'd like for everything of mine to be deleted. however, i can barely remember the passwords to most of my accounts, so that seems a bit unrealistic haha.\n  ","419875":"\n  my fish died. :'(( i'm so heartbroken.\n  ","419876":"\n  there's so such thing as being too old for success. many people reach the peak of their careers after they've turned 40, 50, and even 60.\n  \n  however, if you're under the mentality that you're too old already then you're already setting yourself up for failure. success is attained when you believe in yourself and work hard to achieve your goals regardless of the obstacles in front of you.\n  ","419877":"\n  i'm sorry you have to endure that, ugh. but you're right -- just put in the work until you have what you need to move forward & then you can put it all behind you.\n  ","419878":"\n  arrogance, where that person thinks that they know better than anyone else regardless of credentials or knowledge. they usually need to have the last word in of every argument and think that everyone else is wrong except themselves.\n  \n  i know one or two people with that trait, and it's terrible.\n  ","419879":"\n  my day was fine -- exhausting, but fine. there was a lot of police activity in the area because they unearthed a dead body close to where i work, so it took me much longer to get home than usual. there were helicopters everywhere.\n  \n  i'm just looking forward to sitting down and drinking some coffee because my mind has been a wreck today.\n  ","419880":"\n  i never really understood the purpose of anonymously telling a person to quit doing whatever vice they're doing, as if that person is actually going to heed their words.\n  \n  i'm going to live my life regardless of how you think of it, and when i deem it's time to quit, i will quit. you're wasting your breath by trying to convince me otherwise.\n  ","419881":"\n  i've been weaning myself off of cigarettes slowly, but i don't really have any intentions on quitting completely yet.\n  ","419882":"\n  because i smoke cigarettes, among other life threatening and risky behavior.\n  ","419883":"\n  i don't even expect myself to see 50 tbh, that's pushing it a wee bit.\n  ","419884":"\n  people gain by trust through earning it -- close friendships, loyalty, chemistry, etc etc. i don't trust most people and i don't willingly give out my trust to people whom i don't know well, and it does take a while for me to warm up to someone.\n  ","419885":"\n  you're right, i should just ingest every unhealthy food i see because not caring about one facet of my health means i shouldn't care about any facets of my health at all.\n  ","419886":"\n  my boyfriend and i accidentally took a three hour nap when we went on vacation last weekend, if that counts. we passed out so hard that we didn't get up until 9:30pm.\n  ","419887":"\n  i just know i want to be happy, and i kinda know how to get there, but it's going to be a long and continuous process.\n  ","419888":"\n  i've come to realize that if you have high expectations in life then you're going to ultimately be disappointed. as a result, i try not to have any expectations in general.\n  ","419889":"\n  life versus death -- typically, the notion that some people think they have the moral high ground to take the life of another person if they're deemed too much of a danger to society, much like the whole \"for the greater good\" mentality.\n  \n  it's interesting to think about because mostly everyone has a different notion of what morality really means.\n  ","419890":"\n  i have a lot -- heathers, queen of the damned, the crow, american psycho, the lord of the rings, the punisher, girl interrupted, and sweeney todd, just to name a few.\n  ","419891":"\n  hello ~~\n  \n  i'm fine, just drinking alcohol after what turned out to be a terrible end to my evening in an attempt to feel better. the last two days have been beautiful because my boyfriend and i took a spontaneous mini-vacation, but i walked into a shitshow when i got home. :\/\/ i'm so done.\n  ","419892":"\n  talking shit about me behind my back & trying to turn my friends against me simply because they didn't agree with my perspectives on things.\n  \n  obviously i cut them out of my life, as well as the people who believed them.\n  ","419893":"\n  depends on the circumstance, since some people are negative for realistic reasons and others are negative because they're willfully ignorant of the brighter side of things.\n  \n  sometimes my boyfriend can have a negative outlook on things, especially if he's going through a rough patch, but i usually try to remind him of the things that *are* going well in his life and that he's strong and can survive everything that's thrown his way.\n  ","419894":"\n  i wish it was cold outside. i've been craving cold, late nights with bonfires and brews.\n  ","419895":"\n  yes, if there's one thing i've learned in life, it's to take responsibility for my own actions and mistakes. i have no issue with owning up to the wrong things i've done because i always know there's room for improvement.\n  ","419896":"\n  i think it's both, but mankind certainly is making the severe progression of global warming even worse due to our actions, especially when it comes to agriculture.\n  ","419897":"\n  i remember those days, ugh. getting back to college was always the worst but eventually you'll get into the groove of it. i kinda miss attending classes and learning.\n  ","419898":"\n  usually landscapes, or things with trees within them. this is one of the paintings i've done.\n  ","419899":"\n  experiences !! there's nothing better than spending money on going on a vacation because you make so many memories in the meantime.\n  ","419900":"\n  i used to dabble in photography, but lately i've been writing and painting. it's always been a good form of emotional release for me.\n  ","419901":"\n  curly fries are the bomb.\n  ","419902":"\n  i'm absolutely against animal hunting, unless it's for survival purposes. as a sport, there's no reason for it.\n  ","419903":"\n  you've never seen them before tbh.\n  ","419904":"\n  somewhat, yeah -- or at least severely reduced in price. the cost of tuition these days is absolutely ridiculous and should be more affordable for people with low income.\n  ","419905":"\n  i don't really know my neighbors besides the old man who lives next door. he's an asshole and yells at the landscapers who cut my lawn.\n  ","419906":"\n  heathers is one of my *favorite* movies!! i've never seen the show or the musical, but i've watched the movie countless times.\n  \n  winona ryder & christian slater ... oh my god. i love dark films like that.\n  ","419907":"\n  the last time my card was about to expire, they automatically sent me a new one in the mail.\n  ","419908":"\n  if i killed someone accidentally, i don't think i would be able to forgive myself because it was likely preventable, and i have a tendency to hold onto certain things that i've done and wish that i could have done them a different way.\n  \n  if it was in self-defense, then i don't think i would feel as strongly about it because there's justification for my actions, especially considering i would think my life was in extreme danger.\n  ","419909":"\n  it isn't normal, but it's definitely a side effect of your BPD because we constantly need reassurance and validation, and if our loved ones aren't in contact with us, we feel as if they're purposely harming us by withholding contact.\n  \n  i don't think you should cut ties at all. you have to try to rationalize to yourself that this person is living their own life and may not have time to text you back as often as they would like, and it isn't being done in a malicious manner. they have no reason to purposely ignore you, and you have to remind yourself of that.\n  \n  idk if this helps or not, but i do understand exactly how you feel because i've lashed out for the same reasons regarding certain people in my life when i've felt ignored too. it's shitty but you have to be mindful of everything and take into consideration things that are going on in their lives as well.\n  ","419910":"\n  it doesn't annoy me, but it makes me wonder why people even say those things to begin with, especially considering i don't post any photos of my body on the internet.\n  ","419911":"\n  i honestly don't remember, lol. it's probably been a few months. i do all of my banking online and via my banking apps.\n  ","419912":"\n  you perish into the earth.\n  ","419913":"\n  obviously -- unless you die.\n  ","419914":"\n  i'm drinking, ask me questions ~~\n  ","419915":"\n  my boyfriend and i are taking a mini vacation tomorrow !! we reserved a hotel room, and the hotel has a bar and restaurant inside of it so we're gonna get drunk and eat good food and then go back to the hotel room and watch shitty tv and play music and board games.\n  \n  then the next day we're going to a huge aquarium to see sharks, and i'm so so excitedddd. :'))\n  ","419916":"\n  my life has been chaotic, confusing, yet joyful all at the same time.\n  ","419917":"\n  i would probably break up with him, especially if he tried to hide it from me and act as if nothing was wrong. i won't stand for being disrespected in such a way and it's one of the worst forms of betrayal.\n  ","419918":"\n  i don't concern myself with other people's opinions. people have the right to believe what they desire, obviously as long as they're not a threat to themselves or to others in the process.\n  ","419919":"\n  no, i'm usually grateful that he shares his thoughts and feelings with me when he's going through a difficult time. he's generally a very closed-off person, so the fact that he's revealing himself to me in such an emotional way shows how comfortable he is.\n  \n  if i'm in a bad place too, i'm somewhat able to compartmentalize my feelings so that i can help him the best way i can.\n  ","419920":"\n  the fact alone that they're insulting a person simply because they disagree with them says a lot about who they are as a person. you can disagree with someone without making it personal and insulting a person, whether it's due to their looks or their personality.\n  ","419921":"\n  my boyfriend and i are taking a mini spontaneous vacation tomorrow. :'))\n  ","419922":"\n  i've always dreamed of traveling across the country via car and visiting the grand canyon. i haven't done it yet because i don't have the time or

while the prospect of having a child might be hurtful to some relationships, it's usually because the relationship itself is flawed in some significant way to the point where neither person can handle

shows that they don't care enough about your relationship to work actively to improve themselves.\n  \n  i'm assuming this means a *big* mistake, though. not something insignificant like leaving a dirty dish in the sink, lol.\n  ","420014":"\n  it depends entirely on the situation. however, just because you have problems trusting others doesn't necessarily mean that you have a problem per say ; lacking trust in others is usually an outcome of an environmental cause, you're given a strong reason not to trust other people because you've been betrayed so often in the past.\n  \n  that doesn't imply that not trusting others is wrong since it's a normal reaction to being betrayed, manipulated, or abvsed. for example, i have problems trusting people but i don't really consider it a personal

because he's essentially a victim of abvse, and throughout the series, you can see him trying to break free from the reins of his family's expectations but nevertheless still being held back against his will. you realize as the series goes on that he has genuinely been brainwashed into believing what he does by his father, and he doesn't want to live that lifestyle at all.\n  \n  chloe price, on the other hand, has always been a relatable character to me because of her strength, impulsivity, reckless need to escape, and passion for her friends. she's one of the most unpredictable and

","420058":"\n  LOL, this is true. these days, i've just been deleting 99 percent of \"\"questions\"\" or other crap people have sent me. i've noticed an alarming increase in the amount of anons

in pursuit of your own happiness. you're doing things that are rewarding and fulfilling and living your life to its fullest extent.\n  \n  this is subjective and it varies depending on the person, though. good can mean different things to different people.\n  ","420087":"\n  i don't really believe there's a correlation between strength and the amount of friends a person has. however, having no friends can be a lonesome existence and in some circumstances can make life harder because it means you don't have a support system.\n  ","420088":"\n  lmfao, no. mariah wouldn't be anonymous on my

i'm following a plan, but in reality, things are falling apart and i'm losing control. i have no idea what i'm doing or how to get to where i need to be, and that scares the shit out of me.\n  ","420092":"\n  i never disagreed with that part of it -- if it's posing a sanitary hazard, then yeah that's obviously gross if the glass wasn't clean.\n  \n  when people used to come to my house, i would clean and tidy things up to look presentable. but to have the house pristine 24\/7 is a bit uncommon. it's an ideal setting but a lot of people don't have the opportunity to deep cleanse as often as you do.\n  ","420093":"\n  i never said you were too young to have kids. i was insinuating that when you have children, it'll be harder to keep the house clean all the time like it is now.\n  \n  either way, perhaps i'm coming from a different perspective because my family has never had a pristine home even though i do routinely clean.\n  ","420094":"\n  if you're worried about gossip and have the time to keep your house pristine 24\/7, then i'm assuming you're very young and don't have children.\n  \n  i don't have children either, but i'm realistic and know that you can't keep a house clean 24\/7. it's unreasonable.\n  ","420095":"\n  yeah, that's incredibly rude. no one's house is perfect and they're probably even more aware of the state of their house than you are, you don't need to be rude about it.\n  \n  if it's causing a sanitary issue, that's a different problem. but if there are a few dishes in the sink and the cabinets are a bit dusty, then that's not a big deal at all because everyone's house is like that.\n  ","420096":"\n  yeah, it's a pain in the ass. that's mostly the reason why i'm cautious when making new friends or getting to know other people -- i don't want them to take advantage of my kindness or think that i'm someone who's easily vulnerable.\n  ","420097":"\n  mondays are the hardest days for me to experience because it's difficult for me to go back to work after having two days off in a row.\n  \n  i like my job, but my commute is long and stressful. it takes a lot out of me to drive to and from work, and i never look forward to it.\n  ","420098":"\n  i don't have obsessive compulsive disorder, so no.\n  \n  you also shouldn't use mental illnesses as adjectives to mean something that has no correlation to mental illness. it's demeaning to those who actually struggle with disorders like OCD.\n  ","420099":"\n  it depends on the question, but go ahead. if i don't answer it, it means i was uncomfortable posting it.\n  ","420100":"\n  by supporting, i mean using your knowledge to educate others -- not ridicule strangers whom you assume eat meat without a care in the world. you'd get your message across more precisely if you took the time to educate people who are unaware of veganism, instead of making snide remarks anonymously.\n  ","420101":"\n  ???\n  \n  this has nothing to do with me, but okay. if you're so concerned about what people eat, then advocate for animal rights as opposed to sending anonymous messages on the internet.\n  ","420102":"\n  i used to identify as an intersectional feminist for about a year or two. however, within the past year, i've distanced myself from the neo-feminism movement because a lot of it advocates for things that don't make much of a difference in the

how to weave my words together in person, but they also come out fragmented and not as eloquent because my mind often races too fast for my mouth to keep up. it's easier for me to keep up with my mind while typing on a computer.\n  ","420106":"\n  no, i don't find that attractive at all. it's extremely relentless and forceful, and it means that person cannot take no for an answer.\n  \n  if a person asks another one out and they initially say no, the ideal thing for that person to do is accept their response and move on. by repeating the question, it places unnecessary pressure on the other individual to the point where they eventually date the other out of pity, fear, or frustration. that isn't a good basis upon which to establish a relationship.\n  ","420107":"\n  aw, thank you

freelance for my job, not really. i just finished an iced coffee, so i may make another cup of coffee since that's the only thing that motivates me to finish my work on the weekends, lol.\n  \n  i also just placed an order for a myle, which is a nicotine vape with a few different flavors. i'm hoping it helps me cut down on smoking cigarettes.\n  ","420115":"\n  i prefer friends who are down to earth, honest (sometimes blunt), intelligent, and funny. i don't think i would get along with someone if they didn't have a similar sense of humor.\n  \n  my friends range in personality types, though, so it all depends on whether or not we have chemistry among meeting each other for the first few times. most of the people i associate with, such as friends and coworkers, meet the above traits.\n  ","420116":"\n  not generally -- our lives are always changing & we experience new things every day, so there's usually always something to discuss. in addition, politics and music and video games and our other interests are constantly evolving, so that adds further discussion to our chats.\n  ","420117":"\n  it's interesting you ask this because i was discussing the dark web with an anon on my page a few days ago.\n  \n  it's something that has always intrigued me, but i would absolutely never delve into the dark web myself for fear of my own safety and the safety of my loved ones. there are a lot of horrors that take place in the dark web, including the black market, sxx trafficking, arms trading, etc etc.\n  ","420118":"\n  interesting !! thank you, i wasn't aware that

always referred to myself as bisexual.\n  \n  however, if there's a more accurate term, feel free to tell me.\n  ","420120":"\n  i'm bisexual, so i'm attracted to multiple genders of people.\n

class in high school.\n  \n  it was so long ago, though. i honestly don't remember anything about them.\n  ","420124":"\n  yes, i genuinely do like my job. it isn't stressful like any of my old jobs were, my managers are incredibly understanding of my mental health issues, and i like the actual work that i do.\n  ","420125":"\n  i *love* true crime documentaries and tv shows. murder investigations have always intrigued me since i was young so i'm immediately hooked if something i'm watching revolves around crime.\n  \n  i really enjoyed the netflix original regarding oj simpson's trial. it's extremely informative and accurate.\n  ","420126":"\n  so i received a bunch of questions regarding gender & they all disappeared before i could answer them. i'm assuming that anon got banned.\n  \n  however, they asked how many genders there are -- there isn't a number associated with gender because it exists on a spectrum.\n  \n  the anon also inquired as to why there are \"so many\" genders now compared to years ago, when there was just \"male and female\" -- male and female are sexes, not genders, so they still exist. for a long time, people thought that you could only be a man or a woman, but as we learn more about gender, we become open to the idea that gender isn't limited to just a man or a woman and it occurs in a spectrum format.\n  \n  the anon also called trans people \"transxxual\" and indicated that those who were trans weren't \"normal\" people -- this is also false, as the term transxxual is extremely outdated and doesn't reflect what transgender actually is. in addition, to refer to cis people as normal insinuates that being cis is almost a default, which shouldn't be encouraged.\n  ","420127":"\n  i can still offer advice and lend an ear to those who need to vent. because i struggle, i understand what it's like for other people to also struggle and it provides comfort to people, knowing they're not alone.\n  ","420128":"\n  unfortunately, yes. it's something i've dealt with first hand with someone in my life for basically as far as i can remember.\n  ","420129":"\n  i've never had a surprise party before, and tbh i don't know if i would ever want one. i usually have to prepare myself for big outings and it would probably catch me off guard.\n  ","420130":"\n  my boyfriend frequently tells me how much i mean to him and how i'm a saving grace in his life. coming from a person who means a lot to me, it feels good to hear those words.\n  \n  i also occasionally get anons here on askfm who have told me that i've helped them a lot with mental health, and it makes me feel good about myself knowing that i've helped someone else.\n  ","420131":"\n  i love sushi !! i suggest a cucumber roll or california roll since they don't have raw fish in them.\n  ","420132":"\n  this is true -- i worked for a law firm and basically everything we did for claimants were scanned and uploaded to our server, including medical records which were submitted to the social security office.\n  ","420133":"\n  i'm not technologically savvy and i prefer watching content on tv as opposed to a laptop.\n  ","420134":"\n  interesting. how is it possible for people to triangulate information about me when it isn't anywhere on the internet, though ??\n  ","420135":"\n  like i said, i have nothing to hide and there isn't any personal

agree to disagree. culture doesn't \"have it wrong\" and if i can't help you understand the nuances of gender, then unfortunately that isn't my responsibility anymore.\n  ","420157":"\n  it isn't a fact -- psychologists, sociologists, and medical professionals recognize that there are trans people and multiple genders besides man and woman. there's evidence of it dating back centuries, even in other cultures.\n  \n  it's also not a matter of feeling \"different\" because it's quite normal, despite the fact that it isn't socially accepted yet. just because you have an opinion of the contrary doesn't change factual evidence that trans people exist.\n  ","420158":"\n  chaotic. my teenage years were the darkest years of my life & i struggled severely with my mental health in those days. i

concert tomorrow evening !!\n  \n  2. i always get strange anon questions, but i have been noticing an excess of unusual ones this past week as well. i can only attribute it to the fact that my answers have been showing up on the 'discover' feed, so perhaps the same is happening to you.\n  ","420176":"\n  i used to know how to play the keyboard, guitar, and ukulele. however, that was more than 10 years ago.\n  ","420177":"\n  i always get weird anon questions, lol.\n  ","420178":"\n  i'm all dressed up for a cocktail party sponsored by my job and my anxiety is going wild.\n  ","420179":"\n  yeah, i believe in spirits and the paranormal.\n  ","420180":"\n  thanks, i appreciate it ~~\n  ","420181":"\n  i honestly wouldn't even know -- i'm not enthusiastic about most food, and my tastes change every now and again. something that i might like today might not be appealing tomorrow.\n  \n  however, i would probably want a meal rich with protein, such as eggs, with a side of potatoes and a lot of vegetables.\n  ","420182":"\n  honestly, my current job is the best job i've ever had. compared to my previous jobs, this job doesn't cause me nearly as much stress, i'm not worrying incessantly about work after i've come home, and i have a lot of support from my supervisors regarding my mental and physical health, something that was lacking in my prior jobs.\n  \n  they've also entrusted in me the opportunity to complete freelance work on the weekends alongside my monday through friday work, which means extra income. there's a lot of growth available with this company, and i can see myself staying here for a number of years.\n  ","420183":"\n  i'm not conventionally good-looking, so there's really nothing i can get based on my looks alone. in that same vein, there isn't anything i want that could be acquired by having good looks anyway.\n  ","420184":"\n  i admit when i'm wrong because i never want to give off the impression that i'm stubborn, ignorant, or a toxic person. i'm always trying to rectify my wrongdoings because i'm also terrified of my friends being angry with me.\n  ","420185":"\n  he's one of the most intelligent and hardest working people i know. we connect on an intimate level, more than with anyone else i've ever talked with before. we can sit down and have conversation for hours and never get bored, and we can also sit down and laugh over silly, nerdy things together without judgment.\n  \n  he's also one of the strongest people i know in that he's endured a lot of hardship but has never let it overcome him or deter him from his goals.\n  ","420186":"\n  ideally, it should be. there isn't much you can do with a person in the long run if you're going off of their looks alone. you should be able to have a conversation with them on an emotional level.\n  ","420187":"\n  making impulsive decisions without any regard for how future-me is going to feel about those decisions.\n  \n  jumping to erratic conclusions based on vague evidence.\n  \n  drinking large amounts of iced coffee in small increments of time.\n  ","420188":"\n  lmao, no ?? i don't use big or complicated words on askfm.\n  ","420189":"\n  i'm going to a party for my best friend's husband's 30th birthday tonight. tomorrow, i'm working on some freelance assignments and then i have a cocktail party for work in the evening.\n  \n  sunday, i don't have any plans besides finishing up my freelance work.\n  ","420190":"\n  addiction is a disease -- it's a mental health condition and its listed under substance abuse disorders in the DSM.\n  \n  while you do make the choice to do a drug, you obviously don't choose to be addicted. it literally rewires your brain and causes psychological and physiological changes that are out of your control.\n  ","420191":"\n  i'm just going to leave this here.\n  ","420192":"\n  it is for me, i would never spend that much money on a phone. but if other people have the disposable cash and want to drop one grand on a phone, that's their choice.\n  ","420193":"\n  i was kicked out of walmart once because my friend stole something, so they kicked out all three of us since we all went together.\n  ","420194":"\n  right now, it's breezy and overcast. however, this morning there were torrential downpours of rain. it's probably going to rain again later too.\n  ","420195":"\n  lately i've been listening to mike shinoda, macklemore, grandson, watsky, and bryce vine.\n  \n  however, some of my top favorites are linkin park, stone temple pilots, korn, soundgarden, and alice in chains.\n  ","420196":"\n  my main goal is to find happiness and also make my loved ones happy.\n  ","420197":"\n  i've been losing weight through healthy dieting and exercising. i lose motivation sometimes too, but you have to keep reminding yourself that nothing will happen if you don't actively work towards your goals. it also isn't an overnight process.\n  ","420198":"\n  honestly, it's been terrible. i've been having stomach problems since last night and actually left work early due to getting sick and running to the bathroom three times in three hours.\n  \n  i took a nap and feel a little better, but my stomach is still killing me. i'm going to try to distract myself with some xbox.\n  ","420199":"\n  with my boyfriend, obviously. lol.\n  \n  we've been together for eight years.\n  ","420200":"\n  i would honestly have no idea. i only know a few people who are twins, lol. and it's not as if there's any way to predict what gender a person is, so it's basically impossible to know.\n  ","420201":"\n  no, i'm in a relationship.\n  ","420202":"\n  \"he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.\"\n  \n  it's always held a deeper meaning to me because it reminds me of my youth, and my behavior \/ thought processes when i was younger. i did a lot of things that i gave the impression that they were fun, when in reality i was just masking the fact that i was in a lot of emotional pain.\n  ","420203":"\n  surprise, i have a twin ~~\n  ","420204":"\n  i don't spoil myself very often, although i know that i should for my own mental health. self care days are important.\n  \n  the last time i spoiled myself was a few days ago when i splurged on two pairs of shoes. idk if that's really considering spoiling myself, though, because i kinda needed them since i only have one pair of shoes with adequate support.\n  ","420205":"\n  this is my most recent one.\n  ","420206":"\n  so after seeing other people's answers, i realize you mean partying and drinking or doing drugs.\n  \n  yes, i used to be heavily involved in that kind of behavior where it did negatively impact my work and my personal relationships.\n  ","420207":"\n  -- be yourself regardless of who dislikes it. your true friends will stick around and you don't need to prove yourself to anyone.\n  \n  -- focus on school and study hard. getting an education is important and a lot of teenagers don't realize that.\n  \n  -- there are always avenues for help if you need it, and you're never alone in your struggles. you have friends, family, guidance counselors, teachers, and doctors at your disposal.\n  \n  -- don't feel pressured to do things that you don't want to do. those who genuinely care about you will understand if you don't want to party or do drugs, for example, and those who get angry with you probably don't deserve your friendship anyway.\n  \n  -- dating isn't as important as it seems and you have your entire adulthood to date around. don't feel pressured to be in a relationship or have sxx if a lot of people around you are. if you don't want to have sxx or be involved with someone, you don't need to be.\n  ","420208":"\n  probably, my mother has been talking about it a lot recently. she wants another dog but my father doesn't seem too keen on the idea.\n  \n  i would personally love another dog, though. it'll help me a lot with my mental health issues.\n  ","420209":"\n  no, i only made one or two friends. i didn't dorm or stay at the college all the time, so there wasn't any time or reason for me to make friends. i basically went to class and came home.\n  ","420210":"\n  i honestly haven't been feeling well mentally for the past few days, so i have no inspirational speeches to give. i'm always an advocate for recognizing your strength, but for me personally, it's difficult to do that sometimes because i still feel weak and powerless.\n  \n  however, you shouldn't forfeit in the face of adversity. there are no white flags to be waving, and if you've made it this far in life, then you've already won. no matter who you are, everyone faces immense struggle in life from time to time, and the fact that you survived thus far is a testament to your strength and will power, and that's something of which to be proud.\n  ","420211":"\n  \"just forget about the past.\"\n  \n  if it was that easy, then i wouldn't be in long term treatment for recurrent svicidal ideation and multiple mental illnesses, lol.\n  ","420212":"\n  you evidently don't understand how having svicidal thoughts work.\n  \n  even if someone has moved on from trauma, they can still experience svicidal thoughts. it's a chronic side effect of a lot of mental illnesses, even if that person hasn't experienced trauma at all. it takes a lot of therapy for people to come to terms with their thoughts and find incentive to continue moving forward.\n  ","420213":"\n  i've never smoked hookah before, actually.\n  ","420214":"\n  LOL, yeah. when i was a teenager, i tried trimming my bangs by myself. it turned out absolutely terrible, as they were incredibly uneven.\n  ","420215":"\n  yeah, i definitely do that a lot. my brain processes information a lot faster than i can speak, so i have a tendency to stumble over my words, skip out on words, combine words, say them in the wrong order, etc etc. i'm not really good at verbally expressing how i feel either, which is why i garner much solace in writing things down.\n  ","420216":"\n  long distance relationships take a lot of work, so it feels different in the aspect that you have to really put aside a lot of time and effort in order to maintain the relationship by talking to them routinely, and letting them know how much you're thinking of them and appreciating them. similar to having a relationship where you two see one another regularly, there needs to be a lot of open and honest communication, as well as a strong foundation of trust.\n  ","420217":"\n  it took me a few months to warm up to my boyfriend, yeah. especially considering i didn't know what to do in our situation since i was moving to another state for college soon, so i wasn't sure how much of myself was safe to offer to him.\n  \n  i don't remember much about meeting my best friend for the first time because we were both 11 years old, though. the only thing i remember is that we bonded over our love for linkin park, which basically solidified the foundation of our friendship.\n  ","420218":"\n  i don't tolerate any forms of ableism, racism, sexism, homophobia, or transphobia, among other methods of discrimination.\n  \n  society *should* be inclusive, even though it isn't on a variety of scales. i always try to be an advocate for inclusivity and educate others on the nuances of various social issues, which includes gender, sex, lgbt rights, and disability and mental health awareness.\n  ","420219":"\n  lately i've been switching between criminal minds and breaking bad. both are really good shows.\n  \n  i also really enjoy the x files, ncis, how i met your mother, parks and rec, orange is the new black, wentworth, stranger things, the killing, supernatural, and various crime documentaries.\n  ","420220":"\n  i love the art from this artist, they're always so uplifting and beautiful.\n  ","420221":"\n  i only really watch achievement hunter, markiplier, and seananners on youtube.\n  ","420222":"\n  my boyfriend & i don't really spend much time together to begin with, but we do usually need breaks from other people and require alone time, respectively.\n  \n  when i need to be alone, i usually relax by watching tv or just laying down and listening to music.\n  ","420223":"\n  my boyfriend told me that we can have a bbq and a fire tonight, which made me smile. he knows that i always love spending time outside with him.\n  ","420224":"\n  i can't believe it's been one year. you've taught me so much about growth, mental health, and survival. and i don't think i would have made it this far if it wasn't for you.\n  \n  rest in paradise, chester. you were a beacon in this world and you taught us to grieve in the wake of your death. we all miss you.\n  ","420225":"\n  i have dissociative amnesia, meaning i can't remember huge chunks of my life. i don't remember the first 11 years of my life and my teenage years are mostly a blur.\n  ","420226":"\n  laying in bed having an existential crisis, no big deal.\n  ","420227":"\n  i'm the same way, it's such a shitty feeling. you have to remember that everyone goes through life according to their own timeline, though, and its difficult to compare others without considering your and their circumstances individually. every person's situation is different and usually people's lives are much different than how they portray them on social media.\n  ","420228":"\n  i don't post photos of my family on askfm.\n  ","420229":"\n  i've only mentioned that i had a degree once within the past week or two, and it was literally a question about intelligence -- where i said that i was of average intelligence.\n  \n  i'm not perfect by any means so idk where you would get that assumption from. i have more flaws than attributes.\n  ","420230":"\n  i'm constantly talking about my flaws, rofl.\n  ","420231":"\n  my pet peeves pretty much all have to do with other people, as i basically hate most of humanity, lol.\n  \n  that includes shitty drivers -- people who don't use their blinkers, drive too car to my car, cut me off while switching lanes, don't allow me to merge, etc etc.\n  ","420232":"\n  i've done plenty of things for the first time, so you'll have to be more specific.\n  \n  i have to admit, though, the first time i drove was absolutely terrifying even though there was an instructor in the car with me.\n  ","420233":"\n  not at all. nudity is just a human being in their natural state, nothing more or less.\n  ","420234":"\n  i highly doubt it. i haven't heard anything indicating that the site will be taken down.\n  ","420235":"\n  no ?? i don't know any job that does that.\n  ","420236":"\n  my day has been fine. nothing out of the ordinary. i'm on my lunch break right now and i'm debating on what sort of drink to buy from the store.\n  ","420237":"\n  yeah, definitely. the medication helps my depression & anxiety a lot and therapy has helped me develop better and healthier coping mechanisms to deal with my triggers.\n  ","420238":"\n  i've never watched any matches or anything, but i think it's a cool way to make money. i've always wanted to make money by playing video games professionally, rofl.\n  ","420239":"\n  obviously the tide pod challenge was the worst one because people died from it. i think challenges in general are silly, though.\n  ","420240":"\n  no. i don't go to zoos because i can't handle seeing the animals in such conditions. they're often mistreated there.\n  ","420241":"\n  when my boyfriend does something kind for me that's unexpected.\n  \n  the other morning, he woke up before me and made me a cup of coffee for me to drink when i woke up. he brought it right to the bed, which i thought was really sweet.\n  ","420242":"\n  i don't have any games on my phone. they use up too much battery.\n  ","420243":"\n  i'm not interested in speaking to someone from askfm either. i'm only here to answer questions.\n  ","420244":"\n  idk, but it bothers me sometimes, lol. i'll be proud of my makeup when i see it in the mirror, but it doesn't usually translate well into photos.\n  ","420245":"\n  he's the hardest working person i know and he's extremely passionate about animals. he's always there for me to listen and offers unbiased but gentle advice for when i'm struggling, and he's always down for conversing about difficult topics.\n  ","420246":"\n  i haven't written something in a few months, but i usually write nonfiction essays and poetry.\n  ","420247":"\n  i've recently gotten into the habit of eating veggie burgers as opposed to beef burgers, and i absolutely love them. i love how versatile they are and how you can make them with an assortment of different things.\n  ","420248":"\n  criminal minds, ncis, unbreakable kimmy schmidt, the killing, the x files, how i met your mother, parks and rec, supernatural, breaking bad, ghost hunters, paranormal lockdown, and ghost adventures.\n  ","420249":"\n  i wouldn't be friends with someone who's so young that they're going through puberty. that's just bizarre and gross.\n  ","420250":"\n  you can please refrain from calling me dear, it isn't a nickname i'm comfortable with.\n  \n  however, good morning ~~\n  ","420251":"\n  depends what you mean by the call of duty. i'm willing to help people as long as it doesn't put my own health at risk.\n  ","420252":"\n  i think this question is what fueled the last question i answered on my page.\n  \n  in short, if you're over the age of 13, you can use any media site you want within reason (unless the site it 18+). there's no age limit to social media, and i would even go so far as to say that those who are 25+ should use social media more due to their wisdom.\n  \n  for me personally, i'm turning 27 this year. i use facebook, instagram, askfm, twitter, and snapchat.\n  ","420253":"\n  no. you can be on social media at any age after the age of 13. most social media sites indicate that you shouldn't be under 13 to use their sites ; however, there's absolutely no age limit.\n  ","420254":"\n  lol, no. i don't have any valuables or assets ; therefore, i don't have a will.\n  ","420255":"\n  obviously, considering we're all homosapiens.\n  ","420256":"\n  he can still be worried about me even when i don't express my svicidal thoughts to him. he's worried about my depression, my anxiety, my panic attacks, my behavior and impulses, etc etc.\n  ","420257":"\n  yeah, most of them do. my boyfriend has told me that he's constantly worried about me and he's always checking up on me, which is something i do appreciate.\n  \n  yesterday, for example, he went out to run a few errands and i stayed home to finish up some work. i decided to lay down when i was done, so when he got home, he got concerned and thought i was having an episode because i was just laying in bed with all the lights off.\n  \n  i was fine, but a lot of the time i'm not fine which is why he acted that way.\n  ","420258":"\n  no, they all pretty much have the same effect on me. i just drink different things depending on my mood that night.\n  ","420259":"\n  in my current relationship, no.\n  \n  we've established and built a relationship that has been eight years in the making. to throw all of that away and break that foundation of trust would be devastating, and even if he apologized, that doesn't take away from the fact that he purposely did something to betray that trust, knowing it would hurt me.\n  ","420260":"\n  i know a few people who complain about their lives but do nothing to change it, unfortunately. they constantly try to make other people feel bad for them but they're not willing to make positive steps to change themselves or their lives.\n  \n  i'm thankfully not this person, at least not anymore. i used to be really unhappy with my life and was too depressed to change anything, but recently i've stepped my game up and started working towards improving myself.\n  ","420261":"\n  you're probably better off asking someone who's a girl.\n  ","420262":"\n  in a sense, i sorta understand what you mean. however, in order to live in this society we must deal with those expectations regardless of whether or not they're ridiculous. it doesn't change the truth of how reality is and it doesn't diminish the struggles people face as a result of those societal expectations. you can't simply pretend that they don't have an effect on people.\n  ","420263":"\n  for something to be abnormal, it has to be out of the norm. being mentally ill isn't out of the norm and its actually a lot more common than people realize.\n  ","420264":"\n  i like being able to escape into the book i'm reading and forget about the worries or troubles of my everyday life. i love books that completely captivate you and draw you into the world completely.\n  ","420265":"\n  guess i'm boring then. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  ","420266":"\n  i deal with intrusive thoughts and memories often, and tbh i just try to let them pass and give myself positive affirmations and remind myself of how much i've endured, and it helps me let them pass.\n  \n  therapy helps too, but i know not everyone has access to that.\n  ","420267":"\n  probably because they feel as if they don't deserve to be valued or taken care of properly by other people.\n  ","420268":"\n  idk about a farm, but the idea of living in a rural area is appealing to me.\n  ","420269":"\n  i don't post photos of my friends on askfm.\n  ","420270":"\n  i think that's a toxic & invalidating mindset. people recognize that they're mentally ill, especially with respect to depression and anxiety, and not everyone can afford to be professionally diagnosed, obtain medication, or attend therapy. it doesn't make someone struggle less if they're not in treatment, since treatment is often a privilege (unfortunately).\n  \n  that being said, i don't agree with self diagnosis of complex disorders because that *should* be diagnosed by a trained professional, since they're the only ones who can differentiate one disorder from the other. it's fine to have suspicion that you have an illness but if you're going around saying that you're definitely borderline or dependent or antisocial, then that is just insulting to people who genuinely do have those disorders.\n  ","420271":"\n  lately i've been enjoying the answers of the following users ;\n  \n\n   @Courrtana\n  \n\n\n   @country_peach\n  \n\n\n   @babycadiex\n  \n\n\n

photographs often. i also write poetry.\n  ","420274":"\n  i'm not into dance, but i do enjoy art -- both observing it and making it.\n  ","420275":"\n  they're quite similar, so it all depends on your own personal preference. i prefer yoga over meditation because i'm giving my body a workout, and it's also difficult for me to really meditate.\n  ","420276":"\n  do you mean blood \/\/ water by grandson ??\n  \n  if so, then yeah -- i absolutely love that song.\n  ","420277":"\n  i like his serious roles more than his funny roles, actually.\n  ","420278":"\n  it's SO good & i recommend it. i'm only six episodes into season one but it's really enjoyable. a good mixture of drama with a hint of comedy.\n  ","420279":"\n  zero, lol.\n  ","420280":"\n  absolutely. people shouldn't be subjected to discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender, so i'm fully in support of the bill.\n  \n  for those who don't know, the SOGIE bill is a bill in the philippines that stands for \"sexual orientation and gender identity or expression\" and it seeks to prevent discrimination against people based on their orientation or gender identity.\n  ","420281":"\n  perhaps those guys should reevaluate their relationships then. if you're in a monogamous relationship, then ideally the only person you should want to be with is your partner.\n  ","420282":"\n  no. it's actually quite common. people usually mind their own business and care about their own lives, especially if they're already out with friends or running errands.\n  ","420283":"\n  don't say you support people with mental illness & then abandon them when their symptoms start to act up. supporting those who are mentally ill means you're there for your friends through the good times as well as bad times, and they need extra support during those times when things get bad.\n  ","420284":"\n  thanks, lyndsey. i appreciate it. \u2661\n  \n  my boyfriend knew it was going to happen, but i was too optimistic in his recovery. he's been sick the past few weeks and it got progressively worse over the past three days, despite the fact that we were giving him routine medication. :\/\/\n  \n  it was difficult to make that decision. but ultimately you have to decide what's best for your dog, and it would have been cruel to prolong his suffering any more than it was.\n  ","420285":"\n  i'm sorry to hear about your dog too -- they genuinely are members of the family, though. losing one is like losing a segment of yourself.\n  \n  the house felt so empty today, it was unsettling. everyone has been a wreck since he passed away. he was 11 years old, but it didn't feel as if his time was here yet. it happened so quickly. :\/\/\n  ","420286":"\n  rest in paradise to my favorite boy, the noble steed of the family, the most loyal pup i've ever known.\n  \n  you've helped me through so much over the past eight years without even realizing it. you gave me kisses when i was sad, you crawled into my lap even though you were 100 lbs to comfort me, and you always wanted pats. you weren't just a good boy -- you were the best boy. ?\n  ","420287":"\n  i wish i had bonfires at night more often with my friends. they're usually *so* much fun, but we all work conflicting schedules so it's difficult to really gather everyone around.\n  ","420288":"\n  i don't really lie often enough to know if i am or not.\n  ","420289":"\n  my most debilitating habit is skin-picking -- i have horrid marks and scars all over my arms as a result, and sometimes people point it out to me and make it quite embarrassing.\n  ","420290":"\n  don't come on strongly & take your time with talking to them. if they say no, then leave them alone.\n  \n  however, if you're consistently getting blocked, then you have to sit back and analyze what you're doing objectively that makes you sound like a creep. it isn't coincidence.\n  ","420291":"\n  i'm not really sure -- i used to be greatly into buddhism & hinduism when i was younger, but as i got older, i fell out of the mindset and became less interested in their perspectives.\n  \n  it's nothing against the religions themselves, i just think i lost my personal value in them and started focusing more on my mental health, studies, and personal life.\n  ","420292":"\n  i don't believe in any form of a higher power. i'm not really religious or spiritual anymore.\n  ","420293":"\n  student loans & rent, lol. i wish rent was less expensive so that i can afford an apartment on my own, or at the very least, my student loans were less expensive so that there's a chance i can allocate that extra money toward rent.\n  ","420294":"\n  i'm actually outside rn. it's cool and breezy, the sun is setting, and everything has that golden hue to it.\n  ","420295":"\n  i don't believe in sin.\n  \n  however, if i hypothetically did, then i would think that the difference between the two would be regret. when you're committing a sin, you don't regret your actions. there's no guilt involved. however, mistakes are usually made and there's guilt & regret involved, which is what defines them as a mistake to begin with.\n  ","420296":"\n  my best friend & boyfriend are very non-judgmental people so they've always helped me out when i found myself in a weird or awkward situation.\n  \n  at the same time, they also make fun of me for it because i have a tendency to make things more awkward than necessary without meaning to, LOL.\n  ","420297":"\n  i'd create more awareness regarding mental health, and specifically, personality disorders & schizophrenia &

it and everything but the teacher saw that as a reason to take us both into a closet, have a teaching assistant restrain me, and whoop me with a paddle multiple times. my skin was actually bruised and i was squirming so much that one point she hit me in between my legs. i couldn't even walk for the next few days and sitting h u r t. my parents were infuriated and thankfully both the teacher and teaching assistant were fired.\n  \n  --\n  \n  omg. i'm so happy they were both fired, but that doesn't make their actions any less abvsive. i'm so sorry you had to go through that at such a young

obviously there's no reasoning with you otherwise.\n  ","420309":"\n  ???\n  \n  you didn't give me evidence at all. you're talking about magic & dragons, lol. i provided you with an objective source of information regarding gender. that's all i can really do in this case.\n  ","420310":"\n  this makes absolutely no sense, i hope you realize that. i'm beginning to wonder if you're just trolling me at this point, so unless you have factual evidence to provide, i'm going to have to end this conversation.\n  ","420311":"\n  there are countless examples of homophobia that exist, so the idea that you're denying it is a bit worrisome.\n  \n  regardless, your analogy is a bit far-fetched and not rooted in reality.\n  ","420312":"\n  i'll give them the benefit of the doubt.\n  ","420313":"\n  like i stated, rudimentary definitions aren't a sound basis upon which to explain the difference between sex and gender. it's a sociological and psychological topic of study and has existed for centuries.\n  \n  however, there are unbiased facts regarding both concepts and it has nothing to do with whether someone is part of the lgbt community or an ally. your statements makes you sound a wee bit homophobic, though.\n  \n  in addition, the example you just provided is largely used by transphobic people who don't believe that trans people exist, as there's no logical way a person could identify as an animal.\n  ","420314":"\n  if you read the text, it gives a profound explanation of gender. i don't really expect you to read it now, but please bookmark it and read it sometime if you have time to spare.\n  ","420315":"\n  there have been studies that suggest that sexual orientation is established in a child's adolescence, as many children realize their sexual orientation from a very young age. a lot of people don't really realize their sexual orientation until puberty years because they're conditioned into believing that being heterosexual is the default orientation.\n  ","420316":"\n  rudimentary definitions aren't a sound basis upon which to establish an understanding of something as complex as the difference between sex and gender.\n  \n\n

people can have transition surgery to change their genitals and undergo hormone therapy to alter their secondary sex characteristics.\n  \n  you're right that someone's sexual orientation does not have any correlation with their gender. but again, your idea of gender is actually the definition of what sex is.\n  ","420318":"\n  i just explained how sex & gender are different. they're not synonymous with each other anymore because society as a whole has developed a deeper understanding of what gender truly is and how it is and isn't correlated with people's assigned sex.\n  \n  your sex is biological and is dependent upon your chromosomes. your gender is your perception of yourself.\n  ","420319":"\n  thanks, my dude ~~\n  ","420320":"\n  no, you're thinking about sex. your sex is dependent upon your chromosomes, which in term influences what genitalia you develop. there's also a term called intersex, which is a chromosomal anomaly in which people aren't entirely male or female.\n  \n  gender, however, is different from your sex. you can be a man, woman, non-binary, etc etc. gender exists on a spectrum so there's really no \"number\" as to how many genders there are, but nevertheless they all fall under the trans spectrum unless a person is cisgender (meaning their gender aligns with their assigned sex).\n  ","420321":"\n  can you explain why ??\n  ","420322":"\n  yeah, absolutely. for example, it wouldn't be appropriate for a woman to wear short shorts and a tube top to work in an office or retail environment. even if the dress code is casual, that doesn't mean that people can wear any clothing they want.\n  ","420323":"\n  if anyone has any questions, now would be the perfect time to ask them !! i'll answer almost anything, send 'em my way ~~\n  ","420324":"\n  obviously neither.\n  ","420325":"\n  i couldn't be a therapist because i don't think i'd be able to handle other people's problems on top of my own. i can empathize with people but i invest myself too much into other people's emotions to begin with.\n  ","420326":"\n  that makes a lot of sense !! i can get behind that.\n  ","420327":"\n  i wish i was better at singing. i absolutely love to sing, but my voice is terrible. if i had a decent singing voice, i probably would have entered the music industry.\n  ","420328":"\n  i'd say they're fairly equal. i'm a fast reader, but since i've been typing on computers since i was a child, i've become pretty fast at typing too.\n  ","420329":"\n  i'm terrified of driving, but it's something i have to do practically

when it comes to my boyfriend & best friend. if either of them are having a particularly bad day, then it usually puts me in a terrible mood because i feel as if i can't do anything to help them.\n  ","420336":"\n  i'm not sure what the protocols are when it comes to field trips. i would assume that the parents have the authority over the teachers when it comes to those instances, but i'm not versed in education.\n  ","420337":"\n  i disagree to an extent. i think parents should discipline their children and encourage them to do better in school if they're getting poor grades, especially if they're getting detention for acting out or neglecting to do their work.\n  \n  kids won't learn unless their parents teach them the correct way. if a parent ignores the fact that their child is doing poorly in school, then the child won't learn how to reverse their behavior. they need guidance.\n  ","420338":"\n  i don't really see what this has to do with me. this is a conversation between

get a psych evaluation. the biggest problem is that people with self diagnosed complex mental illnesses infiltrate communities they don't belong in.\n  \n  -- new wave feminism is a bit of a joke, and

more things about yourself and come to realizations regarding your sexual orientation.\n  \n  for example, i used to consider myself pansexual but as i've gotten older, i've realized bisexual fits me

tell him when i met him because i was afraid i was going to not be able to say anything at all when i got to the signing booth, lol.\n  \n  but i managed to give him my letter (!!!) and tell him thank you, and he was genuinely thankful and appreciative. he's one of the nicest guys i've ever met.\n  ","420569":"\n  you definitely should when you have the time !! it's a great album, i've had it on repeat since i got the cd on monday.\n  \n  i recommend \"running from my shadow,\" \"i.o.u.,\" and \"hold it together.\" those are my jams right now.\n  ","420570":"\n  hey friends, my inbox is empty. does anyone have any questions ??\n  ","420571":"\n  cell phone, car loan, car insurance, and student loan.\n  ","420572":"\n  i think he's both tbh -- he's exhibited racist tendencies, and he also thinks that people like him are superior to others who are less fortunate without regard for their shortcomings or struggles.\n  ","420573":"\n  uh, no ?? i'd also be telling his wife rofllll.\n  ","420574":"\n  i'm sorry that you haven't experienced what it's like to finally meet your role model.\n  ","420575":"\n  sooo i just met mike shinoda & i'm SHOOK.\n  \n  he was literally the nicest guy ever. my best friend & i told him how much he and LP's music meant to us growing up and he was genuinely thankful. i gave him the letter i wrote and he was so grateful and seemed as if he wanted to read it.\n  \n  i'm trembling. it was so amazing and i have so much closure now that i finally told him how much this means to me.\n  ","420576":"\n  i'm not concerned about the pain because i don't even know if i want children.\n  ","420577":"\n  ... i literally just said who.\n  ","420578":"\n  aaahh, thank you !!\n  \n  i'm a little nervous because my best friend might be getting out of work late, and i'm terrified we won't be able to get there on time, though.\n  ","420579":"\n  I'M MEETING MIKE SHINODA TODAY, I CAN'T CONTAIN MY EXCITEMENT.\n  ","420580":"\n  traveled to austin, texas, for a video game convention with my boyfriend. i got to meet a few of my idols and hang out with really cool cosplayers.\n  ","420581":"\n  i don't really eat food out of enjoyment, for the most part. however, i do really enjoy eggs and sushi (not together, lol).\n  ","420582":"\n  in general, you're right. however, if that speech is oppressive and inappropriate, then it's good for a website to be vigilant of those messages and get rid of them, especially considering there are children on this website.\n  ","420583":"\n  that makes sense !! it's good that they're starting to do that, if that's the case.\n  ","420584":"\n  exactly my point.\n  \n  tbh i feel as if i continuously get the same few anons who want to try to prove me wrong or challenge my statements, but then they ultimately get frustrated when i don't respond the way they expect me to, haha.\n  ","420585":"\n  it obviously matters to the lgbt community because it raises a question about his credibility.\n  \n  in any regard, your bizarre analogy regarding your grandmother is a fallacy and makes absolutely zero sense. i'm not going to entertain this any longer because it's getting wild, lol.\n  ","420586":"\n  we already went over this. you can think i'm lying all you want, but the truth is that he contradicts his own statements. just because you think he was pro-gay marriage the second he was sworn in doesn't mean that he didn't spend a majority of his campaign against gay marriage.\n  ","420587":"\n  i would imagine so. i haven't visited the city in a long time, though.\n  ","420588":"\n  don't get your panties in a twist, my dude. i'm just saying his opinions often contradict themselves. it isn't anything new.\n  ","420589":"\n  that's honestly up for debate because his opinions regarding gay marriage have always flip flopped with time, rofl. during the 2016 presidential campaign, he made a lot of contradicting statements, first saying that he preferred \"traditional marriage\" and opposed same-sex marriage, and then eventually saying that his opinion was irrelevant because the debate was settled.\n  ","420590":"\n  i'm in support of gay marriage. people should be allowed to marry whoever they want regardless of their sexual orientation, sex, or gender.\n  ","420591":"\n  i'm talking about actual businesses and corporations, my dude. especially in regards to businesses that have customers, i.e. retail positions or food service industries.\n  \n  being an actor doesn't exactly fit that mold. obviously if someone is homophobic and doesn't want to play a gay character, that's their decision.\n  ","420592":"\n  your answer looks like it got cut off. :\/\/\n  \n  either way, it sounds as if we're simply misunderstanding each other. i don't believe that people should be able to refuse business to others based on their race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc etc. like my other anon said, if a person is being hostile and becomes a threat to the business, then yes, that's a valid reason to refuse service. but you shouldn't be able to refuse service to a person based entirely on a bias you hold against an entire group of people.\n  ","420593":"\n  LOL, it's honestly a strange question to ask because you should be at the age where you know whether or not your body gives off signs prior to getting a period. that's the only reason why i doubted that it was a legitimate question since everyone's bodies are different.\n  ","420594":"\n  the supreme court ruled in favor of the baker, in that particular instance. however, i personally believe that it shouldn't matter whether someone buying a cake is straight or gay. the person is a consumer who wishes to invest in your product, and their sexual orientation doesn't affect the money coming out of their wallet.\n  ","420595":"\n  obviously i think it was disgusting how one of their management heads said statements opposing gay marriage, and i think it was justifiable how people responded to the controversy through boycotts and refusing to allow stores to open in certain cities.\n  ","420596":"\n  right now, i'm getting paid to sit at my laptop in sweatpants and a ratty tank top while drinking a large iced coffee and listening to the skyrim soundtrack in my own bedroom.\n  \n  freelance work is friggin awesome, my dudes.\n  ","420597":"\n  scrambled eggs with spinach or a spinach salad with bacon bits, mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese.\n  ","420598":"\n  tbh i just want to be content with who i am, where i am, etc etc. i have a lot of goals and ambitions, though, so i'm motivated to get myself to a place where i'm truly comfortable with myself and my environment.\n  ","420599":"\n  yeah, it does -- especially if i'm around a group of people. i always need time alone to unwind after i've been out and there are a lot of people around.\n  \n  if i'm around one or two people maximum, then i'm usually okay, though.\n  ","420600":"\n  wow, that sounds amazing !! i definitely think more people should utilize such a thing because it sounds as if it can be extremely helpful, especially in the case of mental health if a person feels as if they have no one to relate to or no one cares about their issues.\n  ","420601":"\n  tbh i never have anyone over my house so this question doesn't really apply to me ... however, i personally don't care if someone walks into my house with shoes on as long as they're not completely filthy.\n  \n  i always walk around with no shoes on, i just hate how constricting shoes can be.\n  ","420602":"\n  lol, i'm one of those idiots who lay out in the sun until my skin turns beat red. i love having a tan, even though lately it's been really hard for me to actually tan (( probably because i'm inside so often these days )).\n  \n  i miss going to the beach, though. it was always so much fun to lay there, chain smoke, have a beer, and bullshit for the day.\n  ","420603":"\n  positives ;\n  \n  -- i legitimately enjoy what i do\n  \n  -- i can listen to music while i work\n  \n  -- my coworkers are chill af\n  \n  -- they just recently gave me the option to do freelance work, so i'll be making extra income on top of my salary\n  \n  negatives ;\n  \n  -- the commute is long and exhausting\n  \n  -- there's never any parking in the lot\n  \n  -- there's a high turnover rate, which makes me paranoid that they're going to fire me without warning one day\n  ","420604":"\n  i'm bisexual & non-binary, so i'm all about pride month !!\n  \n  i don't usually go to parades or anything, but i do like to raise awareness of lgbt+ issues during pride month.\n  ","420605":"\n  that makes sense. i've obviously always known that credit exists and that there are good and bad credit scores and that determines a variety of things such as mortgage payments and other big loans.\n  \n  however, i think it's sad that i was never actually taught *what* credit was, where it comes from, how it works, etc etc. it would have been beneficial to have been taught it in school (i'm sure some schools do, but mine definitely didn't).\n  ","420606":"\n  this is true too !! granted you consistently make the payments on time, haha. i'm lucky in that my car expenses and other bills have given me pretty good credit because i've never missed a payment thus far.\n  ","420607":"\n  aw, lol. i'm not that smart, i've just owned quite a few cars at this point in my life !! although my current car is the only *new* car i've purchased, so all i really did was give a down payment and set up a monthly payment plan.\n  \n  good luck, though !!\n  ","420608":"\n  i've personally never had the kind of money to drop all of my life savings on a car in one purchase, lol. i have monthly payments, like i'm sure 99% of the rest of the population with cars do as well.\n  \n  i can't imagine what would happen if the car is totaled, though. that seems like you wouldn't be able to get the money back compared to someone who was, for example, only halfway done with paying the car off.\n  ","420609":"\n  -- when people talk over me when i'm in the middle of speaking.\n  \n  -- when people chew with their mouths open or talk with their mouth full of food.\n  \n  -- when people insist on cutting me off and then proceed to drive 5 mph down the highway.\n  \n  -- when people ignore texts instead of saying 'no' if i ask them to hang out.\n  ","420610":"\n  i don't have expensive tastes at all, considering i don't even indulge myself in expensive items since i can't afford them. i wouldn't consider myself to have much of a taste of anything since i'm not very picky to begin with.\n  \n  i guess ... i would have cheap tastes ?? lol.\n  ","420611":"\n  french fries & ice cream !!\n  \n  (( don't @ me,\n  \n   @Courrtana\n  \n  . you won't understand. ))\n  ","420612":"\n  no, lol. you're talking about kids in high school. they just questioned authority and the teachers' opinions a lot and didn't follow their advice obediently like most other people did.\n  ","420613":"\n  best --\n  \n  \u2727 mike shinoda meet n greet passes\n  \n  \u2727 various vacations\n  \n  \u2727 tattoos\n  \n  worst --\n  \n  \u2727 various items for my family as gifts that they've never used\n  ","420614":"\n  depends on who you're buying the gift for and what they like.\n  ","420615":"\n  given the right amount of time has passed and circumstances, i believe so. however, they would have to be wary of the same situation happening again. there's a reason why people have falling outs a majority of the time, and if the circumstances or people involved haven't changed, then the same thing is doomed to happen again.\n  "}}
