. it s unfortunate that being cisgender is seen as a default in today s society , but i don t blame people for assuming i m cis since i do present as femme and have a lot of typical feminine features .","279426":"yes , i used to have a horrible habit of stealing random sh t from stores , lol .","279427":"i really want to see grandson live in concert . his music is intense af , and from what i ve seen , his shows are a lot of fun .","279428":"thanks for the follow i don t follow people upon request .","279429":"as far as i know , my friends are okay rn . they re also young compared to a lot of other people who have contracted covid , so i don t know if the effects would be as apparent as someone who s older my friends who got it are between years old .","279430":"yes , i know quite a few people who got covid .","279431":"well , the day is basically over considering it s nearly midnight , lol . i made breakfast , worked for hours , laid down for hours , then spent the night on social media watching television .","279432":"i m not using askfm on my phone rn , so i can t see the new update . i ve been using it on my laptop all evening .","279433":"i try to , for the most part . however , sometimes it becomes way too overwhelming for me and i need to disconnect for a while . there s too much chaos going on in the world and it has the tendency to really f ck with my mental health .","279434":"this is difficult , because while i like the idea of forgetting who i am when it rains , it would make working every day difficult because lately it s been raining most afternoons during the week , lmaoo . at the same time , i already forget a lot of the time what i m doing when i walk into a room , and it frustrates me so much . to have that happen on an everyday basis would be so annoying .","279435":"listening to an instrumental harry potter medley video on youtube , answering questions on askfm , perusing my facebook feed , and drinking wine .","279436":"no , it ideally shouldn t create problems at all in a healthy relationship . what s in the past stays in the past , and it s normal to talk about your past sexual relations in order to really get a better understanding of what people like or dislike in the bedroom .","279437":"my most recent , memorable moment was probably the small party i use that term lightly , there was only a few of us and we distanced ourselves in the backyard my roommate and i had last weekend . i honestly can t remember the last time i laughed that hard , it was an amazing gathering and exactly what i needed at that point in time .","279438":"my grandfather died just about a month ago . he lived in florida , my father flew down there for about a month to look after my grandmother while my grandfather was in the hospital and nursing home .","279439":"none of my close friends got covid , but my father and i suspected that my grandfather d ed from it because he was displaying all of the symptoms in the days leading up to his death , but there was no formal diagnosis made . i do know a lot of people who have had it , though . it was running rampant in new york for a long time . i believe it s getting better now we re in phase two of reopening , but that still doesn t mean that covid is gone .","279440":"i don t have many friends to begin with , so no . lmao . i keep a very small inner circle , and i only talk to maybe people . this doesn t include coworkers , though . i have three coworkers with whom i talk semi regularly . but we ve become distant ever since the office closed .","279441":"if they re spewing hateful oppressive discriminatory comments either online or irl , if they re not putting the same effort into the friendship as i am and won t change their ways after discussing it , if they become rude or arrogant or entitled to certain things or friendships , and or if they re being manipulative and ab sive .","279442":"i don t generally go to the movie theater , haha . i don t think i ve ever seen a movie long enough that required an intermission , tbh . i much prefer watching movies at home , where i can pause whenever i need to to get food and snacks , or use the bathroom without missing anything .","279443":"i don t believe i have the update on my phone yet . i m not entirely sure , i ve been using my laptop to answer questions this evening .","279444":"no , i haven t felt that way at all . i just have zero interest in pursuing a new relationship or even dating in general .","279445":"eh , yes and no . i have a stable job and whatnot , but my mental health ranges between being absolutely amazing to being in the trash within the course of a few hours . i m medicated now and i engaged in therapy for like , years , but i still can t help but feel whatever mood swings i feel at any particular moment . i also recently dealt with a break up , so that has really f cked with my emotions over the past few months .","279446":"hi friends , my inbox is basically empty . send me some interesting appropriate questions .","279447":"honestly , i m not all that picky . it really depends on my mood that day . i enjoy drinking beer , especially lagers and ipas . as for liquor , my favorite is tequila but i also like light rum and amaretto . in addition , my favorite wine is sauvignon blanc .","279448":"that s pretty questionable , lol . i do enough to get by , do my job efficiently , and pay my bills on time . that s all that really matters at the moment .","279449":"yeah , i drink alcohol on a fairly regular basis .","279450":"probably sometime in my early to mid s , when i was living my life to the fullest and going on vacations times per year and was otherwise managing my mental illnesses well before i had a breakdown when i was years old . i was working towards my bachelor s degree and felt extremely educated , and i was also writing a lot creatively .","279451":"when i m anxious , it feels as if my heart is beating out of my chest cavity . i get extremely overheated and sweat profusely . i get vertigo and light headed . my mind races . my stomach churns and makes me nauseous . i can t breathe . etc etc . i used to be diagnosed with panic disorder , but i m pretty sure it s in remission now because i haven t had a panic attack in quite a few months .","279452":"lol . again , the answer is a resounding no .","279453":"i don t talk to people privately . if that s what you re aiming for , then you can kindly leave my page . this is a question and answer site , after all .","279454":"no , i don t give those usernames out . askfm is the only place you can contact me .","279455":"i have anxiety disorders , so my doctor prescribed me xanax to manage my symptoms .","279456":"it isn t a fact , it is simply an opinion . regardless , thank you for the compliment .","279457":"i m not close to anyone in my family at all , and i only really see my aunts and uncles on holidays sometimes , we ve been seeing them less lately over the past few years . my aunt on my mother s side is probably the one to whom i m closest .","279458":"i appreciate the compliment .","279459":"you asked me this already , lol . i said i was drinking coffee , listening to music , and perusing social media .","279460":"i m very picky when it comes to bars , and there are only two bars that i regularly visited before covid happened . the rest of the time , i preferred going to brewing companies since there are a lot on long island .","279461":"i answered a similar question earlier , but my day has been okay . i managed to get through the work day just fine i had enough work to keep me preoccupied , and i haven t done much since clocking out three ish hours ago .","279462":"thanks for the follow","279463":"you re speaking to me now .","279464":"hello i m doing fine . i m currently listening to music , perusing social media , and drinking coffee .","279465":"there were quite a few people from my office who were furloughed because of covid , we were losing revenue . i wasn t one of them , thankfully . the situation is slowly getting better in new york , and company wise , we re making just as much money now as we were before covid hit new york state . i m comfortable in saying that my job is very stable right now .","279466":"i don t believe the popularity of social media would change much , because as much good there is on social media that people like to talk about , there are also others who feel comfortable to post the bad things that have happened to them as well . in fact , posting the bad things may make people more compassionate and receptive to others because it only proves that we re all human and endure similar struggles , even if the circumstances are different .","279467":"no , if that was the case then i would have been unemployed months ago . i ve been working remotely from home since mid march .","279468":"a perfect relationship , in my opinion , is a relationship where you have the same sense of humor so that you can enjoy the same things together , while also maintaining a distinction between both of your interests . while you share similar interests to some degree , it s also important to have different interests as well to maintain your sense of self outside of the relationship . relationships are also meant to be open and you should be able to communicate effectively with your partner , regardless of how awkward or difficult the topic is . your partner should ideally be open and responsive to what you have to say , and vice versa , and not restrict you from being your true , authentic self .","279469":"it would be a small , quaint bar with a wooden bar stand , taps behind the bar with a big mirror to make the space look bigger , and antique lighting hanging above the bar and within the bar itself . there would be a large outdoor seating area adorned with string lights and plants , with an interior design made of dark wood and metal sorta industrial , but also modern . the bar stools would be cushioned with soft , velvet material and there would also be an area in the back where you can order simple bar food , like loaded fries or sliders or pretzels and dip .","279470":"i ve always been attracted to the idea of lestat from anne rice s vampire chronicles , haha . also , draco malfoy from the harry potter series and patrick bateman from american psycho .","279471":"drinking three glasses of wine last night , followed by eight xanax pills before going to bed . it calmed me down following my mental breakdown , but i woke up horribly foggy and unstable this morning . i was unsure if i would be able to focus on the computer screen at work because i was so disoriented .","279472":"i suppose happiness can be defined as being content , and possibly even joyful , with yourself and your surroundings . you re self assured and have a direct idea of where you re headed in life , and you do everything in your power to complete your goals .","279473":"my ex doesn t think i m selfish , at least that i m aware of , lol . if anything , he s described me as selfless because i dedicated myself fully to him . i ve always thought i was selfish because , for one my parents instilled that idea in me from a very young age . i grew up convinced i was selfish and everything i did was self serving without the consideration of other people . it s followed me through to adulthood and i still often think of myself without how it will affect other people .","279474":"my day has been fine , although tiring . because of my breakdown last night , i woke up extremely exhausted and mentally physically unstable . i managed to make it through the entire work day , but i laid in bed for like two hours afterwards because i was mentally drained . i didn t even have dinner tonight , i m simply not hungry . i m just drinking coffee and trying to relax myself with calming music and social media .","279475":"yeah , i miss my friends most of all . when this whole covid situation has calmed down , i m definitely inviting a lot of friends over to the house and having a party , lol .","279476":"i believe i am , yes .","279477":"not so much anymore , no . i was terrified of it when it was at its peak in new york , especially when i was still working in the office , but now that i ve been out a few times to the grocery store and pharmacy and hardware store , etc etc . , i ve calmed down a bit .","279478":"mentally unstable , self destructive , selfish , manipulative , and addictive . at the same time , i m also very dedicated to both my work and my friends , creative , passionate , and emotional .","279479":"my biggest dream goal aspiration is to publish a book , or at least a collection of essays and short stories .","279480":"if i had to choose between the two , i would say pessimistic . however , i m actually a realist more than anything else . i try not to be too optimistic or too pessimistic about anything , although i definitely do have my moments where my pessimism comes out .","279481":"i would much rather read a novel , holding a physical book in my hand . staring at screens too much hurts my eyes , and it s much easier for me to read a physical book as opposed to an e book or collection of online stories .","279482":"this is actually a really difficult decision for me because i use both askfm and facebook equally , haha . i love answering questions on askfm , but i also enjoy sharing informative articles and memes on facebook .","279483":"neither . i don t like flowers , and i m not the biggest fan of chocolate . chocolate makes my stomach hurt .","279484":"i don t collect either , lol . however , i recently bought two new pairs of sandals because i realized i only had one pair and a pair of flip flops for the summer .","279485":"i d choose cosmetics over jewelry . i only wear one necklace because i m not the biggest fan of jewelry , and i also like applying makeup every so often because it makes me feel better about myself .","279486":"i like sitting on the front steps or in the backyard and watching the rain fall and or a thunderstorm rolling through .","279487":"most calming sounds crackling of a wooden campfire . rainfall on the windows and roof . the lord of the rings soundtrack . most irritating sounds construction happening while i m trying to work . the squeaking of clean fruit or plastic bags against each other . cats pawing at boxes or pretty much any sort of plastic , lmao .","279488":"gasoline , firewood , freshly brewed coffee , lavender , patchouli , dragon s blood incense , balsam , and freshly cut grass .","279489":"i prefer savory flavors over sweet flavors . i prefer foods that have a hint of salt to them , like chips or pretzels , as well as spicy food . i ve never been a fan of sweets .","279490":"? ? ? the only person who s interpreting it as sexual is you , my dude .","279491":"when i order online , yes . however , i have a terrible habit of obsessively tracking delivery progress , lol . when i text a friend , not so much . it also really depends on what i m texting them about , because if it s about a serious topic , then i get extremely anxious while waiting for their reply .","279492":"i feel lonely on occasion , but it s more of a mental loneliness than a physical loneliness . i m home with either one or both of my roommates throughout most of the day , and while i m working , i m frequently in contact with my coworkers through messages or emails . my loneliness mainly comes late at night when everyone is sleeping and i m just laying awake in bed .","279493":"soft kitty fur i m currently watching a mainecoon and his fur is marvelous , wrapping my hands around a hot mug of coffee or tea , and soft sherpa blankets .","279494":"disappointing my workplace and friends .","279495":"robert downey jr . , helena bonham carter , johnny depp , angelina jolie , natasha lyonne , and matthew grey gubler .","279496":"now why would i give away my methods so quickly on social media ? smh .","279497":"i only watched the full first season , and then i think half of season two , but i enjoyed it . i wouldn t say that it lost my interest story wise , but i ended up finding other shows to watch and completely forgot about it .","279498":"that s fairly normal there are certain types of beer and liquor that i can t drink because i had too much in the past and now i can t even smell it without wanting to gag , haha .","279499":"sushi , lamb and rice and hummus platters , veggie burrito bowls , caprese salad , and scrambled eggs on english muffins .","279500":"i would probably freeze up and not be able to say anything at all , haha . i d ask for a picture and then run away in fear .","279501":"probably , sure .","279502":"lol , absolutely nobody wants to see that .","279503":"hello do you have a question ?","279504":"yes , we still talk most days out of the week , send snapchats , play video games together on occasion , etc etc .","279505":"i support it wholeheartedly , it just isn t something i m personally interested in .","279506":"very rarely .","279507":"no , your body reacts in different ways and not everyone cries . it doesn t invalidate their happiness at all , some people just don t cry when it comes to things like that .","279508":"i would simply tell them .","279509":"i don t know if i m anyone s favorite , but i do have a few facebook friends who react to my posts and share them on a regular basis .","279510":"i ve never considered anyone to be a mentor in my life .","279511":"the latter , i assume . people rarely approach me when i m out in public .","279512":"both . i like the feeling of being drunk , and i also like the taste of some drinks like certain beers and especially tequila .","279513":"if i set my mind to it , then maybe . i seldom drink water , though , it s a really bad habit and i should ideally drink more .","279514":"i m eating lunch rn .","279515":"i ve been suppressing my feelings and i ve been drinking wine and i finally broke , lol .","279516":"fiction mimics reality .","279517":"having mental breakdowns on tuesday nights is the latest rage , haven t you heard ?","279518":"unsuccessful i haven t done anything substantial at all .","279519":"apparently they sorta straddle the concept of being alive and being dead .","279520":"only towards my friends , sometimes . i put a lot of effort into my friendships .","279521":"because i m fat , obviously .","279522":"because i was conditioned from an early age to think of myself as a piece of sh t and it s stuck with me through adulthood .","279523":"no , i don t .","279524":"nothing special .","279525":"i m not entirely sure , and even if i did know , i doubt she d be comfortable with me telling askfm .","279526":"well yeah , nature is obviously alive . it doesn t have the same level of intelligence as humans or animals , but that doesn t mean it isn t alive .","279527":"i d visit one of my friends who lives there and i ll let her show me around .","279528":"no , but people certainly take nature for granted .","279529":"no , i don t care about my body hair . if i feel like shaving , then i ll shave . if i don t want to shave , then i won t shave .","279530":"no , i m just trying to survive at this point . it s better for me to try to take each day at a time , otherwise i get too overwhelmed with everything going on .","279531":"because i m mentally ill , prone to s icidal ideation , have an alcohol problem , and if my body doesn t give out first then my mind definitely will .","279532":"yeah , there s such a thing as internalized sexism where some women feel the need to blame other women or discriminate against other women because they ve been taught to do so from an early age .","279533":"i d be surprised if i make it to the age of .","279534":"women do not stigmatize themselves . the stigma and oppression women face have existed for centuries .","279535":"because i have unhealthy coping mechanisms and alcohol is the easiest way for me to cope with them . i ve always been pretty open with this sort of thing , i ve always had some sort of substance ab se problem going on in the background . lately it s been alcohol .","279536":"well considering i answered a very similar question today already my answer was sushi , right now my new answer would be a bucket of margaritas .","279537":"i answered a question , and it certainly wasn t flaunting .","279538":"i don t pay much attention to things like that when i m out and about . i really have ever gone out to see my friends , and that s it even before covid . in general though , women have always faced a social stigma simply because they re women .","279539":"if i could afford it , i d certainly design it but i would hire a group of people to actually build it .","279540":"i can t even build a damn bench , let alone a computer .","279541":"yeah , sometimes . my one friend is a pharmacy technician and always yells at me because i drink on my psychiatric medication , lmao . apparently the combination i m on doesn t bode well with alcohol .","279542":"nah , i would miss my friends .","279543":"a hell of a lot less traumatic than it has been , lmaoo .","279544":"selfie of the night send me questions .","279545":"i honestly can t even envision myself as a parent , let alone a grandparent .","279546":"eh , i love spicy food but nothing overly hot . i d say somewhere in between very spicy not spicy at all like moderately spicy , haha .","279547":"probably ! ! i m only human .","279548":"they re transphobic , as well as you considering i ve stated multiple times what my gender is . also , please stop posting on my page . i ve already deleted everything else you ve sent me over the past few weeks . hiding behind anon won t change that .","279549":"yeah , in a lot of circumstances online you can t really evaluate the tone of someone s voice , you re only seeing the text on the screen . some people misconstrue messages for that reason .","279550":"well yeah , who i am is the same regardless of whether i m interacting with someone online or irl .","279551":"it doesn t affect me at all . i really couldn t care less about sex .","279552":"youtube is a blessing .","279553":"no , i barely have one these days thanks to psychiatric medication .","279554":"i forget some nights , but most of the time i do remember , lol .","279555":"i love this fluffy boy .","279556":"all of the star wars movies , all of the indiana jones movies , the godfather , inception , and slumdog millionaire .","279557":"not a problem at all ! !","279558":"perhaps she s just trying to respect you by not prying into the subject , considering it may be a sensitive topic ? i m honestly not sure , haha . i obviously don t know your mother or how she behaves , she may just be processing her own feelings about it .","279559":"i m fairly socially awkward , thanks to anxiety .","279560":"i ve never experienced that before .","279561":"i could really go for some fresh sushi rn . that d be the perfect gift .","279562":"yes , askfm is a question answer website . its purpose is to ask and answer questions .","279563":"okay . this isn t a question .","279564":"unless you have a question , you can leave my page .","279565":"no , the only language i know is english .","279566":"i don t particularly care .","279567":"hello do you have a question ?","279568":"lol . you re the one on my page . if you re unhappy with my response , you have the freedom to leave .","279569":"i don t give out likes upon request . additionally , you appear to have a substantial number of likes to begin with .","279570":"eh , i don t disagree . i don t know very much about the animal breeding industry .","279571":"honestly , i have no idea . but their fluff is incredible .","279572":"angora rabbits ! !","279573":"i don t really get jealous these days , tbh . the only instance i can think of is when one of my favorite people is talking to other people but ignoring me whether accidentally or purposely .","279574":"increase mental stability . intelligence . confidence . decrease physical strength . alcohol tolerance lol . selfishness .","279575":"slender man and the chupacabra , most definitely .","279576":"i ve been heartbroken more than i ve broken hearts well , at least to my knowledge .","279577":"i woke up at am for some reason even though i didn t have to log into work until am , so i made breakfast and coffee and listened to music before i clocked in .","279578":"uh . . . wut . lol .","279579":"crossing my fingers for you ! !","279580":"ah , okay . your initial message made me think that your mother just assumed you were pregnant and scheduled a random blood test on your behalf , lol . either way , i hope things work out in your favor whichever you decide .","279581":"thank you","279582":"that seems a bit extreme for your mother to want to find out if you re pregnant through blood work , not going to lie . pregnancy tests are fast and easy , though . i recommend taking more than one because sometimes you can get a false reading .","279583":"i have two roommates , both of whom are men .","279584":"a pregnancy test is much easier than blood work , haha . i absolutely hate having my blood drawn .","279585":"the needles themselves never bothered me . the most troubling part of getting a tattoo is sitting in the same position for hours at a time at least for me , haha . i also hate when the tattoo gun goes over a nerve and i can t help but twitch it always makes me afraid that the artist is going to screw up a line , although they never have before .","279586":"i honestly can t remember a specific incident . i don t really go around telling people what to do , and usually my friends take my advice into consideration if they do ask me for my input .","279587":"my ribcage tattoo , most definitely . i knew it was going to be painful going into it , but i didn t realize the type of pain it would be . it was a searing hot , white pain that i ve never experienced before .","279588":"yes , most recently i was on a cruise ship to the bahamas last february . i ve also spent some time on people s boats when i was much younger .","279589":"i have seven tattoos at the moment .","279590":"yeah , there are a lot of mom and pop shops around here , and i try to support local businesses as much as i can .","279591":"i don t believe i ve ever been inside of an antique shop before .","279592":"eh , it depends on my mood . sometimes i prefer one over the other . when my roommate and i had the bbq over the weekend , i had one of each one cheeseburger and one hot dog .","279593":"i prefer to listen , mostly because i don t like burdening people with my own problems and i prefer to face my problems on my own time without intervention . i m always there for my friends when time mental state allows it .","279594":"the only place i ve seen the arrows is stop shop , where i do my grocery shopping . and honestly , they make me so anxious because i m terrified i m going to go in the wrong direction , lmaoo .","279595":"i send out questions on the rare occasion usually on the weekend when i m extremely bored . i try to ask interesting questions that will prompt interesting answers because i like reading them . i don t care at all for the coin system , it doesn t mean anything to me .","279596":"get the rest of my entire body tattooed granted i have the funds for it , at least . i would definitely touch up my ribcage tattoo and get a sternum tattoo , first and foremost . i ve also always loved chest tattoos .","279597":"i found my favorite flavor of arizona iced tea at earlier today , if that counts for anything .","279598":"i d rather spend a weekend in a cabin in the woods with friends while we fish and bbq some food .","279599":"i don t eat steak very often , but i prefer it medium rare with worcestershire sauce on the side .","279600":"i would pay off all of my debt , purchase a new car for my roommate because his car is ancient and always giving him problems , and probably put the rest of the money towards buying a house .","279601":"not in recent years , no . i probably did this when i was much younger and less self assured , and wanted the person to still like me regardless of what they ve done . however , since then i ve retained a bit of confidence in who i am and i don t allow people to use me in an effort to further their own reputation .","279602":"it depends on the situation , because people choose to ignore the truth for a number of reasons . sometimes it can be because the truth is too painful for them to bear , so they ignore it or distance themselves from it in an effort to prevent themselves from feeling the pain .","279603":"i m not entirely sure , tbh . the things i want to do with my life aren t things that make me afraid . for example , i want to eventually buy a house or move into an apartment on my own , adopt animals , publish a book or two , etc etc . they don t frighten me , i just don t have the opportunity to do most of those things right now .","279604":"i suppose my passion for the things i m interested in , as well as how much hard work i allocate towards my job .","279605":"no , i wouldn t . my family s opinion isn t valuable to me at all because i m not close with my family . this has already happened to me in the past with my most recent ex they didn t like him and didn t want me to be with him because of things he had done in the past , but it never swayed my opinion .","279606":"my aspirations to eventually become a published novelist in the future . i haven t exactly worked towards that goal , per say , because i ve never started a novel . however , i do have a brilliant idea for a novel that i might want to write in the future once i find the motivation to expand upon the idea and write a timeline layout .","279607":"i have a medical thing where i sneeze in bright sunlight or if i look directly towards the sun . i m left handed . i m on four prescriptions for mental illness .","279608":"cocaine , most likely . i tried it a few times when i was younger , and i don t think i d ever try it again .","279609":"i would rather have skin that changes colors based on my emotions ! ! it would be like a kaleidoscope because my moods change so often .","279610":"hey leigh , i don t advise drinking that entire bottle of bacardi in one night because you re going to feel horrible until pm the following day .","279611":"thankfully , no . i am in debt but it isn t by very much because it s only student loans and a few credit cards .","279612":"i like really hot showers , mainly because it helps the skin on my arms heal faster and hot water is very therapeutic to me . the temperature doesn t change unless it s a very humid day outside and i need cooler temperatures to really cool off during the summer . my showers usually last between minutes .","279613":"anons always love to pry into business that isn t their own it s just how they are , unfortunately . this is one of the more mild questions i ve received , haha .","279614":"unstable , media oriented , artistic .","279615":"i ve never been camping before , and i also have never been to a hostel before i think hostels are primarily a european thing ? . however , my friends and i want to plan a camping trip later this summer if covid allows it .","279616":"hello do you have a question ?","279617":"i am very well aware of this , thank you .","279618":"thank you my day has been a bit terrible , not gonna lie . i feel really down right now , and i haven t felt this sense of emptiness in a few weeks . i m trying to have a good day because it s beautiful outside , and i even ran to to pick up some beverages and lunch , but i just feel very hopeless .","279619":"no , i ve never planted a tree before .","279620":"i usually go any time i want my hair colored , which is between months . however , because of covid , the last time i cut and colored my hair was last november . i ve been trying to grow the long side of my hair out while keeping the shaved side to a or buzzed , and i always see the same hair stylist . she s actually a close friend of mine who has had her license for quite a number of years .","279621":"drink and smoke excessively . i don t exactly have the most positive coping mechanisms , so obviously i don t recommend this . it s just how i cope when i m dealing with a terrible mood .","279622":"i don t have a tiktok , but pretty much all of my friends have the app downloaded and watch them on a regular basis . my roommate has shown me a few they were pretty funny .","279623":"yes ! ! i love when helena bonham carter is in movies . idk what it is about her , but she s so unique , attractive , and hilarious .","279624":"rainfall .","279625":"freshly brewed coffee , gasoline , and firewood .","279626":"askfm , facebook , and snapchat .","279627":"i just have seasonal allergies pollen and stuff . which reminds me , i should probably take a zyrtec otherwise i m going to be a sniffling mess by this afternoon .","279628":"i ve been lied to in a relationship , but the relationship itself wasn t built on a lie .","279629":"you may simply be overthinking the situation however , again this is something that has to do with trust , and if you re having these feelings then you may not trust your partner as much as you think you do .","279630":"depends on what you mean by a lot , lol . mothers are more than just a mother , and they re entitled to have their down time and fun just like anyone else . if they want to take a vacation and see their friends , then they have the freedom to do so as long as they re not neglecting their child ren .","279631":"lol . no , i ve only ever had one dog and she was afraid of the doorbell ringing .","279632":"scrambled eggs on an english muffin .","279633":"i would say it s common , not necessarily normal . you should trust your partner to not be romantically sexually involved with their exes , so really a sense of jealousy shouldn t come up . perhaps you should explain these feelings to your partner .","279634":"it isn t the first time i ve been asked this question either , which is weird . but that s why i never give out what i make per hour i know stupid anons will make a big deal out of it , whether they think it s too little or too much or whatever . it s no one else s business .","279635":"i haven t ! ! i ll definitely have to look it up .","279636":"i love the smell of freshly cut grass ! ! other scents i enjoy are gasoline , brewed coffee in the morning , chlorine , lavender , ocean water , firewood , and old books .","279637":"i absolutely love your questions . ?","279638":"lately i ve been listening to ashnikko a lot , lol . hi , it s me by ashnikko https youtu . be o iqavlmda","279639":"i ve been on the beach at night , but i ve never swam in the ocean during those times .","279640":"on my side , usually . or in the fetal position , ahah .","279641":". . . wut . lol . i don t discuss my salary because i d rather not have anons on my page talking about money . that has literally no correlation with lgbtq rights . i also don t believe in any gods goddesses , and my fears include enclosed spaces , speaking in public , and abandonment .","279642":"my days are pretty set to a certain routine . i wake up between am , make breakfast , log into work at am , and then work until pm . afterwards , i feed the cats if no one has fed them yet , have dinner , shower , and then relax in front of the television .","279643":"disgusting ass mayonnaise .","279644":"as i ve discussed before , i don t talk about finances on my askfm page . this includes my salary , my bills , my rent , etc etc .","279645":"my friends are close and dear to my heart . i care about them more than most other things in my life .","279646":"if my salary was , year , i wouldn t be able to survive . lmaoo .","279647":"yeah , i don t see why not . you re probably better off asking a man who s in a relationship , though .","279648":"hopefully i ll be going camping with some friends .","279649":"not nearly enough as i would like , lol . however , i m going to ask for another raise when the pandemic is over and we return to the office .","279650":"he s pretty good . i recommend moral of the story and sloppy seconds .","279651":"watsky exquisite corpse","279652":"i am very cozy rn","279653":"when i asked for questions for video responses , this isn t what i was asking for .","279654":"idk if i would consider it cute especially in relationships . like , your partner is ideally supposed to take time out of their day to talk to you , regardless of how busy they may be . even a two minute phone call can mean the world to someone .","279655":"lol . i wish more anons had that mentality .","279656":"most definitely ! ! also , the askfm video camera is weird because it seems like it . . . elongates things ? i can t explain it , but it makes me look super weird .","279657":"thank you","279658":"lol , aw . there s no need to be anxious when sending me questions . if they cross a line , i ll simply tell you or i ll just delete the question . you don t seem like someone who would do that , though .","279659":"ahh , thank you ! ! i m still weirded out by showing my face because i look like a wreck of the time , but perhaps i ll do some tonight","279660":"lol . i mean , that has happened to me on only like one or two occasions . but i appreciate it .","279661":"claustrophobia and a fear of speaking in public not sure what that is technically called ? .","279662":"idk why everyone is being so nice to me today , ahah . thank you","279663":"aw , thank you ! ! i tend to receive backlash from it or just no response whatsoever if people decide to get testy with me , lol .","279664":"haha , that s true . there are also political social figures who were also terrible people , but i can t think of any specific names rn . besides trump . but , ya know . lmaoo .","279665":"i used to when i was much younger , but i haven t since i ve been in my s . i leave it up to the professionals , ahah . i trust my hair stylist so much and she s the one who s been coloring my hair for the past few years .","279666":"idk , i don t really have many hobbies besides listening to music , writing , and playing video games , lol . i get asked some questions about them every now and again . when it comes to video games , i ve been playing games since i was a child . i remember playing on my cousin s n and i think someone else in my family had the old nes console too . my first device was the original gameboy , and i played it constantly . then i got the gameboy advance and eventually i got the original xbox . i ve been buying xbox consoles since then .","279667":"i love singing , but i m just terrible at it .","279668":"when other people belittle , mock , or make fun of my friends .","279669":"no , i ve never attended a protest or rally before . large groups of people give me panic attacks , so as much as i want to go and show my support , it wouldn t be good for my mental health .","279670":"they re touching paws . ?","279671":"english i majored in professional writing with a focus in english literature while in college , haha . i ve always hated math , even though i grasped the topic pretty easily when i was in school .","279672":"the space needle in seattle looks pretty interesting .","279673":"as long as you re respectful , i m more than happy to answer any questions you have . you seem really thoughtful and considerate ! !","279674":"aw , this is so sweet . thank you for the questions ! ! i m pretty much an open book so i ll answer basically anything , unless they re like sexual or trollish questions .","279675":"i really have no idea . the whole thought of covid still gives me anxiety , so i try not to think about it . i m just keeping abreast of major news every now and again , such as the reopening phases . long island just entered phase two last week .","279676":"they them are pronouns for people who don t identify as she her or he him . they re considered gender neutral pronouns . however , gender can t really be quantified because it exists on a spectrum . you have the two gender binaries man and woman and what exists in between . personally , i just identify as non binary because i m neither a man nor a woman .","279677":"i drink alcohol . note obviously i don t recommend this . i have very unhealthy coping mechanisms .","279678":"honestly , i don t believe that s hyperbolic at all . this has had such a devastating impact on society and people s lives that it s weird to imagine things going back to what we thought of as normal . restaurants and bars have opened up with restrictions , for example . but i m terrified to go because people don t really have to wear masks at their outdoor tables , which i think sorta defeats the purpose . idk .","279679":"i honestly have no idea if there will even be a sense of normalcy after this , too . i m just trying to take each day as it comes .","279680":"my emotions have been within the normal range that i usually feel on a weekly basis , lol . that also isn t saying much because i constantly fluctuate between being content to being sad to being irrationally angry to being paranoid . my racing thoughts haven t been as terrible and i haven t been manic in a few weeks , though .","279681":"aw , thank you","279682":"i never said i expected people to know irl at least . when it comes to askfm , however , my gender is in my bio .","279683":"people assume i m cisgender when i m not , lol . non binary people can present as femme and that doesn t invalidate their gender .","279684":"forensic anthropology . it has always been something i considered as a career choice alongside my writing career .","279685":"the holocaust .","279686":"idk , there s nobody whom i really look up to or aspire to be . i have always just focused on my own self improvement according to my own needs and pace .","279687":"hello not too much , i m currently working . only two hours to go until i m clocked out for the day .","279688":"i used to walk occasionally when i was working in the office , especially considering the parking lot was far away from the building and i d also walk on my breaks . i haven t been physically active much at all since i started working from home , unfortunately . i haven t done anything to compensate for it , haha .","279689":"i just use an over the shoulder bag when i go out .","279690":"last week , i reminded my roommate that the garbage needed to be taken out to the curb when he got home from work , lol .","279691":"being mesmerized by the flames , listening to music , and chatting with friends .","279692":"zero . this is weird that i get this question so often i m pretty sure i answered this same question over the weekend .","279693":"depends on how long i m going to be out of the room . if i m leaving the room to just go to the bathroom or something , then i ll leave the light on . otherwise , i always turn it off .","279694":"i have it set to black at the moment , but i might change it up soon .","279695":"i m doing well . i decided to be unhealthy today i ordered mcdonalds for lunch , lol . i also got a mocha frappe , which i m excited to drink . only . hours left of work to go ! !","279696":"alcoholic margaritas , mojitos , and ipa beer . non alcoholic coffee and tea .","279697":"these days , i spend more time at home for obvious reasons . however , before quarantine i spent most of my time out of the house because of work . i would be out of the house from around am until pm .","279698":"mosquitos and wasps i m terrified of getting stung by a bee .","279699":"i d rather never have to pay for food at restaurants ! ! i love eating out every now again , and it would be great if all i had to do was tip the server , lol .","279700":"i usually enjoy drawing and painting , but i seldom do it .","279701":"it was once considered the epicenter of covid cases , unfortunately . last week , we entered phase two of re opening so now bars and restaurants and other small businesses can begin opening up again with certain restrictions .","279702":"that was my thinking too . i also don t want to over exert myself right off the bat . i ll probably start going only twice per week and then increase depending on how i m feeling progressing .","279703":"most definitely . i felt good that i was contributing to my health and losing weight . after gyms open back up again after covid is over , i m probably going to go back and start little by little . i m extremely out of shape so i m thinking of starting small instead of jumping right into it .","279704":"somewhat , yeah . i enjoyed the aftermath of it more than actually exercising itself , lol .","279705":"depends on my mood . because of quarantine and staying inside for about three months now , i ve been aching to go out , lol . some restaurants and bars are open with outdoor seating , but i m still wary because no one has to wear a mask at their table and everywhere just seems super crowded .","279706":"i ve never stayed in an airb b before , but the homes my friends have stayed in have been super cute . i d definitely jump on that opportunity .","279707":"i don t follow people simply because they told me that they ve followed me . i only follow a small number of people .","279708":"yeah , i sometimes drink red bull . i prefer it over monster and other energy drinks .","279709":"besides refilling my cup of coffee , i just finished writing a magazine article for work .","279710":"i used to go to the gym , but that was way before the coronavirus even started . i stopped going last summer or so because i lost the motivation .","279711":"hello do you have a question ?","279712":"sunny with a slight breeze not too hot , but not unbearable cold either . around degrees fahrenheit .","279713":"what is your passion in life , and what are you doing to work towards it ?","279714":"i mostly handle my problems on my own . i don t like worrying or burdening others with my problems .","279715":"not really , at least not lately , lmaoo . there have been times where my life was nothing but chaos , but things have been easygoing lately .","279716":"any statue celebrating the confederacy and oppression of bipoc .","279717":"i m in a pretty decent mood i m tired , but not to the point of exhaustion and i can focus on my work today .","279718":"like i said , i don t remember .","279719":"probably at some point , but i really don t remember . i also had aspirations of running away .","279720":"i say hi to them if we re both outside at the same time , but i ve never had a conversation with them before .","279721":"i prefer dark earth tones , such as mahogany , navy blue , and forest green .","279722":"it is , actually . lmaoo .","279723":"i prefer sushi over pizza . i usually order salmon avocado rolls and spicy tuna rolls .","279724":"no , far from it . it s getting better in certain areas , but overall there s still a lot of danger involved and people are still required to wear masks and social distance at least in the united states and new york .","279725":"yes , i ve been writing poetry since i was a teenager . here s one of my more recent poems from last year","279726":"i d rather stay the way i am now , which is quiet but also outgoing in small groups of people . i d consider myself intelligent , but i also have a lot of room to grow .","279727":"neither , i don t like sports .","279728":"some pop music , like ariana grande , haha .","279729":"i have absolutely zero knowledge about astrology , and i don t even know the signs of my friends except my ex .","279730":"my neighbor was blasting lewis capaldi the other night , and it really made me go into my feels . lmaoo .","279731":"yeah , but it wasn t so much of an abrupt falling out as much as it was just drifting apart from each other until we stopped talking completely . it s just what happens when you get older .","279732":"i ve always wanted to visit new zealand and iceland because they both look like such beautiful places .","279733":"i think i did once with the lotr films ! ! i absolutely love those movies and can watch them endlessly .","279734":"probably . my roommates say that i don t look different compared to when we first moved in , but i m sure i gained a couple pounds simply because i m not walking every day like i used to when i went to the office for work .","279735":"lol , no . he wasn t the recipient of it , my friend was . his girlfriend was at the party also .","279736":"yes , he was there .","279737":"you don t have to be in a relationship with someone to tell someone you love them . normalize saying i love you to your friends . it isn t weird at all .","279738":"i ve mainly listened to music in english , but when i was dating my ex , he and his father introduced me to a lot of great cuban songs .","279739":"i was walking in new york city with a friend to a comedy show , and i ended up tripping over my feet and almost falling . a woman walking next to me chuckled and said , don t worry , that happens to me all the time . it just stuck with me for some reason , haha . it made me feel comfortable , otherwise i would have dwelled on it for super long .","279740":"last night when i was hanging out with my friends .","279741":"to provide people with answers to life s greatest questions .","279742":"universal healthcare .","279743":"a really skittish cat . lmao .","279744":"even bigger , better picture of long boi","279745":"i ve met the members of linkin park , as well as a few people from rooster teeth don t know if they re considered famous or not though .","279746":"hot dogs and hamburgers on the grill last night , if that counts .","279747":"i don t believe so i don t think anyone on either side of my family have had twins .","279748":"no , my mother s parents passed away before i was born .","279749":"yes , we have two calendars hanging in the kitchen .","279750":"that s entirely up to you i can t make that call for you , it s something a person has to decide on their own based on their own levels of privacy .","279751":"thank you ! !","279752":"i believe i was ! !","279753":"i probably would , lol . i can t see myself spending money on a switch though , especially considering how many games i have for xbox that i haven t touched recently .","279754":"i m five feet tall .","279755":"i m not arabic , so it doesn t apply to me .","279756":"definitely not , lol .","279757":"another black white shot in montauk , new york .","279758":"i don t play animal crossing , no . however , almost everyone else i know does , lol . both of my roommates play it often .","279759":"usually , yeah . my mind has a bad habit of racing at night before i go to sleep , so i ll think about everything from the past to the present and to the future .","279760":"i haven t been to many sporting events , but i did go to a new york rangers vs new york islanders hockey game many , many years ago . it was a lot of fun and the rangers won ! .","279761":"that seems a bit excessive , lol . perhaps i would like it if i could put the television screens to the same relaxing youtube video , like cracking wood in a fireplace or snow falling , but otherwise that would be too overwhelming .","279762":"i don t think people are forgetting about the coronavirus , but there are events going on in today s world i . e . the blm movement that are taking precedent over quarantining .","279763":"sunset over the atlantic ocean","279764":"they re gray .","279765":"yeah , sometimes if i get a bagel from the bagel store , i ll order one with vegetable cream cheese .","279766":"right now , i m thinking about whether or not i want to go back to sleep or play video games .","279767":"no , i m not close with anyone in my family .","279768":"aw , thank you ! ! i hope you do too i m not planning on doing much today , i m exhausted from last night . i ve just been sitting at my laptop with a cup of iced coffee and browsing through social media .","279769":"the best way to do so is probably by asking and answering questions off of anonymous .","279770":"well we did end up hugging goodbye at the end of the night , lol . it was fun , though . everyone had a great time .","279771":"hello do you have a question ?","279772":"my day has been fine so far . i woke up about an hour ago and just had mcdonald s breakfast , lol .","279773":"i never stated i was fat when i was years old , lol . i m fat now but this photo was taken almost a decade ago . additionally , it isn t disrespectful to , uh . . . wear shorts in public . smh .","279774":"yeah , i have a slight overbite .","279775":"no , my instagram is private .","279776":"picked up my car from the mechanic , went shopping , cleaned the house , and did my makeup","279777":"i have a few times , yeah . i seldom smoke marijuana these days though .","279778":"i never ended relationships with my parents i never said i did either . i usually go over there to help out every weeks .","279779":"stupid by ashnikko and truth hurts by lizzo .","279780":"i m already grown up . besides , it s not as if i m going to drink it all tonight i would literally die , lmaoo .","279781":"lol , idk what else to call it . we re having a few people over for my roommate s birthday but we re all going to be at least six feet apart from each other in the backyard .","279782":"i m having a social distancing party tonight and probably bought way too much alcohol .","279783":"zero .","279784":"i m home .","279785":"sometimes i do get overwhelmed with how much negativity there can be on social media , especially lately , but it s also good to disconnect from it for your own mental health every once in a while . it s all about balance .","279786":"my father and i were talking about my grandfather who passed away last month , and we both agreed he probably d ed from the coronavirus because he was showing a lot of symptoms of it right before he passed . but he lived in a nursing home and apparently nursing homes are notorious for suppressing numbers of cases . it really makes me wonder . he declined so quickly .","279787":"i understand that i m thankful for social media for the same reasons , it provides me with an escape and i ve made a lot of online friends as a result of it . social media can be both good and bad , depending on how you view it .","279788":"disgusting . those statues represent slavery and oppression and the people should not be celebrated .","279789":"yeah , i graduated high school in at the age of . this was taken after high school , so it was probably or . i do too things seemed so much simpler back then , lmaoo .","279790":"either or , i don t remember .","279791":"if this doesn t define year old me , i don t know what does .","279792":"no , i can barely deal with my depression at it is , haha .","279793":"i try to distract myself by using social media or playing video games .","279794":"i just said because both of my roommates were at work , lol .","279795":"yes , my father is giving me a ride since my roommates are both at work rn .","279796":"i don t think her reasoning is silly , no . everyone has their reasons to break up with someone , and like you said , she seemed to feel bad about ending the relationship but it was something that had to be done . i wouldn t dwell on it too much , tbh . if she didn t see it getting serious anywhere down the road then there s not much you can do except focus on other things to get your mind off of her and move forward with your life .","279797":"it isn t really all that difficult to be healthy in the united states , because although there are a lot of processed foods , there are also just as much fresh foods to purchase at the grocery store . sometimes it can be a little bit more expensive , but it s less expensive to shop for groceries than to eat out .","279798":"cont and said she doesn t want us to continue with the romantic talk and s . exual stuff if we don t see things actually getting serious so no one gets hurt . i said ok but we both still continued to give into it . even tho i wanna be with her long term , i still wanted her to feel comfortable . today she called me and said she decided it would be best if we didn t talk anymore , because she thinks our feelings will only grow and it won t amount to anything bc she doesn t see us in a serious relationship or anything down the road . and that she s recently become more religious and thinks our lustful relationship isn t condusive to the new path she s taken . she seemed to feel really bad about it but she said it s what she decided is best . i feel angry and heartbroken . do you have any advice ? i will miss her so much you have to respect her decision , first and foremost . relationships of any kind are a two way street , and they won t work if someone isn t involved in the relationship but the other person cares too much . if she says she doesn t want to pursue this any longer , you have to respect that decision and let her go . i understand it may be difficult , but perhaps it is for the best . the only thing you can really do from this point is focus on yourself and your own happiness , while also respecting her and not pushing the subject any more .","279799":"honestly , all i d love is a wraparound porch with awnings so i can sit outside with some chairs and a table . maybe even a swinging bench , haha .","279800":"obviously i m referring to my current friends , not my friends from years ago .","279801":"i would think technology , at least in modern societies . our worlds revolve around technology , and not only by means of phones and computers , but also within all types of professions like the medical , engineering , legal , and business ownership industries .","279802":"my friends in general have changed my life more positively because they ve always supported and understood me when i needed help the most .","279803":"probably mid february when i was trying to fall asleep the night before i left for the cruise . i remember being so excited , not only for the cruise but for having an entire week off of work , because it was a new experience .","279804":"cont . . . i told him about my disorders then he got angry and told me that it s not a competition and i felt so bad for opening up . do you think it was wrong of me to share my issues ? no , you weren t in the wrong at all . he shouldn t have interpreted it as a competition , and honestly he should have realized you were saying that as a means to relate to him and make him feel more secure instead of trying to one up him . i m sorry that he made you feel bad , but you definitely weren t in the wrong here at all . it s natural for people to divulge their personal issues medical issues when someone does it first because it acts as a way to relate to the person further .","279805":"graduating from college with honors while battling a lot of mental health issues .","279806":"as far as i know , we re still friends on social media .","279807":"this is written under the assumption that all women have children , lmaoo . that couldn t be further from the truth .","279808":"i have in my camera roll , but i don t know how many i have in all of my albums combined , lol .","279809":"idk , at this point i would say a or . cases have been dwindling a lot where i live , which is a really good sign , and bars and restaurants just opened up again with some restrictions , of course .","279810":"i m doing well . my mechanic just called me and said that i can pick up my car in a few hours , so i just ordered dunkin donuts in the meantime and i m perusing social media on my laptop until my car is ready .","279811":"i hate when people talk over me while i m in the middle of speaking . i find it really rude and disrespectful .","279812":"just because i live on my own now doesn t mean i m happy . i still have mental illness , lol .","279813":"the wage gap is very much real . it s common knowledge that women in general make less than men do considering if they have the same credentials and job description .","279814":"i ve been trying not to lately because it s just been making me super anxious and sad .","279815":"sleep , have some friends over , sit around a fire in the backyard , drink and smoke , and just have good conversations .","279816":"certain smells bring back memories of the past .","279817":"i either let things go extremely quickly easily or it takes me a long time to come to terms with something and let it go . there s no in between .","279818":"i enjoy painting , but i m terrible at it .","279819":"thank you","279820":"morality and intentions . i don t necessarily believe in good and evil , but i believe it does stem from a person s intentions when they decide to do things .","279821":"yeah , i think it s always been terrible . it s also come out more in recent years because of the government s lack of caring about bipoc and the regression we as a society have had regarding fairness and equal rights .","279822":"lol , i ve realized that every time i perceive myself to be happy , i m really just overloading myself with substances to create a false sense of happiness that s only temporary .","279823":"whatever is on sale i m not picky .","279824":"having campfires outside or going to to the bar , usually . i don t really do much outside of those things .","279825":"i don t have celine s phone number . either way , it isn t my business . she probably had a good reason to leave askfm .","279826":"i m not celine s keeper . i don t know why she deactivated .","279827":"hello i haven t been to a protest , but i ve been participating in other ways .","279828":"i ve always wanted to learn latin , haha .","279829":"i have no clue , i ve never discussed salaries with anyone i ve worked with .","279830":"probably things like santa , the tooth fairy , the easter bunny , etc etc .","279831":"does a lighthouse count ? haha .","279832":"movie at home movie theaters are always way too crowded .","279833":"i learned them in elementary school and i know the capitals of i d say half of the states ? i honestly have no clue , haha it isn t something i ve ever needed to think about in like years .","279834":"well yeah , but nothing distracting or inappropriate .","279835":"i m single .","279836":"yeah , i order chinese food every so often .","279837":"i don t live in new york city . i live in the suburbs on long island .","279838":"no , quite the opposite . i don t look at anyone when i m out or anything , i just get my business done and leave as soon as possible .","279839":"no , i ve never seen any of them in person before .","279840":"it s weird that it s not an option on askfm , because that s the standard for pretty much every other social media site .","279841":"no , i m not going to do that .","279842":"replying to emails consists of of my workday .","279843":"i ve talked about it so much when i first initially spoke about it , i really don t feel like explaining it again . all that matters is that we re still friends and everything is amicable between us .","279844":"idk what s going on with heyguyswantstuffjustask because i ve barely logged on today , but regardless if it s about the blm movement , it isn t about a different opinion . it s about having a different moral compass . opinions are things like favorite colors or bands or liking one thing over another . it isn t an opinion to think black people aren t deserving of fair treatment by law enforcement . it s just bigotry .","279845":"breakfast scrambled eggs , bacon , and a buttered english muffin . lunch halal lamb and rice platter with white sauce and hummus . dinner sushi rolls usually spicy tuna and salmon avocado with miso soup .","279846":"all lives cannot matter until black lives matter .","279847":"no , we broke up last year .","279848":"hello yes , i still live in new york . i ve been all right . i m currently living in a house with two roommates moved out of my parents house last year , and my mental health has gotten a lot better as a result .","279849":"montauk , new york .","279850":"i prefer silver over gold jewelry .","279851":"i think makeup is a fun and creative way for people to express themselves and make them feel good about themselves .","279852":"yeah , i ve been driving since i was years old . honestly , i ve always been terrified of driving a car but i had no choice but to get my license and a car in order to commute to school and work during that time .","279853":"i m not answering the other inquiries because you blasted my askfm page within the few minutes i was away from my phone . so i ll just post them below . i ve explained racism on my askfm page numerous times over the past two or so weeks . i ve called out friends for being racist . i ve cut out friends for their racist ideologies . i have zero tolerance for it . but you re talking about a random link to a random question that lnr liked , that i didn t click because i don t open links on askfm . i ve also talked to lyndsey in the past about her racist remarks , over a year ago when she initially made them . that doesn t make me a white supremicist , by any means . lmao . you re drawing conclusions based on an answer she liked , and also directing your anger towards me as if i m the one who s making racist remarks myself . i m not . you can keep making broad statements and random remarks and calling me a nazi , but i m not going to sit here and apologize or say i m wrong because i didn t do anything wrong . i literally woke up to your post this morning .","279854":"i didn t report you , but all right . i was answering your previous statement .","279855":"? ? ? i m not sure why you re angry at me when i m not the person who posted something racist whatever it was , i didn t click the link . if you re such an advocate yourself , then you should take it upon yourself to educate others . i ve made my thoughts clear on askfm multiple times . additionally , i ve dropped friends acquaintances who have been racist throughout this entire ordeal , so you really have no idea what you re talking about , lmaoo .","279856":"i much prefer coffee .","279857":"it seems like you re directing your anger towards me instead of towards the person who has made those posts . here s a thought instead of asking me to explain racism to people , why don t you go onto their pages and do it yourself ? cc lnr","279858":"probably not , although i wouldn t be opposed to a neck tattoo .","279859":"i d say that music has had the biggest influence on my life . it s completed changed and saved my life in so many different ways , and i consider it to be a passion of mine .","279860":"ask me questions","279861":"well , at the moment nowhere considering everything is closed , lol . i used to go to the bar with some friends , though .","279862":"leftover halal food from when i ordered it yesterday .","279863":"i seldom write by hand i always type . it s easier for me to keep up with my thoughts when i type .","279864":"i don t follow people upon request .","279865":"thank you","279866":"june , .","279867":"oh my , i d definitely be sent to the psych hospital and or fired from my job .","279868":"i haven t dated someone besides my ex since , so i have no idea what my type is .","279869":"eh , not necessarily . at least in the typical way most people think of it . i answered the question in the context that i assumed they meant romantic soulmate . however , i do believe that people can have many soulmates in both romantic and platonic senses .","279870":"i wished my roommate a happy birthday today , if that counts . lol .","279871":"well . . . i thought i did .","279872":"well to be fair , i always delete most of the rude ones , lol . in my opinion , it s worthless to get into an argument with someone who clearly is posting just to argue so i just delete their question statement .","279873":"depends on the kind of questions you receive and or want to receive as well as the audience you have . personally , i like having anonymous enabled because i get a lot of interesting questions that way as well .","279874":"not usually , but i do love the occasional road trip . it s fun sitting in the car and smoking and listening to music and chatting with friends .","279875":"yeah , it wasn t healthy for me at all . i d restrict my diet to less than calories per day in an effort to lose weight , and the lower the number , the happier i was . it was an addictive process .","279876":"perhaps , i m sure there are some people who are very secure with themselves .","279877":"not usually .","279878":". . . what .","279879":"all of them ? i toss and turn in my sleep .","279880":"yellow roses .","279881":"lol . . . let s not go there .","279882":"i prefer using either a towel or paper towels . i ve heard that hand dryers only spread the germs around , actually although i m not sure how true that is .","279883":"nah , although i ve always been curious about them .","279884":"i m turning in november .","279885":"not in a serious context , no .","279886":"samsung galaxy s .","279887":"yeah , i m not comfortable talking about finances and expenses and stuff on askfm , haha . i will say this though it was much cheaper to rent a house with roommates than to rent an apartment by myself . i wouldn t have been able to afford an apartment if i didn t have roommates or anything .","279888":"they went to urgent care and got the test there , and that s when they found out they were positive when the results came back . i don t believe any of them actually went to the hospital .","279889":"i ve never watched it , but i know it s on netflix or something , right ?","279890":"not really , no . i ve been mainly listening to ashnikko , badflower , starset , grandson , and two feet lately .","279891":"it isn t a priority at the moment , but it is an eventual goal .","279892":"haha , well my ex and i broke up last august but i didn t really start talking about it until a few months ago . i moved out of my parents house last october i m currently renting a house with two roommates . and now i have four cats . since the coronavirus outbreak , i ve been working from home since march , which has been really good for my mental health actually . i have my bad days at times , but my good days certainly outweigh the bad right now .","279893":"i know a lot of people who have had the coronavirus , yes .","279894":"thank you ! !","279895":"the non binary people i know acknowledge gender , but they don t identify as man or woman . i ve honestly never heard of a non binary person dismissing gender entirely .","279896":"it falls under the trans umbrella , but some people consider non binary to be different than trans . i ve seen people speak about non binary folks in separation to trans folks i . e . saying cis , non binary and trans people .","279897":"i m single . and like i said , it really all depends on the person and what looks best on them .","279898":"when people question my sex , it makes me extremely amused . thank you for the entertainment .","279899":"as if they have any knowledge of gender identity and sex outside of what their parents taught them , lol . the ignorance of some people is to be expected , but it s silly to proclaim someone s gender when you re not that person .","279900":"you re confusing sex and gender . sex is within your chromosomes . gender is how you identify outside of that sex . you re cisgender or transgender , and there are multiple layers to being transgender .","279901":"it s more weird to me that people want to know what genitalia i have . it s alarming .","279902":"evidently you re wrong considering me and thousands and more other people are non binary . just because you don t believe it exists doesn t mean it isn t true .","279903":"depends on the person .","279904":"there are more than two genders , lol . you can t quantify gender like that .","279905":"i m non binary .","279906":"i don t really think you understand that i don t care , lol . think of me however you want it doesn t change anything .","279907":"okay . lmaoo .","279908":"no . non binary simply means that i m not one of the binary genders man or woman . i ve always had doubts about my assigned gender at birth , and i first came out as genderfluid years ago or so i think . then i discovered what non binary was and it seemed to fit better .","279909":"the obsession some people have with genitalia is astounding .","279910":"i changed because i decided to put my own happiness first and foremost .","279911":"i honestly have no idea i wouldn t be working rn , that s for sure . my job relies on the internet .","279912":"uhh , depends on how comfortable i am around someone , lol . after living with me for a while , my roommates have realized how weird bizarre i am and have noticed some of my mannerisms .","279913":"i hate when people push their fetishes onto others because it s inappropriate . that s why i delete all questions pertaining to fetishes .","279914":"i feel like it s a bit inappropriate for askfm because there are a lot of children on this site , but in general it doesn t phase me .","279915":"you asked me to follow you that s a request , lol .","279916":"i don t follow people upon request .","279917":"i have a kettle that i pour over a teabag . if i m drinking black tea , then i ll steep the teabag for minutes and then pour in one packet of sugar and a splash of milk .","279918":"thank you ! !","279919":"i ve never submitted my writing really to any publications except for one specific online publication through medium . com . the publication deals with mental health and a lot of my essays revolve around mental health . they ve published maybe of my essays .","279920":"just keep writing and submitting your stories to various publications . no doubt you ll receive a lot of rejections , but you shouldn t let it deter you .","279921":"if i knew the subject , i would have started writing it already . lmaoo . however , i did have one idea for nanowrimo last year but i never really elaborated on it .","279922":"dramatic fiction or perhaps fantasy .","279923":"i do want to publish a book , that s one of my ultimate goals . i don t know about writing a game though , haha .","279924":"i ve never heard anything to indicate that , personally . he was said to be ab sive years ago but then evidence came out that amber heard was actually lying and she was the one who was ab sing him .","279925":"it doesn t matter . they re still racist .","279926":"yes , without a doubt .","279927":"same to you , my friend . ?","279928":"because then those people don t have to face responsibility for their statements . they feel the freedom to say whatever they want without repurcussion .","279929":"either johnny depp or robert downey jr . angelina jolie and helena bonham carter come in close though .","279930":"anonymous trolls , obviously .","279931":"the past few days have been sunny in the mid s fahrenheit , but today it s a bit cooler and cloudy .","279932":"and there are an abundance of people who are racist , lol . however , i think my opinion that the riots are justified is more unpopular than anything else .","279933":"i heard about that , yeah . i honestly have no words .","279934":"not tonight , but maybe in the next few days . it all depends on my mood , haha .","279935":"hot dogs on the grill .","279936":"i don t personally know anyone , no . mind you , i have a very small inner circle , haha .","279937":"i m constantly in a state of writer s block , haha . honestly , i seldom write creatively and on the off chance that i do , it s because i was inspired greatly by something and was in the mood to write about it .","279938":"yeah , it s created reform on local and state levels with passing of laws banning chokeholds as well as making it possible for police misconduct records to be made public , among other things .","279939":"it most definitely was .","279940":"it could be either , but the fact of the matter is that when white people are pulled over , we always fear for getting a ticket , getting a fine , getting points on our license , etc etc . black people fear for their lives . it s a completely different scenario .","279941":"look up how many people , specifically women , have tried to report an assault but were turned away by the police . it happens across all races , unfortunately .","279942":"hopefully by that time , the coronavirus will have calmed down and society will have returned to a sense of normalcy . i usually just go to the bar with a few friends to celebrate , although in general i don t like making my birthday into a big deal .","279943":"because that s what people have been conditioned to do and in most of those cases , help is rarely given . if anything , it s more traded off to other professionals while the cops write the report and get their quota in . there are millions of cases of assault , for example , where the cops did literally nothing for the survivor . it s despicable .","279944":"idk , to be honest . i haven t been to many places at all , but i d probably choose either somewhere in more northern new england , or down in austin , texas , or maybe the pacific northwest . i ve also always been interested in what s available in virginia west virginia .","279945":"i ve never read her books or watched her show , but i find it easy to organize declutter if i have the motivation to do so , haha . it always makes me feel better afterwards .","279946":"what about it ? you don t have a blue life , it s a profession that you chose to do . most cops are corrupt af , and if you re one of the good cops then you would recognize that the entire criminal justice system is oppressive and quit your job .","279947":"thank you ! ! that s so f cked up , smh . it doesn t surprise me though in the least . only further proof that the american government is corrupt af .","279948":"i ve been spending more time outdoors the past week since it s been nice outside ! ! granted it s only been in the backyard , but it s a nice change of pace compared to being stuck inside . i m grateful to have a big backyard .","279949":"unconditional love and parental support . an environment in which they can grow without fear of judgment or discrimination . the freedom to express themselves and be their genuine selves without repurcussion .","279950":"black lives matter the protests and riots are justified . musicals made into movies are top tier films . alcohol is too normalized in society probably not just american society but society as a whole . that being said , alcohol and drug addiction is a mental health issue not a choice . self diagnosis isn t valid in most circumstances . you can easily say you think you have x , y , and z but to downright say you definitely have those disorders without getting a proper diagnosis is infringing on mental health communities . j . k . rowling is scum . i ve always been a fan of the hp books from a young age , but she s proven herself to be a sh tty person .","279951":"i m not sure of the history behind why marijuana is illegal still , but regardless , it shouldn t be anymore .","279952":"nah , i only ever listen to songs that make me feel good or at least put me in my feels , lmaoo .","279953":"yeah , i ve been working from home since mid march .","279954":"i m doing well ! ! i had a super productive work day , i did the dishes on my lunch break then cleaned the kitchen and bathroom floors after work . my roommate just grilled hot dogs sausages on the bbq and now we re just sitting outside drinking and chatting .","279955":"beautiful sunset .","279956":"yeah , there s no reason why it shouldn t be legalized . it s better for you than both alcohol cigarettes , marijuana has multiple health benefits , and it should ideally just be sold to the public in dispensaries if you re above a certain age much like tobacco and alcohol products .","279957":"oof , i d rather not get into this conversation again . lmaoo . uh , just a lot of really stupid illegal sh t that could have gotten me put in jail .","279958":"i totally understand that . initially i thought that my mental health would be worse off while working from home , when in reality it s gotten so much better because of the lack of stress of being in the office , lack of anxiety driving two hours per day , etc etc . i feel more comfortable , i don t even feel burnt out by the end of the day , and i use my breaks to clean the house so i feel even more productive . my company is super confidential too , which is why i m also not surprised they haven t said anything . it s to be expected at this point . however , people s main concern is that they re going to tell us , like . . . for example , on friday that we ll have to return to the office on monday . it won t give anyone time to really prepare for that change . especially the parents who have been working from home .","279959":"no , i have memory loss so most of my past experiences have either been lost in time or totally blocked out of my memory .","279960":"lol . for real , though . i m here for a good time , not a long time .","279961":"i m not entirely sure they ve been extremely quiet about where the company is headed , which has concerned a lot of us . people are going to need to prepare to go back to work , and we re already that they re going to give us a last minute s notice . management did send out a survey asking us to answer do you prefer working from home or in the office and why ? but we never heard anything back from that .","279962":"i wouldn t survive a damn week in the wilderness , lmaoo . i m not outdoorsy by any means , but hopefully my friends will teach me some things if when we go camping this summer .","279963":"taking a train to my job would be an even longer , more complicated ordeal . driving is the simplest way , and it s how the majority of people commute to places where i live .","279964":"and yet , they re so incredibly delicious .","279965":"sunbathe in the backyard , go to outdoor bars restaurants , grill food and have a campfire with friends , and go on walks through local parks and gardens to take photos .","279966":"i d rather have no cell phone . i can access the internet social media on my laptop .","279967":"no , i don t interact with anyone really when i m in the office to begin with . we re all focused on our own work , and the times i do spend with others are on breaks with two of my closest coworkers whom i consider friends . it s more of the anxiety of being in the office than anything else , including driving the two hours per day . it s mentally draining .","279968":"most definitely . working from home has been an amazing experience , and honestly i m really dreading the day that management tells us we can return to the office .","279969":"i ve always been happy to go on cute dates to small , local restaurants and ordering food and drinks while sitting outside talking about whatever comes to mind . there s a bar restaurant that s located on a beach and i used to go there often , order food and drinks and sit in the sand and watch the waves come in .","279970":"idk , i m pretty content with where i am right now . i m relaxing after work , my roommate is about to start grilling some hot dogs for dinner soon , and i have a drink in my hand .","279971":"apparently supporting the protests riots , as well as defunding the police , is a fairly unpopular opinion .","279972":"you evidently don t know me very well .","279973":"you guys are making this all too difficult and more complicated than it should be , lmaoo . animal ab sers are terrible people . people who ab se humans are also terrible people . people who ab se both animals and humans are even worse , more terrible people . hopefully this is more understandable to you guys who are misinterpreting my statements .","279974":"oh , in that case i m not sure . they haven t given us a date to return to the office , if we re going to return to the office at all .","279975":"i never said it wasn t . i said that people who ab se animals also frequently ab se people .","279976":"? ? ? i work hours a week . i m not sure what other work you mean .","279977":"i ve spoken out about that topic plenty of times , lol . physical ab se and verbal emotional ab se are not comparable , and it s wrong to pit them against each other .","279978":"no , i ve never been a fan of battle royale type of games like that .","279979":"i ve been working this entire time , lol .","279980":"fighting for a person s right to exist is better than doing absolutely nothing at all .","279981":"i understand that . and i did answer your question . i m not here to repeat myself if you can t understand the point i was making when i explained it the first time .","279982":"you guys evidently aren t understanding my point , lol .","279983":"this isn t about muslims or hispanic people , though this is about black lives . there are an assortment of minorities who face oppression and discrimination , but right now society is focused on black people and how they ve been ab sed and m rdered over centuries of oppression .","279984":"uh , i did answer your question . i said that people who ab se animals are also often ab sive to their families , partners , etc etc . i m not going to repeat what i just said , lol .","279985":"i m not really sure what a social media influencer is exactly unless you mean like , youtubers or something ? . however , i believe that people have a moral obligation to speak out against injustice , or at the very least do their part in fighting against racism and police brutality whether that s raising awareness online , signing petitions , donating to bail funds , buying from black owned businesses , attending protests , etc etc . if you re in a position of influence , then i do think it is part of your responsibility to speak out against racism for your followers even if that isn t necessarily part of your job . if you have your own private reasons to not speak out , then that can be respected , but i also don t believe that people should just ignore what s happening .","279986":"people who ab se animals are often people who also ab se their spouses families other people in their lives . they can t see the value of an animal life , and they often believe that animals aren t as worthy as human beings either .","279987":"the government is hiding intelligence about extraterrestrial life from the general public and utilizing their technology for the military and warfare .","279988":"confidence , a dark sense of humor , compassion for animals , a hard work ethic , a responsible attitude , etc etc .","279989":"why racism is still seen as a controversial issue in .","279990":"as long as it isn t interfering with their responsibilities as a parent , then i don t see a problem with it .","279991":"not really , i just believe in coincidences .","279992":"i d rather be able to pause moments and allow myself to fully enjoy them . time goes by so fast these days , especially joyful nights with friends . sometimes i wish i could live in those moments forever .","279993":"sorta ? my ex and i were long distance for around months when i first attended college out of state . granted , we did break up for one or two months during that time frame though .","279994":"i used to , but i ve promised myself to not do that anymore . i used to give too many people chances that they didn t deserve to make them happy , even if it meant sacrifice on my part , and it only hurt me in the end .","279995":"animal ab sers are just as terrible as people who ab se humans if not worse , and they should be subjected to the same level of punishment .","279996":"it can be both nonbinary can be an identity in itself as well as an umbrella term for other genders outside of the gender binary .","279997":"yes , that s the most relaxing way for me to wind down at the end of the day either watching the sunset or simply sitting outside and listening to the wind and birds . it really helps me decompress after being stressed out .","279998":"i like vanilla greek yogurt with blueberries and granola .","279999":"i d rather lose an entire year of my life who s to say the day being relived is a good or bad day ? it would also become monotonous after a while .","280000":"yeah , i love goth styles of clothing .","280001":"not necessarily as long as they re respectful of my views , then i can be friends with a person who has different viewpoints from me .","280002":"i d like to believe so , but my attention span has for sure dwindled in recent years . i focus and think well enough at work , but outside of work , i barely have the attention span to watch an entire movie in one sitting .","280003":"i don t watch reality shows , haha . i honestly have no idea .","280004":"i m most comfortable with chill , down to earth people who like discussing topics with an open mind and are willing to listen to other points of view . most of my friends are like this thankfully , and i m super comfortable saying anything around them .","280005":"i don t think it s worth it for me to really ask for advice because i can handle my problems on my own and don t require outside input . i prefer giving advice to my friends who ask for it .","280006":"i wouldn t reveal his secrets , no . that s just disrespectful . i often talked about our sex life though , lol .","280007":"nah , i never talked badly about him . it was just about things that confused or frustrated me .","280008":"on occasion , i did . i mostly kept my insecurities to myself when i was in a relationship , though . i m much better at giving advice than asking for advice .","280009":"it hasn t really changed . i still text my friends every other day or so , the only difference is that i haven t seen any of them in person for around three months .","280010":"yes , i d like to get surgery to give myself more of a jawline , as well as top surgery .","280011":"i understand this entirely . i m sorry you re going through this . i feel the same way towards myself as well , i get so sick of myself and i revert back to a mindset that i ve had since i was a teenager . that s why my coping mechanisms are unhealthy it s unfortunately all i ve ever known . i went to therapy for years , but it was difficult to really establish new coping mechanisms , especially in terms of rage , because what i ve always done has been ingrained in me for so long .","280012":"borderline personality disorder .","280013":"i d prefer to stay home . now that i have a house to live in with my roommates , i finally have the freedom to do as i wish without restriction or judgment . i used to go to parties to escape from my parents house , but now i don t feel the need to do so anymore .","280014":"i m probably not the best person to ask this question , considering i deal with rage all the time and my coping mechanisms aren t healthy by any means .","280015":"nah , i m good .","280016":"i have to admit , it made me chuckle when i just looked it up and saw it was beheaded . i don t think there should be statues of anyone in history who had a past of being oppression towards other groups of people to the point that they re revered , for some reason . columbus was a vile person .","280017":"writer , editor , and program administrator .","280018":"a nightmare that i had while i was taking a nap two days ago .","280019":"i haven t attended any protests , unfortunately . i ve been advocating on my own time through social media , signing petitions , etc etc . i have a few friends who have been to protests around here , and they said they were really great because they ve all been peaceful protests .","280020":"self confidence however , not to the point of arrogance , because that s an

.","280233":"it doesn t seem malicious at all , so it isn t really scary just weird and sometimes unexpected , lmao . the vibes i get are silly if anything , so none of us are really too concerned about it . mind you , my roommate s mother s ashes are sitting in an urn on his dresser in his room . idk if you guys believe in this sort of thing , but i definitely believe it could be her just messing with us .","280234":"i believe they still do as far as i know ? the last i heard , he only suspended his campaign . i could be wrong though , idk . i ll have to see when i vote on the rd .","280235":"so like . . . my house is definitely a little haunted , lmaoo . we had another experience two nights ago . my roommate was awake around am , when me and my other roommate were fast asleep . he then heard a really loud sigh coming from his own bedroom that wasn t his own , nor was it his cats , but he turned on his lights and nothing was there . other strange occurrences last week , i was in the kitchen and my roommate was in his bedroom playing video games . our other roommate has a habit of making that weird squeak sound through his lips when he s thinking . however , at that moment he was at work . my roommate and i both heard that sound , and my roommate calls out , leigh , is name home ? and i go no , he s at work . then we both realized we heard the same exact sound , but neither of us did it . one night a month or so ago , i woke up randomly at am . i heard footsteps going down the hallway , but didn t think much of it because i know my roommate stays up late . we were talking a few days later , and apparently he also woke up randomly at the same time and heard the footsteps too , even though all of us were in our beds and our other roommate was sleeping . again about a month ago , i was in my bedroom and my two roommates were in the hallway just talking . we all heard knocking . i assumed it was the front door , but it didn t sound like the front door sound like that hard wood type of knock . my roommates were really confused and started searching around the kitchen and living room , and they were knocking on things to try to replicate the sound to see where it came from . apparently it was a knock on the kitchen radiator however , no one was in the kitchen , not even the cats . my roommate has been in the basement on several occasions and thought he saw shadows out of the corner of his eye , but nothing was there when he turned around . this has happened on numerous occasions .","280236":"if anything , i build up emotional walls more than anything else . i m very hesitant to talk and get to know new people because i don t know their intentions , and it s difficult for me to trust others .","280237":"i would tell my year old self that things do get better in terms of my mental health , and that working towards my goals is the strongest way for me to reach a level of being content with my life . i would tell them that i would finally move out of my parents house and start a new life for myself , a life in which i m free from judgment and ab se and can live according to my own terms .","280238":"chester bennington from the band linkin park . even though he d ed three years ago , he still has a resounding influence on me in terms of his strength through adversity , his love for his fans and family , and his passion for his interests . when i was growing up as a teenager , linkin park s music was important to me and they essentially pushed me forward to see another day . i ll never be able to thank them enough for that .","280239":"i ve kept this question in my inbox for a week , trying to think of an answer . i don t know if i identify strongly with any movie or book characters , besides possibly susanna kaysen from girl interrupted . however , who i identify with the most is actually a video game character chloe price , from the video game series life is strange . i ve always related to her personality , actions , etc etc . , and felt a lot of empathy towards her during the game .","280240":"money is an important aspect to most people in terms of their happiness because it provides them with a sense of economic security , which is integral to really thrive in today s age . however , people can be happy without money if they have a strong support system , whether it s friends or family or their partner . cultivating interpersonal relationships is super important to an individual s happiness .","280241":"i love different aspects of all three of them , aahh ! ! i think i would pick one mainly because i ve been craving to go to the beach with a frozen cocktail in my hand . i m not much of a fan of firework shows , but i ve never seen a spin fire show before and that sounds really interesting to me .","280242":"i would get a full body tattoo of all different types of flowers , perhaps a sleeve on one arm of one or two different types and then the rest would change

car i have . i just finished paying off my car loan , so i m excited that i actually own it now and i don t owe any money towards it anymore .","280248":"i think it s amusing more than anything else , particularly when it s online such as on askfm . when we re conversing with people online or posting things online , you re only getting the side of people that they re comfortable showing to you . you re not getting the entire person . so in that vein , it s wrong to assume that you know how someone thinks and or acts , because you only know what they re willing to tell you about them .","280249":"iced coffee . lmaoo . even if i m in a very depressed slump , the idea that i have iced coffee or coffee in general is sometimes enough to make myself get out of bed and start the day . it s a pretty strong motivator in my life .","280250":"eh , not really . i haven t been so focused on the future as much as i ve been trying to focus on the present moment . in the future , i do want to publish a book or an anthology of short stories , but that s the only major goal i have .","280251":"i thought so too in the beginning , but he simply suspended his campaign efforts in order to focus more on the coronavirus . he didn t officially drop out , and i m still voting for him in the new york democratic primaries .","280252":"i would much rather have the ability to know when a person is lying to me . it would be easier to weed out friends and or potential partners that way .","280253":"i don t have any plans besides to do laundry and clean the house , lol . it s difficult to really make plans when we re all still under lockdown .","280254":"i m still voting for bernie sanders . he hasn t dropped out of the race .","280255":"samsung galaxy s .","280256":"oof , this is a
