there when people checked on him .","361396":"probably not . she always uses me as the middle man . it s annoying . made me feel scared before about my nana when nothing that bad was going on . says unwanted things . very condescending personality . will ask you things she already knows the answers to to one up you etc the real meaning of two faced here . asked if my sister and her husband were coming home and then all nevermind found my answer when i didn t return her message in time . go directly to the person you want to know about instead of putting me into it . they would know more than

about it from a family friend a bit too late and everything clicked into place .","361401":"i doubt it . think he would have remarried anyone at the time . he was with his st wife for years .

to be one of those guys .","361416":"yes but i also wouldn t single people out like that . especially when they ve never even met the people . if someone didn t have a place to go then i d be accepting like a true christian would ? i wouldnt purposely try hurting people with a cryptic blessing either . i wouldn t even acknowledge them not being there then . like none of us were going to go . it was a huge ordeal . also the nd time meeting her whereas the bf was in the picture for years and now a problem ? ?","361417":"no . i clearly said bf at the time . she s married now and he s a
