assume it was because it was about exactly what i was talking about last night.)\n  \n  however, it wasn't a personal attack. it was just her saying she didn't agree.\n  ","418570":"\n  i don't think you're understanding what i'm saying at all, even though i've repeated myself multiple times. i'm not going to repeat myself, due in part to clogging up my followers' feeds with the same messages over & over again.\n  \n  i agreed with you when you used the birth example ... because being cisgender is the default. babies have no concept of gender. that's why pronouns are used for sex in the beginning of a person's life up until they discover they're trans or non-binary. in the past, trans people weren't respected and their pronouns referred solely to their sex. however, as society changes, so does language. it's accepted that pronouns refer to gender.\n  ","418571":"\n  i did, and it doesn't affect my life at all. unless she was personally attacking me or disrespecting me\/my pronouns, then i don't really see the big deal. however, we have a mutual understanding that we have a difference in opinions, and while we may not agree on everything, we respect one another.\n  \n  cc:\n  \n   @sweetnothings18\n  \n","418572":"\n  i've never been sassy, i've simply just corrected them. it's easy to assume i'm cisgender, and i totally understand that.\n  \n  even if i was sassy in the past, it's normal for a person to change their attitude as they get older. you begin to focus less on the small, insignificant details because they're not a big deal anymore.\n  ","418573":"\n  i don't really understand this message because you reiterated exactly what i said. my story didn't change because i consistently explained that pronouns *used* to refer to sex, and as society and language changed, it now refers to a person's gender.\n  \n  perhaps you're confused because of the fact that i stated that cisgender is the default. it's perfectly normal to refer to someone as the pronouns that align with their sex before they discover if they're trans or non-binary. at which point, pronouns change. you're not going to continue to refer to a trans man as she\/her when they come out and say their pronouns are he\/him.\n  ","418574":"\n  both, actually. i'm not bothered with being called she\/her because i present as feminine sometimes and my face is naturally feminine-looking, so i wouldn't expect people to automatically know my gender.\n  ","418575":"\n  lmaoo, it was bound to happen. people love arguing with me over sex and gender.\n  \n  thank you, though. even though we have different opinions, i value that you put your opinions across respectfully and understand people's feelings. it's rare to see these days because often people resort to personal attacks.\n  ","418576":"\n  you underestimate the beliefs of other people then, lol. there are so many people who try to defy logic and use it to put force their own personal agenda, that's something that has never changed.\n  \n  either way, that doesn't change the fact that language changes as society changes; therefore, while pronouns used to refer solely to people's sex in the past, they now refer to a person's gender. being cisgender is a default up until a person comes to the discovery that they're trans or non-binary, at which point their pronouns can change depending upon what they're most comfortable using.\n  ","418577":"\n  it's based upon people's interpretations of that logic as well. most forms of logic are objective, but there are some instances where it is subjective or people skew logic to suit their own personal agenda.\n  ","418578":"\n  ???\n  \n  studies have everything to do with it because they're based upon years of research and study. history is constantly changing, and logic is can be subjective. it's a basic, universally-accepted concept that language changes as society changes.\n  ","418579":"\n  you're asking me to go back 5+ years, man. i can't recite the source at this point.\n  \n  however, they all generally agreed that pronouns were a default for sex up until a trans person came out with their gender, at which point their pronouns changed. it also delved into the history behind the distinction of sex and gender, much like what you're saying, but as society changes, so does the language we use.\n  ","418580":"\n  quite a few, from what i remember. i researched it when i was in college, so that was quite a few years ago.\n  ","418581":"\n  there have been dozens of studies on gender since then. while what you're saying is indeed true in the past, science has progressed since those studies were published. also, gender does change definition from culture to culture, but it still exists in most cultures.\n  ","418582":"\n  i was referring to people in real life. i only have a few online friends whom i care about in that matter.\n  ","418583":"\n  i agree. people seldom check books out at the library anymore, and colleges give students a plethora of online resources to do their research because it's likely more up-to-date and accurate anyway.\n  ","418584":"\n  are you referring to me being non-binary as a trend ??\n  \n  that's a pretty long trend then, i've been this way for years. i've only started being open about my gender quite recently.\n  ","418585":"\n  everyone's gender aligns with their sex when they're first born because babies have no concept of gender. cisgender is the default in our society. there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever.\n  ","418586":"\n  it's always been relatively easy for me to do something like that. in order for me to cut someone from my life entirely, they would have had to do something that really disrespected me to the point where being friends with them is toxic. at that point, i've lost all connection to them.\n  ","418587":"\n  it depends on the transgression and whether or not it was done accidentally or purposely. i can forgive accidents as long as they're not repeated multiple times, but i'm less likely to forgive things done on purpose.\n  ","418588":"\n  of course it is ?? when i was in college, all of the resources they gave us were accessed online. clinical studies, the national institutes of health, world health organization, etc etc.\n  ","418589":"\n  they were online sources. it isn't like i went to the library and checked out books on the subject, lol.\n  ","418590":"\n  i told you what i've researched already.\n  ","418591":"\n  of course i have. doesn't really matter what your impression is, that doesn't change the fact that i've done research and came to my own conclusions.\n  ","418592":"\n  i have more acquaintances than friends, so perhaps \"friend\" wasn't the accurate term to use in that context, and i have a lot of former friends from whom i've distanced (not for any bad reason, that's just what happens in life).\n  \n  i can name perhaps five people who are a genuine, close friend of mine.\n  ","418593":"\n  it's amusing because i'm either incredibly closed off or i'm an open book. it depends entirely on the vibe i get from the person upon meeting them or getting to know them over time.\n  \n  i used to be closed off all the time, but i've learned that communication is essential to maintaining healthy relationships and i need to be open about my feelings in order to really progress.\n  ","418594":"\n  that wouldn't really change things. i'm only part of one facebook group, and i don't really interact with it regularly. sometimes i'll make my own posts regarding things going on in my life since it's sorta like a vent group, but i steer clear of things that can make people get heated.\n  ","418595":"\n  i'm always terrified that my friends are going to get fed up with me and leave me, and sometimes i genuinely believe they only talk to me because they feel sorry for me or something.\n  \n  it's totally irrational, but i can't really help it. it's something i've been trying to work on and gain more confidence in, but it's a long journey.\n  ","418596":"\n  as long as they don't treat me differently and respect me for my own opinions on the matter, i don't really see the problem with being friends (or at least civil) with someone who believes that there are only two genders.\n  \n  i have quite a few friends who think that, and it doesn't affect our friendship at all.\n  ","418597":"\n  the only opportunities i would have to watch them would be at night because i don't get home from work until 6:30 pm.\n  \n  on the weekends, i generally don't watch tv or anything because i'm busy doing other stuff. if i have free time, i'll usually just have the tv on in the background, but lately i've been listening to music.\n  ","418598":"\n  i don't own an umbrella actually, lmaoo.\n  \n  getting wet by the rain is annoying, but it isn't something i like or dislike. it just exists, and it is what it is. i normally have a jacket with a hood, so it doesn't bother me.\n  ","418599":"\n  there are some instances where kids as young as 4 or 5 know that they're \"different,\" but if you're asking me if i would comment on their post, then i wouldn't.\n  \n  like i stated earlier, people are entitled to their opinions. especially if their opinions aren't hurting anyone, they're simply opinions. i wouldn't go out of my way to argue with someone on their own page because i disagree to an extent.\n  ","418600":"\n  i like horror movies, but i HATE jumpscares. i won't watch anything with jumpscares in it, which is why i haven't watched the haunting of hill house.\n  \n  sometimes, they'll make me a bit paranoid if i watch them at night, but it isn't a really bad fear or anything.\n  ","418601":"\n  i'm not personally sure, and i think it's something that's still being studied extensively.\n  ","418602":"\n  well it's only 10am, but my sunday is going well so far. all i've done is drink two cups of coffee & make breakfast while f*cking around on my laptop, lol.\n  \n  on sundays, i usually run errands and do laundry. however, i'm wiped out from my trip yesterday so i don't want to do anything. i also did laundry a few days ago and my errands aren't urgent, so it isn't a big deal.\n  ","418603":"\n  they probably have their own reasons and theories respective to their experiences.\n  ","418604":"\n  no, i've never sought revenge on anything because i personally think that's petty. there would probably be some exceptions in extreme cases, such as if someone were to m*rder a loved one, but situations where people have wronged me don't warrant anything like that.\n  ","418605":"\n  i think it's something people come to the realization of over time, especially in terms of puberty. it isn't so much a choice as it is a discovery within oneself.\n  ","418606":"\n  when it comes to family & friends, no. i don't have a hard time saying no to them, especially in regards to something i'm uncomfortable doing.\n  \n  work is a different matter because i always take on work that my supervisor assigns to me, and to say no would indicate that i have a poor work ethic.\n  ","418607":"\n  i don't personally believe it's strange. your gender is based entirely in comparison to your sex, and my sex is obviously female so there's no use in me denying that fact.\n  \n  however, she's completely entitled to her opinion. you don't have to agree 100 percent with someone on every single matter in order to be civil with them.\n  \n  also, you can at least tag her, lmaoo.\n  \n   @sweetnothings18\n

back asleep, even though i only slept for 4 hours last night.\n  ","418611":"\n  i ask myself this question every day. i truly don't know who i am as a person -- my personality changes depending on my mood, who i'm around, etc etc. i adapt myself and adopt particular traits to appease those around me, and although i suspect i do have an inner core of personality somewhere within me, it seldom shows itself in public.\n  \n  i've always had issues with self-identity, and it's something i've been trying to work on in therapy. i didn't grow up with a stable home life, and i have no memory of the first 11 years of my life, so those formative stages have been lost to me.\n  ","418612":"\n  at the moment, i would wish for my boyfriend to have an easier life and perhaps time for the two of us to take an extended vacation so that we can escape our troubles for a little while.\n  \n  he's been going through hell and back when it comes to various aspects of his life, and i feel terrible because there's really nothing i can do to help except support him. he's always gotten the short end of the stick.\n  ","418613":"\n  somewhat, yes. there is still a sense of hypermasculinity in today's society, which prevents men from showing emotions out of fear of being ridiculed or being treated as \"less of a man.\"\n  \n  society has progressed far in terms of it, but nevertheless, it still does exist. in reality, crying and showing emotion has nothing to do with sex or gender -- it's an innate part of being human. there's nothing wrong with it at all.\n  ","418614":"\n  i'm sorry you're going through this, friend.\n  \n  chances are, it isn't you at all. i'm assuming you're in high school, and during the teenage years, teenagers can be incredibly mean or cruel-hearted, not realizing the outcome of their actions or simply not caring what their actions do to people.\n  \n  i highly doubt you're not a likable person. those kids are just being irrationally mean to you for no good reason. however, i do encourage you to try to continue to make friends as life can be awfully lonely without anyone by your side. eventually, some will stick around.\n  ","418615":"\n  pronouns perhaps used to solely refer to an individual's sex, but as times have changed, language has adapted to follow suit. pronouns primarily refer to a person's gender now because it refers to how that person feels and presents themselves, and using their biological sex to refer to them (in terms of pronouns) despite them being trans or non-binary is a bit disrespectful.\n  \n  i've traversed the whole \"gender\" thing for a really long time before i felt that non-binary was the best way to describe me. granted, it is just a label, but it is the easiest way for me to describe my gender because i'm not a trans man or woman and i'm not genderfluid.\n  ","418616":"\n  consider me the first non-binary person you've come across then. there are plenty of people who are non-binary in the lgbt community.\n  \n  calling it nonsense just because you don't understand it, though, is a bit close-minded. seek to understand what you don't have experience with instead of looking down upon it.\n  ","418617":"\n  it's a play, not a movie.\n  ","418618":"\n  when you have the opportunity, i highly recommend it. i was captivated the entire time !! and i would definitely go see it again if i had the chance.\n  \n  apparently it also won 6 tony awards, including best play, and i can totally understand why.\n  ","418619":"\n  i'm in a relationship.\n  ","418620":"\n  it was phenomenol !! i was in awe the entire time, the acting was amazing and made me so emotional, and the special effects were out of this world. it genuinely felt like they were doing magic on stage.\n  \n  it was a long day because it's split into two parts, one at 2pm and the other at 7:30pm, but it was so worth it.\n  ","418621":"\n  THERE'S A HARRY POTTER MARATHON ON TV, THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\n  \n  i'm definitely not sleeping tonight.\n  ","418622":"\n  google translate works pretty well.\n  ","418623":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","418624":"\n  it obviously isn't necessary, no. it's a nice option to have, but it isn't like it's a requirement or anything.\n  ","418625":"\n  not at the moment, no. i'm quite content right now.\n  \n  i also bought an overpriced hoodie at the theater today, and its SO soft and cozy. i can't wait to wear it to work on monday.\n  ","418626":"\n  y i k e s\n  ","418627":"\n  this sounds like something a 16 year old would say.\n  ","418628":"\n  i'm well !! i'm

again, it was only my first time. i'm sure if it was something i practiced, i would be fine.\n  ","418632":"\n  no, i've never been crabbing before.\n  ","418633":"\n  i'm not on birth control. i stopped taking it years ago after it made my depression worse, made me gain weight, and completely got rid of my libido.\n  ","418634":"\n  i haven't turned netflix on in about a week, but lately i've been watching the chilling adventures of sabrina.\n  \n  if you guys like thriller\/drama shows, then it's worth checking out. it's incredibly good and i love the characters.\n  ","418635":"\n  right now, my boyfriend sleeping next to me in a cozy, warm bed. i'm absolutely exhausted, but i miss him and i want to tell him all about my day.\n  ","418636":"\n  i generally don't like people touching me, so the only person i'll cuddle with is my boyfriend.\n  ","418637":"\n  i had dinner like six hours ago, but my friend and i went to applebee's during the intermission between the two parts of the play, and i ordered a chicken fajita wrap.\n  ","418638":"\n  i watch television, but i don't use cable.\n  ","418639":"\n  i just got home from my trip into the city, and omg, harry potter & the cursed child was SO FREAKING GOOD.\n  \n  the acting was amazing and emotional, and the special effects were jaw-dropping. there were books opening and closing on their own, things levitating, people flying, dementers flying around the entire theater up into the balcony, etc etc.\n  \n  i'm so blown away, it was amazing.\n  ","418640":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","418641":"\n  i'm heading into manhattan to see harry potter and the cursed child with an old coworker !!\n  ","418642":"\n  i saw kesha and macklemore during the summer.\n  ","418643":"\n  it's my actual hair color !! i'm happy with the way it faded.\n  ","418644":"\n  going into manhattan today & i like how my makeup turned out ~~\n  ","418645":"\n  it's important because many people neglect to see the difference between sex and gender, and i'm here to educate them on that difference.\n  \n  guaranteed some people probably still think of me as a woman even though i'm quite open about being non-binary, but what it comes down to is what they say when talking to me and\/or about me. if someone misgenders me in conversation purposely, then that isn't respectful anymore.\n  ","418646":"\n  there's a distinct difference between sex and gender. i'm not denying that i'm female, because that's my sex. however, my gender doesn't align with my sex which is why my pronouns are they\/them (it's what i'm most comfortable with).\n  \n  there are also people whose gender don't align with their sex and they have other pronouns, some non-binary people use he\/him and she\/her. it doesn't make their gender any less \"real,\" it's simply what they're most comfortable using.\n  ","418647":"\n  pronouns refer to someone's gender, not their sex. if someone says their pronouns are they\/them, then refer to them as they\/them.\n  \n  obviously you don't respect my gender because you just called me a woman, even though i clearly told you my gender multiple times.\n  ","418648":"\n  you're confusing sex and gender. my sex is female, but my gender is non-binary (not man or woman). my pronouns are they\/them, not she\/her.\n  \n  now that that's on the table, respect would be appreciated. it takes zero effort to respect someone's gender.\n  ","418649":"\n  this is correct.\n  ","418650":"\n  obviously not -- non-binary is a gender, not a sex.\n  ","418651":"\n  it's easier this time of year, so i wear mostly tee shirts and hoodies. sometimes i wear a binder.\n  ","418652":"\n  i don't have people over my house.\n  ","418653":"\n  because i don't like presenting as feminine most of the time.\n  ","418654":"\n  my breasts, LOL. they're just obnoxious and make my body dysphoria worse.\n  ","418655":"\n  i'm certain that it did, yes. it's generally understood that reading does help improve vocabulary, and considering i read a lot of books when i was a teenager, it really expanded my mind as to which words to use and when.\n  ","418656":"\n  i haven't read in a while, but i used to read books obsessively when i was younger.\n  ","418657":"\n  this is sorta related to this question, but the first person who came to mind is my aunt. she's a bizarre human being -- she keeps the ashes of her former cat in the center console of her car (inside a ziploc baggie) instead of an urn.\n  ","418658":"\n  i've always loved flynn rider from tangled, haha.\n  ","418659":"\n  i'm so tired of these fetish questions.\n  ","418660":"\n  i'm a writer and editor for a publishing company.\n  ","418661":"\n  my gender is non-binary, and i'm most comfortable with they\/them pronouns.\n  ","418662":"\n  i'm thinking about going to bed.\n  ","418663":"\n  yeah, definitely. a lot of my college education was spent discussing the media and how a lot of news stations are biased, reporting only certain facts to their target audience in order to get better ratings.\n  \n  that's why it's important to fact check things and read up on the news from multiple sources.\n  ","418664":"\n  i wish i had a greater understanding of myself. there's so much of my life that i don't know about, and i think that's why i have issues with self-identity, because the crucial moments of my life which shaped my personality have been blocked out of my memory, which leaves me feeling confused.\n  ","418665":"\n  neither youtube nor spotify are working on my laptop rn, and i need music to drown out the sounds of my house in order to write.\n  \n  welp. this fuckin' sucks. y'all should send me questions.\n  ","418666":"\n  my day has been fine so far. it was an average day at work, and then i came home, made a cup of coffee, and booted up my laptop to try to write some more tonight.\n  ","418667":"\n  it depends on the day. some nights, i fall asleep around 10pm while other nights it's between midnight and 1am.\n  \n  i try to get to bed earlier on the weekdays because of work, but sometimes it doesn't work out.\n  ","418668":"\n  i pretty much do this all the time. i'm always worried he's angry with me over something (when rationally, he isn't) so i'm constantly asking if i'm doing anything wrong or how i can improve myself to be a better partner and friend.\n  ","418669":"\n  thankfully, it's been a few months since i've felt that way. i don't recall the circumstances surrounding it, but i do remember being svicidal because everything felt too much for me to handle, i lost all motivation, i felt like i was up against a brick wall, and i had nothing to live for.\n  ","418670":"\n  doing drugs around their child, physically & verbally abvsing their child, neglecting them or refusing to give them food if the child did something wrong, etc etc.\n  ","418671":"\n  anyone else get a nice, cozy, accomplished feeling when they switch bags and re-organize their wallet and personal belongings ??\n  \n  i just did that to prepare for my city trip tomorrow, and idk i feel so organized now, lmaoo.\n  ","418672":"\n  my boyfriend is hella gay.\n  ","418673":"\n  waking up in the morning & having coffee with my boyfriend. spending the day together, whether we go out somewhere or stay in and watch sh*tty television and eat copious amounts of food. ending the night with a big bonfire in the backyard and some brews.\n  \n  generally just spending an entire day with my boyfriend is perfect to me. it seldom happens anymore.\n  ","418674":"\n  i can be, although i'm certainly not as curious as i used to be when i was in high school & college. honestly, these days i'm just too exhausted to really research into a lot of things i'm interested in, which is disappointing.\n  ","418675":"\n  i wouldn't say that i'm grateful for my most recent ex, but he did teach me to not tolerate lying in any sort of relationship, whether romantic or platonic. he would lie to me constantly, i assume as a form of establishing dominance, and eventually i got tired of it and broke up with him. i simply couldn't trust him, and i later found out that he cheated on me multiple times.\n  ","418676":"\n  i honestly can't remember. i'm usually either depressed, sad, or content\/unaffected.\n  ","418677":"\n  yeah, i used to be deeply ashamed of my past because i had really unhealthy coping mechanisms and it negatively affected my interpersonal relationships.\n  \n  i've learned that shame is a negative emotion, though, and it only hurts you in the end. you should be able to forgive yourself and learn from those experiences to make yourself a better person.\n  ","418678":"\n  idk, i would say probably half the time ?? i don't generally wear makeup and my normal attire are hoodies, tee shirts, and jeans. occasionally, i'll wear more feminine clothing, though.\n  ","418679":"\n  i don't generally do much during the summer because it's usually ridiculously hot and humid outside. being outside for five minutes usually kills me unless there's a breeze.\n  ","418680":"\n  i love the fresh balsam candle from bath & body works.\n  \n  i

hope it isn't like this tomorrow. :\/\/\n  \n  my favorite weather is when it's chilly and sunny. i also really love thunderstorms.\n  ","418684":"\n  this isn't a question. also, i don't know anyone

few times, but it really screwed me up.\n  ","418691":"\n  honestly, i was afraid for when they first became pregnant, knowing their activities (drinking and drugs) and how far along they were in the pregnancy already. i hoped that they would clean up their act immediately in light of their baby.\n  \n  lately, i've been disappointed and afraid in light of recent events. a child failing to thrive is extremely concerning, and the negligence on their part to rectify their behavior just has me shaking my head. i can only hope that this past week has brought light to their eyes and helped them realize that they should be doing more for their child.\n  ","418692":"\n  i've seen some in passing, but i haven't taken any time out to actually read them.\n  ","418693":"\n  where did i encourage cyber bullying ?? you clearly didn't read my post.\n  \n  some people *do* cyber bully for dramatic purposes, and that's obviously not okay. however, other people aren't cyber bullying, they're just pointing out factual things that have occurred and explaining that they're problematic. that isn't cyber bullying, that's raising awareness of an issue.\n  ","418694":"\n  my writing is a bit sloppier, but that's what next-day editing is for !! lmaoo. it's also a bit easier for me to think of various extended metaphors when i'm drinking for some reason.\n  \n  tonight, i'm drinking redd's

hypocritical if he was bothered by them.\n  ","418727":"\n  no, that isn't anything close to an apology -- that's likely just them missing the friendship while refusing to acknowledge that they did something wrong to tarnish the friendship. especially if they're talking as if nothing ever happened.\n  ","418728":"\n  hELLO ~~\n  \n  i'm doing quite well, thank you for asking. i just finished up two cups of coffee & a load of laundry, and now i'm cracking open a drink and relaxing until i get sleepy.\n  ","418729":"\n  it's a three-way tie between jason momoa, hugh jackman, and jensen ackles.\n  ","418730":"\n  usually my grudges are due to a person not acknowledging that they did something wrong, or in some cases, it's due to me thinking irrationally about a situation and holding a grudge over something someone did that realistically isn't a big deal, but it was to me at the time.\n  ","418731":"\n  the women i surround myself with are pretty damn flawless. they're beautiful,

your partner, no. it *is* normal to want to be left alone sometimes, because that certainly happens between me and my boyfriend, but if they're making you so angry that this happens often, then perhaps you two simply aren't as compatible as you think you are.\n  ","418733":"\n  i didn't realize this was a competition.\n  ","418734":"\n  if you've never done that before in your life, then you're a liar, lmaoo.\n  \n  it also doesn't necessarily mean something bad -- we usually point out positive attributes, and there's nothing wrong with that.\n  ","418735":"\n  i have a tendency to hold a grudge, but it's something i've been trying to work on for the past year or so.\n  \n  i don't generally get into arguments with people, so the second question doesn't really apply to me. the only person i'll bicker with is my boyfriend, but i've never brought up old arguments in those conversations because i understand that those fights are done and settled.\n  ","418736":"\n  when you

nanowrimo novel).\n  ","418737":"\n  we have similar tastes, yeah !! sometimes when we're out, we people-watch and comment on other people's looks and general attractiveness.\n  ","418738":"\n  beauty standards (for women) initially existed because everything was done to please men -- a woman was not worth anything if she wasn't valuable to a man, so the concept of beauty was encouraged in an effort to make women more desirable to men.\n  \n  these days, beauty standards ideally shouldn't exist anymore because we've progressed past that point of misogyny, but unfortunately there's still a large social stigma regarding what's beautiful or normal.\n  ","418739":"\n  i honestly can't fathom why someone would think that a person isn't a \"\"real\"\" mother if they had a cesarean section. they still carried a child for nine months, and it shouldn't matter whether or not the birth was had v*ginally because a child was still developing inside of them.\n  \n  also, c-sections are generally massive surgeries from my understanding !!\n  ","418740":"\n  LOL.\n  \n  well, we did hear rumors when we were in high school about us being together. and at that point, we had to confirm that the rumors were true because my best friend and i *did* actually date at one point.\n  ","418741":"\n  i think you can support the lives of most police officers while also supporting the lives of black people ; the two concepts aren't mutually exclusive.\n  \n  i'm a strong proponent of #blacklivesmatter, but i also know a lot of people who are in law enforcement who actually advocate for equal rights, especially when it comes to police brutality. they back the blue but also recognize that there are issues with the justice system overall.\n  ","418742":"\n  i don't have a favorite place in my home that isn't my bedroom, haha. my bedroom is the only place i feel comfortable in my house, and it has everything i need to remain entertained ... besides a coffee machine.\n  ","418743":"\n  my county didn't have stickers either for the same reason -- although, they haven't had stickers for years, from what i can remember going back to 2009. i never earned a sticker from voting.\n  \n  stickers were actually implemented to encourage people to vote, so it makes sense as to why people would be upset if they didn't get an 'i voted' sticker upon casting their ballot. i was disappointed, honestly.\n  ","418744":"\n  i think trump is a sad excuse of a human being with no sense of hardship, and instead of using his privilege to speak out against the injustices happening within the united states, he perpetrates those injustices. he doesn't seem to know what he's talking about half the time, and when he talks to the press, he's incredibly rude (among other things).\n  ","418745":"\n  rules that have been made to oppress and marginalize individuals.\n  ","418746":"\n  i believe my passion is my best trait. when it comes to my interests, i either am disinterested or i'm passionate about something to the point of obsession. and when i'm passionate about something, whether it's an idea or a hobby or a person, i dedicate myself 100 percent to it.\n  ","418747":"\n  uh ... this is a pretty inappropriate question to ask this side of askfm, especially considering i assume most of the people you sent this to struggle with some form of mental illness.\n  ","418748":"\n  don't settle -- whether it's with your life, your relationships, your goals, your passions, etc etc. do not settle for just mediocre, do not settle because you're comfortable, and do not settle because no one is telling you otherwise.\n  \n  push. push yourself harder until you achieve things which you previously thought weren't capable of being reached. most people have a lot more capability in them than they believe, but we never reach that potential unless we're pushed, whether it's by ourselves or by others.\n  ","418749":"\n  i think of cold nights in the darkness, where the smoke from your breath and cigarettes are the only things visible. i think of the scents of musk, engine oil, menthol cigarettes and scotch. your aura is black with purple tinge, pulsating lightly around you. you are leather jackets, slim-fit jeans (with tears in them not due to fashion but due to how hard you work in them), and a gaze as cold as ice. you are the morning sunrise when the sky bleeds pastel purple hues, and you are the laughter which erupts from your belly while we're sitting on the beach with a cup to share.\n  ","418750":"\n  people are always looking for acceptance and validation, particularly if they grew up not having either of those things. by stating an opinion that isn't popular with others, you're at risk of being outcasted by the group with which you're affiliated.\n  \n  this is seen especially on social media, i.e. askfm, where people tend to flock together with like-minded individuals. i'd like to think the overall site is better now that everyone has matured, but years ago, if you voiced an opinion that was outside of what the \"group\" believed, then you would get harassed.\n  ","418751":"\n  stephen king, anne rice, francesca lia block, franz kafka, and edgar allen poe.\n  ","418752":"\n  i completed an internship my senior year, but it was more geared toward marketing than anything else. i didn't really have a portfolio, just my resume with one or two writing samples attached to it.\n  \n  internships are wonderful if you need experience, and you can put virtually anything in a portfolio, as long as it's work-appropriate !! whether they're essays you've written for school or creative work you've done on your own. i had to submit writing samples to my current job when i applied, so i gave them an article i wrote for my college's newspaper as well as a short fictional piece.\n  ","418753":"\n  i'm not in school, but i was quiet and kept to myself.\n  ","418754":"\n  i don't wear perfume, but my best friend has this one rose quartz body spray that smells amazing. it smells like roses, lilies, and patchouli.\n  ","418755":"\n  i prefer reading paper books. the light from e-readers hurts my

basically means the same thing.\n  ","418763":"\n  i suppose what i have now is the wildest it's ever been -- half shaved on one side, long on the other, with multiple colors in my hair.\n

lol.\n  ","418765":"\n  it's very informal, but you used it correctly !!\n  ","418766":"\n  i'm taken, and looks matter somewhat but they're not a deciding factor. i base my preferences mainly off of personality, i won't date someone who's attractive but with a sh*t personality.\n  ","418767":"\n  i'm all right, but a little sad. i'm seeing my best friend tonight for the last time before she moves & idk when i'll be able to see her next.\n  \n  i'm basically laying in bed waiting for her to text me & tell me when i can come over, haha.\n  ","418768":"\n  i do, but i don't want to post it on

unfortunately, i get the same way too -- if someone doesn't respond to me, then i assume i did something wrong or that they're angry with me, and i even look into the tone behind the texts to where i always think there's some sort of negative undertone and i'm just annoying them.\n  \n  sometimes i realize my irrationality, sometimes i don't. it's gotten a lot better over the years, but it still somewhat exists.\n  ","418775":"\n  no, not at all. i'll be the first person to criticize the united states and white people in general, haha.\n  ","418776":"\n  idk what a love \"style\" is, but my

and she basically said that police brutality wouldn't exist if people just listened to police -- i didn't feel like getting into a debate, but there are a lot of biased officers who take advantage of their authority and use it to exert unnecessary control over situations. plus there are a plethora of situations where people got hurt or k*lled even though they *did* listen, and it seems to be an

house somewhere in a wooded area or open fields, with a lot of land for my future animals to run around in.\n  \n  i like rustic styled homes, so there would be a lot of wood and antique-looking furnishings with a lot of area rugs and a fireplace. we would have a deck in the backyard as well as a balcony outside of the upstairs master bedroom. i also like the idea of having a separate room

this favor is.\n  ","419086":"\n  i generally agree with this, yes. people will try to make you feel inferior, but it's ultimately up to you as to how you'll react to those statements or actions. you can either let it eat you alive or you can continue living your life in spite of them.\n  \n  i think it also applies to anons here as well, because people here have a nasty habit of trying to ridicule others on anon, and you don't have to give in to their thoughts.\n  ","419087":"\n  it depends on the circumstance. if they dislike you and she's taking their thoughts into consideration, then chances are you two don't have a chance. however, if she doesn't care about what her friends think and is into you, then she may reach out.\n  \n  this is all assuming that she likes you, though.\n  ","419088":"\n  sometimes, it does. it used to affect my mood a lot before i started taking medication for mood swings -- i would get upset really easily, cry a lot, and generally feel hopeless and unmotivated.\n  ","419089":"\n  i'm going to work as usual, but i'm dressing up in costume since my job is having a costume contest. it's mainly the reason why i bought the wig, lol.\n

the chilling adventures of sabrina two nights ago, and i really enjoyed it (even though i only got one episode in).\n  \n  it's based on the comics, so it's a lot darker than the old tv series and isn't a comedy, it's a drama.\n  ","419091":"\n  usually, they'll tell you straight out.\n  ","419092":"\n  it wasn't exactly a costume, but i transformed my face into a skull one year using makeup. it was pretty dead on and i got a lot of compliments.\n  ","419093":"\n  no, i've never had surgery before.\n  ","419094":"\n  yeah, it's generally used for both depressant and anxiety. however, i also take buspar for anxiety because it's a non-narcotic anti-anxiety medication.\n  ","419095":"\n  it can go either way. i've always spelt it as tomato.\n  ","419096":"\n  i admire\n  \n

few friends who are excellent parents too.\n  ","419097":"\n  i prefer working by myself. i don't like the idea of having to rely on other people for a project because you can't trust that they'll put 100 percent into it.\n  ","419098":"\n  i don't know, it could be anything. driving home, i was convinced i was going to get into an accident.\n  ","419099":"\n  i just made an english muffin and i'm going to make a cup of ginger tea soon.\n  \n  and no, my job let me leave early today. they're really understanding when it comes to mental health issues, thankfully.\n  ","419100":"\n  i'm not doing well at all today. i missed my meds last night, and that combined with the anxiety i was feeling yesterday and the overwhelming amount of work i walked into today, i ended up having a panic attack and vomited at work.\n  \n  i'm not as panicky now, but i'm exhausted and my stomach is upset and i can't get rid of the feeling that something terrible is going to happen. i'm afraid to do anything besides lay in bed.\n  ","419101":"\n  i don't really do any activities around this time of year besides drink and eat things that taste like pumpkin, lol. occasionally i'll go to a halloween party if my friends are having one, but that didn't happen this year.\n  ","419102":"\n  that's where other people come in and sit that person down and explain to them that what they did or said was a mistake or how hurtful it was to others around them.\n  \n  oftentimes it's hard to realize your own mistakes because you're not seeing them from an outside perspective.\n  ","419103":"\n  no, i generally worked on homework and other various assignments as soon as they were assigned to me. if i put them off, i would experience too much anxiety and it would constantly weigh on my mind.\n  ","419104":"\n  the only one i haven't done is go to a haunted house -- i'm terrified of things popping out to scare me, so i've never gone before.\n  ","419105":"\n  scents that remind me of autumn are pumpkin, firewood, apples, and the distinct scent in the air that happens when it gets cold outside.\n  ","419106":"\n  no, i'm thankful in that i have my boyfriend to talk to at the end of the day so i can discuss what happened throughout the day or vent if i need to.\n  ","419107":"\n  it generally doesn't happen to me because i have coffee first thing every morning, so i don't have the chance to interact with people beforehand, lol.\n  \n  i'd imagine i would be quite cranky, though. coffee motivates me to get up in the morning.\n  ","419108":"\n  i just checked, and apparently they updated the app and started giving people coins for interesting questions and answers.\n  \n  i have no idea what they're used for, though.\n  ","419109":"\n  i used to when i was younger, but i haven't been into pokemon for like 15 years.\n  ","419110":"\n  i've only heard like ... one song from them, but i don't think i like them.\n  ","419111":"\n  no, it's 49 degrees fahrenheit but it doesn't feel cold.\n  ","419112":"\n  i've only ever been to the museum of modern art, but i enjoyed it.\n  ","419113":"\n  no, i couldn't care less about drama.\n  ","419114":"\n  i really don't care about the drama between people in askfm.\n  \n  ask me questions about me. kthxbye.\n  ","419115":"\n  this sounds like a bullshit pyramid scheme.\n  ","419116":"\n  good !! i'm in manhattan to celebrate my

this even mean.\n  ","419121":"\n  it's the only way i comfortably go into manhattan.\n  ","419122":"\n  i don't have an issue -- i just fail to see the point of asking me these questions when i don't

most logical conclusion.\n  ","419152":"\n  i've debated this question for essentially my entire life, and i haven't come to any concrete conclusions.\n  \n  i used to think that while our physical bodies perished, our energies are transferred to another medium, which can be related to reincarnation. but it isn't something i'm entirely convinced of.\n  ","419153":"\n  idk what else you're expecting from me.\n  ","419154":"\n  that's called faith. which i already said multiple times that i don't have faith.\n  ","419155":"\n  god is an omnipotent being with whom people have faith in an effort to bring guidance to their lives.\n  ","419156":"\n  google exists for a reason.\n  ","419157":"\n  no, it's something i've pondered for years and have ultimately come to my own conclusions. i

whichever god they believe in due to their faith. i don't have faith.\n  ","419158":"\n  i've literally seen apparitions and have had paranormal experiences, which is why i believe in spirits.\n  \n  i don't believe in god because there isn't any evidence to suggest one exists. religion is also based upon faith, which i don't have.\n  ","419159":"\n  i don't discuss things of this nature on askfm,

pretty significant.\n  \n  if you know that he isn't entirely wrong, then you ideally should *try* to have a more open mind. however, at the same time, it also matters how he goes about giving you lectures. if he makes you feel bad or upset then that's a talk you two need to have to be more receptive to each other's feelings.\n  ","419162":"\n  it doesn't ever happen really because i only vent to my boyfriend and like two close friends, but i dislike when people brush off my problems and indicate \"other people have it worse\" or \"you're just overreacting.\"\n  \n  i'm aware that other people may have it worse, but that doesn't discount what it is i'm going through now or make it any better. everyone will always have problems and this is what i was given.\n  ","419163":"\n  yes, halloween is my favorite holiday !! i love all of the spooky movies and decor that are sold in stores, seeing everyone in costume, and the general atmosphere of the time of year.\n  ","419164":"\n  depends entirely on who it's from and whether the criticism is warranted or valid -- however, i usually take it into consideration unless it's just wildly untrue.\n  ","419165":"\n  yeah, i'd say i'm

grandson !!\n  ","419167":"\n  when i'm angry, i usually either play video games, talk to friends about my problem, or drink.\n  \n  i calm down my boyfriend by letting him vent about his issues, bringing him food, and suggesting that he plays a violent video game to get out his aggression.\n  ","419168":"\n  who said that pisses me off ?? i know i look feminine sometimes.\n  ","419169":"\n  i'm trying to grow out the one side of my hair, because i'm keeping the other half shaved.\n  ","419170":"\n  it's funny because i've never had long hair before, but i was always curious as to how i'd

they're trying their best to attend to every customer in a timely fashion. it isn't their fault if a customer has a lot of items, or a lot of coupons, or if they're sometimes dealing with a difficult or irate customer. have some patience and realize that they're doing the best they can.\n  ","419177":"\n  that's a matter that's up for debate. i personally believe in spirits.\n  ","419178":"\n  no, quite the contrary actually !! i didn't think they were real either until i had that experience and started researching more into the boards.\n  \n  it's generally advised to not use them because they

extent of it.\n  ","419182":"\n  i prefer running my errands on the weekdays after work so that i have the weekends free to do whatever i want to do.\n  \n  i.e. i ran a bunch of errands last night

situation.\n  ","419218":"\n  no ... like i said, babies have no concept of gender. when they're born, it isn't wrong to assume that their gender aligns with their sex. your gender is something you figure out later in life.\n  ","419219":"\n  yes, i do that whenever he needs to vent about something. just because i feel crappy doesn't mean he can't express his own feelings too.\n  ","419220":"\n

select few people in my life.\n  \n  i don't think those types of people are bad people, but they're desperate and misguided. they obviously don't know the meaning of consent.\n  ","419232":"\n  lmao. i mean, there are a lot of guys on askfm who do that, unfortunately.\n  \n  i just think it's pathetic. if you want a girlfriend, then go out into the world and find one or choose a dating site. askfm

fun.\n  ","419241":"\n  i don't like answering questions with \"idk\" because it seems like a waste of time to me.\n  \n  my boyfriend has a beardie, not an iguana. i don't know if their diets are different.\n  ","419242":"\n  i didn't have an answer, so i deleted it.\n  ","419243":"\n  well, next month is my birthday so i guess i'm looking forward to that. i usually get together with a few friends and go out, which is always nice.\n  ","419244":"\n  i lie to my mother on a regular basis -- little, insignificant things though because i'd rather not deal with her bxtching or yelling at me so i just lie to keep things at peace.\n  ","419245":"\n  it isn't the weekend yet.\n  ","419246":"\n  my family makes me angry for reasons i'm not getting into.\n  \n  when i get like this, i usually either play video games or drink. or both at the same time.\n  ","419247":"\n  i don't think that's weird. it's probably just nostalgia, even though you're already in a relationship.\n  ","419248":"\n

rain or snow falling outside -- it relaxes me, especially if i'm curled up in a blanket with a cup of coffee and a candle on.\n  ","419254":"\n  uh... as opposed to running ??\n  \n  it would be odd if i automatically ran to everywhere i needed to be, lmao. just imagine me running through the office building instead of calmly walking to my office like a normal person.\n  ","419255":"\n  there are really no \"\"easy\"\" ways to get over a breakup, unfortunately.\n  \n  it all depends on the situation, but it's helpful to stay around friends and remind yourself that you're a whole person without your ex's existence in your life, and you once existed before them. getting over breakups comes with time.\n  ","419256":"\n  i take showers. i don't really enjoy taking baths, i just get bored.\n

there once a year anyway, my aunt likes some of the scents so i'll usually get her some things for xmas.\n  ","419266":"\n  tell me how well sending this as a mass message is working out for you, considering i've already seen you plague some of my friends' pages with this nonsense.\n  ","419267":"\n  i *love* bath & body works but i seldom shop there because their products are expensive and i can easily spent $50+ there in one trip, LOL. i love their lotions and candles.\n  ","419268":"\n  i don't buy skirts because i don't wear them, but that's pretty much the only thing i can think of. i mostly wear skinny jeans with boots, sweaters, hoodies, and flannel shirts.\n  ","419269":"\n  i prefer darker colors, i.e. black and dark maroon.\n  ","419270":"\n  my wardrobe tends to be filled with black, grey, army green, maroon, and brown.\n  ","419271":"\n  anyone have any questions ?? my inbox is empty ~~\n  ","419272":"\n  i never really understood that. there are environmentally safe deodorants and natural ones that are great to use and prevent you from smelling.\n  ","419273":"\n  i have one friend who either doesn't wear it or it just isn't strong enough for her, but she smells ALL THE TIME.\n  \n  i've gotten used to it at this point, but i'm surprised she doesn't smell herself because i can always smell if my armpits are even remotely smelly.\n  ","419274":"\n  if they don't smell, then i don't really see the big deal. however, if they do have body odor, then they probably should start wearing some sort of deodorant.\n  ","419275":"\n  i'm always concerned about my own hygiene, rofl. i'm terrified of smelling badly, it's one of my worst fears.\n  ","419276":"\n  i'm fairly certain that's something people don't consciously notice.\n  ","419277":"\n  only really when it's in sushi.\n  ","419278":"\n  basic dishes, really. i don't have much experience cooking.\n  ","419279":"\n  i have plenty of mental illnesses, but my gender isn't one of them. it isn't considered a mental illness.\n  \n  i'm also steadfast in my gender, i don't have dysphoria in that regard.\n  ","419280":"\n  as long as their views aren't homophobic, transphobic, racist, or sexist, i can be friends or in a relationship with someone who has different views than me.\n  ","419281":"\n  it's been an ongoing struggle for basically my entire life. i obviously can't just snap my fingers and love myself because that isn't how it works. i appreciate the concern, though.\n  ","419282":"\n  i wouldn't know, i've never done that before.\n  ","419283":"\n  i've been dating the same person for eight years.\n  ","419284":"\n  idk what kind of lasagna you're making, but there's plenty of cheese in my lasagna.\n  ","419285":"\n  there's not much to elaborate on. i've never felt like a girl nor have i ever felt like a boy. my gender doesn't match my physical appearance, and i constantly experience body dysphoria as a result. i've always strived to be androgynous, looking like neither a full boy or a full girl but somewhere in between.\n  ","419286":"\n  yes, i celebrate all of those holidays.\n  ","419287":"\n  genderfluid basically means your gender changes -- some days you're more comfortable referring yourself and presenting as a girl, while other days you're more comfortable presenting as a boy or somewhere in between.\n  \n  non-binary simply means you're not one of the gender binaries, boy or girl. for me personally, i consider myself to be neither because i've never been a girl nor have i ever been a boy.\n  ","419288":"\n  yeah, it was because i developed early when it came to sex characteristics.\n  \n  unfortunately, i do still look feminine in some cases, which is why i still experience body dysphoria. ideally, i would like to be androgynous.\n  ","419289":"\n  that has nothing to do with what i'm currently talking about. i used to identify as genderfluid until i discovered what non-binary meant.\n  ","419290":"\n  i'm not insecure at all. you just have a blatantly obvious agenda to ridicule or discredit trans & non-binary people, and i never understood the point of that because people will be their gender regardless of what the opposition believes.\n  ","419291":"\n  exactly. ^^\n  \n  even when i was a child, i never considered myself to be a girl because of the horrible body dysphoria i experienced. i still experience it to a degree, but it's moreso something i deal with than anything else.\n  ","419292":"\n  i know what a tomboy is. i just don't really see why you're wasting your time posting this because it doesn't change my gender.\n  ","419293":"\n  i don't really know what you're trying to achieve here, but regardless, i'm still non-binary contrary to your views.\n  ","419294":"\n  there were probably a few people, but i explained it pretty thoroughly so that there was little room for confusion.\n  ","419295":"\n  no. i've cut people out of my life for a reason, and i have no regrets about any of them.\n  ","419296":"\n  yeah, to a certain degree. if a person has toxic traits then it's acceptable to let that person know what they're doing wrong so they can change, but if your partner is trying to change aspects of your personality that aren't problematic, then that may be a red flag.\n  ","419297":"\n  my school days are a blur tbh.\n  ","419298":"\n  he would be the exception, considering i'm already in love with him.\n  ","419299":"\n  absolutely. i love him regardless of his gender or how he presents himself.\n  ","419300":"\n  yeah, especially when it's my boyfriend and his friends. they're hilarious.\n  ","419301":"\n  yeah, i don't generally have an emotional reaction to bad news until hours or days later.\n  ","419302":"\n  my day was all right. i worked all day and i've only been home for two hours. i had a good dinner, though, and now i'm watching my boyfriend stream some PUBG.\n  ","419303":"\n  i've never tried. i don't have much experience cooking.\n  ","419304":"\n  i don't care enough to do something like that.\n  ","419305":"\n  eating dinner & waiting for my boyfriend to sign onto xbox. i was just checking out the xbox sales.\n  ","419306":"\n  i'd rather not inflict pain on anyone.\n  ","419307":"\n  i've done it in the past, so no doubt i'll be able to do it again.\n  ","419308":"\n  somewhat -- my job has forced me to become a little bit of a morning person because i have to wake up early for work and focus on assignments early in the morning. i need to be alert, otherwise i'll make mistakes.\n  ","419309":"\n  my boyfriend is going to find a way to stream PUBG with his friends tonight, so i'll be able to watch them !!\n  \n  i hope he can figure it out, since i'm pretty sure xbox has that mixer thing that allows you to stream with your friends. i haven't seen him play with his friends in a long time & they're always hilarious together.\n  ","419310":"\n  i've only ended one relationship, and it was on okay terms -- we didn't stay friends or anything afterwards, but we also didn't hold any animosity toward each other.\n  ","419311":"\n  it's completely normal for you to want closure. however, i don't think it's a good idea to call him because you might hurt yourself more by doing that if he doesn't answer and ends up completely ignoring you.\n  \n  i'm sorry you're going through this, situations like these definitely suck. just try to focus on yourself during these times, do a lot of self care, see your friends, etc etc. you existed before him and you can continue to exist after him.\n  ","419312":"\n  yeah, i pretty much like anything that's covered in cheese. lmao.\n  ","419313":"\n  yes, of course. my friends' problems affect me because i don't like seeing them upset, troubled, angry, etc etc. i try to do what

someone's pronouns changing if they're still traversing the complexities of gender and they don't quite know what gender they are yet, it's experimental and a way to see what they're most comfortable

","419316":"\n  my baby corycat !!\n  ","419317":"\n  yes, a person's word means everything. if someone says that they'll do something and they don't stick by it, then i start to trust them less and less.\n  ","419318":"\n  only when it comes to my boyfriend's attention. i feel uncomfortable when it comes to pretty much everyone else.\n  ","419319":"\n  it depends on my mood. sometimes i try different things while other times i'm afraid to leave my comfort zone.\n  ","419320":"\n  yeah, i was bullied mostly in middle school.\n  ","419321":"\n  i went to work, and then i went to dunkin

saturday night. i had a serious talk with my boyfriend regarding certain things going on in my life.\n  ","419325":"\n  it's been a good influence on me. i've learned a lot about various subjects over the years and it helped me realize my passion for mental health awareness.\n  ","419326":"\n  i mean ... i wouldn't consider it to be *great*, LOL.\n  \n  it's a good app if you have some spare time to waste, though.\n  ","419327":"\n  no, i'm against hunting as a sport.\n  ","419328":"\n  no, not really. my routine for getting ready for work in the morning is basically the same every day, but i wouldn't consider it a ritual, lol.\n  ","419329":"\n  you're right in that it might give mixed signals. i suppose it all depends on whether or not you want to stay friends with that person. by checking in on them, you might be leading them to think you're still interested, which will hurt them in the long run.\n  \n  i understand the desire to want to see how they're doing, but whether or not it's a good idea really depends on your individual circumstance. i personally wouldn't check up on them, but that's just me.\n  ","419330":"\n  i suppose the highlight would be right now -- i'm

on them !!\n  ","419373":"\n  there's a stereotype that new yorkers are *always* loud, rude, and obnoxious.\n  \n  and while that may be true in certain cases, it certainly doesn't define all people who have been born and raised in new york.\n  ","419374":"\n  i've never used one before, so i really have no idea. i've actually never been in a house that had a garbage disposal.\n  ","419375":"\n  interesting !! there's one i use at work for toasting bagels and it takes such a long time. my boyfriend also has one of those microwaves that doubles as a toaster oven, and that takes even longer.\n  ","419376":"\n  not really -- at least nothing significant comes to mind. i used to get embarrassed when i was out with my mother and she would make a fuss with cashiers, but since she doesn't go out anymore, i haven't experienced that.\n  ","419377":"\n  a toaster oven.\n  \n  idk if it's just the ones i've personally used, but they take literally forever to bake or toast something. i'd much rather use a real toaster or a real oven.\n  ","419378":"\n  like most things, it could be genetic but it also could definitely be influenced by your environment and how you grew up. it goes on an individualized basis.\n  ","419379":"\n  i honestly have no idea. i have no recollection of my childhood and i've never thought to ask what kind of baby i was.\n  ","419380":"\n  not generally -- it all depends on who's giving me the compliment and the general vibe i get from them. most compliments make me uncomfortable.\n  ","419381":"\n  we're similar, but we're also different. for example, we like the same music and general interests but our personalities are pretty different. i'm very introverted, while he knows how to talk to people quite well.\n  ","419382":"\n  i had a conversation with the barista at starbucks about hair dye, LOL. he complimented my hair and was telling me how his was bright pink, but it faded out within a week.\n  ","419383":"\n  ???\n  \n  i don't have opinions on my friends' relationships. if they're happy, that's all that matters.\n  \n  cc:\n  \n   @ManicMartyrdom\n  \n","419384":"\n  i'm not a big fan of candy tbh. i like the chilly weather, the changing colors of the leaves, the seasonal drinks, being bundled up in warm clothing, etc etc.\n  ","419385":"\n  it wasn't made from an app, it's actually the xbox avatar creator !! they updated it for the xbox one a few weeks ago.\n  ","419386":"\n  ???\n  \n  that wasn't my argument, but all right. if you read earlier in the thread, i said that poly relationships were more taboo than monogamous relationships and that's why people don't understand them. i said nothing about jealousy in that respect.\n  ","419387":"\n  no, she was referring to the anon on her page who was playing the \"blame\" game and who was annoying her.\n  \n  idk why y'all are making a big stint out of this, all i said was that poly relationships are taboo in today's society. that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with monogamous relationships, especially considering i'm monogamous.\n  ","419388":"\n  i got into an argument with my mother this morning and ended up walking away, otherwise i would have just gotten more upset.\n  ","419389":"\n  LOL YES. when i was younger, i used to spell nearly everything out. now i don't really care and use a lot of acronyms.\n  ","419390":"\n  street racing. there are a lot of roads around here that people race on, and it's incredibly dangerous.\n  ","419391":"\n  it's a pretty even split between clear, sunny skies and rain. it's been overcast a lot lately, though.\n  ","419392":"\n  no, i don't like my own answers.\n  \n  idk why i have so many, i guess people like what i have to say ??\n  ","419393":"\n  i don't pay attention to sports, so i really have no idea. if i had to venture a guess, i would say probably football.\n  ","419394":"\n  i'm not sure -- if you go under \"contact us\" in the menu, though, they have resources such as an FAQ and other ways to contact support.\n  ","419395":"\n  i can't remember the last time i actually swam, regardless of whether it was in the pool or ocean.\n  ","419396":"\n  rofl. i've always been a trembling, anxious mess -- the only difference between now and then is that i used to be drunk or high 99 percent of the time.\n  ","419397":"\n  in most scenarios, most people wouldn't get violent or angry. but that isn't really a chance i'm willing to take these days.\n  ","419398":"\n  in that particular situation, i would rather fake laugh and get the interaction over with rather than give no reaction whatsoever and deal with the possibility of a stranger getting angry or violent with me.\n  ","419399":"\n  when the delivery drivers were loading packages into my garage, one of them said something about my shirt but i couldn't hear what he said, and he laughed -- so i awkwardly laughed with him because i didn't want to make the situation even more awkward by not responding to what he said.\n  \n  i have literally zero idea of how to act around people anymore.\n  ","419400":"\n  occasionally, yeah -- however, it's more along the lines that i drink after a stressful day period, as my job doesn't really stress me out very much. my personal life gives me more stress than my job does.\n  ","419401":"\n  no, i've never been a fan of whiskey or anything similar to it, i.e. scotch. my boyfriend drinks johnny walker occasionally, and i can't stand the taste of it.\n  ","419402":"\n  nah, that phased out quite a few years ago and especially after we started going through hardship together. obviously no relationships are all sunshine and roses, but he still gives me butterflies and his small tokens of appreciation and affection make me really happy.\n  ","419403":"\n  i've had pimples obviously, but i said i've never had acne.\n  ","419404":"\n  depends on my mood. i usually drink beer, but every now and again i'll have amaretto on the rocks, especially in the colder months.\n  ","419405":"\n  his smile !! he has literally the most beautiful smile and it melts me every time.\n  ","419406":"\n  i've never had acne so i've never really gone out of my way to avoid getting pimples. i just wash my face with warm water 2-3 times per day to keep it from getting oily.\n  ","419407":"\n  uh, is this supposed to say alcohol ??\n  \n  lmao, yes. i do drink.\n  ","419408":"\n  i probably have at one point, but that was way too long ago to really remember specifically.\n  ","419409":"\n  i do, actually. we had mutual friends and we ended up meeting each other during an outing to an amusement park when we were in, like, 10th grade. we spent the entire night talking.\n  ","419410":"\n  not really, which is why i wanted questions -- to distract me.\n  \n  the day started out fine but quickly deteriorated after i got home. i just finished up with the delivery my family was supposed to get (they were 1.5 hours late, ugh) and now i'm sitting down, trying to calm down and relax.\n  ","419411":"\n  anyone have any questions ??\n  ","419412":"\n  no, i think they're beautiful and majestic creatures.\n  ","419413":"\n  i don't text very often, so it doesn't really have the same effect.\n  ","419414":"\n  i have a brother already. we don't really have a close relationship or anything, though.\n  ","419415":"\n  sometimes, yeah. i don't watch most scary movies or shows alone anymore because they make me way too paranoid.\n  \n  my best friend recommended that new netflix series, the house on haunted hill, but i'm terrified to watch it alone, rofl.\n  ","419416":"\n  i agree to a certain extent. however, that doesn't mean that people should openly put themselves at risk of being hurt if they have the suspicion that a conversation can lead down that road. we need to protect ourselves first and foremost.\n  ","419417":"\n  this is true, but i also don't believe the paranoia is unwarranted. there are plenty of valid reasons to refrain from talking to people online, *especially* if they're coming from a position where opening up to someone in the past has left them vulnerable.\n  \n  but the bottom line is that people are allowed to ignore whoever they want regardless of their reasons for feeling uncomfortable. no one is obligated to talk to someone else simply because they exist, regardless of gender.\n  ","419418":"\n  it depends on the individual. some people simply don't want to converse with strangers and aren't willing to entertain the idea, while others fear for their safety and privacy.\n  ","419419":"\n  not wanting to talk to someone is a perfectly valid reason to not talk to someone. like i said, no one is obligated to talk to a person simply because that person exists. if they feel uncomfortable in that position, anyone has the right to cease conversation.\n  ","419420":"\n  as long as they're not being racist or classist, then there's nothing wrong with refusing to talk to a person. no one should be forced to communicate with a person they don't want to speak to, especially if the person trying to talk to them is making them uncomfortable.\n  \n  women in particular shouldn't feel obligated to talk to men solely because the man reached out to them. if that woman feels uncomfortable with that interaction, then she has every right to cease communication, ignore the message, or block the person attempting to talk to her.\n  ","419421":"\n  sooo ... i made one of these things.\n  \n\n   https:\/\/tellonym.me\/poetalunam\n  \n\n  it looks like the same thing as askfm, but drop me a message there if you want !!\n  ","419422":"\n  that seems pretty irrelevant to what you were discussing with me before.\n  \n  unless you have an actual question to ask, i'm not going to respond to these messages anymore.\n  ","419423":"\n  they're supposed to, but sometimes they don't. lately our deliveries haven't been telling us when they're on their way, they just gave us a four hour window as to when they would be here.\n  ","419424":"\n  i don't really believe gender has anything to do with that -- if you want respect, then show respect in the first place. if you're going to message a stranger randomly without respecting their decisions, then don't be surprised if that person tells you to leave them alone or ignores you.\n  ","419425":"\n  my weekend hasn't really been going so well. i'm not in a great mood because of things that happened earlier this morning, and i'm also experiencing anxiety because i'm supposed to be getting a delivery in sometime this afternoon and i have no idea when it's going to come. i have to help the workers take items off the truck and mark them off on the invoice, and i'm really not feeling social today.\n  \n  however ... i have coffee and i'm probably going to play video games after the delivery is done, so i guess i have that to look forward to.\n  ","419426":"\n  if someone is doing something that's making you feel uncomfortable, you have every right to call out that behavior and ignore the person making the unwanted advances.\n  \n  if you want to talk about respect, then the person who is the one messaging other people should respect that some people don't want to take part in those antics and leave them alone.\n  ","419427":"\n  neither. i don't really like the way my face looks most of the time.\n  ","419428":"\n  we can't find an apartment around here that's cheap enough yet. if there were affordable options, then i would have moved out a long time ago.\n  ","419429":"\n  i get into conflicts with my mother on a weekly basis because she's an extremely difficult person to live with, and she's also the only person who gets under my skin.\n  \n  however, that's basically the extent of it. i rarely get into conflicts with friends or my boyfriend, and i honestly can't remember the last time i had debate with someone who wasn't my mother.\n  ","419430":"\n  no, i wish i did !! thank you ~~\n  \n  it's actually the new avatar creator from xbox. they updated it about a week ago and gave a lot more options and it looks so much like me.\n  ","419431":"\n  i don't see anything wrong with that, personally. some people just aren't ready to date someone if that person has a child, and i would be in the same position if i was dating someone who had a child as well.\n  \n  no one is forcing you to settle down. if you're not happy then you have the freedom to break things off and find someone who's more suited to you.\n  ","419432":"\n  ???\n  \n  better in what context ?? people don't have to do anything they're not comfortable doing. if a stranger direct messages me on social media, then there's a 99 percent change they're being ignored. there's nothing wrong with that.\n  ","419433":"\n  this generally doesn't happen to me, but the few times it did, i just ignored the message.\n  ","419434":"\n  i prefer having a small group of friends over larger groups of friends. i've always had a small inner circle, and i only really talk to perhaps 4-5 people regularly these days.\n  \n  i'm not generally comfortable around strangers, so i usually try to do things in the public when the least amount of people are around (like running errands super early in the morning or late at night).\n  ","419435":"\n  no, i'm blatantly white. lol.\n  ","419436":"\n  i've been replaying fallout 4 a lot lately, actually, in preparation for fallout 76 that comes out next month.\n  \n  i also just recently finished the first episode of life is strange 2, and i'm debating on purchasing the new destiny 2 DLC, forsaken. i have the rest of the DLCs but i need to see how much money this one is first.\n  \n  i've also been meaning to buy the new tomb raider game, but i'm waiting for it to go on sale.\n  ","419437":"\n  i'm not at a point in my life where i want to be involved in a child's life like that, so i don't think i would feel comfortable dating a person who has a child.\n  \n  i don't even know if i want children in the future.\n  ","419438":"\n  i'm not really shy, but i do have social anxiety -- especially when it comes to talking on the phone. i dread making phone calls when it comes to scheduling appointments, but obviously i have to do it anyway.\n  \n  my boyfriend is also horrible at texting (lol) so it's much easier for us to catch up by talking on the phone rather than texting.\n  ","419439":"\n  it isn't my friend, it was my mother who was saying those things. it's difficult to ignore her considering i live with her.\n  ","419440":"\n  i think we're all selfish to a certain degree, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. it's perfectly okay to be selfish because our needs are just as important as anyone else's needs, and its healthy to recognize that we should do things for ourselves and put ourselves first at times.\n  ","419441":"\n  i absolutely hate my voice with a passion, lol -- so in that respect, i would agree. i don't know how other people feel about their voices, though.\n  ","419442":"\n  the only person i talk to on the phone is my boyfriend. everyone else, i text.\n  ","419443":"\n  my mother has been a tyrannical mess ever since i got home this morning and has been yelling at me for every small thing i've done for the past hour.\n  \n  this morning, she wanted me to go to a particular bagel store and buy her a bunch of food and spend money we don't have, even though we have more than enough food at the house and i wasn't feeling well enough to make the stop on the way home. she got angry with me, and when i got home, she told me she called in the order anyway so that i had no choice but to go back out and pick her food up.\n  \n  when i got home from that, she started yelling about how my father and i are \"useless\" because we couldn't find a particular set of dishes for the kitchen and basically went off on how we're both lazy and not good for anything.\n  ","419444":"\n  for example, if i'm not feeling up to doing something but i know it would make him happy, i'll get over my own feelings and do it for him.\n  \n  usually that translates to little things, like picking up food for him on my way over to his house, etc etc.\n  ","419445":"\n  they're equally as important -- although i would sacrifice my happiness for my boyfriend's happiness, realistically both partner's happiness are equally as important and no one should make you choose between one or the other.\n  ","419446":"\n  can y'all ask me questions to distract me ?? i'm having a shit day & i'm in such a horrid fuckin mood.\n  ","419447":"\n  i am !! i probably won't buy it for a while because i'm more focused on other games, but the first game was legendary.\n  ","419448":"\n  some people feel jealousy, hurt, and pain -- which is why polyamory wouldn't work for them. however, there are some people who thrive in polyamorous relationships. everyone experiences love differently.\n  ","419449":"\n  a lot of people don't understand polyamory because they're so used to the idea of monogamy, and polyamory is pretty much taboo in today's society for that reason.\n  ","419450":"\n  being in a polyamorous relationship isn't cheating because both partners have agreed and consented to each other also seeing other people alongside their current relationship.\n  \n  however, cheating can happen in polyamorous relationships if one person goes behind their partner's back to see someone, lies about it, etc etc. even though they're free to see who they want, there's an underlying understanding of communication and honesty when it comes to polyamory.\n  ","419451":"\n  well i did say that we have discussed it from time to time, so yeah.\n  ","419452":"\n  \"weak\" by AJR ;\n

relationship for the better. i still have issues with jealousy that i'm constantly working on, and being in a polyamorous relationship while having jealousy issues wouldn't be constructive to our relationship.\n  ","419454":"\n  yes, i'm very much a fighter for the things & people i care about. i'll bend over backwards if it meant making a loved one happy and i'll never stop fighting toward the causes i'm passionate about.\n  ","419455":"\n  love isn't meant to be all sunshine and roses, and you *will* go through hardship with your partner. what defines your relationship is how well you undergo conflicts together and communicate with each other during struggles.\n  \n  if someone is giving off the impression that their relationship is all good times, then they're either hiding the bad parts of the relationship or they simply haven't experienced hardship yet. you can still be in love with someone, and vice versa, and experience struggle with them -- it's a natural part of being human.\n  ","419456":"\n  i would be enthralled with it, considering my last kiss was with my boyfriend, lol.\n  ","419457":"\n  i wouldn't go so far as to say i hate people, but i'm definitely not a people person and i prefer having a small, intimate circle as opposed to a large one.\n  ","419458":"\n  i have a tendency to be a jealous person, but it's something i'm always working on because jealousy is a toxic emotion and doesn't serve anyone.\n  \n  a large part of jealousy is that you have to remember your worth. just because someone is experiencing something doesn't automatically mean you don't deserve to have the same experiences. it also doesn't mean that person deserves it more than you do. sometimes life is unfair and we have to deal with that.\n  ","419459":"\n  i honestly don't even remember what our first argument was about or how i dealt with it, haha.\n  \n  but one thing you have to remember -- it isn't you against your partner, it's you and your partner against the problem. work together to solve disputes.\n  ","419460":"\n  well, that happened back in the day when i worked in retail. i worked as the photo lab supervisor and then i also worked as a pharmacy technician, so i dealt with the public on a daily basis.\n  ","419461":"\n  \u2661 sleepy baby. \u2661\n  ","419462":"\n  i've been in quite a few situations where the language barrier posed an issue, but it wasn't funny or awkward. it was just overwhelming because my job was to help the customer, and it was difficult to help them when i wasn't sure what it was that they wanted.\n  ","419463":"\n  technically i already do, haha. my boyfriend adopted a bearded dragon, and we take care of her together.\n  \n  obviously they're not ~~ real ~~ dragons but they're the closest thing to one. especially considering they have absolutely no depth perception and like to think they can fling themselves off of furniture.\n  ","419464":"\n  yeah, plenty of times. thankfully it hasn't happened with my new job at all, but there were a few coworkers in my old jobs who were really irritating and angered me a lot.\n  ","419465":"\n  according to astrology, my astrological sign (scorpio) is also a water sign.\n  ","419466":"\n  yes, i have seven tattoos.\n  ","419467":"\n  wait... was this your attempt at fucking with me ?? rofl.\n  \n  regardless, if you want to continue asking me questions, feel free. i just don't answer anything inappropriate, especially with respect to sex.\n  ","419468":"\n  not so much anymore. i enjoy the feeling of being buzzed\/tipsy more than actually being drunk.\n  ","419469":"\n  if it was a joke, then you wouldn't be so offended rn, rofl.\n  ","419470":"\n  i always found threats for physical violence via the internet to be amusing also -- what exactly are you going to do, transport to a different era in the future and slap me on the back of the head via virtual reality ??\n  ","419471":"\n  lol, intimidation is the wrong word in this context. amusing might be better suited for this scenario.\n  ","419472":"\n  that's a bit frightening that you're curious about a stranger's sex life.\n  \n  although i assume you must be new to my page, since i've never answered any questions that even remotely relate to sex.\n  ","419473":"\n  lmao @ the \"no offense.\"\n  \n  that's not going to negate the fact that you asked what's usually a very personal question to a random stranger without preface.\n  ","419474":"\n  probably an 8\/10 right now !! i'm sitting down with a cup of coffee & checking up on social media, so i'm fairly

to focus on.\n  ","419477":"\n  no, i've never wanted to move to canada.\n  ","419478":"\n  i don't get headaches regularly anymore unless i'm withdrawing from caffeine or i'm hungover. but i usually just treat them with a good meal, a few ibuprofen, and a lot of water.\n  ","419479":"\n  i wasn't going to answer this at first because i'm generally reserved about my vices and seldom talk about them ... but yeah, i smoke like 3-4 times per week, lol.\n  ","419480":"\n  i'm very much a worrier, lol. my anxiety gets the best of me sometimes and my head is reeling most of the time when i'm awake.\n  ","419481":"\n  YESSSSSS. i'm so excited !!\n  ","419482":"\n  i'm not addicted to music, if that's even a possibility, but i do enjoy music a lot. i actually just bought tickets to a concert that's happening in december.\n  ","419483":"\n  no, i haven't used a planner since i went to college.\n  ","419484":"\n  no, i don't normally have plans on the weekends because everyone i know works on the weekend, lol. i might see my boyfriend sunday morning, though !!\n  ","419485":"\n  i'm feeling much better today, although my stomach is still a little off. :\/\/ i'm just looking forward to going home and laying down.\n  \n  other than my stomach issues, my day has been okay. i've been having trouble focusing at work, but that's normal these days.\n  ","419486":"\n  i honestly have no idea, lol. i don't really do anything illegal or dangerous these days.\n  ","419487":"\n  i don't really eat seafood often, but i usually get crab or salmon in my sushi.\n  ","419488":"\n  i doubt it. i'm feeling much better today, it was probably just one of those 24-48 hour bugs that has been going around.\n  ","419489":"\n  yeah, i've had break ups with friends before. they were mostly toxic for me so i didn't have any negative feelings towards the break up.\n  ","419490":"\n  is it just me or is askfm dead tonight ??\n  \n  ask me questions, as long as they're appropriate ~~\n  ","419491":"\n  oh shit, that's horrible. i just talked to my boyfriend & he said his dad had the same thing, but it definitely didn't last two weeks.\n  \n  whatever it is, i hope you feel better soon !!\n  ","419492":"\n  physically, i've been having nothing but problems with my stomach the past two days. i'm just in constant pain and i think it's some sort of stomach bug.\n  \n  when i'm feeling terrible physically, it also affects my mood so i haven't been motivated to do anything at all today. i slept pretty much the entire day.\n  ","419493":"\n  i didn't get questions all day, so that's why i was seldom on today. i also took like three naps because i feel like garbage.\n  ","419494":"\n  i don't remember what they were about at this point. when i woke up, i remember them being strange and vivid, but i can't recall any details.\n  ","419495":"\n  occasionally. i've been having nothing but vivid dreams in the past 24 hours.\n  ","419496":"\n  thank you very much ~~\n

asked if they could verify me. they asked me to email them a picture of myself holding up a paper with my username on it to verify it was really me.\n  ","419509":"\n  yeah, that's normal and very common. as long as you don't act on your thoughts then it isn't a big deal.\n  ","419510":"\n  i just woke up from a nap so i don't even know what's real and not real.\n  ","419511":"\n  i'm just as mature as other people my age.\n  ","419512":"\n  no, not that i'm aware of.\n  ","419513":"\n  i'm not sure. i don't try to be mature or immature, i just act like myself.\n  ","419514":"\n  no, i never have. i've always wanted to try wire-wrapping, though.\n  ","419515":"\n  honestly, lately my coping mechanisms have been sleeping and playing video games. at least it takes my mind off of things.\n  ","419516":"\n  i frequently receive gift cards for my birthday and xmas since it's easier than trying to think of a gift. they're usually pre-paid visa cards or cards to places like dunkin donuts and starbucks.\n  ","419517":"\n  i feel that -- i'm on a heavy cocktail of psych meds too to control my mood swings, and even though they help for the most part, i still get swayed by the simplest of things. my episodes aren't nearly as bad as they used to be, but they're still somewhat there.\n  ","419518":"\n  do you have access to a therapist or psychiatrist who would be able to help with your mood swings ??\n  ","419519":"\n  it makes complete sense. i get those feelings occasionally myself.\n  ","419520":"\n  any sort of customer service position -- i have social anxiety, which makes it extremely difficult to talk to people, especially over the phone. i would be an awful sales representative and would make zero commission because i wouldn't be able to convince anyone to buy anything.\n  ","419521":"\n  work & my personal life, primarily. i've also been feeling unmotivated and burnt out, which hasn't been helping. it's been making my anxiety skyrocket at random points during the day.\n  ","419522":"\n  \"love is a b*tch\" - two feet ;\n  \n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/_DjE4gbIVZk\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","419523":"\n  yeah, it happened often when i ran stock when i worked in retail. they were normally heavy totes of assorted products or big bags of items.\n  ","419524":"\n  i wouldn't say a lot, but the people in my life who matter understand me, and that's all that really counts.\n  ","419525":"\n  it wasn't so great. i don't know if i ate something bad, but i've had such pain in my stomach all day and i'm nauseous and dizzy.\n  \n  which doesn't help my mental health because it brings out my depressive episodes, so now i'm also mentally feeling like shit.\n  ","419526":"\n  depends on the individual animal, lol. there are some dogs i've met that i've preferred over cats, and then there are some cats that i preferred over dogs. it entirely depends on their personality.\n  ","419527":"\n  i've honestly just been scrolling past all of it because drama is pointless to me. luckily i haven't been on askfm much since yesterday, so i still found answers i haven't seen yet tonight.\n  \n  my inbox is empty, though, so i probably won't bother to stay online unless someone sends me questions.\n  ","419528":"\n  probably not in the long run. the money would run out eventually, unless i miraculously get a raise or find a job that pays me more than my current job.\n  ","419529":"\n  a lot more money than i can afford rn.\n  ","419530":"\n  it would depend on a lot of factors, such as the cost of living, violence in the surrounding areas, etc etc. i don't like big cities, but i also probably wouldn't feel comfortable in a small town either because i don't want people knowing who i am.\n  ","419531":"\n  i'm guessing you've lived there ?? rofl.\n  ","419532":"\n  no, i've never talked about moving to canada.\n  ","419533":"\n  i just said anywhere within the united states, so no.\n  ","419534":"\n  anywhere within the united states -- massachusetts, west virginia, north carolina, oregon, etc etc.\n  ","419535":"\n  in a heartbeat. the only things stopping me are financial obligations.\n  ","419536":"\n  that's true, i never thought about it that way. i would be so angry if my phone didn't think i was me because i was\/wasn't wearing makeup, lmao.\n  ","419537":"\n  when i went to RTX four years ago, i saw some amazing cosplays !! obviously they weren't halloween costumes, but they still require a lot of hard work and creativity, and the results were outstanding.\n  \n  i think my favorites were the halo spartan soldiers or people who dressed up as the characters from RWBY.\n  ","419538":"\n  i'd probably carve something fallout- or destiny-related, since those are the two video games i've been playing the most lately.\n  ","419539":"\n  i haven't needed to look for a new partner in a number of years, so i honestly have no clue what i would look for.\n  \n  however, my boyfriend is compassionate, artistic, a gamer, a hard worker, wants children, loves animals more than he loves people, has strong political opinions, has tattoos, and is left-leaning but loves playing devil's advocate.\n  ","419540":"\n  i don't remember most of my childhood, so i honestly don't know. i just remember being a witch or a devil.\n  ","419541":"\n  i don't listen to any podcasts, no. there are some on spotify that i tried listening to while at work, but i honestly can't write\/edit documents and listen to something with spoken words at the same time because i get way too confused, lol.\n  ","419542":"\n  my phone unlocks via fingerprint, and tbh i think it's a lot more reliable than entering a passcode or password.\n  \n  don't some phones also have facial recognition, where the phone unlocks after you snap a picture of your face with the front camera ?? idk if i'm making this up or not, lmao.\n  "}}
