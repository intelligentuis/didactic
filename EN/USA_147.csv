  maybe he's waiting for the perfect time . just bc we've been together for nearly 6 years doesn't mean anything. his cousin didn't propose to his wife until 10 years later. my brother didn't propose to his wife till 6 1/2 years later and just bc we have a son doesn't mean we have to be married

   Parents can have fun but they have to be parents first every decision you make even if it's for yourself will affect your child whether that be drinking and driving or to be doing drugs   Or going out and how many times you go out every parent deserves a break but not as much as you take

   Exactly you're 22 but you are a mother the day you decided to keep that baby is the day you gave up your youth your freedom yes it's OK to have a night out once in a while but you shouldn't be doing drugs popping pills and drinking as often as you do even if it's not every night you do do it often

  stfu apparently you aren't a parent lol
  
  just bc i kept my son doesn't mean i give up all my rights stupid
  
  i just posted on snapchat since you wanna keep clocking me 🙃
  "
791411,"
   A mature person and mother will not take people telling her that her going out or drinking or doing drugs is hate but if they take it as advice or an opinion or concern and maybe you're not ready to face reality because u like how your life is just cuz ppl are allowing you doesn't mean it's right
  ","
  if you haven't noticed i'm 22 and i don't give a f*ck what anybody thinks
  
  if your going to keep clocking my every moves make sure your doing it right or stfu
  "
791412,"
   You can't say you don't drink often because you post pictures of it and videos every time you go out you post a video of a drink in your hand or a picture of it and you want to take pictures of your man and you smoking or video every night that you guys do go out
  ","

  shouldn't i be out then? shouldn't i have went out Monday.
  "
791413,"
   As in last year you mean 2016  The year we just left .  Because I recently not that long ago saw your Snapchat a picture with a pill in your hand.  I watch your Snapchat and you're out a lot almost every night drinking or drug. It doesn't matter who your with your not with your son.

   If you're not out every night it's just almost every night.  I watch your Snapchat you go out drinking doing drugs and your man  I watch her Snapchat you go out drinking doing drugs and your man also and you go Around or  city on weekdays.  And your man drives under the influence of drugs & alcohol

  you sound stupid bc the last time i went to the city was 2 weeks ago to my bfs show lol

  i'm glad your watching my moves 😘😘😘
  "
791415,"
   I watch your Snapchat and you post yourself out so how can you say you're not out every night should I take a picture or record every time you post that you're out because I can definitely assure you you were out more even on weekdays you go get drunk and you put yourself out there doing pills drugs
  ","
  i haven't done pills since last year lol.
  
  and i'm home now? want me to snapchat what i'm watching so you can watch that too?
  
  and plus most of the time were w/ his cousins 😘
  "
791416,"
   out almost every night ??And why do you do drugs pop pills and drink and Snapchat it all & your man doing the same thing while you're driving around ? how responsible are you being of the parent putting your life at risk and possibly not going home to your son are going home in that condition

  all i hear is blah blah blah
  
  i'm 22 stop trying to tell me what to do w/ my life
  
  i'm tired of all these haters 🙄
  "
791417,"
   Why do you go out every night ? Don't you want to be home with your son? & even if he is sleeping why are you leaving your  responsibilities with someone else.  Plus any emergency can occur minor or not.  Having to do directly with your son or something around him such as a fire or worse.
  ","
  stfu . again y'all keep saying i go out every night but Friday-Sunday he was w/ Greg's mom bc she wanted him. that's not leaving my responsibilities. 2nd i only went out last night . which he was w/ my mom bc she didn't mind. i was home Monday and Today . Tomorrow i have an interview let me not go to that bc i'm leaving my responsibilities 🙄. i'm home now. it yet y'all say i go out every night.

   In my relationship I share my Facebook with my boyfriend. He has it logged in on his phone and he has his personal one too but we both share mine. He messaged people.. goes on my feed. Have you ever been in a relationship like this? What are your thoughts on couples sharing social medias?
  ","
  Tbh no bc I've always trusted my bf since the very beginning of our relationship. And I have his twitter linked to my account. But that's all. And he has mine linked to his phone bc he thinks my Twitter is more interesting. But I know all his passwords

   So if Joseph at the age of four said he wanted a dress, refused to wear trainers or 'boys' clothes, stole your make-up etc how would you deal with that? (I'm watching a TV show about this right now, hence all the questions sorry!)

  I wouldn't be upset at all. Since he's only 3 right now I'd think he's in a phase . Ya know but as he gets older and he continues this then we can sit down and have a talk

792088,"
   If a child at the age of 4 says that he/she is not the gender that they were born with, should this be encouraged. Should we encourage the child to 'be' the gender they identify with at the age of 4? Why/why not? If not, what do you do instead?
