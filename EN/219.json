episode betrothed modified to be gwen . but we couldn t access the file so we didn t do it","202834":"he s full size ! yeah he was supposed to hang out with the xlr kids","202835":"like an emp that would knock out other electronics ? he would probably need some augmentation for that","202836":"was the bathroom just a hole in the floor ? i hate that","202837":"maybe , the mystery inc models are layered in a way where i can t open them all at home , but i can look if there are requests","202838":"because the omnitrix logo didn t make any sense .","202839":"gi joe or something marvel maybe ?","202840":"he d just need his throat","202841":"for me , they are all canon except the crossovers which are imaginary stories until they actually happen","202842":"i would say decimus prime is a what if situation unless a crossover could ever actually happens","202843":"it s possible but i don t remember them being cut , i don t know","202844":"do you honestly think the ultimate alien guys would do a he man homage ?","202845":"this is probably a better question for perkins , i don t know much about him","202846":"it does ?","202847":"what information leads to this question ?","202848":"twitch . tv dyemooch","202849":"billiam","202850":"i m not sure how they would take that","202851":"i didn t think of the galvan as the leader","202852":"i would think so","202853":"i would be , i d like to see it !","202854":"it s weird","202855":"which rioters ? i don t remember","202856":"possibly , the roster was never finalized or anything , it was just a loose idea","202857":"she almost did for a minute","202858":"maybe if they needed more muscle","202859":"later this week or , years from now ?","202860":"he s so tall too ! i don t like the casting so far . i feel like they want to have it in arkham because that way they won t have to do traditional costumes","202861":"no the idea for the stream was to do alien forms that are exclusive to one omnitrix wielder only , the others don t have access . and we couldn t do it anyway because the file was corrupted","202862":"sorry i don t answer who would win or power ranking questions . that s stuff for the fans to debate","202863":"probably . he could reach all the way into his bedroom from the couch","202864":"yeah similar","202865":"probably most of it","202866":"who decides that ?","202867":"dude , i was out as soon as they cast a skinny penguin","202868":"not as far as i know","202869":"well verdona wore clothes in omniverse too so i m not sure","202870":"he s a mere figurehead of a waning monarchy , kind of like the queen of england","202871":"no , i don t think so . they can only mind control or drain them","202872":"forgotten","202873":"farmer boringjeans","202874":"no , i don t think he was ever a real plumber","202875":"it probably has all the original features","202876":"he is not legally old enough","202877":"no one s ever seen a non cyborged version of kraab s species , so i have no idea","202878":"most of them use the same names","202879":"it was always a cat","202880":"most of that episode is in night color , i don t really like posting the affected colors","202881":"i hope so","202882":"it is not known what happened","202883":"i don t know if i d want to do a whole new series , maybe a direct to video movie or two ?","202884":"nope , i never have . marvel s animation has never been quite up to the bar that dc has hit . kind of the opposite of the live action movies . ciro neili , brianne drouhard and tom perkins worked on emh . all people i ve worked with","202885":"sure , bring me one of those first pizzas","202886":"uh , i don t know . if i could use the animated equivalents of the movie characters and rewrite the story to fit tfa and we got a feature film budget okay","202887":"probably the same ones that are popular with you guys for ben","202888":"gwen s in the reboot ?","202889":"not that i know of","202890":"probably","202891":"yeah they re a little smarter","202892":"ha !","202893":"i just ignore that episode completely","202894":"looooooooooove wanda","202895":"ha ! i don t think so , not at this time","202896":"maybe cap or rocket ? it s super hard to choose","202897":"they d probably be suspicious but ben could probably pull off impersonating a distant cousin","202898":"nope","202899":"azmuth probably assumes the omnitrix user would transform into the water alien in water . . .","202900":"it s not very galvan looking","202901":"i think kevin would have to ask azmuth","202902":"that s a tough one i like the gnome or alice may or char gar gothicon i don t know","202903":"i want to say way big just because i can see him picking up and eating the entire competition","202904":"i can t remember why not . he probably would be red or have some red markings","202905":"no","202906":"yuri is the voice of sasuke in the us dub","202907":"i don t usually make blanket statements like that","202908":"why would we use social media ? we work for a professional corporation . they probably contacted his agent or asked him as a friend","202909":"pffft . i have no clue","202910":"i think we just asked him","202911":"deejay emcee","202912":"he expels a corrosive digestive gas that breaks down mineral elements into a vapor he can inhale","202913":"probably a little","202914":"that s the kind of thing they do","202915":"nope","202916":"here s hoping","202917":"he can eat just about anything","202918":"i just want a good reed !","202919":"probably not unless it had gone on for several years","202920":"salvaged a few usable parts and destroyed the rest","202921":"yeah , he was actually in the show","202922":"yes","202923":"i wanted to use both","202924":"it certainly doesn t sound like his powers , we never treated him that way","202925":"howard stern owns that character even in dimension","202926":"they feel ripped off","202927":"no we didn t","202928":"no , sorry . there were no plans for earth hot shot","202929":"she will probably start to make more friends , but she also has a very busy schedule","202930":"probably both","202931":"nope","202932":"probably naruto","202933":"no . upchuck is the only known alien with an alternate . azmuth s reasons for including both are unknown","202934":"i guess it had to happen in one universe or another","202935":"he was from that vic cook movie right ? i forgot about him . i don t remember if they had a relationship or not","202936":"he s still size but he s looking old and wrinkly","202937":"late afternoon early evening . i ll post on twitter when we have the details","202938":"no , he s not any kind of statement on trump or anything . he s just your normal crooked politician","202939":"probably pretty long","202940":"lol","202941":"it seems like he would have already if he could","202942":"just mostly organic stuff , no car parts","202943":"he is currently listed as missing","202944":"unitar s powers probably change randomly as different hack writers come up with new powers in episodes without regard for the series continuity","202945":"you can t afford one , sorry","202946":"i think it just ignores them","202947":"nope","202948":"probably soundless vacuums","202949":"fright face toepick polled so low he was only use once","202950":"it doesn t seem like it","202951":"you guys sure like to ask questions about stuff i didn t work on","202952":"no he can t digest any of that stuff","202953":"nah","202954":"we didn t want to recast","202955":"probably","202956":"echo echo","202957":"i like to think he went with plug man in the end anyway","202958":"why ?","202959":"last week ?","202960":"cooper is a mutant but darkstar seems like a magical creature to me","202961":"no , fistrick is an altered human","202962":"he wishes","202963":"no","202964":"only half","202965":"yes","202966":"you ll have to look back through the answers for those","202967":"yeah . he s probably around gorilla grodd s strength level","202968":"his is not blossomed","202969":"of course not","202970":"what","202971":"let s do the time war again","202972":"that would be a copyright nightmare","202973":"probably terraspin","202974":"no , they are an invasive species","202975":"he doesn t really have other powers he s just stronger and tougher than a normal human","202976":"as far as i know they ve never been there","202977":"nope","202978":"oh i just did this yesterday","202979":"nope , they were just our way of including gwen and kevin , and giving the idea that they were having their own adventures away from ben","202980":"not as pets , no

a mate","202989":"i think servantis has the aid of all his equipment","202990":"agreed","202991":"probably","202992":"only anodite","202993":"i don t think anyone believes him when he says he worked for vilgax","202994":"no , just because he turns invisible doesn t mean he can see other invisible things","202995":"probably benzarro or ben","202996":"possibly","202997":"i don t think it has a name","202998":"no , someone asked me to pick an alien and change their color","202999":"i m definitely not the correct person","203000":"chadzmuth would let azmuth beat the crap out of him , then sue azmuth for everything he s worth","203001":"i had an idea to do her in her beast wars colors","203002":"maybe different sized ones could group

gainax among others","203018":"his movies always suck . his cut is going to be better than whedon s ? i don t think so . that movie was always going to be terrible from the word go","203019":"it s possible","203020":"i m not sure .","203021":"ha !","203022":"you should watch the dyemooch stream saturday","203023":"seems like omnivores","203024":"he would see his grandpa max","203025":"no , we never had any backstory for bad ben . any shortage of resources answers refer to mad ben only , the others were probably me being confused about the name","203026":"i don t remember now . i get so many questions i guess i m reading too fast or something","203027":"bad ben ? no . did i say that ? if i did i just mixed up the names again","203028":"a new one","203029":"did you see a birthday episode ?","203030":"no , he d be yellow with a green uniform","203031":"ha ! i think hex would leave this reality first","203032":"i don t think we did any art of them pre mutation","203033":"i

get","203046":"i don t know . from how you describe it you could just plug a human in then zap darkstar","203047":"unable","203048":"probably not","203049":"remind me what the tachyon cannon is","203050":"yes","203051":"we rarely pinned it down like that . we just used them where we thought it would be the best or sometimes the worst","203052":"something similar","203053":"i like the final , i didn t want it to just be the same and i wanted more classic gwen theming","203054":"no","203055":"eye see what you did there","203056":"sorry i m confused by the whole thing frankly is that not what you meant ?","203057":"no , they have pig tails they can use","203058":"i always liked having earthling mutants who s powers were unrelated to aliens being on earth . it would be nice to have more","203059":"bad ben s not much different","203060":"seems like a useful combo","203061":"just to keep adding more","203062":"yeah probably runny","203063":"i would make fasttrack yellow","203064":"yeah i did","203065":"i ve never seen sunny s episode","203066":"maybe . but i didn t really think the shadowing worked right in uaf so it wouldn t be like that either","203067":"it s contemporary","203068":"not for that i remember","203069":"i don t think so","203070":"i haven t watched the new show","203071":"yeah probably","203072":"it s one thing","203073":"he s more bizarro than zombie usually visually","203074":"sure","203075":"i m not sure","203076":"he watches the show","203077":"he would commune with them and gain their favor","203078":"well seeing civilians of ben s aliens is one of my favorite things so all the sudden in omniverse it becomes top priority","203079":"yeah probably","203080":"i m sure he starts recycling at some point","203081":"he did what turtles do","203082":"it seems like it might","203083":"an understandable backstory","203084":"not that i can remember","203085":"koffing","203086":"i see","203087":"another electric alien ?","203088":"who ?","203089":"you can t send pictures in a question . i ve complained about this before askfm eng","203090":"you mean of the bandai prototypes ? definitely ben k","203091":"oh , it s cool i guess","203092":"he originally was meant as a friend to the xlr sk kids . i wish i could find that clean up , i have plans for that character","203093":"which friend s art ?","203094":"i think there was one in uaf . i doubt ben has one","203095":"there are probably crystal coves in many realities","203096":"maybe like years ?","203097":"negatrix !","203098":"furikake","203099":"i promised paul

think he s around anymore","203105":"i guess i like the omniverse version best","203106":"they hold dominion over a substantial portion of space","203107":"i don t understand eunice well enough to guess what she s doing","203108":"not any i can remember . a brainstorm brain would have been cool , if it could manifest on ben s head","203109":"it s better to just ask one question clearly","203110":"maybe he likes them when nobody s looking","203111":"it came from glen and dwayne s story ideas . losing feedback was supposed to be the reason ben took off the watch , but none of us liked that direction","203112":"i m not sure really","203113":"chowder and flapjack would have been cool .","203114":"basically nothing","203115":"i would guess he doesn t need to be in water to live","203116":"it doesn t seem like it but it s not impossible","203117":"i don t remember roy . benevelon was an alien","203118":"well the titans could theoretically get to ledgerdomain from the world inside mumbo s hat","203119":"we basically know nothing about eon","203120":"probably ! only after trying to get buzzshock","203121":"well we ve never seen other fasttracks have we ? maybe they are rare or antisocial","203122":"i ve never seen him try","203123":"the scope is unknown","203124":"i don t think echo echo can be considered a mechanical life form the same way clockwork is","203125":"it could","203126":"it doesn t seem like it . maybe he s already dealt with it or never even had to","203127":"that s probably a question for tom pugsley or alex soto","203128":"no , he was probably on his way up in his life of crime before","203129":"i suspect there aren t any","203130":"not too much really . matt wayne came up with the name but it didn t get much farther","203131":"i would think so , but i don t really know too much about him","203132":"probably similar but a little more lax and lazy because of their lifestyle","203133":"i think so , i picture squidstrictor being fairly large . i haven t thought about ventrilosquid s size really","203134":"wow i m not sure . i think it would have to be a physical energy we can see , but even then who knows he could end up turning into a baby or something","203135":"no , i wouldn t think so","203136":"cool ! that s what we were trying for","203137":"no , he is a previously unseen species","203138":"that s a tricky one . if you think about it there s probably only one ledger domain that all the alternate universes access . maybe that means there s only one charmcaster in the omniverse","203139":"they only wear spats , they like to feel the pavement on their flippers","203140":"it seems like that was glen murakami s idea","203141":"lex luthor could never really synthesize kryptonite so i wonder if it s not possible to replicate","203142":"only if the energy had been pulled out and given some type of physical electrical form . i don t think he could just pull the energy out himself","203143":"that would be cool","203144":"probably !","203145":"it is contemporary","203146":"in some it does","203147":"treasonous thoughts","203148":"i always wondered if he was created with the intention of being killed off","203149":"i don t like that you can t look at links before you publish the answer askfm eng","203150":"grey matter , echo echo , ball weevil , grey matter","203151":"yes","203152":"i wasn t there for echo echo s creation , i don t know","203153":"no , billy is on the ben inc board of directors , and he s growing up fine","203154":"it s possible","203155":"he has or will","203156":"s aright","203157":"probably some","203158":"yes , he did it for more control and other self upgrades","203159":"steven choi designed it for the show and bandai used it . that kind of thing is on the model sheet and up to the storyboard artist whether or not they use it","203160":"i don t think so ?","203161":"spook the werewolves","203162":"unknown","203163":"that s a good question , i m not sure about that one","203164":"probably not another full series . maybe a direct to video movie or comic mini series","203165":"q boss from giant robo","203166":"i don t know","203167":"well he s based on the mach , so really he s earth retro","203168":"definitely not","203169":"he was supposed to end up in the vampire trilogy , but got dropped somewhere along the way . maybe he s still en route to anur transyl","203170":"they probably exist there","203171":"we didn t discuss them too much","203172":"i suppose you might think that","203173":"i barely know what they re like in ben s reality","203174":"look up how to make a good pitch bible online so you can provide the information and images the executives need in a professional way","203175":"the reboot probably would have happened sooner","203176":"it s possible","203177":"i liked that he looks like paul williams in a beatles costume , so i just wanted to get paul williams to voice him","203178":"he probably goes backwards","203179":"if he has a first name it could be rick","203180":"vreedle powers","203181":"probably","203182":"i ve never heard anything about it . it seems like a lot of mistakes were made with alien powers in uaf","203183":"i think that was just a straight reuse","203184":"i like rahzar and tokka s designs","203185":"he d find something useful to do with them","203186":"i don t know","203187":"that s not what ventriloquism is","203188":"i don t remember a birthday episode","203189":"probably none . maybe persuader . i don t have many legion files","203190":"yes","203191":"he was killed and eaten on a wheat roll or something apparently","203192":"i don t know the scale","203193":"he can pull gasses in through his nozzles","203194":"years or whatever their life span is","203195":"if there is he s not a villain","203196":"yes it was . when i asked dave johnson to design feedback for us , he offered me the advice of how important ben s aliens had uniforms costumes . i had already decided i was going to do that but it was nice to get confirmation from the original designer","203197":"yeah , ben s probably a naruto fan","203198":"yes they have a metallic casing and some innards","203199":"either a mutant or a human altered by science","203200":"not until it was too late","203201":"i don t know","203202":"ben made it","203203":"i m not sure that was decided before i came on","203204":"xlrg","203205":"https youtu . be xvobqqkethm","203206":"sometimes but not as much as i used to","203207":"oh i love dino thunder . tommy is my favorite ranger and i love sauropods . i guess my favorite is just mighty morphin .","203208":"adonis is awesome","203209":"wow , it s a mystery . i have all the other models from that show except her , and i don t really remember her . i wish i could find it , looks cool","203210":"agreed","203211":"unknown","203212":"interesting","203213":"maybe there s artificial goop snacks like for tiffins","203214":"i don t know","203215":"it was probably some board artist who wasn t familiar with his powers","203216":"probably near ben intelligence","203217":"you guys are weird","203218":"they can probably lose some parts and still function","203219":"the alternate watches weren t customized in most cases","203220":"we usually had a pretty strong idea of what we wanted","203221":"it wasn t really any kind of plan","203222":"i hope so !","203223":"ratbat","203224":"probably","203225":"i don t really know it seems like she just does her own thing whatever assignment azmuth gives her","203226":"no","203227":"it s a mr hyde style transformation so he will revert to human eventually","203228":"lots , i guess ? how do i quantify something like that ?","203229":"no i don t think so","203230":"isn t rojo s real name robot jones or something ? i thought i read that somewhere","203231":"beast boy or cyborg","203232":"why take any away ? i only wanted to add more","203233":"it s hard to remember working on individual episodes after doing so many so fast","203234":"guy gardner","203235":"animo is one of the few scientists left and is trying to save the world","203236":"it s hard to choose","203237":"i didn t name them , that was done in the original series","203238":"prototype implies a physical built construct . do you mean bandai s toy prototype , or did you mean concept art ?","203239":"it s the same model as i designed for alien force","203240":"they are exactly the same model sheet , i don t know why it would look different","203241":"patrick warburton","203242":"not my show","203243":"i haven t watched it enough to have a favorite . i love the classic and skull s designs","203244":"belial","203245":"i still draw on paper , but most draw in photoshop","203246":"oh i remember that episode","203247":"i m don t believe that s true . the original ben series was the apex of the franchise s popularity . everything after has been trying to reach those levels","203248":"depends on how prevalent his feline attributes are","203249":"i ll just throw them in the pool !","203250":"he may have had to rebuild it at some point , or use it in making a new one","203251":"he did but unfortunately in trying he was infected","203252":"rook ! does he count ? we did a million versions of rook","203253":"isn t that eunice s story ?","203254":"frogs of war","203255":"we would have to reference uaf and omniverse color supervisor chris hooten for any kind of owl character","203256":"well he s probably not an alien since he was in the brotherhood and we didn t have non earth villains in that group as a general

is inspired by evangelion plug suits","203270":"no , if i did i was incorrect","203271":"it seems like he doesn t , or vilgax s personality is so different that he is not interested in the

try to outwit her","203302":"no , he doesn t have him","203303":"probably a bit more rounded and barrel chested . still gangsta though","203304":"mystaxions from glaber

powerful","203386":"he is not exceptionally fast but he has a massive stride so he gets there quicker","203387":"nope","203388":"it was my idea so that we could use some of tom perkins unused

rule in my industry . it s for legal reasons","203408":"no","203409":"no clue","203410":"no","203411":"not really . one of our mandates from cn was to change the look and tone of the series as much as we could in the short time we were given for development . and i know from past experience that most fans end up liking the new version . also i tend to be fairly respectful of source material","203412":"pretty fast probably","203413":"don t even get me started","203414":"can someone with breath like that ever truly be a best friend ?","203415":"mostly it was just which alien we thought of , or were in the mood for at the time . but it might have also depended on other factors like who s in the voice cast of the episode especially for aliens like ditto and ghostfreak or what kind of powers were needed for a specific story point . things like that","203416":"i imagine it being a cross between a sentient virus and an infestation of mites or fleas","203417":"i m not actually sure you do have a question . better luck next time","203418":"how about a kiwi bird and a sea slug . the kiwi hops high and fast , and he spits a tar like substance from his tuby beak , when the tar

plans","203438":"well , to be honest i ve never seen you make the list","203439":"i am not sure","203440":"i never combine mine , i really only have favorite torsos and limbs . but piranacon and bruticus with the blast off color chest shield are the coolest looking","203441":"i can t remember any names that were too hard . we did have a list of names for future use","203442":"that s not what was told to me","203443":"we changed osmosians so we could be more in line with the original show continuity","203444":"i have always thought ben transformed into the apex of the alien species , even the equivalent of a super hero . i did hear that dwayne felt the opposite , he thought the transformations were the everyman of the species","203445":"i just never really got the upside down head","203446":"no","203447":"nothing that s definitely coming out or anything that s been announced yet","203448":"i wasn t around when they created clockwork","203449":"i don t know what that

sleeping","203455":"i don t have any","203456":"if you want to sure","203457":"there s probably tons !","203458":"no , but there s an early drawing of subdora with a chamalien helmet that might give some insight","203459":"nope . although there was some thought to thriller whale being based on an existing undertown alien","203460":"https youtu . be sxjoifhod","203461":"i don t know if he didn t . it might have been lost","203462":"oh","203463":"it s in there !","203464":"the gift of disinterest","203465":"otp","203466":"normal ben has the omnitrix ?","203467":"i ve never actually thought about it","203468":"i oversaw the line art and color , and i was involved with things like story and casting","203469":"nope","203470":"i always want more azmuth and argit . we really should have done a show where they had to team up . . .","203471":"and snoop is pure thc","203472":"what an odd coincidence , i just found my copy of the incredible mr . limpet","203473":"i suppose so","203474":"i don t know if it has a lot of subspecies","203475":"pfffft","203476":"there may be hand me downs , but the omnitrix weilder probably reaches their pinnacle when they build their own omnitrix","203477":"they are both ground vehicles at this point","203478":"fasttrack","203479":"they should have bruce timm oversee their live action","203480":"it would have been revealed","203481":"i think they are all called groot","203482":"i haven t seen it","203483":"look on the bright side , no more diarrhea !","203484":"i m still deciding who i ship sg sari with","203485":"look away !","203486":"clearly a mirror universe counterpart","203487":"i d rather watch sopranos","203488":"not on me","203489":"creepy schemers who are always fasting","203490":"yeah , sony needs to get over themselves and let feige do the thinking for them","203491":"just the ones we ve already mentioned like thriller whale , ventrilosquid , and the teleporter","203492":"we had to make them a little more earthlike in case they would be made into toys , but those are their cybertron modes","203493":"probably not dwight . mindwipe is partly based on korla pandit . he needs to have a really smooth and sultry voice","203494":"i don t remember any","203495":"he looks amazing","203496":"approximately galvan day","203497":"i don t know much about them","203498":"after a certain point we were told we had too
