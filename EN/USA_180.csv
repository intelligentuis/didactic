   📝 “The real violence, the violence that I realized was unforgivable, is the violence that we do to ourselves, when we’re too afraid to be who we really are.” ~ from the show sense8 — What are your thoughts on this quote?
  ","
  I mean I can agree with this quote because we do cause ourselves so much violence. I feel that’s because we are afraid to be ourselves and who we really are. People are afraid to be themselves because we know that others will judge us so quickly and we don’t like feeling like we’re getting judged by someone.

   He looked like Michele Morrone and took your handcuffs off, inviting you to sit in the passenger's seat.

  I think it’s because people think when a guy cries it makes them look weak and that they can’t show their feelings with others. It’s really sad though because guys are human too and they have feelings just like everyone else and they can cry if they have to or need to let it out.

967042,"
   You're welcome. And when you look, you'll probably see other things, even made by Aquaphor that say they're specifically for the lips -- forget them! They're just more expensive for tiny amounts and aren't better. The normal Aquaphor is cheaper and you get a ton, so it'll last a long time!

I know you wouldn’t want us to be sad but instead to celebrate your beautiful life but it’s hard without you Chaz🙁 You definitely knew how to scream like the devil and sing like an angel. You have such an angelic voice Chester and every time I listen to it I tear up because I know you’re not physically here with us but I know you’re spiritually always here. I miss you more & more each  & every  day it’s unbelievable.  But I’m here to keep your beautiful legacy alive forever, you can count on that angel. You’re a legend Chester and will always be remembered as one. My hero👼🏻💕 You will also keep on inspiring me and motivating me throughout my life, that will never change nor stop. You will always be such a huge role model to me and will always have a huge impact on me. And your legacy will be kept alive forever Chester, you know that we will keep and spread your legacy forever💕 we love you Chester. RIP you beautiful angel and soul👼🏻

I started freaking out and started breathing so heavily that I could barely breathe.. and then more news about his death started popping out and that’s when I knew it was real and that day in 2017 a part of me died along with Chester and I’ll always be heartbroken about it 💔

   In your honest opinion how Important is money in a relationship and Also in your opinion in your past relationships how did money work with you and your partner? Was it a causal thing for them to pay for dates, buy you gifts, help pay off your debts, etc. If they didn’t have money what would happen?
  ","
  Honestly I don’t think money should be important in a relationship. Because relationships aren’t just about the money it’s about the person and who they are and your love for them. But to be in a relationship I think you should at least be financially stable.

  I mean just because you fall in love with someone it doesn’t mean they’re the right person or that it’s the right timing but on the other hand you may fall in love with someone and the timing may not be right but you might meet them later on down the road and the timing will be right then. I mean just because you fall in love with your significant other doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the right person for you unless you just know.

  "
970817,"
   Why do people give up so easily on relationships nowadays? Are we becoming more and more selfish?
  ","
  I feel people give up on relationships so easily nowadays because they don’t know how to commit to being in a relationship or maybe they just aren’t ready or even afraid to because they know they will get hurt in the end.  It’s mainly commitment that I believe people have an issue with and also communication. I feel most don’t know how to communicate with their significant other most of the time.  It’s also definitely fear because it’s very hard to trust nowadays and you never know what your partner can be doing on their own time. You know? They can cheat on you or not be completely honest with you and whatnot.  And most people don’t know how to be loyal to their partner. It’s different for many people.
