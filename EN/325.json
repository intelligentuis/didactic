in my opinion . people in the clubs claim that they re doing it because it means they value their participation , or something along those lines , and it makes them closer in the long run . but i

claim that they re in love with you solely based on one date , then they clearly must have created some fantasy of you that they re basing those feelings off of , instead of getting to know you over time . it s somewhat of a red flag and it can be seen as obsessive behavior . especially if they re looking at you and seeing only what they want to see instead of seeing you for how you actually are . they re creating an intimate connection over a fantasy of you , and that s not healthy at all .","300642":"to me personally , there s a remarkable difference between i love you and i m in love with you . the former saying can be applied both romantically and platonically because it s just an expression indicating your love and appreciation for a person , whether it s your partner , friends , or family . the latter , on the other hand , signifies a deep , intimate connection you feel towards someone on a romantic level .","300643":"i think it ultimately depends on what you re looking for . i believe netflix is better for movies documentaries , while hulu is better for television series . i don t know much about amazon video , so i can t comment on that . i prefer netflix , though . they

them at all .","300645":"lmao , no . i apologize profusely quite frequently , it s just one of those words that slip out without conscious thought behind it .","300646":"depends ultimately on my mood that day . sometimes i m incredibly proud of the person i am , while other times i m very disappointed in myself and believe i could do so much better than how i m doing . i m never really neutral on myself , it s either one extreme or the other , which can be overwhelming at times .","300647":"i wouldn t know , i m not a boy . lol .","300648":"unfortunately , yeah . i have regrets about trusting a certain person in my life because they don t know how to keep their mouth shut .","300649":"making intimate connections with people and education .","300650":"financial stability , emotional stability , and a strong support system .","300651":"yeah , it s about sex but also skeet is slang for c m , so i thought it was hilarious and also horrifying how a bunch of and year olds were dancing to a song that s basically about c mshots and having sex , lmao .","300652":"my boyfriend and i spent the morning sleeping in and having coffee outside together . things like that always make me happy .","300653":"ugh same . i watched abducted in plain sight a few weeks ago was absolutely confounded at the parents . not only was the documentary creepy af , but those parents were either incredibly ignorant or simply did not care about their daughter .","300654":"i don t have anyone blocked on social media , actually . if someone annoys me , then i just delete them off of my friends list . or , in the case of askfm , i just delete their messages .","300655":"aw , thank you ! !","300656":"honestly , this reminds me of when i was in middle school everyone was dancing to get low by lil jon , without knowing or realizing what it was actually about , lol .","300657":"lmao , if you think i m not being a mental health advocate because i spoke up when you started incessantly spamming my inbox , then you clearly don t know what a mental health advocate is . please stop sending me messages . i m just going to delete them from hereon out .","300658":"dude , just leave me alone . i have no interest in being your friend . i said challenge accepted because you said you would go on a hunger strike if i didn t say hello to you .","300659":"i poop at least twice per day . i m not sure if that s normal , lmao .","300660":"i believe creative writing is an art form , so there s really no such thing as straying too far from formality . my prose is pretty informal itself .","300661":"challenge accepted .","300662":"i just looked him up . i appreciate his hair and beard , but his face isn t attractive to me .","300663":"no , i don t even know who she is . lol .","300664":"i think an anon has mentioned that to me once before , but i don t remember when it was exactly .","300665":"not really , no . i understand that everyone has a different style , however . one part of editing that s interesting to me is that each writer has a different voice and style , so it s important to respect those styles while still maintaining formality and conforming to the ap and in house styles . also , i write creatively in my free time so that breaks up a lot of the monotony as well .","300666":"i haven t heard that term in ages , lol . i wouldn t know , it isn t something i handle in my job . i doubt it s even touched upon at all for most publishing companies .","300667":"it still isn t seen as formal , so no . the only times we re instructed to use ampersands are when they re included in the official names of organizations .","300668":"no , that s not a formal style and i don t think it s encouraged in ap style . not unless it s the official name of an organization , like most law firms .","300669":"it s mostly irrational , especially considering my greatest fear in particular is my boyfriend leaving me . he s never given any notion that he would ever do such a thing , but it s still something i fear every day .","300670":"leaving me , i . e . ceasing contact with me with no discernable reason whatsoever to where i can t get closure . i become extremely attached to my friends and if they don t talk to me or respond to my messages , i assume they re angry with me or don t want anything to do with me , and i freak out .","300671":"yeah , i don t really know what else you can be abandoned by , lol .","300672":"no , but i do fear abandonment .","300673":"that basically defined my entire teenagehood . well , i wouldn t necessarily say i fell in love with them , but i was infatuated with a lot of different people growing up and they never reciprocated those feelings .","300674":"no , i always craved love because i never felt like i received it adequately growing up , so i constantly sought after people with failure , of course .","300675":"somewhat , but not so much anymore . i still appreciate my simple pleasures , like coffee and cigarettes , but i value human interaction and having experiences moreso now than ever .","300676":"you don t know for certain how long things will last , so the best thing you can do with any scenario is to appreciate it for what it s worth in the present moment and value it s existence in your life .","300677":"i m not entirely sure . i don t know what exists outside of life , and while i ve struggled immensely in this life i ve been given , i ve also experienced genuine happiness and love as well . i ve gotten over the whole i wish i was never born thought because i ve learned to appreciate what i do have .","300678":"no . nobody s face is perfectly symmetrical .","300679":"i don t necessarily think so , no . most people live their lives without finding a purpose that suits them , but that doesn t mean that their life is meaningless . you can still have a fulfilling , meaningful life without knowing what your purpose is .","300680":"not always , but he bought me something thoughtful so i figured i would get him some small things too ! ! i bought him a big oz candle , some pajama pants because he s always losing them in his room , and a new wallet .","300681":"it ultimately depends on my mood , because sometimes i m extremely sensitive while other times i m a cold hearted b tch , lmao .","300682":"sorta , but it s more like a mantra if you re going through hell , keep going . basically meaning that if you encounter struggles in your life , the best thing you can do is continue living and making the best out of your situation . most experiences are temporary , and while it s okay to feel discouraged , you shouldn t allow the situation to break you down .","300683":"a good friend is someone with whom you re naturally compatible and have great chemistry , whose friendship with you isn t misplaced by time or distance , and who knows how to raise your spirits but also snap you back to reality at the same time .","300684":"i would suggest consulting shehitsback because she finds some really great makeup products for cheap prices ! !","300685":"i m currently obsessed with the two faced pumpkin spice palette . the colors are so rich warm , and i love natural and reddish tones when it comes to eye shadow .","300686":"no , i ve only ever really gone on a few dates with people i was already dating . i only went on one date when i was single , but i showed up to that one as well .","300687":"yeah , i smoke marijuana frequently . i also tried cocaine a few times when i was younger .","300688":"my favorite position is wrapped inside of a blanket burrito with a cup of coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other hand .","300689":"the last time i cried for no apparent reason was a few weeks ago . sometimes it just happens when my emotions are too strong , and there isn t generally anything wrong that would warrant such a strong response .","300690":"people compliment my hair the most because i always dye it funky colors , lol . i ve gotten a decent amount of compliments on the blue ever since i got it done in december .","300691":"if you really want to express strong apathy , you would say i couldn t care less . that implies that you basically have no f cks left to give meanwhile , i could care less means that while you don t care , there s still a part of you that does and you have a few f cks to give left within you .","300692":"actually work in my field ! ! in the beginning , i was worried i would never find work as a writer because writing jobs are scarce in an office setting , but i m really happy i found a job within my field where i can apply the knowledge i learned in college .","300693":"all of the s around me aren t really in walking distance . it s about a minute car ride , though . i also pass by every day going to and from work , so sometimes i ll stop in for coffee and cigarettes .","300694":"i eat healthy , for the most part , and my blood work always comes out fine . however , i m overweight so that definitely isn t healthy at all .","300695":"traffic and car accidents . i was just sitting in traffic for two hours because the entire highway was closed off , for whatever reason , so everyone was pushed into this one lane back road , which took forever . i m so happy i m not sitting in fuckin traffic anymore .","300696":"it doesn t make me rage , but it does annoy me slightly . although i admit , i ve done that once or twice as well if i m talking to a former coworker at the drug store i frequent . i try to move out of there as quickly as possible , but the cashier is insistent on talking , rofl .","300697":"just existing is enough for me , haha . i always need alone time every night where people can t bother me , and on the weekends , i like having alone time early in the morning because everyone else is still asleep .","300698":"y all read way too much into things , it s quite concerning .","300699":"you asked me this question last night , and basically all i did last night was drink tea , listen to music , and sleep . i think i fell asleep before pm , haha . tonight , i m planning on seeing my boyfriend and giving him his valentine s day gifts .","300700":"i m tired , even though i slept for like nine hours last night .","300701":"the original , haha . i never saw the remake .","300702":"oh boy , i wish i had no feelings . lol . that would honestly be such a relief .","300703":"the juvenile diabetes research foundation jdrf means a lot to me . when my boyfriend was younger , he used to raise money and organize events for the charity with his family . i think they have a great mission and are doing wonders to help kids diagnosed with diabetes .","300704":"things i hate about you , the wedding singer , benny joon , arthur , knocked up , silver linings playbook , and the princess bride .","300705":"everyone has a different reason to be happy , it isn t a universal thing . sometimes , though , the smaller pleasures of life is enough to make people happy . personally speaking , things like having conversations with my boyfriend and listening to music make me happy . i also like waking up without an alarm , having the first cup of coffee in the morning , and getting positive feedback on my work from my boss .","300706":"my dude , you re the one on my profile . if you re upset , then you can simply leave my page .","300707":"lmao . nah , i m not missing out on anything that i don t already have . i m quite happy with my relationship .","300708":"i just told you that i m in a relationship , lol . if you don t believe me , then that s on you .","300709":"i don t have conversations on askfm . however , you re free to ask me questions .","300710":"uh , no ? ? lmao . i m in a relationship .","300711":"i experience deja vu pretty often it always freaks me out because it makes me feel as if i can predict what will happen next , but it s always on the tip of my tongue . idk if any of the experiences are weird though , they usually happen with just everyday conversations .","300712":"aw , thank you","300713":"red walls with a black accent wall . tapestries hung up with string lights on the walls . a specific table for candles so that it doesn t get in the way of anything . a large bed that s not pressed up against the wall with cozy blankets and pillows and comforters . a television hung up on the opposite wall from the bed . and perhaps a small fish tank .","300714":"adventure , i suppose . i don t go out and do things as often as i would like . most of my weeks consist of the same routine of working and going home and sleeping because i m too tired to do much else . ideally i wish i had the free time with my boyfriend for us to go on excursions on the weekends , but it s not doable with our schedules .","300715":"nah , i eyeball most recipes , haha . baked goods taste much better when you play around with the ingredients anyway ! !","300716":"i . . . i don t remember . . .","300717":"no , i didn t receive chocolate or flowers , lol . my boyfriend did surprise me with a weighted blanket , though ! !","300718":"rum soaked cannoli cake or rainbow cookies with a cup of coffee .","300719":"i prefer questions ! ! i rarely vote on polls tbh .","300720":"i suppose so people have told me that i am in the past , and people often come to me if they need career or relationship advice .","300721":"singing , lol . i love to sing but i m absolutely terrible at it .","300722":"waking up with my boyfriend , having a hearty breakfast , and drinking coffee while sitting outside and talking .","300723":"not really , no . i don t care enough about most things to be argumentative about them .","300724":"no , it was pleasant and sunny out today ! !","300725":"i went to work and ate a horrible amount of cookies my department had a bake off , haha . now that i m home , i m drinking ginger tea to ease my stomach and i m going to take a shower soon .","300726":"you must be hella young if you think is old , rofl .","300727":"no , not much offends me these days .","300728":"it costs zero dollars to respect a person s pronouns . if you had the tiniest bit of decency within you , you would at least respect a person s pronouns .","300729":"probably not ? ? how am i supposed to predict what she looks like within the next three years ? ?","300730":"i m awake , but it s only am .","300731":"i m doing well . i m out having drinks with a friend , so i m in a decent mood .","300732":"no , that doesn t sound very appealing at all .","300733":"lol . that s great .","300734":"lmao . they look comfortable af though , not gonna lie .","300735":"lol . no , i don t own one of those either .","300736":"i thought about that while answering your question , actually ! ! where i live , biscuits are flaky bread rolls that are usually really dry and tasteless to me , lol .","300737":"is crash bandicoot considered retro ? ? lol . i don t remember any games i played earlier than that , unfortunately .","300738":"i usually need gps if i m going somewhere for the first one or two times , but after that , i generally remember where i m going . i also have a good sense of direction when it comes to north , south , etc etc .","300739":"uh , i don t own a onesie .","300740":"it was around christmas time last december , actually . my parents bought some gifts for my grandparents who live in florida , so i dropped the package off at the post office for them .","300741":"no , i m not much of an explorer mainly because i don t have the opportunities to explore i m normally too tired to do anything after work , lmao .","300742":"i absolutely despise candy hearts . even when i was a child , i disliked the taste of them because they literally taste like colored chalk .","300743":"i don t believe i ve ever sleepwalked before . however , you would have to be asleep in order to do that obviously i m completely unaware of my actions when i m sleeping . lmao .","300744":"i push doors that say pull on basically a regular basis . even on doors that i use every day , sometimes i ll just have a brain fart and not know what to do . lmao . there s no such thing as too much butter , especially with respect to buttered bagels and croissants , so that has never happened to me . i don t eat biscuits , so your last question doesn t apply to me . i ve always thought they were too dry and crumbly .","300745":"i m percent in support of vaccinations . there s really no reason to refuse a vaccination unless the child was immunologically compromised or something , and it s prevented hundreds of diseases for many years . the fact that anti vaxx parents have been the root cause of some diseases returning as an epidemic is absolutely deplorable .","300746":"the weather doesn t have much of an effect on me , thankfully . it doesn t affect my mood as it used to when i was younger , and these days , i prefer grey , chilly days as opposed to warm and sunny .","300747":"i m not much of a shopper at all . usually i m in and out of stores as quickly as possible i only purchase necessary items . sometimes i ll splurge on junk food or coffee , but it s only when i believe i deserve a treat if i was having a bad day . i went to pick up my prescriptions two nights ago couldn t help but buy two bags of cheez its because they were on sale for , lol .","300748":"i split a delivery order with a few coworkers on monday for lunch . i ended up ordering boneless buffalo chicken wings with ranch for dipping .","300749":"i m a full fledged scorpio . i have a bachelor s degree in communications professional writing . i m years old . lately i ve been obsessed with peach red bulls . i ve been in a relationship for years . i prefer the scents of rose , lavender , jasmine , and patchouli . coffee is my favorite beverage . i have at least cups per day . i m diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses , so i ve always been a strong advocate for erasing stigma related to mental health . i have no current piercings , but i used to have my nose and labret pierced . i also have seven tattoos . lately my favorite musicians have been ajr , hozier , grandson , matt maeson , and two feet .","300750":"the only stereotypes i can recall right now are that people from the uk are supposed to have horrible teeth drink tea basically all the time , lol .","300751":"it goes on an individualized basis , i believe . some people say it sooner than others , it all depends on the relationship dynamics and how comfortable you feel with your partner . i don t remember when i first told my boyfriend i loved him , lol . that s going back years ago , but it was probably in an appropriate time and setting considering we re still together i didn t scare him away .","300752":"askfm obviously , facebook , instagram , twitter , snapchat , tumblr , and tellonym .","300753":"yes , my boyfriend writes me letters occasionally on special holidays ! ! he ll either include it inside of a card or write me a letter that goes alongside whatever gift he bought me . i ve always adored classic displays of romance like that .","300754":"only if they don t take care of their teeth or have proper hygiene . people can t exactly help the way their teeth grow in , but if they re not brushing and flossing every day , then that s gross .","300755":"i m sure i don t know everything there is to know about him . humans are incredibly complex , multifaceted creatures , and it s near impossible to know every single , little thing about an individual , regardless of how close you are to them .","300756":"lately i ve been spending my spare time watching netflix before bed . i only really have hours of time to myself per day , so in those hours , i just want to relax and recoup .","300757":"i disliked gym class , as well as basically any math class i was in . i m pretty sure i hated calculus , but i don t remember at this point .","300758":"i have a mindfulness journal with daily prompts , but i haven t written in it in a few weeks . it s an extremely helpful journal , though . it allows you to focus on the present moment and be thoughtful of what s going on in the now , as opposed to dwelling too much on the past or future .","300759":"not actively , at the moment . my boyfriend said that he ll start going to the gym with me , though , so that gives me more motivation to actually hop onto the whole fitness thing .","300760":"my day went all right nothing significant happened , it was an average work day . it felt like the day dragged , though . time wasn t going fast enough . i got home not too long ago now i m just planning on relaxing and getting an early night s rest .","300761":"it s all good ! ! thanks for understanding .","300762":"yeah , i was in a lot of ap classes when i was in high school , actually . although i did take ap literature and ap grammar as well . i don t remember what my skill level used to be compared to my peers because i don t remember my really old writings , but i do know that i scored in the th percentile on the writing portion of the sat , if that counts for anything .","300763":"i do , but it s an anonymous tumblr and i don t like giving my url out publicly . it s mainly a venting blog .","300764":"aw , this is so cute ! ! thank you , lovely","300765":"my only skill is in writing , haha . i can describe nearly anything via the written word and i ve always had an advanced understanding of what flows well .","300766":"probably to some degree , sure . i just don t pay conscious attention to what s trending . i do things because i want to do them , usually out of impulse if i m being honest , lmao .","300767":"i agree with you . that doesn t mean my hair is a fashion statement , though . lol .","300768":"obviously your eyes aren t fine because you failed the visual portion of the lesson . i would find a new eye doctor if i was in your position . it s not bad to get a second opinion , and it s going to help you in the long run .","300769":"i can try giving you advice , but i can t guarantee anything .","300770":"yeah . he died about a month ago . i had him for over a year , my boyfriend couldn t believe he lived for as long as he did considering corycats from pet stores have a short lifespan .","300771":"i don t have any pets atm , so here s a selfie of me at the bar last week .","300772":"yes , he s a genuinely good person who has struggled with his own demons . he did some sh tty things in the past , but through therapy , i learned that it was a coping mechanism for him in an effort to deal with my mother . since then , i m empathized with him more , especially considering he s recently been more understanding and forgiving of my feelings .","300773":"me and my parents co exist , but that s the extent of our relationship . i don t really speak to them with casual conversation , it s always been on a need to know basis . i m not close with either of them exactly , but i do empathize with my father more .","300774":"i broke part of the screen on my ipad within the first few months of having it , if that counts . it still works , but it still has this horrendous crack across the entire screen .","300775":"a bad person , in my eyes , is someone who intentionally hurts other people with no remorse because of their own selfish needs usually extreme examples , like p dophiles , m rderers , and other ab sers .","300776":"i treated myself to a caramel macchiatto on lunch today . i needed the extra boost it was the perfect drink to get in light of the weather this afternoon .","300777":"nothing really . i just got home from work , which i m really thankful for because the weather has been absolutely horrible today and i was worried about getting into a car accident on the way home . it s been snowing , sleeting , and raining since am so everything is really slippery .","300778":"i don t believe i m seeing my boyfriend on valentine s day because he s working late that night , but we ll probably see each other the following night ! ! we don t usually do much anyway . we treat each other to a small gift or two , but that s pretty much it . we don t need a holiday to tell us to appreciate each other .","300779":"a client e mailed my supervisor to tell her that whoever wrote her online feature was a wonderful writer she was pleased with the work . i was the writer . that made my week last week .","300780":"yeah , i reconnected with a friend i used to talk to when i was in middle and high school because i had questions about my past . we haven t talked regularly since then , but we do message each other perhaps once a month or so to catch up .","300781":"my hair is influenced by a fashion trend ? ? that s news to me , rofl . i ve been shaving and coloring my hair for years now .","300782":"i have a hyundai accent .","300783":"non binary . lol .","300784":"i think i donated money to a friend s gofundme a few months ago . i don t remember when it was exactly .","300785":"not really , no . i m not doing it on purpose to appease others , i m doing it for myself . if i wanted to make a fashion statement then i would have done something that appealed to the general public .","300786":"uh , so that they remain shaved . lol . my hair grows fast and i don t want to shave it out just yet .","300787":"yes , i love my boyfriend .","300788":"it s under the trans umbrella , yes ! ! it basically means that you don t identify as either of the gender binaries man or woman .","300789":"looking at the responses to this question , it looks like anon s intention totally backfired . lol . who cares . someone else s gender doesn t affect your life , trans people shouldn t be demonized just for existing .","300790":"allowed a friend to vent to me about a personal problem they ve been having and offered them my advice . it s been spanned out over the course of like two days since we ve been texting about this problem , but i m always here for my friends if they need support .","300791":"i m sure it annoys everyone to some degree .","300792":"no ? ? why would i be friends with someone who doesn t like me or vice versa . lol .","300793":"that s honestly terrifying that people look at that character and say to themselves , that s my ideal partner . they re blinded by the romanticization of similar characters to him , where instead of focusing on the terrible things they did , they genuinely believe that they re doing it out of unconditional love . it s dangerous , especially if those fans are young and think that his behavior in the show is okay . that might lead them to pursue similar real life relationships in the future .","300794":"even though the idea completely overwhelms me , i actually do enjoy planning events and vacations and whatnot . i used to do most of the planning when my boyfriend and i would go on vacation , either just the two of us or with friends , and i genuinely enjoyed making a small notebook of dates , times , finances , etc etc . right now , my boyfriend , myself , and his family are planning a massive vacation for next year , which makes me really excited . i m also a bit nervous because a lot of preparation is involved , but it s going to be so worth it .","300795":"uh , sleep . lol . other than that , i enjoy relaxing with a cup of coffee while talking to my boyfriend or a close friend . sometimes i ll also grab a drink with a friend at night if i feel like socializing for a change , but otherwise , i m content with laying down and watching television or playing video games by myself .","300796":"i m in a relationship , so i suppose my boyfriend is technically my date . but we re not actually doing anything for valentine s day . he s working late that night , so i probably won t be able to see him until the following night .","300797":"i read classic literature when i was in college , considering i was an english literature minor , but since graduating , i haven t read any of the classics .","300798":"idk , the anon decided to throw white into the question . i just answered accordingly , lol .","300799":"i was honestly concerned because i noticed you weren t answering questions , and then i saw your name that said you were on a hiatus . lol . i took a year off of askfm quite a few years ago because i needed to focus more on my education , it was while i was finishing up college . other than that , i haven t really taken any complete breaks from social media .","300800":"my weekend was pretty good , besides the whole medication fiasco which was just resolved , so i can rest easy now . i spent the majority of the weekend working and spending time with my boyfriend , so i have no complaints . spending time with my favorite person and getting extra money ? ? yes pls .","300801":"it really depends on my mood , but lately i ve been into dark blue , turquoise , sea green , etc etc .","300802":"i finished all of my work for the day ! ! the only things i m planning on doing for the rest of the night are curling up into a blanket burrito , watching television , and sleeping .","300803":"what are you referring to ? ?","300804":"my first concert was a conglomeration of artists from a radio station the only people i remember being there are shaggy and lisa marie presley , lol . it was in , so i was years old , i think .","300805":"ah , that s awesome ! ! i love seeing memorabilia like that , it s partially the reason why i like going to the hard rock cafe whenever i go into manhattan , even though it s a super touristy place .","300806":"i m in a decent mood , actually . i m listening to all of the songs my boyfriend and i listened to last night when we were hanging out and relaxing , and it brings me peace . almost sweet music by hozier https www . youtube . com watch ? v oe tfa zc","300807":"ding ding ding ! ! my boyfriend and i were listening to that song last night , because we haven t heard it in literally years . i forgot how fantastic of a songwriter don mcclean is .","300808":"no angel born in hell could break that satan s spell . and as the flames climbed high into the night to light the sacrificial rite , i saw satan laughing with delight the day the music died .","300809":"it s difficult to have a single thought that encompasses an entire group of people with different values and ideas . a staggering number of straight , cis white men are incredibly ignorant , but obviously that doesn t mean all men who are straight , cis , and white behave that way .","300810":"not really , no . my hair is just hair something that i can customize to make me feel the most like myself , much like how someone accumulates tattoos on their body . i like changing my hair color often because i get tired of having the same color for too long .","300811":"i used to wear the slip on checkered vans in high school mostly because i was a scene kid , which was honestly horrifying .","300812":"both , haha . he s a cisgender man .","300813":"i ve never shaved my face for the purpose of applying makeup , no . i wax my upper lip and eyebrows though . as for my legs , you re lucky if i shave my legs at all , lmao . i do admit , having shaved legs feels nice on satin sheets , but it s way too much effort to shave when it s only going to grow back in within the next day .","300814":"the top three people in my friends group are urlsareshittbh you ! ! , kittiemeowsie , and me . lmao . the top three people in my country are three people i don t follow .","300815":"i don t have any audio recordings on my phone . i have a few videos , but they re all of my boyfriend s pets , so it isn t something that would be of interest to anyone else besides us .","300816":"i m five feet tall .","300817":"yes , i try to use any coupons i can find , which are normally in the weekly flyers that come with the newspaper . you can also find some helpful coupons online as well that you just have to print out and clip . i splurged on some chapstick and a valentine s day card for my boyfriend tonight because i had a extrabucks from cvs , lol .","300818":"everything has been wonderful , actually . we re in the process of planning a massive family vacation next year .","300819":"i believe that certain extents of challenging your partner is healthy in a relationship , yes . ideally , your partner should inspire and motivate you to be a better version of yourself , which also includes calling you out on your bullsh t if you re making excuses in an attempt to not do something .","300820":"yeah , i live with my parents at the moment .","300821":"the best thing for me when i m sad or depressed is to be around my boyfriend . he knows how to make me feel better without overstepping boundaries , and he understands that it s often the smaller things that have a tendency to give me hope , like forehead kisses or waking me up to a freshly made cup of coffee or allowing me to sleep in if i need a day to sleep .","300822":"i can see both of them within myself , actually . i have my father s nose and mouth , but i have my mother s eyes . i inherited the short as in height gene from my mother s side of the family , but i have the analytical nature and some psychological issues that also stem from my father s side .","300823":"the only thing about my external appearance that i change often is my hair . i usually color it every months or so , and i have to maintain the shaved portions of my head as well .","300824":"i m doing well ! ! i had a very productive day today , and i even ran errands after work and finally got a call back from my doctor regarding my anxiety medication . so now i m just relaxing and catching up on my questions in my inbox .","300825":"i don t mind flossing because it feels better when i m done . i floss once per day .","300826":"not really . i m not looking forward to working and waking up early , but usually once i m there , i m fine .","300827":"yeah , it wasn t bad . i did the rest of my work today and i ve just been relaxing and watching netflix while drinking tea .","300828":"i m sure some people probably do , but in general he s an attractive man .","300829":"i follow accounts . however , there are a lot of accounts which are backup accounts of people , and a lot of them are also inactive .","300830":"no , friendship can t be forced . it only happens naturally . however , i ll answer any questions that you have .","300831":"i m definitely not conservative , haha . if anything , i m between centrist and leftist . my beliefs align with those ideals the most .","300832":"perhaps it is more of a specific regional thing , like the other anon said they heard of it referred to a penis as well . i mean . . . i ve always just called it a penis . or a d ck , haha .","300833":"i think it s disgusting . you re basically sxxualizing children and things associated with children , which is wrong .","300834":"i m not posting a photo of my fridge because it s a mess rn , rofl . i have to clean it out . my favorite food is sushi , and lately i haven t been all that interested in pasta . it all tastes the same to me . tonight , i m having chicken parm and salad with my boyfriend and his family .","300835":"haha . it makes me wonder why strangers on the internet are curious about my boyfriend s penis .","300836":"probably ! ! that s what i was thinking , it s interesting how each region of the world has it s own slang terms .","300837":"if that personally happened to me , then i would simply shrug it off and be reminded that their opinion isn t necessarily factual . i would perhaps ask them why they thought that way and take that into consideration , but if it s totally false , then there isn t much else you can do .","300838":"this sounds like a fetish question . i ll never understand how certain people have urine fetishes , it makes no sense to me . it s literally bodily waste .","300839":"i ve literally never heard of a penis referred to as a bird before .","300840":"because it was incredibly random , as well as invasive . i m not answering that question , lol .","300841":"lmao . congrats , this actually made me laugh out loud .","300842":"he s a year old man .","300843":"no , i ve been in a relationship for quite a few years . lol .","300844":"well , he was years older than me and i felt like he was taking advantage of me , so that was a major component . in addition , he lied to me all the time and i was getting tired of it . i didn t actually love him like i thought i did , i only loved the idea of him , and i didn t enjoy spending time with him anymore .","300845":"he didn t i broke up with him , actually .","300846":"yes , i would . i love my boyfriend regardless of what gender he is , and i would want him to do what makes him happiest and most comfortable with himself . if that means transitioning , then i fully support his desire and would try to help in any way possible .","300847":"anyone have any questions ? ? my inbox is empty","300848":"i hope you feel better soon ! ! do what you need to do to get well , and don t worry about askfm . you need to focus on yourself first and foremost .","300849":"i m already someone s favorite person .","300850":"well i went back to bed for the past hour , lol . i wrote one assignment this morning after i got home and decided i was still tired , so i slept more . now that i m awake again , i m going to try to finish my work and drink some coffee to keep myself motivated .","300851":"no , i don t listen to podcasts .","300852":"no , there s no conspiracy behind it . however , i do believe there is still racial profiling when it comes to america s justice system .","300853":"i don t know anything about their albums , so you re asking the wrong person .","300854":"they re all right . i don t actively listen to them , but i ll listen to them if they appear on the radio .","300855":"i like having a small light on while i sleep at night . it helps me see the room somewhat instead of it being pitch black , although it s terrible to keep a light on for that length of time .","300856":"i only run the water when i need it , i . e . while cleaning off my toothbrush instead of letting the water run the entire time . i also use energy saving light bulbs .","300857":"uh , askfm never said what the coins were exactly for , lol . i highly doubt they ll be giving away actual money or prizes . regardless , i don t want to do question for question . i don t ask people questions to begin with , and i don t make any exceptions to that .","300858":"i used lexisnexis when i worked for the law firm . i don t use an e library for my current job , though .","300859":"because i would probably lose it if i kept it in my jeans , to be perfectly honest with you . lmao . at least when it s in my bag , i know exactly where it is and it isn t going anywhere . i have an over the shoulder bag , so it would be difficult to grab my bag and steal it since it s wrapped around my entire body .","300860":"my favorite class when i was in high school was english literature . i took both ap literature and ap grammar , but i preferred the literature course because the teacher was much better and more interested in the class itself . i ve always been a fan of literature as it is , so it melded with my interests quite well . i also enjoyed taking forensics when i was in high school . we studied blood spatter patterns , bullistics , famous murderers , and the psychology behind why some people k lled and others didn t . it was an extremely interesting class .","300861":"i only own one knife , and i keep it in my handbag in case i ever need it while i m out of the house .","300862":"aw , thank you ! !","300863":"thank you so much","300864":"i honestly have no idea , i haven t weighed myself in a long time .","300865":"aw , thank you ! ! i didn t think i could pull off blue because i ve never tried it before , but i was pleasantly surprised . one of the best colors i ve ever dyed my hair .","300866":"yeah ! ! i bought a wig for my halloween costume last year .","300867":"lol , yes . well i drink coffee as i m writing , but writing exhausts me sometimes so i took two naps yesterday , lmao .","300868":"so after thinking about this question and discussing it briefly with another anon on here lol , i think it should ideally go on a case by case basis , so the age would change depending on the circumstances and severity of the crime . i would agree with my previous anon and say anywhere between because you definitely know right from wrong at that stage . however , it does ultimately depend on the child themselves .","300869":"ugh it s literally the worst . especially people who don t even look when changing lanes and figure hey , they ll move out of my way ! fucking hell . it s so terrible . i want to live in an area where i don t have to deal with other drivers , lmao .","300870":"i hate everything about driving . i hate the anxiety i experience when i get behind the wheel . i hate dealing with other drivers who always think they re entitled to the road . i hate sitting in traffic every day .","300871":"? ? ? ? ?","300872":"i think it s good ! ! there are a lot of bugs because it s still relatively new , but the graphics are beautiful and it helps a lot if you have friends to play with , considering its multiplayer . i would suggest buying it if it goes on sale that way if you don t personally like it , at least you won t feel as terrible spending money on it . i would also watch a lot of streamers play the game so you get a better feel for what it s all about before you decide to purchase it .","300873":"amused , lol . that s such a juvenile thing to say and imply , it s something someone would say if they were in high school . nobody can make a person cool and being cool is a subjective trait .","300874":"idk , i ve never had one before .","300875":"i don t like the taste of pineapple usually , so no .","300876":"i ve been playing fallout lately . however , i also really enjoy the rest of the fallout series , skyrim , assassin s creed , the bioshock series , the halo series , life is strange , and destiny .","300877":"it wasn t something i did regularly , but i was a terrible friend in the past where i would purposely manipulate friends for my own gain , like using them basically for drugs and alcohol . then i ended up dropping them completely when they weren t useful to me anymore .","300878":"i don t own a playstation , so xbox one by default .","300879":"yeah , it s happened on a few occasions , in both situations where i was apologizing for my wrong behavior and where i was reaching out because i was concerned about them . it s understandable in both instances . if i wronged someone , then it makes sense for them not to want to talk to me and i accept that . i can t be everyone s friend and i make mistakes like everyone else . in the case of someone struggling and not responding when i reached out , that s also understandable because sometimes people don t have the energy in them to respond to things like that .","300880":"i don t consider myself to be very interesting , but all right .","300881":"yeah , there are so many factors involved . it should ideally go on a case by case basis .","300882":"yes , it s wrong . and i think you know it s wrong too , considering you sent this question out to ask for a second opinion . either break up with your girlfriend or stop cheating on her . chances are she doesn t deserve that kind of heartbreak .","300883":"i was thinking somewhere around there too . at that age , you obviously know the difference between right and wrong . however , idk what the current laws are now regarding the topic and i also think it heavily depends on the crime itself .","300884":"lol . i still want to do some research on the topic first .","300885":"as my bio indicates , i live in new york .","300886":"hello do you have a question ? ?","300887":"it s an opinion question that i have to think about because i m not sure what my opinion is on the issue .","300888":"i only have one question in my inbox besides this one .","300889":"continue driving . i m not going to give someone the satisfaction of an emotional response on the road , and plus i m usually too focused on actually driving to really have a reaction to begin with .","300890":"i don t talk privately with strangers on askfm .","300891":"sometimes i get angry , but most of the time i m concerned about my safety so i don t allow myself to become angry because it could impede on my driving . i ve never flipped anyone off before , lol . that s just an invitation for trouble .","300892":"nah , it doesn t anger me . it s useless to emotionally invest yourself into something a stranger thinks they know about you . i delete most of the anon hate i get because it doesn t warrant or deserve a response .","300893":"if it s lighthearted and people know that they re just teasing , i see nothing wrong with it . my coworkers and i make fun of each other semi regularly , but that s also because we hang out on breaks every day , lol .","300894":"i went to alt . s not so silent night at the barclays center last december . i don t remember everyone who was there , but i saw mike shinoda , bastille , ajr , muse , florence and the machine , and death cab for cutie ! !","300895":"i went to public school .","300896":"when i was growing up , i had a dog for quite a few years . she passed away around the time i was years ago . since then , i ve only had fish two bettas and a corycat .","300897":"i don t know much about comedy , but i m fairly certain that not all comedians make racist jokes .","300898":"i don t need space from my boyfriend really , but i do need space from my friends and people in general . i value my alone time a lot , and i always need time to recharge after i ve been out or at work for too many hours . i like the quiet .","300899":"if your idea of a joke is blatant racism , then you probably aren t very funny , rofl .","300900":"i seldom wear rings unless i m going out to a formal occasion . my boyfriend has bought me a few over the years , and i try not to wear them often because i m honestly afraid to lose them . in addition , it impedes on my typing speed at work .","300901":"who cares what they think of you . their behavior is not appropriate for the workplace and they need to be reprimanded accordingly .","300902":"talk to them directly and tell them that their behavior is inappropriate and racist . if they continue doing it , then i would probably go to hr .","300903":"i don t remember my dreams most of the time , so i honestly can t say .","300904":"i m from new york . as for my goals and career plans , i want to eventually move up within my company and obtain more responsibilities which equals out to more money . i want to continue in the field i m currently in and perhaps do more freelance work .","300905":"sometimes i regret them , while other times i know there s nothing i can do about those mistakes now the only thing i can do is learn from those mistakes and move on with the knowledge that i can do better . i try not to think about the past rather , i ve learned over the years to be more mindful of the present .","300906":"i don t believe that the united states is the best country in the world , lol .","300907":"i didn t eat lunch .","300908":"it doesn t change my mind either way . if he doesn t ask my father , it s not as if i won t marry him . also if my father said no , i would marry him anyway . it s not something that makes a difference to me personally .","300909":"right now , he s at work so he s probably thinking about what he needs to do and now to do his job efficiently .","300910":"nothing in particular , unfortunately . i would say my tax returns but i don t suspect i ll get much money back .","300911":"anyone have any questions for me while i work on some freelance writing ? ? my inbox is empty","300912":"zero . i ve never displayed psychotic symptoms .","300913":"smoked with a squeeze of lemon on top of it .","300914":"seafood is all right . i don t love it , but i ll eat salmon every now and again .","300915":"writing freelance assignments , cleaning , and doing laundry usually . i also take a nap in the middle of the day since i m normally tired by pm .","300916":"uh , it s after am , lol . i normally wake up around am which is sleeping in for me , actually . i haven t done much today at all so far besides write one assignment and eat breakfast .","300917":"uh , i m not anywhere close to being insane , lmao . i have a firm grasp on reality and i don t struggle with any symptoms that correlate with insanity .","300918":"i ve heard of it , but i ve never watched it before ! ! it sounds like it would be right up my alley .","300919":"aw , thank you ! ! i was never interested in journalism persay , but most of my freelance work has to do with press releases and other written features that clients pay for to get more online exposure , like website articles and magazine features .","300920":"yeah , which is terrible . most americans also work or more jobs just to keep afloat . i technically work two jobs because my work week doesn t end on friday i also do freelance work on the weekends , so i m basically writing for profit every day of the week .","300921":"lol . i remember reading about a study somewhere in europe perhaps the netherlands or denmark ? , where people had shorter work weeks or only worked days per week instead of days . it ended up leading to more productivity throughout the week and employees were happier . i thought that was incredibly interesting .","300922":"yes , that s entirely true . and i m glad that there s more exposure to mental health problems in the workplace and companies are becoming more understanding of people s need to take time for themselves to recoup and recharge . there s still somewhat of a stigma that exists , but for the most people , people are understanding and encourage mental health days because it leads to better productivity when the person returns to work .","300923":"thank you ! ! i didn t know that . i ll definitely keep that in mind in case my mental health declines . thankfully it s gotten much better within the past two years thanks to medication and therapy , but it still comes and goes in waves somewhat . if i m out of work , it s usually only for one day at a time and it only happens perhaps once or twice per month .","300924":"me too . the woman in hr has had her own host of medical issues , and there are a lot of people in my office who deal with mental health issues including my immediate boss , whom i ve spoken to multiple times about my problems . so i think that she s more sympathetic than anything else because she knows what it s like to be struggling . i ve never used fmla before , but i do have the paperwork in case anything does happen . i was out of work for about a week with my last job when i was first diagnosed because i was very s icidal , but that job was fine with just a doctor s note excusing me from working for the week .","300925":"honestly , the world would probably be more at peace because there wouldn t have been any religious wars and people wouldn t feel the need to be in conflict with religions that differ from their own . a lot of people not saying all people , obviously feel like their religion is the best religion and every other religion is wrong , which leads to a lot of conflict .","300926":"this past week , i ve been dealing with a lot of anxiety due to running out of my medication . unfortunately , my doctor hasn t returned any of my phone calls to prescribe me something else or at least a different milligram of my medication to hold me over until the pharmacy gets more in stock . i was extremely panicked on thursday ended up leaving work early because i couldn t stop my racing thoughts and nerves and crying , and i spent the rest of the afternoon exhausted in bed . i don t know if there was any silver lining associated with it besides the lesson that i need to take better care of myself . thankfully , my company was completely understanding of what i went through and offered their help if needed , and hr even said that it s good that i knew to leave work because i have to take care of myself first and foremost .","300927":"it sounds like the rule is meant to keep dogs safe in the car , which is something i fully support . there are so many people who travel with their dogs in their laps or unrestrained in the backseat , which can lead to a lot of distractions and possible accidents . i ve never traveled with my own dog in the car , but when my boyfriend and i are transporting his dog to places like to get groomed or going to the vet , we usually have him on the leash in the backseat with a cover over the seats that prevents him from climbing into the front seat . thankfully , his dog behaves really well in the car and just lays down the entire time , so it isn t something we had to worry about .","300928":"don t invest your time and energy into people who aren t willing to do the same for you in return . it s a lesson i previously learned in the past as well , but a situation arose in which i had to distance myself from a close friend because they kept taking advantage of the friendship and refused to see the error of their ways whenever it was discussed with them .","300929":"i ve called the police , a rental service , and a radio station . i ve never called the rest of what you listed , however .","300930":"i honestly can t remember the last new movie i saw . i re watched the crow a few months ago , and i absolutely love that movie because i like themes that have to do with revenge . the dialogue was also wonderful and the characters were well rounded .","300931":"completely androgynous , with a flat chest and skinny bodice . my hair would probably remain the same because i love the half shaved , half long look , and my face would also be thinned out so my cheekbones would be more prominent .","300932":"yeah , i ve blocked certain family members from seeing my posts in the past , when you create a new status , there s a button that shows who you re sharing the status to , and you can click on that and change it to say hide x , y , and z . you can hide certain people from seeing your posts that way . however , much like celinem said earlier , facebook isn t really the best means of finding a new job . i ve personally found the best results on sites like indeed . com , ziprecruiter . com , and monster . com .","300933":"do you mean like pens and stuff ? ? if so , then yeah . i don t really keep much at my desk , though . i only have a few pens and some notepads , but i seldom use them .","300934":"if you re going through hell , keep going . it basically means that you ve survived this far , and you have the potential to survive again . don t give up hope in the face of adversity , and you ll indeed make it through to the other side .","300935":"how about a selfie instead","300936":"i mean , my best friend i go months without texting each other . two weeks is literally nothing . i would just respond to them accordingly as if nothing happened .","300937":"neither beer .","300938":". . . what . . . i have literally no words . lmao . some people are out of this world . literally . that s so ridiculous i cannot even fathom his rationale .","300939":"his mother passed away . i clearly stated that in my answers .","300940":"sanguine has always been appealing to me , both aesthetically and in meaning .","300941":"i think dreams are either randomized or they re reflections of our subconscious . sometimes dreams can be meaningful , but there are also dreams which are utterly meaningless , which makes dream interpretation tricky . i think most of my dreams are meaningless , but i ve also had a few dreams that did indicate i was stressed out or upset like the climbing up a hill or teeth falling out ones . i also used to have frequent nightmares which were very graphic , and i think those were also indications of my stress levels too .","300942":"i seldom remember my dreams , but the last portion of a dream that i remember having was from earlier in the week . someone i knew was in the hospital for four days last week , and in my dream , they were randomly in my boyfriend s house wearing a ball gown and hugged kissed me hello as i walked through the door , lmao .","300943":"probably askfm , lmao . i always enter the app if i see i have a new question if i m not doing anything else and then i just catch up on my feed after i answer the question s .","300944":"it was the best decision i honestly could have ever made . his family still talks about how helpful i was how grateful they are that i was home to help them during that time , because no one else in their lives stepped up to help at all . and that was nine years ago . sometimes even the simplest decisions can make a huge impact on people . returning home meant the world to him and his family , even though they didn t expect me to make that leap , and i put myself in a better headspace because it prompted me to mature and be responsible . i would have gone down a darker road , i expect , had i stayed in massachusetts .","300945":"it was really complicated , so there were multiple reasons . the first reason was that i was severely depressed my first year of college , and i ended up failing the same class two semesters in a row which was unheard of for me , considering i got straight as in high school . the second reason was that my boyfriend s mother passed away , among other things going wrong with his family , so i felt the need to be closer to him to help him and his family during that hard part of their lives . it was overall a better , healthier decision for me . i flourished when i returned home , and i was also able to remain close with my boyfriend and his family and help them out whenever they needed it during that transition phase , among other things .","300946":"originally massachusetts for one year , then i returned to new york .","300947":"uh , pretty much any question on here pertaining to fetishes are weird af . keep that sh t out of my inbox , thx .","300948":"talking on the phone has always given me terrible anxiety . it s difficult for me to explain things verbally to begin with , but over the phone makes it x worse for some reason . i . e . i had a phone at my last job and sometimes i would have to speak to clients about their cases . which always gave me either horrible anxiety or a full blown panic attack . i dreaded going to work each day because of not only the general stress of the job , but also because of the possibility of having to talk to clients on the phone . they were never pleasant experiences either .","300949":"i only talk to my boyfriend on the phone i prefer that over texting because he s terrible at texting back , and it s easier to have a conversation verbally than through text . the last time i video chatted with someone was when i was using oovoo in college , lol . i would video chat with my boyfriend , as well as my best friend , because they both lives in different states than me .","300950":"i ve never owned an iphone , so i honestly don t know much about them . i ve only had android phones once smartphones started coming out .","300951":"i m monogamous . no , my hair is not my natural color lol . my hair is currently blue , but my natural hair color is dark blonde . i m only allergic to seasonal allergies . yes , i believe in s x before marriage . if you re planning on spending the rest of your life with someone and s x will be an important part of that relationship , then you have to see if you re s xually compatible . my boyfriend and i were long distance for about nine months when we first started dating , so i guess so , lol . i m percent pro choice . people should have the right to decide what to do with their own bodies in terms of pregnancies . they have bodily autonomy , and everyone has the right to terminate a pregnancy for whichever reason arises . i live with my parents .","300952":"yes , i believe in marriage . even though it s technically just legal documentation , i also believe in the metaphorical value of marriage too . i don t know if i want any children . if i do , it would only be one child . i m somewhere in between a centrist and a leftist . my favorite food lately has been sushi , and my favorite drink will forever be coffee . i support black lives matter . the whole notion of black lives matter arose because of the injustices committed against black people in the legal system , and just because people are raising awareness of those injustices doesn t mean that injustices toward other people don t exist . yes , global warming climate change is real .","300953":"the only language i speak is english . i don t have any pets currently , but i used to have two fish . i don t label myself as a feminist due to the stigma held against modern day feminism , but some of my beliefs align with intersectional feminism . i don t have any necessary dietary restrictions , although lately i ve been focusing on cutting out more carbs and eating more lean proteins and whole grains . all of my pet peeves have to do with driving , lol . i hate when people don t use blinkers or drive too slowly in the left lane . traits in others i appreciate the most are honesty , loyalty , a sense of humor , and maturity . my own worst trait , in my opinion , is my mood instability , which can cause me to question everything around me and makes me unpredictable . it s gotten more under control in recent years , but it s still somewhat there . my five year plan includes moving out and renting a house or apartment with my boyfriend , adopting a lot of animals , starting to write a book , progressing further in my career whether it s with the same company as now or a different one , and progressing further in my mental health recovery .","300954":"nectarines . oranges . peaches . quinoa . salt . tomatoes . vanilla . watermelon . wine . yellow peppers . zest of lemon . i left out radish v . rhubarb because i ve never had either , and the same goes for udon noodle v . ube .","300955":"avocados . blueberries , cucumbers . dragonfruit . elderberries . figs . ginger . hash browns lol . iced tea . jam . kiwi . lemons . mangoes .","300956":"i m answering questions from my inbox and listening to music at the moment . i m waiting for a text back from my friend to determine what it is i m going to be doing tonight , as well .","300957":"my day was all right not great , but at least i feel a little better than i did yesterday . i wasn t very productive due to my anxiety , but i managed to stay at work for the entire day , which made me proud of myself . also , a client emailed the company stating they loved the way their feature was written , so i got a congratulatory email from my boss since i wrote the feature . i m debating on either grabbing a drink with a friend tonight or staying in and working on some freelance assignments .","300958":"i think it s terrible . no animal deserves to d e just because someone hasn t adopted them yet . that s why it s so important to adopt senior animals because there are so many of them left in shelters and centers .","300959":"there is no living celebrity whom i d like to meet , unfortunately . all of the celebrities i idolized have since passed away .","300960":"i m not sure off the top of my head . ideally , i would like to eventually lose between pounds to get back to my ideal weight , which is what i weighed when i was in high school .","300961":"the only times i ve ever played tennis were during gym class in high school , haha . i wasn t the biggest fan of the sport then again , i m not a fan of pretty much any sport .","300962":"i m more like my father , thankfully . we re both analytical , academically smart , logical , and patient . the only bad thing i inherited from his side of the family was anxiety . nearly everyone on that side experiences it .","300963":"yeah , i was named after a family friend actually .","300964":"i m a writer and editor .","300965":"i ve been without one of my medications for a few days now , so my anxiety has been at an all time high . i was panicked and crying pretty much all morning .","300966":"song of the day easier by mansionair https www . youtube . com watch ? v ja iukelt w","300967":"cont . . . that i m queer . i recently had to teach someone on here what a qpr is because of straight , cis girls trying to be cute and fit in with lgbtq people and using our terms . ? ugh , that sounds so obnoxious . people who are straight cisgender who try to fit in with the lgbtq community normally have zero understanding of what it s actually like to be lgbt , just because they believe that being gay is trendy . . . for some odd reason . like , just because you have a stereotypically sassy gay best friend doesn t mean you re entitled to be part of the community . lmao .","300968":"i absolutely agree ! ! idk , i ve personally always felt weird calling myself queer even though i am bisexual , it s just one of those words that i feel like i m not qualified to use , if that makes sense ? ? especially because i m cis passing and i m in a relationship with a man , idk . but it happens a lot where a lot of straight people try to include themselves into the lgbtq community , i think it s sickening .","300969":"i really appreciate courrtana , so so much . she s such an amazing friend and i know i can always go to her with my struggles . she tries to take time out to check up on her friends even when she s not feeling well herself , and i think that needs to be appreciated more often .","300970":"i paid for a cup of coffee a few weeks ago , lmao . it was ridiculously absurd to pay that much money for coffee , but i felt like treating myself trying something new .","300971":"my boyfriend inspires me . he s endured so much adversity growing up and he s survived everything , and he continues to live his life to the best of his ability despite those struggles . he s never once spent time feeling sorry for himself , or if he has it was short lived , and he s the hardest working person i know , both in his personal and professional lives .","300972":"other people s opinions , specifically those of acquaintances or strangers . i used to worry incessantly about what people thought of me , but as i ve gotten older , i started caring less and less . if you cared about what everyone thought about you , then your brain would be in shambles . it s easier to go through life only caring about what you believe and think of yourself , as well as perhaps your significant other or a close friend .","300973":"i like my name , so i wouldn t have it be any other name .","300974":"usually late november early december to late march .","300975":"the only thing making me feel better today are filters and rose crowns .","300976":"i used to not be able to sleep with any noise in the background , but these days , it doesn t bother me . my boyfriend has three fish tanks in his room , so i don t even notice the sounds of the filters anymore or his fish thrashing around , rofl .","300977":"no , i ve surprisingly never felt that way before . people who know me or read my answers know that i m a straightforward person , so if i had something to say about a topic , then i would just message that person off anon or privately . i ve never been worried about being misconstrued as an obnoxious anon .","300978":"i ve always rolled my eyes at all of these weird orientations that have popped up recently , because i feel as if people are trying to slap the queer label onto something that doesn t necessarily have anything to do with being gay . sapios xual is one of them . most people are attracted to intelligence to begin with , so it s not out of the ordinary for people to look at someone and find them more attractive because they re either educated or highly intelligent . while education is indeed a privilege , you don t necessarily have to have a formal education in order to be intelligent either . sometimes it just comes naturally . at the same time , however , i couldn t care less how other people decide to label themselves because it doesn t affect my life at all . i ve just always thought the whole sapios xual label was a bit redundant .","300979":"yeah , quite a few times actually . needless to say , i broke off the friendships because i knew i didn t deserve to be used like how they were trying to use me . i m also somewhat going through the same situation now , again , but it s different because this person has been my friend for years and they ve only started exhibiting these behavioral changes within the past year or so . however , every time they re spoken to about what they re doing wrong , they just shrug it off and continue doing what they re doing . it s tiring and exhausting , and all of their friends are getting hurt in the process .","300980":"last night , i found beauty in the mundane . i saw my boyfriend , which obviously isn t unusual , but the conversations we had last night were beautiful , even though we were just talking about our days and what feelings we were experiencing . there s always a certain beauty in honest conversation , when you ve connected so intimately with a person that the dialogue flows more greatly than water and you understand each other on a deep , emotional level . on the surface , it just probably looked like two people having a conversation . however , it felt so much more than that and it was beautiful in my eyes .","300981":"i m probably not going to live that long to the point where i ll be unable to take care of myself . and if i do end up living that long , i hope i somehow d e so i never have to put that responsibility upon someone else .","300982":"i would rather explore the ocean . there s still so much we don t know about our own planet , and it s intriguing to me how even though we ve advanced so far technologically , we still don t have the resources or technology available to explore the deepest depths of the ocean .","300983":"i m not proud of the united states , so there s no picture for me to post . i would say that i m proud of the civic advancements we ve accomplished , but at the same time , we re also so far behind other countries and there is still a lot of discrimination that exists on a large scale level .","300984":"abandonment is my biggest fear , particularly from my boyfriend . i m always terrified he s going to get fed up with me and leave me unexpectedly , even though we ve been together for years .","300985":"the vampire chronicles by anne rice are really compelling , well written books . i also enjoyed the psychology behind i am not a serial killer by dan wells and the writing style of most of stephen king s books and short stories .","300986":"there is absolutely nothing good about my town . i really can t think of something worthwhile about this place .","300987":"two pillows when i m at my boyfriend s house , four pillows when i m at home . i love being surrounded by soft pillows and blankets and everything while i sleep .","300988":"yeah , i normally dream in color , as far as i can remember . i think that s a reason why i m so confused when i wake up because often i confuse my dreams with reality for a few minutes .","300989":"sometimes i wake up every hour , so i ll smoke marijuana or take some anxiety medications to sleep throughout the night . however , most of the time , my sleep is uninterrupted .","300990":"i ve been panicky and crying literally all morning . my anxiety is so bad that i just want to crawl into a hole and die .","300991":"song of the day movement by hozier . https youtu . be zk eizvgfw","300992":"people chewing , ugh . it s the most obnoxious sound ever . i cannot stand it .","300993":"i got stitches when i was in kindergarten , but i don t remember anything about it . i still have the scars , actually .","300994":"i play video games on the xbox one ! ! my favorite games are skyrim fallout , but i also really enjoy the destiny games , the halo games , the assassin s creed games , life is strange , the wolf among us , and the bioshock series .","300995":"yes , absolutely . there are so many people in this world that it s impossible to assume that there s no one out there who s compatible with you . chances are there are multiple people who are compatible .","300996":"yeah , that s how i feel about most of applebees food .","300997":"i don t remember . i m pretty sure they just fell to the ground and we abandoned them , lmao .","300998":"i have one name for a boy that i like , but idk about names for girls yet .","300999":"i m drinking coffee and watching the television show encounters with evil on netflix .","301000":"i only like moderately spicy food . anything too hot isn t appealing to me .","301001":"not really , no .","301002":"yeah , that theory is interesting too .","301003":"do conspiracy theories count ? ? lol . i like reading or watching videos about conspiracy theories , the weird twitter airplane voicemail thing , aliens , whether or not kurt cobain completed s icide , etc etc .","301004":"i don t follow any sort of sports teams or groups .","301005":"drinking coffee . if i could , i would drink coffee endlessly throughout the day . it doesn t have so much to do with the caffeine as much as it has to do with the taste . i absolutely love it .","301006":"if it s possible , i would eradicate all forms of oppression and discrimination , including stuff like racism , sexism , homophobia , transphobia , antisemitism , etc etc .","301007":"hello do you have a question ? ?","301008":"? or ? or ? , lol . i love those heart emojis the most .","301009":"to work in tandem with something means to work together with someone or something , usually in a close or well observed manner . i . e . if you re working on a joint project with a classmate where you both have to contribute and intertwine your ideas , hypotheses , and conclusions , then you would be working in tandem with them .","301010":"this past weekend was the last time i received good news even though other bad things were happening , ironically . my boyfriend has been struggling with his life for a while now , and he was only able to really admit to myself that he would feel better if he changed his ways slightly recently . we had a long discussion about his feelings and what to do to make him feel more fulfilled in his life , and he came to the conclusion that he should spend more time making experiences and generally enjoying life to work to live , not to live to work , if that makes sense . it made me happy because he seemed more motivated and hopeful just from having that conversation alone , and i want him to do what s best for himself .","301011":"i think it goes on a case by case basis . you have to ask yourself why they aren t improving it is a lack of motivation , are they going through a rough patch in their lives , or do they sincerely believe they re doing nothing wrong ? ? i m dealing with this situation myself rn , actually . sometimes it s better to distance yourself from people who see nothing wrong with their actions and don t want to improve because it can be detrimental to your own progress and well being .","301012":"my breaking point is when i have a full on mental breakdown or meltdown crying uncontrollably , wanting to throw things across the room , exploding at other people , isolating myself , etc etc .","301013":"i picked it up from my boyfriend , because he says this phrase a lot too it is what it is . it can be helpful in some situations where you cannot change the outcome , and the only thing you can do is deal with what comes next and make the most out of the situation .","301014":"there s nothing wrong with having roommates , as long as they re responsible and good with money . the two people we have in mind are extremely hard working , responsible people .","301015":"that s the only way we would be able to afford a house . my boyfriend and i have discussed it a house is a more ideal choice for us , but we would need roommates to keep afloat . we already have two people on board , so we ll see what happens .","301016":"it entirely depends on the reason why they re home to begin with . if they re not motivated and aren t actively working or going to school or anything , then i think the parents need to be strict with them and help them get their sh t straightened out . however , if they re actively working , or going to school , and generally trying to do what they can to make the most out of their life , then i see no reason for them to be kicked out . most of the time , people of that age don t want to live at home but they don t have any other choice , whether it s for personal , medical , or financial reasons .","301017":"my short term goals are to continue working extra hours to gain more money in the next few weeks , spend more quality time with my boyfriend , and eventually get a new tattoo . my long term goals are to move out into an apartment or a house with a few roommates , get promoted at work , progress further in my mental health recovery , adopt animals , and get married .","301018":"it s funny you mention that because i was just watching a docuseries entitled encounters with evil which discusses serial k llers thrill k llers and whether or not their inclinations toward violence are genetic or environmental . i think criminals who are the most evil though i don t really believe in the whole evil thing are the ones who k ll with no motive behind their actions whatsoever they hurt others just for the fun of it , and that s more terrifying that anything else .","301019":"i normally listen to a playlist . i don t generally listen to the same song over over again because i don t want to get tired of it .","301020":"i ve been obsessed with grandson for a really long time now , lol . he just came out with a new song apologize . https

ashamed or reserved about who i am .","301023":"usually when someone asks for advice . however , i ve also asked before if they want advice if they seem like they re looking for an opinion . i always make sure they re willing to hear suggestions , though .","301024":"garlic parmesan with ranch dip .","301025":"my coworker placed her mug on her desk too hard and it made me flinch today , lmao .","301026":"am i the only one in that virtual reality and does actual reality still exist outside of me ? ? if so , then i don t think i would enjoy being in virtual reality because i like remaining up to date with what s going on in the world , no matter how depressing it might be","301027":"i mainly answer questions , scroll through my feed , and like my friends answers .","301028":"hell yes ! !","301029":"by that logic , i can also claim to be north african . lmfao . i m pretty sure everyone s results say those things , though .","301030":"yes ! ! i very much enjoy your spam .","301031":"writing , playing video games , watching netflix , reading , painting , and hanging out with friends .","301032":"sometimes , especially when i m driving .","301033":"i found it really interesting ! ! especially the polish and portuguese parts .","301034":"i had a andme test done a few months ago , but i m not really too concerned about them sharing my dna because i have nothing to hide . however , i do believe it s ridiculous how those companies can sell your information to third parties like that . idk if the act of selling information should necessarily be illegal because you have to agree to it beforehand , but i do think it s wrong for insurance companies to reject you based on your results . thankfully i didn t take the health portion of the andme test .","301035":"i haven t seen it before either , i m guessing it s new . i love the blueberry one too .","301036":"yeah ! ! the little bodega in my office building sells them . it s peach nectarine its so friggin good .","301037":"not really , no . i want to make an appointment for my next tattoo , though . other than that , my boyfriend and i might go on a cruise next year ! !","301038":"thank you so much .","301039":"usually cheddar sour cream chips , hot cheetos , and cool ranch doritos . lmao .","301040":"this is a really ableist question , just so you know . there s nothing wrong with being admitted to a hospital for psychiatric issues , and no one is insane for doing so . i ve come close to admitting myself numerous times , so this sorta irks me . hospitals are meant to help you , not increase the stigma associated with mental illness .","301041":"i m doing well ! ! i got a hell of a lot of work done today i even worked through my lunch don t worry , it s extra money , so i feel super productive and accomplished . . . . i also drank a oz peach red bull , so that might be another reason why i m so amped right now .","301042":"i put comfy pajamas on , curl up in a blanket , and watch television . sometimes i have a beer or two .","301043":"i hate cleaning the bathroom and folding laundry . it takes so much out of me , lmao .","301044":"every time i go to , i feel compelled to just buy all of the snacks imaginable . it s a wondrous place for me .","301045":"of course . i m only human , lol .","301046":"they don t use the oxford comma . which annoys me to no end .","301047":"hello do you have a question ? ?","301048":"i took advil and went to bed early . however , i couldn t do much else the rest of the day so i was slowly dying at work .","301049":"yeah , i agree . i ve always followed the notion that if you re unhappy with a person , then you should tell them face to face instead of gossiping about them behind their back . that gets nothing done and the only way a conflict will get resolved is if there s communication .","301050":"it must be hard spitting on someone when you re an anonymous stranger using the internet .","301051":"the only pharmacy that has a drive thru is too far of a drive away from my house . my pharmacy is literally less than five minutes down the road . plus whenever i go , i usually need to pick up other items anyway so it works out .","301052":"i absolutely hate going to the pharmacy . half of the reason is probably because i used to work there , but i also hate witnessing customers yelling at the pharmacy technicians or the pharmacist for things that are out of their control . it makes me cringe so much .","301053":"honestly , my body is annoying the hell out of me rn . i got my period kinda late , so my cramps are even worse than usual and i just want to crawl into a hole and die .","301054":"try to take breaks at the same time as them ? ? lol . i have absolutely zero idea how to talk to people at first , it s so horrible .","301055":"this is true ! ! that s how i became friends with two of my other coworkers , as well as my boss lol . i wore a skyrim hoodie to work one day my boss pulled me to the side and was like , you play skyrim ? i ve been exclusively playing skyrim for six years straight . thus , a friendship was born .","301056":"because askfm is just as much of a hellsite as tumblr , lmao . but regardless of how problematic and annoying it is , i m hopelessly addicted to askfm .","301057":"bless this post . this is the best message i ve received all week .","301058":"i m in the same boat , unfortunately . i don t remember how long i ve been using askfm , but it s been a hell of a long time .","301059":"i m trying , but i m socially awkward . i ll just analyze from afar or wait until we run into each other in the office building somewhere . lmao .","301060":"i don t see why not it s not as if your friend is the person who committed the crime . you cannot change who your family is , so if he was born into a family where someone was a criminal , then there isn t much you can do about it . your friend is their own person first and foremost .","301061":"i m not sure why you sent this to me . i follow danny , so i saw his answer previously .","301062":"rofl . like , this girl has short black hair that s slicked back with gel . she wears skinny jeans and converse every day . she has oversized hoodies on or flannels nearly every day . maybe i m thinking too much into this . but my gay vibes are on fire .","301063":"there s this new girl who was just hired a few weeks ago my gay vibes are tingling . i know it s a radical assumption , but i m usually not wrong with my vibes tell me that someone is gay , which makes me want to befriend her . but i have no idea how . lmao . she complimented my hair last week and it sounded like she wanted to say more but stopped herself . so now i m stuck in this limbo where idk what to do , lmao .","301064":"no , i never have before .","301065":"i brought it up once like . . . over a month ago , lmao . the fact that you remember is albeit creepy , which is another reason why i kept deleting your questions .","301066":"i sorta feel the same way he does actually , which is why it doesn t bother me . i m nice to people in public obviously , but it doesn t mean i empathize with them on an emotional level . i either feel everything or nothing at all .","301067":"no matter how many times you ask me which has been at least , i m not going to answer this question . stop putting this in my inbox .","301068":"i know . that s why i said he had some traits , but not enough to meet the diagnostic criteria .","301069":"somewhat , yeah . he only empathizes with people he s personally connected to , and he feels nothing toward absolute strangers . he has no qualms about confronting a stranger and calling them out because he doesn t know them personally . as for the whole disregard for the law thing . . . lmao . yeah , he s had some instances in the past where it was fairly questionable . he likes to take matters into his own hands .","301070":"i think it s wrong to make assumptions on people based on a mental illness while the mental illness may explain an aspect of them , it doesn t define every facet of them , and no two people with the same disorder are alike . my boyfriend has questioned whether he has aspd , but he never went to a psychologist to inquire further about it . i think he has some traits , but not enough to meet the diagnostic criteria .","301071":"yeah , where i live plastic bags cost five cents each . the county implemented it in an effort to reduce plastic because of the effects it has on the environment .","301072":"generally speaking , yes . i try to retain an open mind and see things from other people s perspectives in an effort to understand where they re coming from and come to a mutual agreement . however , it does depend on the other person as well , because you can only do so much when the other person isn t cooperating or doesn t know how to come to a peaceful resolution .","301073":"i honestly have no clue . every year has it s ups downs , and was rather uneventful as a whole in terms of my personal life . i believe my best years are still ahead of me .","301074":"instead of buying bottles of water , i have a reusable cup that i use every day and it helps that my fridge has a filter in it . i bring my own bags to the grocery store so that i don t have to pay for plastic bags . i carpool with friends if we re going out instead of everyone wasting gas driving separately . i pack my own lunches and bring them to work instead of buying food at the cafeteria .","301075":"it used to be ideal in the past , but i believe times have changed and now it s the easiest method to divide a nation and turn each side against each other . the democrats blame the republicans , and the republicans blame the democrats . it s silly and childish , and i do believe there should be more options available or at least some reform regarding the political system as a whole .","301076":"i believe it means that if we get our heart broken , it does take us a bit of time to come to terms with the heartbreak and open ourselves up to the possibility of meeting someone new . however , our view on love is indefinitely changed from that experience , and we re constantly being shaped by our experiences with love , whether it s romantic or platonic . it s also a fact of getting older too . our perspectives on love change as we evolve into mature human beings , and values we desired in the past might not reflect who we are in the present or in the future .","301077":"the only time a brand s political stance pushes me away from endorsing or using that brand is when they exhibit opinions that directly oppress or discriminate against a group of people , whether it s racist or sexist or homophobic or transphobic , etc etc . i m also turned off when a brand explicitly states they re pro life .","301078":"this sorta coincides with my last answer regarding toxic masculinity , actually . the whole point of the commercial is to challenge toxic masculinity and give examples as to how men in general can improve , especially in terms of teaching their children how to behave instead of brushing off problematic behavior as boys will be boys . instead , people have misinterpreted the commercial to be an attack on men as a whole , and like i stated in my previous answer , it seems as if the only people who are offended by the commercial are those who feed into toxic masculinity because they re been so brainwashed by it over the years .","301079":"i think it entirely depends on the context it s in . because there are some instances where it s factually correct to say not all x do y . it s a simple fact of life , but there are also moments where people say that phrase as a means of backing themselves up if they re not making a valid point or they re using it as a scapegoat . i . e . not all men . when men become combative when people critique toxic masculinity , sometimes the whole not all men thing comes up . however , it s fully evident that it isn t all men who behave that way . however , the problem arises when there s such a societal expectation for men to behave in a specific way and that s what we re focusing on . the people who get offended by that are usually the ones who are feeding into those stereotypes .","301080":"it s a common phrase , but thankfully i ve never actually heard a person irl use it without being sarcastic . however , i mainly think it s a statement used by men who think they re nice guys , when really they re not as nice as they believe they are they re basically relying on that phrase to give themselves validation that they re right . instead of looking at themselves critically and wondering how they could do better .","301081":"it s all right tbh it gave me a backbone and taught me to allow other people s opinions and feelings to roll off my back . at the end of the day , they re the ones with the problem and i m under no obligation to take on that problem as my own .","301082":"it was a nightmare , but i had no experience and i was very young when i first got the job , so i didn t have much of a choice besides to work in retail . i can t tell you how many times i drove home crying or ran into the stock room to cry because customers were so cruel .","301083":"lol . sometimes when i m down , i feel that way . however , generally i have a realist outlook towards my own life and i understand that while sometimes bad things happen , you shouldn t let them define you or bring you down . the best thing you can do in those circumstances is understand that it s a bad moment , not a bad life , and you can persevere and rise above those challenges .","301084":"self doubt , my lack of confidence , and my anxiety and incessant worry over things out of my control . i m sure if all of those things magically disappeared , i would be a better , more fulfilled person .","301085":"i prefer frozen yogurt because it s generally healthier for you . however , i cannot resist chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream . which is why i seldom buy it .","301086":"a car , if that counts ? ? my second car got totaled when i got into an accident many years ago . granted , the accident wasn t my fault and there was virtually nothing i could do to avoid it , but it was probably the most expensive thing i ve ever broken .","301087":"when i do my proofreading , i mainly make sure the sentences flow well and aren t awkwardly placed , the grammar is correct , everything is consistent , and the entire piece follows ap style . i also fact check the pieces against the information it was based off of to ensure that everything is factually correct .","301088":"yeah , that pretty much defines the first years of my professional life when i worked in retail . i still can t believe i put up with that crap for so long . some of the customers were nice , but most of them were middle aged to elderly people who couldn t take no for an answer and had no idea how sales or coupons worked . i can t tell you how many times i got berated because a coupon was expired , a sale ended , they didn t buy enough items to qualify for the sale , etc etc .","301089":"plot twist i never learned how to ride a bicycle .","301090":"uh , taco bell . lol . i ordered a burrito off of their power menu , so it was expensive in terms of taco bell prices , but it was . . . so worth it .","301091":"i ve never worn braces , but i ve been thinking about eventually getting invisalign in the future .","301092":"i m sure there are some programs that don t incorporate religion into their meetings . it s all a matter of finding the right social worker and group of people who work out well for you .","301093":"depends on the values of the relationship . some people think it s a good gesture while others don t really care either way . a lot of people view it as a matter of respect .","301094":"you do realize sex and gender are two different things , right ? ? i m assigned female at birth sex but i m also non binary gender . there s nothing contradictory about that . as for therapy , we only touched upon it once or twice due to my body dysmorphia , but we mainly talk about what s happening in my life in the present moment relating my feelings to perhaps some moment in the past that would have influenced those feelings and behaviors .","301095":"i ve only ever sent nude photos to my boyfriend .","301096":"thank you","301097":"eventually , yeah . i cut down a lot already because i ve been vaping too .","301098":"because i wanted to comment on the person who thought she was my anon , obviously .","301099":"it s values are completely contrary to the customs and societal trends of western society . although i think it has a lot to do with the regions islam is most prevalent , i . e . the middle east , because the culture of the middle east largely influences the values of islam as well .","301100":"how do i appease anyone ? ? i don t even talk about anyone on my page . and if people mock me , they re sure not making it obvious or saying it to my face , which basically makes it worthless .","301101":"thank you ! ! it s from over the summer , but it s one of the only photos where you can really see my shaved head .","301102":"lol . absolutely zero dollars , unfortunately . what i wouldn t give to get rid of them .","301103":"i speak my mind all the time , lmao . half of my page is me giving my opinion on things .","301104":"i already have half of my head shaved , lol .","301105":"that s never happened to me before , so idk how i would react honestly .","301106":"i ve intervened in a verbal fight , not a physical fight .","301107":"yeah , definitely . when i was , i tried drinking alcohol for the first time because my friends had a bad influence on me , and i smoked marijuana for the first time when i was years old .","301108":"who would i even snitch to ? ? lmao . i m only surrounded by adults , and adults have the ability to make their own decisions .","301109":"tbh i don t even remember what prompted me to start smoking cigarettes . i remember i was years old when i started i was in college , but idk if one of my friends asked me if i wanted one or if i picked up the habit myself .","301110":"no , not at all . there are a lot of people who have never had the desire to smoke cigarettes .","301111":"anyone have any questions while i work on some freelance assignments ? ?","301112":"we don t talk outside of askfm or anything , and i think we only follow each other on instagram .","301113":"meh , not really . i was looking forward to finally having one of my meds again because there s been a bad shortage and i haven t had it for a week , but apparently it s still on backorder . ugh .","301114":"aw , thank you . i hope your day goes well too ! ! for the rest of the afternoon , i m planning on finishing my freelance work . then i m going to clean up a little bit and head to my boyfriend s house to watch the superbowl with him and his family .","301115":"this isn t an appropriate question to ask someone .","301116":"my day has been a bit wild , lol . i woke up early this morning , which was actually a great thing because my boyfriend ended up texting me and asking me to bring him insulin because he needed it at work he couldn t leave work . so i had to rush to bring him insulin prior to my doctor s appointment at am , which i thankfully made on time . since i got home from my appointment , i ve been working on some freelance assignments for my job .","301117":"yes . when i was in high school , i went from having hair that was a little longer than shoulder length to a very short pixie cut .","301118":"i ve always preferred shorter hair on myself , which is shorter than shoulder length . when my hair is longer , it becomes really limp and straggly and doesn t generally look good .","301119":"i m not entirely sure , which is why i ve kept this question in my inbox for a few days . the only good thing about focusing on what is going wrong is that it s easier to spot mistakes and correcting them accordingly . if we only focused on things that are going well , we might overlook the things that do go wrong and not be able to fix them at all .","301120":"to a degree , yes . i was raised surrounded by american culture , as well as the regional culture , so it s had an effect on my perspectives as well as my patterns of speech .","301121":"she has verbally physically abvsed me for as long as i could remember . she hasn t touched me since she became disabled because she s basically bedridden now , but she still verbally attacks me and my father on a regular basis .","301122":"depending on the situation , i may be able to sue them for negligence if they didn t tell me they had hiv at all .","301123":"i would rather fly to wherever i want to go , which is looking like either new england or somewhere down south , depending on which area i like better . i won t be able to thrive living where i am now because prices have been skyrocketing in new york in general , and my best option is to move out of state .","301124":"i believe most people needs love , to some degree , in order to survive . whether it s through family , friends , or their significant other . love doesn t always have to be romantic and it s super important to have a support system when you re struggling .","301125":"don t settle for anything less than what you deserve . if your partner , or a potential partner , shows any red flags for abvse or controlling behavior , then get rid of them . most people deserve to be in healthy , loving relationships where there is open communication and patience .","301126":"i m seldom happy with my selfies , which is why i rarely post them . however , a few of them do come out good , which are the ones i do post . i don t post selfies , or pictures in general , that i don t like . however , i m comfortable sending ugly selfies to my boyfriend , especially if it s over snapchat , lol .","301127":"i own a car . i never learned how to ride a bicycle .","301128":"i found out that someone i know was admitted to the hospital on friday because they had a flare up of their medical condition , and doctors can t figure out what s wrong with her . she s hopefully going to be released today , but i wouldn t be surprised if they keep her for another few days .","301129":"go to your local pet store and see if someone can help you in finding a medication that will treat her . or call your vet and tell them you can t afford to take her in and ask for advice . adversely , you can also see if the vet will set up payment plans for you instead of paying for the vet bill all at once .","301130":"drink coffee smoke cigarettes , lol .","301131":"i prefer water slides . roller coasters have always scared me .","301132":"i don t know who you re talking about , so no .","301133":"manipulated people to get what i wanted out of them by taking advantage of their kindness . i look back on those memories with regret , but unfortunately there s nothing i can do about it now . i was young and naive .","301134":"spending the day with my boyfriend is the perfect day for me , because it feels like a vacation away from home whenever i spend time with him and his family . whether we re just hanging out at home or spending time exploring parks or going to a winery or brewery .","301135":"i vaguely remember it , yeah . i was like years old , though , and it was more of a peck on the lips than an actual kiss .","301136":"i usually don t like celebrating my birthday . i don t advertise it anywhere to my knowledge , and if anything , i prefer small gatherings with friends where we just hang out for a few hours .","301137":"i don t really like either show , but i prefer rock morty .","301138":"courrtana and country peach mainly , but i have a few people added on other social media as well . i also keep in touch with liam steph , who both used to frequent askfm a long time ago .","301139":"no , not usually . only when i take selfies do i feel comfortable . otherwise , i m unhappy with the way i look .","301140":"the only language i know is english .","301141":"i went to alt . s not so silent night at the barclays center in december ! ! it was bastille , mike shinoda , muse , florence and the machine , death cab for cutie , ajr , and a few others . it was a great show .","301142":"i m in a constant state of exhaustion , so perhaps that s why .","301143":"try blocking them , if you haven t done that already . that way they won t be able to even send you questions in the first place . if they keep making new accounts , then the best thing you can do is ignore them . eventually they ll get fed up of you ignoring them and leave you alone at least in my experience , that s what i ve always done .","301144":"you re asking the wrong person . i m usually the last to find out when things are trending , lol .","301145":"i don t struggle with claustrophobia that severe , but try to implement breathing exercises into your flight so that you remain calm and grounded . if that doesn t work , then perhaps take a xanax or something .","301146":"no , i don t have any games on my phone . however , apparently you can play roller coaster tycoon on your phone now it s free ! !","301147":"i use snapchat occasionally , only for sending snaps to my friends though . i don t upload anything to my story .","301148":"i don t have an opinion because it doesn t affect my life .","301149":"no , neither of us are interested in that . the only sports he likes watching are ice hockey , basketball , and football .","301150":"i was excited to have a few drinks with my boyfriend s family tomorrow watch the superbowl , but due to some recent events , i don t think the family is going to be able to get together anymore . my boyfriend and i might just watch it by ourselves , though . we ll see .","301151":"no , if i was single then i would be uncomfortable with an arranged marriage . i m content with being my myself , and if my boyfriend and i were to break up , idk if i would be up to dating anyone else at all .","301152":"uh , serotonin .","301153":"it s been fine . i ran errands this morning and worked on some freelance assignments from the morning to the afternoon , then i basically laid in bed for four hours .","301154":"i only hang out with one person besides my boyfriend , and i try to see her once every week or once every two weeks .","301155":"no , not generally . thanks to the internet , i know a lot of people who are also non binary or trans and experience dysmorphia . i can also talk to some people in my life regarding these feelings if i m feeling down about it , so it isn t isolating much anymore .","301156":"i don t think anything exists that would make me smile for as long as an entire day . there are things that make me happy , yeah , but it s usually fleeting .","301157":"yeah , but his looks help too . lmao .","301158":"any sort of sales or customer service position . i hate speaking to people in general , and i absolutely hated talking on the phone with my last job .","301159":"if you re trying to kiss their ass , then maybe . i don t know why you would be in a position to do favors for your boss , though .","301160":"i answered this either earlier this morning or yesterday . i don t remember .","301161":"origamibirds is hilarious ! ! she just wasn t the first person to come to mind .","301162":"i don t have a sex drive right now , so it hasn t been a concern really .","301163":"hello friends ! ! anyone have any questions while i work on some freelance assignments this afternoon ? ?","301164":"lol , no . i ve never placed much faith in groundhog day at all .","301165":"i just looked her up as i ve never heard of her before just now , and i think i would support her . i only read the wikipedia article on a few of her stances , but she seems incredibly progressive . i also like the fact that she seems to have grown so much and has publicly apologized for her past , problematic views i . e . being pro life and homophobic in her early life instead of trying to pretend it never happened .","301166":"yeah , i just read that his reasoning behind supporting her was basically to prevent a trump administration from happening entirely . which , honestly , was the only reason why i voted for clinton to begin with . i didn t like clinton very much because i don t believe she s authentic , but i personally believe she would have been a better president than how trump has been behaving .","301167":"interesting . i don t know if i would vote for him if he ran for office , i would obviously have to check him against the other people who are running . from what i remember , i liked his policies back in , but since that time , a lot of people i know who used to like him have turned their backs on him i don t really know the reasons why . i d have to investigate further .","301168":"i don t think he s running , is he ? ?","301169":"i think he s around or so .","301170":"socialism is practical in theory , but it s translation to reality doesn t work out quite well , unfortunately .","301171":"i m sorry you re going through this . that s not fair for you or your mother to have to deal with someone like that . i hope you can get out of this situation soon .","301172":"my favorite part about january was my boyfriend s birthday ! ! we got together with a few of his friends for a gaming poker night , and we ended up playing ultimate chicken horse fibbage , which was a hell of a lot of fun . i haven t laughed that hard in ages . i m not really looking forward to anything in february besides making more money , since i ve been picking up extra freelance work every weekend .","301173":"it doesn t have anything to do with my confidence levels , because i don t need to be confident in myself in order to be comfortable bathing with him . like i said earlier , our relationship transcends physical appearance . regardless , neither of our houses have bath tubs and his shower is a single person standalone shower , so we haven t showered together in a very long time , lol .","301174":"yeah , i have absolutely no complaints . he takes care of himself , which is the most important . he also recently got a new tattoo which looks beautiful .","301175":"sounds like something you need to talk to your mother about . if your father is constantly lying to others about his family , then perhaps he needs some sort of intervention so that he realizes how much he s hurting his family .","301176":"i ask him all the time . he thinks my body type is beautiful , but he would also love me regardless of what i looked like at this point because our relationship transcends physical appearance . he also understands that what i think about myself is most important so he tries to help in whatever way he can to make me feel more comfortable with myself .","301177":"he s no exception . obviously i m comfortable in the nude around him , but it doesn t make me any less self conscious about my body .","301178":"wait , people actually get angry over the fact that work spouses exist ? ? lol . i ve never referred to someone as my work spouse , but i have developed close friendships with a few of my old coworkers , and i currently have like two coworkers with whom i m close as well . however , calling someone your work wife or work husband is really common and i never saw the big deal . they re not actually married to you , it s just a metaphor .","301179":"sometimes princess tal comes out with these spot on , hilarious answers out of nowhere amid her usual answers , and they have me dying every time .","301180":"it wasn t a real argument , but the last time my boyfriend and i bickered was a few weeks ago when he was insisting that journaling was not a word , and i had to explain to him that it was , indeed , a real word that people use . the conversation started out with me going like , i was journaling today ! in reference to the new mindfulness journal i received for xmas . so he was like , uh . . . don t you mean writing ? ? you were writing in your journal ? ? so i go , no , i was journaling . and it turned into a minute discussion on why journaling is and is not a word , lmao .","301181":"no , i dislike my voice a lot . it s a lot more higher pitched than i would like it to be and it sometimes sounds nasally especially lately , considering i ve been sick , lol .","301182":"i don t like being naked in front of myself , let alone other people . lmao .","301183":"my favorite place in new york is either upstate new york or montauk ! ! i like upstate new york because of the woods and mountains and landscapes everything is so beautiful and it s a much different environment than what i m used to . i also love going to montauk because it s such a quaint little town , everyone there is pretty friendly , and they often have music and food festivals .","301184":"there s also socialism , which basically infers that the means by which someone makes a living are shared by the whole community instead of individuals . everything is worked toward the greater good of the community and social classes are sought to be eradicated .","301185":"the biggest thing it affects is the way i perceive my body . i struggle with body dysmorphia , so how i envision myself or want myself to look is completely different from how i actually look , and it causes a lot of anxiety within me .","301186":"at this point in my life , i would rather be a joyful simpleton , lol . when you re too aware of your surroundings , the political climate , current events , etc etc . , it really has the capacity to bring you down and see the worst in everything . sometimes i wish i was blissfully ignorant .","301187":"i m doing fine ! ! i just got home from running errands , so now i m about to clear through some of my inbox on askfm before sitting down and working on some freelance writing for my job . i picked up a thicc iced coffee on the way home , so i m excited to drink it .","301188":"i used to live primarily in the past or focus too much on the future , but i ve really improved the past year or two in that i try to focus my energy on the present moment . it s been doing wonders for my mental health because it forces me to be grateful for what s going on at the current moment instead of worrying incessantly about the future or dwelling too much on things i can t change .","301189":"i ve never gone camping before , no . my boyfriend and i have always talked about doing it when the weather gets nicer , though ! ! there are a lot of campgrounds on long island .","301190":"i hope you were able to sleep after sending this message ! ! i never have trouble sleeping , thankfully . i usually fall asleep within minutes of laying down .","301191":"depends on the time of the year . i wear boots during the winter and sneakers basically the rest of the year .","301192":"doesn t sound like it s any of my business .","301193":"my day has gotten much better ! ! i was really upset when i got home from work , but i ve been at my boyfriend s house for a few hours now we re high and just watching ancient aliens .","301194":"lol . usually , yes . however , there are some people who genuinely don t know and want to be educated .","301195":"the latter . it basically means that i m not identifying as one of the gender binaries , which is man or woman .","301196":"i ve always had body dysmorphia and didn t feel connected to being a girl or a woman , but i didn t hear the term non binary until a few years ago .","301197":"i admire his work ethic , not the capitalist system itself . it s a shame that people have to work so hard in order to keep themselves afloat , but there isn t much else you can do these days .","301198":"it s been ranging between the single digits and degrees fahrenheit the past few days .","301199":"you re anonymous . however , i don t follow people upon request . i only follow a small number of people whose answers are thought provoking and entertaining .","301200":"friendship isn t something that can be forced . however , you re free to ask me questions .","301201":"as my bio indicates , i live in new york .","301202":"i hope y all aren t coming out of the woodworks to be nice to me just because an anon called me fat , lmfao . either way , thank you . much appreciated .","301203":"thank you ! ! i m surprised at how blue it is still , i dyed it before xmas .","301204":"aw , lol thank you","301205":"i ve been the same weight for about a year now , actually . but yes , i have gained weight within the past few years .","301206":"where have you been ? ? i constantly talk about the fact that i m fat . lmao .","301207":"fresh new selfie","301208":"i admire my boyfriend s work ethic . he s literally the hardest working person i know , and he s completely self motivated . he normally puts in hour weeks , but he also never stops moving even when he is home from work . sometimes i worry that he s going to run himself down , and i express that concern often , but i would rather him work too hard than not work at all unless he obviously had a valid medical reason .","301209":"i don t support the use of puberty blockers on children who are transgender . there s not enough research done on the subject puberty blockers can be detrimental to a child s development . climate change global warming is a real threat to the existence of this planet . i can t believe this is actually an unpopular opinion these days , but there are surprisingly a lot of people who don t think climate change is real . minimum wage needs to be raised in order to meet the standard of living for each respective region . the minimum wage is not a livable wage anymore . drinking alcohol every day is not healthy , and the glamorization of alcohol abvse in american culture and some other cultures around the world is damaging . people are in denial about their alcoholism because it s socially acceptable to drink every night . i don t support the self diagnosis of mental illnesses other than simple depression and anxiety . if you think you might have x disorder , then do everything in your power to see a physician . if you cannot see a physician , then do not claim to have that disorder .","301210":"everyone who struggles with depression needs something different , so what helps one person might not help another . love and support is a universal concept , but some people are comfortable with close comfort while others prefer help from afar . it entirely depends on the individual . if you have a friend or family member or loved one who is struggling with depression you want to help them , then ask them what you can do to make them feel more comfortable . communication is key .","301211":"this is a difficult question for me to answer because i ve never told my parents anything by default due to my rocky relationship with them . most of the serious things they know , they ended up finding out by accident or through someone else because i didn t tell them myself . or they went and searched it out through my private things .","301212":"lol . i don t believe that s how that works , anon . lmao . but i appreciate the sentiment .","301213":"no , i haven t done my taxes yet . i just got my w last weekend .","301214":"yes , climate change is very real it s changing at an alarming rate .","301215":"uh , no ? ? cashiers can t give things away for free , that puts their job at risk . they don t control the prices of items in the store .","301216":"i can act like a tourist for once y all can show me the cool coffee spots dive bars , lmaoo .","301217":"petition to fly courrtana back up to new york so that we can take a thicc road trip to canada to see her family and heartofstitches ! !","301218":"apparently my myers briggs personality type is infj .","301219":"i love sweaters , as long as they re a size too large and extremely cozy .","301220":"it depends on his work schedule . sometimes i don t see him until after pm because that s when he gets out of work , while other times i see him in the morning if i m off from work he goes into work late . he s an assistant store manager at a retail store .","301221":"they re in between generation x and the baby boomer generation .","301222":"he doesn t know when he s working on sunday , so i m not sure if i ll be able to see him for the superbowl . if he s home before the game , then we ll be watching it with his family .","301223":"i m a big fan of anything the punisher is in , so i ll probably watch it .","301224":"i m all right , although i m in somewhat of a bad mood because of certain things that just happened when i got home from work . i m just trying to figure out if i m seeing my boyfriend tonight , that s my only priority atm .","301225":"the only thing i forget , despite several reminders , is my boyfriend s work schedule , lol . he ll tell me like times per week what it is for the upcoming week , and i ll get every single day mixed up .","301226":"i ll look him up ! ! do you have any specific video recommendations ? ?","301227":"lol . yes , anon . you caught me .","301228":"people usually think i m younger than i actually am .","301229":"this is the sweetest thing , aw . i hope you re doing okay , friend","301230":"i think all of the k marts shut down , actually ! ! i m not entirely sure .","301231":"i ve never seen a movie by that name before .","301232":"how is that any different from the toilet in my house ? ? lol .","301233":"aw , thank you ! ! guaranteed it s the filter on the photo , though . lol .","301234":"nope , i haven t quit smoking yet .","301235":"aw , thank you","301236":"i woke up because i couldn t breathe then it was difficult for me to fall back asleep , that s why i was awake earlier .","301237":"i just don t like the fact that they exist at all .","301238":"i wish i had an answer for you . it s simply always been like this for me .","301239":"there s no snow where i live , lol . it s just been bitter cold , but it s supposed to be warmer today compared to yesterday .","301240":"around pounds , but that s based on what i weighed around six months ago . i haven t weighed myself in a while .","301241":"because they make me dysphoric and i ve always felt uncomfortable with them .","301242":"i d lose like pounds , get more tattoos , remove my breasts , and maybe grow a few inches taller .","301243":"lately i ve been avoiding looking at myself in the mirror because i absolutely hate what i look like .","301244":"yeah , mothers should absolutely be allowed to breastfeed in public . there s nothing wrong with feeding your child , and the main purpose of the breasts is to do just that . the only people who have an issue with breastfeeding in public are those who don t understand that concept , and they view breasts as a sexual organ more than anything else .","301245":"i m not afraid of the dark persay , but i do feel more comfortable when there s a small light on . i like being able to somewhat see in the dark .","301246":"lol , no . i have tattoos on my arms , legs , back , and torso .","301247":"my body feels foreign to me , like it isn t my own , and how i envision myself isn t remotely close to how i actually look on the outside .","301248":"no , quite the opposite . i don t feel comfortable in my body at all .","301249":"if it works for them , then i support it . i don t judge other people s relationships , though . as long as everything is consensual and there s communication , then there s nothing wrong with having an open relationship .","301250":"you can literally just look them up on youtube , lol . i m watching on my tv rn .","301251":"so i m finally watching shane dawson s conspiracy theory videos i m fucking shook y all .","301252":"i saw that answer too felt the sarcasm seeping through my bones .","301253":"i ve never been fired before , no . but it s just something i ve always been afraid of happening .","301254":"it depends on how bad the snow is . sometimes i take the risk , while other times i ll just call out of work and tell them i can t drive in . i know i won t get fired , but i m also coming from the position where i always think i ll get fired , so i always do whatever possible to show my face and prove my worth .","301255":"i try not to whenever possible . however , sometimes i have no choice like when i have to go to work .","301256":"i don t personally believe so . just because you don t feel sexual attraction doesn t mean you re queer or part of the lgbtq community . it s lack of a sexual attraction , not a sexual attraction that deviates from what s been socially acceptable . if you want to really get into it and talk about romantic orientations , and if an ace person has romantic attractions to people that selects them for inclusion in the community , then maybe they do belong there . however , i ve never given much credit to such micro attractions because i don t personally feel like there should be a need to label everything .","301257":"i think it still has a use , yeah . you can describe people s behaviors and personalities without applying mental illness to the equation . behavioral psychology is really just the study of why people behave the way they do , what factors in their environments and genetics influences that , and what we can do to cope with or reverse behaviors . sometimes it has nothing to do with mental illness , and we need both behavioral and clinical psychologists to differentiate the difference .","301258":"i totally understand where you re coming from . ideally another word should have been created , but at the same time , racism isn t taken nearly as seriously as it should so it doesn t surprise me that nothing has happened .","301259":"to a degree , yes . why , do you have a question regarding the topic ? ?","301260":"move on with your life . danny is one of the most open minded tolerant people i know , so if he blocked you , he must have had a damn good reason to do so .","301261":"definitions aren t absolute . they may have existed to define an ideology at one point in time , but like all other forms of linguistics , definitions change as society changes . language is constantly evolving , so we have to change our definitions of things as society evolves . from my understanding of it , racism refers to the systemic oppression of races which doesn t include white folk , because in most cases of history , white people were the ones who were performing the oppressing , not being oppressed themselves . that s why racism refers to the oppression of races other than white . obviously white people still face discrimination , but those are isolated incidents compared to the grand scheme of things .","301262":"no , but calling someone i know a shemale and saying she fcks dogs is probably some of the most insensitive sht i ve seen . you can kindly unfollow me .","301263":"no , i don t . i probably should , but i never bought them .","301264":"unless they meant reverse racism , which . . . also doesn t exist .","301265":"i ve never watched bet , so i have no opinion . i don t think there s such a thing as reverse segregation though , lmao .","301266":"no , i ve never heard of that before .","301267":"my day was fine . it was awfully cold this morning , so i froze while getting into work , but the rest of my work day was all right . i had a few projects to work on , so it kept me occupied . i got home from work two hours ago so i ve just been scrolling through social media and whatnot since then . i was on my laptop , but now i m going to find something to watch on netflix .","301268":"even if it s not a good raise , it s still a raise it s more than what you would be making had you never asked beforehand .","301269":"doesn t matter if it s retail or not more responsibility equals more pay . this happened to me a lot with my last office job , they even gave me the title of senior writer without even hinting towards a raise . and i didn t say anything because i was terrified that i would get fired . really , you should say something .","301270":"thank you ! ! my best friend also swears by that elder berry stuff because it s all natural , but i don t know much about that either .","301271":"lol yes . when i worked at the drug store , we sold them or something similar . it was wild . but it s supposed to really drain out your entire system , so allegedly it helps a lot .","301272":"i m pretty much done with this cold thank god , but i ll definitely look into it the next time it happens ! ! thank you sm .","301273":"oh , rofl . i never take cold medicine honestly , i used to get way too drowsy when i was a teenager so i stopped using it . i just stick to nasal spray , ibuprofen , tea , etc etc .","301274":"no , i don t have the flu . i just have a cold .","301275":"i certainly hope i will . i can breathe a lot better today , so i m hoping that i won t wake up every hour like i have been the past few nights .","301276":"uh , i assume you meant something , not someone , lol . but i ve been in that position many times before at previous jobs . if they re giving you more responsibility , then ideally , they should be evaluating you for a raise in pay . ask your immediate supervisor what you should do in order to be set up for a formal evaluation , because you really should be paid more if they re giving you more work to do on top of the work you already do .","301277":"i live in new york , but uh , my best friend lives further north than i do , lol . i m fairly certain it s

especially in cases where trying to solve the problem will only aggravate the problem further .","301282":"lmao , what . there s no such thing as fake news unless it s something that s completely untruthful . none of those sources report false news . obviously they do have their own individual bias , since no news media is unbiased , but that s why i read things from multiple sources instead

expression blood is thicker than water , because they wholeheartedly believe that family is the best thing regardless of how you re treated by your family that you should adhere to your family s

avocado spread if they have it available . if they don t have avocado , then i usually ask them to put a small amount of ranch dressing on the sandwich .","301289":"it depends entirely on my mood how i m feeling that day . sometimes , it s easy for me to accept the past , while other times , i have no control over those feelings and i find myself in a constant state of reflection . those are the times that my depression gets worse , because i often get stuck in that mindset that nothing will change and nothing will get better .","301290":"fuck , the sun is going down that means that my driving anxiety is going to get x worse because i can t see well at night people drive even more like assholes at night .","301291":"the first thing i do when i wake up in the morning is take my medication . i always have it right next to my bed .","301292":"i m more prone to sensory overload , but generally speaking , yes . sometimes i experience information overload while i m at work because so much information and data is thrown at me all at once , so i have to really sit there and calm myself down so that i can process everything in an organized manner .","301293":"yes , i m quite concerned about the state of the environment . everything humanity does affects it to some degree , which is why climate change is so relevant right now .","301294":"i tell my boyfriend good

lol . i ve always loved the look of moss on tree trunks and the earth .","301320":"i think it depends on a lot of factors , not solely the fact that they re raising their child to eat vegetarian food . it also has to do with whether or not they re open to the child exploring other tastes if they express the desire to do so , how strict they are with food intake , etc etc . that changes whether or not it can be a positive or a negative thing . i think it can be positive if parents are open minded and are willing to allow their child to explore meat and dairy options if they want to down the time , as long as they re not strictly enforcing the lifestyle upon their child .","301321":"yes , they definitely can ! ! you can still have the diagnosis , but if you haven t exhibited symptoms for

.","301324":"i would ask what the purpose of my childhood was when it ultimately destroyed me and almost ended my life . i know that life is unfair and that sometimes things happen without a clear cut reason , but i ll never understand why things happened to me that should not have happened , things that could have been avoided , things that have messed me up for the majority of my life .","301325":"love can never overheat , although it can be extinguished . love has always appeared to me as a burning flame , and it grows the more you feed it . as for your second question , i ve always wanted to have a bonfire in the middle of a clearing in the woods .","301326":"my emotions are at war when i have to make a decision that will hurt someone in the process . i can t sit here and continue living my life the way i ve been living it because i deserve better , and sometimes that means distancing myself from people in my life who are toxic . it s going to hurt them , but i need to

re looking for if they cut me off while driving ? ? lmao . that makes zero sense . i m not going to risk getting into an accident by making it known that i m angry on the road . that s irresponsible .","301370":"i don t remember , haha . i always liked latin , even though i don t know the language well , so i wanted something that represented my love for poetry the moon .","301371":"aw , my baby .","301372":"i think about my safety and the safety of the drivers around me . i m not going to put myself or someone else at risk of an accident just because i m angry at another driver . also , a lot of people look for the validation that they angered you , so i always thought it was funny if they were to look into my car and just see me singing away as happy as could be , even if i am annoyed .","301373":"i prefer moderately spicy food , somewhere in between . i like non spicy food as well , though .","301374":"no , i just try to make sure i m driving as safely as i possibly can .","301375":"i get enraged when i drive , but i m not vocal about my rage . lmao . i just simmer on the inside , otherwise i ll get too distracted . however , nearly all of my pet peeves have to do with driving people who are in the left lane drive too slow , people who cut you off without using a blinker , people who slow down completely to watch an accident on the side of the road , and people who think it s okay to cut across three lanes of traffic and assume everyone else will be responsible .","301376":"around hours , i think . smh .","301377":"my life has been substantially easier since i started medication , actually . before i was on meds , i was less than human . i was a hollow shell of an individual . however , i ve been on medication for years at this point , and my motivation is at its highest its ever been and i can actually live my life .","301378":"no , i absolutely hate the summer . i prefer cold weather over warm weather . it gets too hot and humid where i live .","301379":"lately i ve been sleeping on my back with my head propped up , otherwise i drown in mucus . but otherwise , i like sleeping on my stomach with one arm under my pillow , one arm extended outward , one leg extended , and one leg bent halfway .","301380":"i seldom lose my temper , thankfully . the last time i got angry was last week , but i didn t lose my temper . instead , i walked away from the situation so that i didn t aggravate it more .","301381":"thankfully , i ve never had any major cooking failures . every time i have made a dish , even though it s a bit rare , it came out fine normally pasta , breaded chicken , etc etc . however , i absolutely cannot learn how to microwave popcorn perfectly to where it s not burnt and where there aren t many kernels leftover . i end up wanting the most out of the bag , so i put it in longer than what it says , and it burns . lmao .","301382":"it s currently degrees fahrenheit , and it s cloudy and gray . it s supposed to rain later tonight . i prefer cold weather over hot weather , definitely . i would rather be chilly than sweating , and it s so much cozier to bundle up as opposed to wear nearly nothing to withstand the heat .","301383":"obviously people who are manipulative are terrible people , especially if they re purposely trying to alter someone s perspective or behavior to benefit their own good . it s selfish and demeaning .","301384":"lol , not usually . i only get enraged when i m driving behind slow cars . i can understand people walking slow if they have a disability or injury , so it doesn t usually bother me . i just try to get in front of them as quickly as possible .","301385":"yeah , i totally agree with you . plus , i recall in the books that their relationship went into much more detail , and it was sorta glanced over briefly in the movies and that was all .","301386":"it could be better . i woke up at am because i couldn t breathe i couldn t go back to sleep . i dragged myself out of the house to go to work , but i became so sick over the course of the morning that i ended up leaving work early . i m home now and i m drinking tea in an attempt to feel better . i m going to take some aspirin to make my fever go down . i hate feeling sick , because mentally , i m motivated and want to get things done , but my body won t cooperate .","301387":"i m sure you already got this answer multiple times , but the first character that comes to mind is hermione granger from the harry potter series . in the books , she s described as a generally unattractive , mousy girl with kinky brown hair , and the series is focused on her intelligence as opposed to her looks . there s one point where she transforms so much during a formal occasion that the entire rest of the characters are shocked that it s her . in the movies , they cast a very pretty young girl emma watson who grew up to be an attractive woman , which sorta offset the character development in a way .","301388":"i ve only ever gotten a nosebleed perhaps times throughout my life . if it s happening routinely , though , i would seek medical attention .","301389":"most anon questions are trollish or hateful , and i don t think people should be awarded coins for that nonsense . the coins are to encourage people to send out interesting questions off anon .","301390":"usually small , insignificant things . songs that aren t inherently sad , that s the main one for me lately . it also depends on whether or not i ve been compliant with my mood stabilizers , because otherwise i ll start crying for no reason at all .","301391":"it wouldn t bother me . if i know that i m good at a game , then it doesn t matter what other people think . you have to let things roll off your back sometimes .","301392":"yes , absolutely . your safety is much more important than you attempting to show up to work in hazardous conditions .","301393":"is this supposed to be in reference to something , or are you talking about manipulative people in general ? ?","301394":"it can , but it isn t recommended . i don t have wheel drive .","301395":"people seem to think that i m a lot younger than i actually am .","301396":"no , i don t gamble at all . i never saw the point in it .","301397":"no , i ve never seen that movie before .","301398":"bath bomb . chocolate . soup only because i ve never had ramen before . tattoos . cotton . novel . map . comic book .","301399":"i worked retail for four years when i was a bit younger . i don t really remember what the silliest question was , but i do remember a lot of customers getting irrationally angry over the fact that we didn t take expired coupons or coupons that weren t for the items they purchased . some people even told us they left the coupons at home , but still wanted us to apply them anyway . it was ridiculous .","301400":"a criminal who blends in with everyone else is scarier , in my opinion . they re usually calm , collected , and intelligent . you can t imagine them committing the crimes they ve committed , but they have that beast within them locked behind closed doors and can release it whenever they feel like it .","301401":"my boyfriend and i took a small weekend vacation to the northern fork of long island last month with his family . we didn t do anything special , just went bowling and then hung out in the hotel room . then the next day we went to a brewery .","301402":"cockroaches are the only bugs that bother me , surprisingly . i think it s because i had to deal with them a lot whenever i visited someone s house , though . it always grossed me out .","301403":"i like my boyfriend .","301404":"in general , i don t usually care about what tattoos people get as long as it makes them happy . however , face tattoos are a really risky move for obvious reasons and the only redeeming factors are if the tattoos are done well . that being said , the tattoo honestly looks horrible . she could have gotten a better artist to do a realism portrait instead of something that looks like an amateur unfinished sketch .","301405":"saturday night . i decided i wanted to drink , so i went to the gas station at pm to buy beer .","301406":"i m honestly an open book , lol . i m always willing to talk about my feelings .","301407":"not very far . i ve only traveled from new york to texas .","301408":"my inbox is empty so y all should ask me questions","301409":"you re anonymous . i don t follow people on demand , though .","301410":"i am absolutely the most boring person in the world i also hate how i look and sound on camera . no thanks .","301411":"yes , exactly ! ! that s another great point . the amount of times i ve blacked out is terrible , and it s scary that you don t remember what you said or did .","301412":"sounds like the show cops in the united states , lol . it s ridiculous . the main issue i have with binge drinking and the culture surrounding alcohol in general is that it gives off the impression that drinking in excess on a regular basis is somehow normal and safe . it isn t glamorous to drink every night , especially considering most people don t know how to only stick to one drink . it s caused a lot of confusion with my own alcohol consumption because for a long time , i thought my consumption wasn t an issue . it wasn t until i started drinking in excess times per week that i realized it was problematic .","301413":"ah , that makes sense ! ! yeah , binge drinking is seen as the norm in the united states , which is absolutely terrible .","301414":"for the most part . sometimes my anxiety gets in the way of that , though .","301415":"backstabbing me by talking sh t about me to someone else while lying to my face and pretending to be nice . i could never tolerate that .","301416":"i always liked the name louis for some reason .","301417":"i somewhat agree , but i also disagree at the same time if that makes sense . i think anything that s militant is generally bad because it s extremism , and most people who are militant wind up being extremely ignorant , close minded , and unwilling to accept viewpoints that are contrary to their own . that being said , i also believe that antifascism is obviously better than fascism . i don t really know what a militant antifascist would look like because all you re really advocating for is the disassembling of a government which reigns supreme .","301418":"i disagree with the statement . on a metaphorical level , it can refer to the idea that people who are cautious to trust others are only closed off to people who are honest or willing to help them . however , coming from personal experience , it s somewhat of a good thing to be hesitant to trust people because you simply do not know their intentions . there are honest people out there , sure , but there are also others who only wish to harm you . the honest people will understand your need for privacy .","301419":"i prefer chips , especially sour cream cheddar chips ! ! i also like dipping lays potato chips into french onion dip .","301420":"strangely enough , the show you moved me and made me critically think about a lot of different things . i was also inspired by beck s passion for writing and she definitely encapsulated the feelings of being a writer who wants to pursue their passion but also feels the need to gain new experiences in order to write something . the show inspired me to write my own short story , which i recently published on medium . com . granted , it s a bit dark but not as dark as the show , haha , but the overall tone of the show was influential to me .","301421":"lol . that s too funny . i don t see anything wrong with eating food that s more geared toward younger audiences , like spaghetti os or sugary cereal . hell , my favorite cereal is captain crunch and i eat it every so often still , lol .","301422":"my relationship has certainly been interesting because we ve been together for years . when we were both years old , we needed something completely different out of our relationship than what we need now . back then , we needed someone who was fun , spontaneous to the point of impulsivity , full of passion , and always willing to take on a challenge , no matter how risky it would be . since we ve matured , our needs have also matured and what we used to need eventually disappeared and re appeared as newer , more responsible necessities . emotional maturity , loyalty , a willingness to work hard to earn a living , diligence , responsibility , and holding the idea that we must move on from our past to pursue a better future .","301423":"red is the warmest color to me because i associate it with my boyfriend the most out of any color . although red can represent wrath in some cases , it also represents compassion , love , passion , empathy , comfort , etc etc . he personified all of those ideals .","301424":"ugh , yeah i agree with that opinion . it s disgusting how middle aged people will find it somehow okay to maintain an interest in people who are either underage or just barely adults . even though it s legally okay once they turn , it s still a red flag for abvse . most people who are much older than their partners like that i m talking about people who are under dating people are dating them for the power play and the fact that they can easily take advantage of them .","301425":"that s interesting i never knew that before . i don t really see the reason why there s such a split because they all get you drunk either way , but i m also basing this off of the american idolization normalization of alcohol abvse since it s all i ve ever known . i m sure alcohol consumption isn t glamorized as much in other countries as it is in the united states .","301426":"yeah , that used to happen to me a lot when i used to frequently ask questions here . i ended up writing them down in the notes section of my phone so i could remember when i had the spare time to ask them .","301427":"like the versatility of the landscape , how i can go from beautiful woods and isolation to urban cities in just an hour or so . i like the vineyards of long island and everything in montauk as well . dislike the high prices of everything , including rent and mortgages and whatnot . taxes are incredibly high too . people don t get paid enough to sustain a life here .","301428":"a spa retreat with her friends ! !","301429":"thank you ! ! i ll definitely have to take a trip down just to see , my boyfriend and i were talking about it yesterday actually .","301430":"i m debating on either new england , like vermont or massachusetts , or somewhere down south like north carolina or virginia .","301431":"i like the name leigh , yeah .","301432":"i don t really have any advice because freelancing sort of fell into my lap , i didn t actively seek it out .","301433":"no , i generally don t mind mondays . i just didn t want to go into work because i m sick .","301434":"filet mignon and smoked salmon .","301435":"no , my monday has been sh tty . i ve been sick all day so it was hard to get through work . i m looking forward to sleeping tonight .","301436":"obviously not , lol .","301437":"thank you so much . it s something i don t really talk about because i don t want to receive anon hate because of it . but i really wanted to post about his tattoo because of how proud i am rn .","301438":"i don t like dancing , so none .","301439":"i walked two miles on the treadmill and worked out my arms and legs afterwards , rotating my arms and my legs every other time i went .","301440":"i went to the gym times per week .","301441":"i don t have any magnets on my fridge , actually .","301442":"yes , i think rats are adorable ! !","301443":"there s no such thing as the countryside where i live , lol . however , i do like walking in various parks .","301444":"i lost pounds in one month earlier last year .","301445":"i haven t had the motivation lately . i ve been exhausted by the time i get home from work these days .","301446":"i drive a hyundai .","301447":"i only check my phone for notifications when i receive them , so it depends on how active my social media accounts are that day . when it comes to askfm , i only check it when i get multiple questions in a row or when i m simply bored by the end of the day .","301448":"i never learned how to skateboard when i was younger , no .","301449":"no , i ve never owned a jeep before .","301450":"i don t have a preference . i m neutral on them .","301451":"no , why would that be wrong ? ? everyone has their preferences .","301452":"i m sick , so it s difficult for me to get comfortable .","301453":"it s only midnight where i live . although i have been laying in bed , just haven t been able to actually fall asleep .","301454":"ahhh ily toooo .","301455":"hello i am here willing to answer questions .","301456":"my boyfriend got a tattoo today i m so proud of him because it s in recognition of his sobriety , and i feel like addicts don t truly receive the recognition they deserve for remaining sober despite the culture that exists today that basically celebrates and down sizes substance drug abvse . idk i m just so proud of him . he s been through so much i m happy that he s celebrating his sobriety and recognizes that strength within him .","301457":"i don t really use wifi anywhere except my house and my boyfriend s house .","301458":"you have to remember that people only post about their successes not their failures . none of your fb friends are perfect and they have their own hardships and struggles . if it makes you feel bad , then either delete your fb or hide their posts from the timeline .","301459":"zero . i already get enough notifications as it is , i don t want to add any more . if i m interested in catching up on someone s answers , then i ll just visit their page .","301460":"yeah , i wholeheartedly believe that people should have to retake their driving tests every years or so . the elderly get into so many accidents because their senses are deteriorating , and it simply isn t safe .","301461":"i finally succumbed . i finally have fallen sick in light of the rest of my office fighting sickness . i can t breathe or regulate my body temperature , my nose is running , my throat is aching , and i m more tired than ever even though i can t sleep . send me questions to distract me plssssss .","301462":"ahh , i haven t ! ! i totally forgot about it tbh . i haven t been much in the mood to play video games these past few days .","301463":"yeah ! ! they usually love crickets and mealworms , and because she s gotten so big , we ve been feeding her hornworms lately too they re really large , squishy blue worms . as for other food , we normally make her a salad with kale and bell peppers . she s really picky though , she doesn t like bananas or blueberries . however , she did enjoy mango when i tried feeding it to her a few months ago ! !","301464":"i m never around young girls , so i m not familiar with the concept . bugs have never grossed me out , though . especially considering i feed bugs to my boyfriend s bearded dragon on a regular basis .","301465":"uh , what . what do bugs have to do with being years old ? ?","301466":"damn , y all are making me feel old , lol . i know i look young , but being isn t exactly an old age either .","301467":"warm compresses , i would assume . i usually just pop them , but i know that isn t exactly the healthiest thing to do .","301468":"i m years old , lol . i ve been an adult for quite some time .","301469":"uh , you re still a minor if you re under the age of . considering i m a full grown adult , i wouldn t want children reading content regarding sxx on my page . it s also against the terms conditions of askfm .","301470":"i have no idea what this is referring to i m assuming you re responding to one of my statements where i said i don t discuss my sxx life on askfm ? ? if so , then no . i don t hate sxx . i just find it inappropriate to discuss it on a website where the minimum age to join is years old .","301471":"i ve never been the type of person to obsess over or judge names . the only time names concern me are when i m picking out names for characters in a story i m writing .","301472":"my weekend has been all right . yesterday , i worked on some freelance writing and did loads of laundry and cleaned . i also got drunk by the end of the night , lol . this morning , i woke up around am for some reason , but noticed that my boyfriend was awake because he couldn t sleep all night . so i went over his house and spent time with him before he went into work this afternoon . since coming back home , i ve just been scrolling through social media and drinking coffee , and i also spent about minutes cleaning the house .","301473":"depends on what the subject matter is , haha . you re free to ask me any question , though , and if i find it inappropriate then i ll simply delete the question .","301474":"no , i ve never streamed before , lol .","301475":"no , i don t .","301476":"no , i ve never had a desire to have a one night stand .","301477":"i don t own pubg . i also have no interest in playing video games with random people .","301478":"burlington , vermont ! ! it was such a quaint little town .","301479":"no , i went to public schools .","301480":"i don t follow people upon demand . thanks for the follow , though .","301481":"i prefer pubg . it s more realistic .","301482":"if that s what he wants to do , then who cares . it s his life .","301483":"i have no desire to leave the united states , at least not to move there permanently . i ve never traveled to a different country before , so it would be a big leap to suddenly move somewhere i ve never been to before .","301484":"no , i plan on moving out of state when i get an opportunity to do so . i was leaning more toward the southern united states , but now i m unsure as to whether i still want to do that or go somewhere more north in new england .","301485":"it depends entirely on the individual . everyone i ve dated was different in their own respects , so it s difficult to compare them based solely on their gender .","301486":"i suppose a town , although i never really saw the difference between a town and a village . i live in the suburbs .","301487":"yeah , i ve only been in three relationships . one with a woman and two with men .","301488":"yes , i m bisexual .","301489":"yeah , my first relationship was with a girl actually .","301490":"no . if you want to know something about me , then just ask me .","301491":"i don t discuss my sxx life on askfm . however , i ve been in a relationship for years . you do the math .","301492":"i m always honest , lol .","301493":"as my bio indicates , i live in new york .","301494":"i don t see why it wouldn t be okay . however , you do have to be cautious regarding people on social media because you re not percent certain that they are who they say they are . don t trust them immediately and , instead , develop an understanding of them through regular discussions before investing your emotions into them .","301495":"hello do you have a question ? ?","301496":"i d rather go the extra mile for someone or something to prove my compassion rather than sit back and assume that they re aware of my feelings and commitment . you should never stop trying to show your love for whatever you love in your life .","301497":"this is an incredibly vague message , so i don t really have a concise idea as to how to help you . if you did something wrong that put a bad spotlight on you , the best thing you can do is own up to your mistake and vow to never do it again , as well as take the appropriate actions to right that mistake to the best of your ability . management likes seeing people take responsibility for their actions , it shows commitment as well as maturity . in some cases , they might not care but it s better to err on the safe side rather than do nothing about it .","301498":"to be fair , i m moody regardless of how much i sleep , lol . my mood stabilizers have fixed it for the most part , but i do experience some mood swings here and there depending on what i m going through .","301499":"cleaning up poop or other messes they ve made , especially if it s somewhere in the house . however , i never saw that as a big deal because that s the responsibility you take on when you decide to adopt an animal , and it s percent worth it .","301500":"yes ! ! lol , every time i have an exciting event coming up , i always note how far away the event is because it makes me more excited . i always thrive when i have things to look forward to .","301501":"i have the capacity to be fairly patient , yes . people have told me in the past that i m perhaps too patient , but i do believe that good things come to those who wait while putting the time and effort into reaching those goals .","301502":"life isn t complete without experiencing it with someone you love by your side , whether that s a partner or close friend or family member . we re all in need of a support system .","301503":"i left my boyfriend s house this afternoon because he had to go to work , and as i was pulling out of the starbucks drive thru , i see him slowly driving down the road i was turning onto we stared at each other for a solid seconds . lmaooo . i ended up texting him when i got home like , that was definitely you right . and he went , lmao yes . yes , it was .","301504":"i don t like sports at all , but i watch ice hockey from time to time . i suppose my favorite athlete would be henrik lundqvist .","301505":"no , i disagree . bpd is a highly misunderstood disorder , and personally , my intense emotions have always made life even more difficult to deal with , and i wish i didn t experience these feelings as intensely as i do . even small , insignificant things affect my mental state and it s always exhausting . even though i m in treatment , i still have relapses in my thought patterns and i still struggle with self destructive behavior , and i wouldn t wish bpd on anyone .","301506":"i can t think of any games at the moment , actually . obviously there s the elder scrolls vi , but no one has any idea when that s going to be released .","301507":"depends on what kind of rum you buy , there are all different types and flavors . i like dark rum kraken and malibu coconut rum .","301508":"yes , i can . i ve been using a computer regularly since i was a child , so i ve learned how to type efficiently .","301509":"lust is a physical attraction you have towards someone upon meeting them . lust is superficial and is expressed through carnal desires . love , on the other hand , runs much deeper than lust . love is when you know of a person s flaws and still cherish their existence in your life . love is being able to say that you would take a bullet for someone if it meant saving their life . love is believing in the best in a person and helping them work towards becoming the best version of themselves they can be .","301510":"i d like to believe i am , yes . i don t speak of other people s issues that they ve told me in confidence and i always try to be available to my friends if they need my help .","301511":"i prefer dramas , suspense , thrillers , etc etc . my favorite writers are stephen king , anne rice , george orwell , franz kafka , pablo neruda , and susanna kaysen .","301512":"i take medication attend therapy sessions .","301513":"use english whenever possible speaking it , reading it , and writing it . watch tv shows and movies in english to develop a better understanding of the language read books in english as well . you won t get better at a language if you don t practice it every day .","301514":"it never stained because i cleaned the spills up fast and used stain remover . i m somewhat accident prone , though . i don t have any injuries from accidents but i do trip over my own feet a lot , lmao .","301515":"uh , it s after the holidays at this point , lol . i don t normally ask for gifts these days . i just wish for time i can spend with my boyfriend close friends .","301516":"ugh , yes i ve spilled coffee on furniture before as well as on my own floor , lol .","301517":"i m currently making breakfast and having coffee with my boyfriend .","301518":"hello yes , i m fine .","301519":"yes , reading is one of my favorite hobbies . i haven t picked up a book in ages , though .","301520":"yeah , i have borderline personality disorder .","301521":"depends on their intentions . if they re expecting people to buy things or donate money , then i think that s wrong . no one should be obligated to buy you something . however , if they have it posted somewhere in case someone wanted to be nice , then i don t see an issue with it at all . i used to have my own amazon wishlist posted on social media .","301522":"no , i don t imagine that . no one visits my house so it would be impossible for someone to steal something i own .","301523":"no , i don t know of any books . the only help i received were from mental health professionals .","301524":"if you think you have bpd , then you should see a psychologist or a therapist . that s one of the few ways you can diagnose the disorder and receive the help you need .","301525":"not really , no . borderline personality disorder is defined by unstable mood swings , a lack of a sense of self , self destructive behaviors , splitting , dissociation , and other traits . while some people with bpd have issues with being perfect , it isn t a defining trait of bpd at all .","301526":"i studied psychology in college , yeah .","301527":"go to therapy . that s the only advice i have in that regard .","301528":"! ! ! thank you ! !","301529":"leave them if you re able to do so . nothing good can come from coming in contact with someone who s narcissistic , because they ll spin every situation around to suit their own agenda with no regard for anyone else s feelings .","301530":"the horrors that occur in this world . there will always be terrible people in existence , and perhaps i m simply desensitized , but nothing surprises me anymore .","301531":"sometimes you can t learn unless you live through it yourself . it s a sh tty thing to say and go through , but you can only learn so much through other people s experiences .","301532":"another song i absolutely love listening to while under the influence https youtu . be nt wd rka","301533":"well , there s a narcissist in my life who i didn t realize was one until i was around years old . it entirely depends on the circumstance , though . it isn t a term to throw around lightly .","301534":"my goal in life is to attain happiness . in myself , in my career , in my life in general , etc etc . i m not looking for praise or accolades , i m just searching for the happiness within myself that will allow me to be the best version of myself that i can be .","301535":"i wouldn t be so quick to call someone a narcissist , but if a person constantly flips conflicts around and makes themselves out to be a victim , then that s a big problem .","301536":"nothing really scares me about the world anymore . it s expected at this point .","301537":"this is one of my favorite songs to listen to when i m under the influence https youtu . be ahukwv vx a","301538":"i ll totally look into it ! ! i might have seen them at my local liquor store , but i really don t remember . i m also drunk rn , so . . . lmao .","301539":"lol . that definitely sounds deadly . i would not be able to control myself .","301540":"it does ! ! i also have a bottle of chocolate moonshine , which is really good .","301541":"omg . . . that look absolutely delightful .","301542":"that sounds amazing omg . what , are they cherries soaked in moonshine or something ? ?","301543":"it s called twin stills moonshine . idk if they sell it off of long island , though .","301544":"it s certainly an acquired taste . but it s smooth , at least the brand i drank was . it was also a local distillery .","301545":"i ve never developed a taste for whiskey . i m more of a rum tequila person . i can have kraken on the rocks any day . i also recently developed a taste for honey moonshine .","301546":"mostly local ipas . montauk wave chaser , greenport ipa , mustache brewing company , etc etc . i also like yuengling and fat tire .","301547":"yeah , i think it s the right thing to do given the circumstances . there s a lot more to the story as well , but it would be too much to explain . thank you for your support .","301548":"i have this one friend whom i ve forgiven way too much in the past i think it s time to distance myself from him and eventually end the friendship . he s a good person by heart , but he s selfish and doesn t think for himself . i just found out he s been backstabbing my boyfriend spreading his business without his consent , and that s not okay at all . not to mention the fact that he owed me money in the past and still tries to pull fast ones on me despite the fact that i gave him the benefit of the doubt and forgave him the first time . i m tired of it , and he s also screwed over my boyfriend too many times to count . i m not going to sit here and continue to be friends with him when he s hurt my boyfriend so much . he never learns his lesson every time he says he ll change , he goes back to his old ways . there s only so much we can take . i think this is the right decision to make . i ve known him for years and its a difficult decision but there s no use in holding onto a person who has no regard for anyone but himself .","301549":"i refuse to watch any of the split or glass movies , anything from that series . i think it demonizes mental illness and i don t want to endorse the franchise by giving it my time ."}}
