not worth investing in if it s one sided . if you re putting in all of the work to keep that friendship alive and the other person doesn t reach out , doesn t make plans , etc etc . , then you re not under any obligation to be their friend . friendship is a two way street . at the same time , however , if you suspect your friend may be struggling with mental health issues and that s why they re not putting in the effort , then you should try to help them . often people who are depressed self isolate , and it isn t anything personal because they don t want to feel like a burden to their friends .","274760":"what you re doing or going through now isn t going to define the rest of your life . you may feel the pressure of being perfect and doing everything a certain way , but you re

things that undermine the work my coworkers and i do . i dislike when people speak over others when other people are in the middle of talking . i dislike passive aggressive comments and gaslighting

people don t post much on social media to begin with , it makes sense why they wouldn t post about their partner often . but to totally hide your relationship if you re a frequent social media user , that s a bit weird especially if you re pretending to not be in a relationship at all .","275020":"you re an anonymous stranger who has no chance with me .","275021":"that s cute and all , but i would

only really close to two people there , and we talk everyday via snapchat . i miss hanging out with them , but the pros of working from home outweigh the pros of working in the office for me . i m less anxious , i m more productive , i have more freedom i feel , at least , and i feel better because i can do things around the house on my breaks . not to mention the fact that i don t have the minute commute anymore , ugh .","275045":"i only wish they allowed me to take home my office chair , lol . it s so much more comfortable than the computer chair in my bedroom , ugh . i m so happy for you , though ! ! working from home is amazing , as long as you can keep distractions to a minimum and still have the focus motivation to do what you need while in a home environment . it s worked out so well for me .","275046":"also , thanks for not being that much of a d ck about it , lol . i haven t really involved myself in the feminism community in a very long time , so i m not aware of these types of things .","275047":"thank you ! ! i m not exactly in a stable state of mind rn , but i ll look more into it .","275048":"glory , i suppose ! ! i have no interest in being famous .","275049":"i wholeheartedly believe in love , yes . even though i ve been through heartache and heartbreak in the past , i still believe in the existence of true , genuine love .","275050":"it s the first time i used it in years , and i didn t know that . thank you for informing me","275051":"gabby , you know damn well that traffic is f cking horrible here . lmaoo .","275052":"i don t tolerate any forms of discrimination or oppression .","275053":"yes and no . if you asked me this question last month , then i would have said yes absolutely . but now that we ve entered stage and things have somewhat calmed down , i don t feel as anxious going out anymore . does this mean i ll go out to the bar again ? no , probably not .","275054":"i can fold my tongue into a clover .","275055":"thank you ! ! my monday was pretty good i got a lot of productive work done , both at work and in my therapy session . my therapist confirmed that i ve been going through a mild manic episode for the past week , so i ve been trying to acknowledge that and be more cognizant of my emotions during the day week .","275056":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","275057":"let me put it to you this way i usually offer constructive criticism that may or may not be helpful . i haven t critically viewed artwork in a very long time since i was an artist myself , and i don t have the patience or energy to do that right now .","275058":"depending on my mood , i would either tell the waiter who s serving my table or do nothing at all .","275059":"i m not exactly in the business of critiquing artwork .","275060":"depends on my mood . cold brew with soy milk and sugar free vanilla syrup . iced matcha latte with soy milk . iced pumpkin spice latte with soy milk , no whipped cream . vanilla sweet cream cold brew .","275061":"thanks for the follow","275062":"i live in new york state i m years old .","275063":"hello , i like actual questions because i m bored af .","275064":"hi friends ! ! ask me some questions","275065":"as long as they re not white feminists or terfs or anything that s exclusionary .","275066":"i ve never resorted to name calling if i m having a heated discussion and or argument as an adult . i don t know if i did it as a child or not , though .","275067":"we can t . i don t give out my other social media , and i m not interested in having private conversations .","275068":"askfm is for asking questions , not holding conversations .","275069":"the color in my profile picture .","275070":"i don t have whatsapp . i have an instagram , but it s private .","275071":"i suppose a combination of both , in a sense . i work to survive because my paychecks pay all of my bills and debts and food and whatnot . however , i also like working and having a job because it sets up a very good routine for me on a daily basis .","275072":"god was never alive to begin with .","275073":"depends on the work environment and whether or not you both can separate your professional life from your personal life . if your relationship is affecting your work ethic , then it isn t advisable to date a coworker .","275074":"i don t give out my snapchat username .","275075":"it s allowed me to work from home for the past five months , which has been wonderful .","275076":"it s just a phrase .","275077":"hello i m fine . i had my therapy session tonight and we had a very productive conversation , so i was journaling about it for a while . i m trying to document my moods and feelings more often .","275078":"i don t necessarily believe that the seasons have any effect on whether or not a relationship is going to work .","275079":"no , i m not close with my parents and they ve never offered me any productive advice whatsoever .","275080":"i wholeheartedly agree . i also love music from today s era as well , but i think that s just because i m overall very passionate about a wide variety of music . it s extremely versatile .","275081":"most likely not . i m too old to put up playing with those types of games , and if i were to seek another relationship , i would want someone to be completely loyal and committed to the relationship .","275082":"writing , video games , and mental health advocacy .","275083":"i ve only listened to the first seconds of this , but i love it . i love instrumental songs to begin with , especially from the s rock era .","275084":"lucid dreams by juice wrld https www . youtube . com watch ? v mzb vgegcsu","275085":". . . wut . lol .","275086":"money is important , but i don t know your personal finances so i can t exactly say whether or not you need more money .","275087":"hello do you have a question ?","275088":"evidently i don t care if you truly needed help , you would ask me questions here on askfm . that s what this website is meant for .","275089":"lol . thank you so much ! ! i ve dealt with a lot of sh t both online and offline , so stuff like this is entertaining to me . it doesn t bother me in the least .","275090":"i would prefer to sort out the issue immediately , in most cases . there are some cases where it may be better for both people to sleep on it , as emotions can run high during a disagreement or confrontation , but it totally goes on a case by case basis .","275091":"i have other forms of social media , but i don t give them out on askfm .","275092":"i don t give out my instagram username . i already stated this .","275093":"no . if you have questions , you can ask them on askfm .","275094":"no , i don t give out my instagram username . if you have a question , you can ask it here .","275095":"yeah , but my account is private .","275096":"i ll sometimes take them on the weekend during the mid afternoon .","275097":"yeah , if you send the name of the song the artist , i can take a look .","275098":"i know . i haven t made a new friend in ages , minus the select few online friends i ve made from askfm over the years .","275099":"i ve been checking askfm in between assignments at work .","275100":"i ve had the same friends for like . . . years , lmao . you re not asking the right person tbh .","275101":"i ve never learned how to ride a bicycle .","275102":"you mean sorta like a feeling of being burnt out ? if that s the case , then i find it helpful to try to take it easy and focus on my hobbies because that s my own firm of self care . it also can help to vent to a trusted friend , family member , therapist , etc etc . , if that s available to you .","275103":"my roommate .","275104":"if you trust your partner , then you would have no reason to not believe that they re busy .","275105":"only the most suitable way for me to wash down my antidepressant and anxiety meds .","275106":"my roommate ordered two cases of these , lmaoo .","275107":"i ve been neutral during the day hypomanic at night , so this past week has been a weird ride . ?","275108":"if you re close enough to them , you can ask them especially if you re concerned for their well being .","275109":"it s been fine . i m not feeling the greatest today because i didn t sleep well , and i m basically trying to make it through the rest of the work day and then my therapy session before i can lay in bed for the night .","275110":"well that has contributed to it , but overall my life is rather boring in general , lol . all i do is work , play video games , and sleep .","275111":"depends on what the other person did wrong .","275112":"my life isn t very interesting in general .","275113":"that means absolutely nothing to me .","275114":"in relation to what ?","275115":"i m not interested in sports .","275116":"not unless you re pretending to be single .","275117":"thank you regardless","275118":"i don t give out my snapchat .","275119":"it isn t really that big of a deal to me , lmao .","275120":"no , i d rather just touch my screen so i know exactly what i m doing .","275121":"i m assuming it s when you navigate through pages and apps on your phone using hand gestures instead of touching the screen .","275122":"no , i haven t .","275123":"again , this was years ago . i don t even remember , lol .","275124":"this is correct .","275125":"it s just through experience .","275126":"i ve had my car for six years , so i have a keen sense of its dimensions at this point .","275127":"i m sure mine did too , rofl .","275128":"i honestly don t remember . that was nearly years ago , haha .","275129":"in the cupholder , lmaoo . i don t need the visual aid , i just need the verbal instructions .","275130":"nope .","275131":"idk if it s because of quarantine , but i ve really enjoyed just having people come over to my house and we hang out here , usually something like bbqing and then having a campfire in the backyard .","275132":"i haven t needed to parallel park since i took my driving test , so i m not sure what exactly you need to know .","275133":"only when i m driving to a place i ve never been before .","275134":"nothing of any value , i ve only been using the internet for work this morning .","275135":"very carefully .","275136":"thanks for the follow","275137":"i use google maps , if that counts . rofl .","275138":"no , i ve never been interested in watching it .","275139":"physically verbally ab sed me .","275140":"i don t post photos of my friends on askfm .","275141":"you find people to follow ask them questions , and people will also ask you questions , either anonymously or otherwise .","275142":"i ll give out candy to children who come to the door , but other than that , no .","275143":"well , that isn t any different from what i usually do .","275144":"askfm isn t a dating site . askfm is for asking answering questions .","275145":"hello do you have a question ?","275146":"this is going to be a pretty depressing answer , but their ab sive behavior . i grew up in a very dysfunctional and ab sive environment , and the way i was treated is basically the root cause of everything i am now .","275147":"i sneeze whenever i look into direct sunlight , i have astigmatism , and i never learned how to ride a bicycle .","275148":"in the short term , i believe so . finances no doubt can completely change someone s life and how they view their own lives , seeing as how we can finally pay off our debts , get medical attention we might need , purchase goods and services that may be needed , etc etc . in the long term , that isn t necessarily true . there comes a point where if you re wealthy and can pay for things like proper health care and not worry about bills or rent or a mortgage , you might be lacking substance in your personal life . regardless of how much money a person has , it s important to have people in your life who love and support you .","275149":"going to a bar or restaurant without being paranoid af and worried about my health or the health of others .","275150":"forensic anthropologist .","275151":"i m diagnosed with major depressive disorder , so yeah . i ve experienced depression since i was a teenager .","275152":"i honestly have no clue it s been an extremely long time . i don t usually write anything out by hand unless i m writing in my mood journal .","275153":"nah . i ve never been one to do that .","275154":"most days , i wake up somewhere between am .","275155":"haha , it s anywhere between pm and am . last night , i think i fell asleep around midnight .","275156":"ranch or bbq .","275157":"yeah , i used to post my writing there .","275158":"spending a few hours playing video games .","275159":"lol , i ve been a wreck lately but it s nothing out of the ordinary .","275160":"hello do you have a question ?","275161":"my father and grandmother both have anxiety disorders , but that s the most i know .","275162":"i understand completely . that s partially why i never sought help for my mental illnesses until i was in my mid s alongside thinking i didn t need help much , i also wouldn t have been able to afford it when i was younger because doctors and therapists and medication is so much money , ugh . mental health care should be a right , not a privilege . and right now it s a privilege . smh .","275163":"i never denied that socioeconomic circumstances were detrimental to mental health . it prevents a lot of people from seeking proper treatment . what i was dismissing was the anon s assumption that my mental illnesses would get better if i didn t choose to feel however i feel or however they worded it . their words were very invalidating to people who struggle with mental illness , especially chronic disorders that are more complex than depression and anxiety . they also never took into account trauma related disorders it s not a choice , and people who struggle with mental illness don t voluntarily act the way they do .","275164":"lol , big mood .","275165":"i understand i never indicated that doctors don t make mistakes , and i m sorry about your coworker . endometriosis is no joke .","275166":"i gotta say , this is one of the weirdest fetishes i ve ever come across on askfm .","275167":"thank you ! ! i wish the same for you .","275168":"thank you anyways , y all should send me some questions . i m in a pretty good mood .","275169":"honestly , i already have my own personal issues with thinking that i m a burden on my friends they re only friends with me out of like . . . pity , or something . so when things like this happen , it makes me genuinely wonder if i m even their friend to begin with . the only people i m comfortable with in the knowledge that they do care about me are my roommate , my roommate s girlfriend , my ex , and my best friend . i have a few other close friends , but we only talk when i initiate the conversation . i ve thought about closing myself off entirely , but there are also nights where i get into one of those moods where i need to chat with someone , so i always break it .","275170":"i can relate to this . if i didn t reach out first , i don t think most of my friends would contact me . there have only been a few rare occasions where my friends have texted me first , and that was because they wanted to talk about something they were going through , not necessarily to check in .","275171":"lol , ugh i totally agree with you . i m against self diagnosis , especially when it comes to complex disorders like personality disorders and dissociative disorders and whatnot . you simply don t know what you could have , because plenty of symptoms from different illnesses overlap . it s fine to say i think i might have this , but i m not going to say definitively , while it isn t okay to say well , i feel this way so i have x disorder . most people with mental health problems have suspicions of their disorders prior to being diagnosed . and that s normal and very valid , and it helps with the diagnostic process . but i don t believe it s right to say you definitely have a disorder when you haven t been properly diagnosed or even looked at .","275172":"you can cross me off your list because it s not going to happen . i believe it s time for you to move on to someone else .","275173":"? ? ? this makes zero sense . there s no such thing as a wrong patient . if you re struggling with mental health issues , then you re entitled to receive any and all kinds of professional treatment you need . your views on individuals struggling with mental health issues are so skewed .","275174":"rofl . i never said it was immoral , and i m not here to satisfy you . if you want to see people nude , then subscribe to some random person s onlyfans account .","275175":"cont . . . when you choose not to forget your past or you don t have enough achievements to replace your past memories and help you cope with it , no drug and no therapy will change anything . if these medicines and therapies were useful , you would have no illness at all anymore . this is . . . completely wrong and inaccurate , but okay . i really hope you don t become a therapist or psychiatrist in the future because you d be completely invalidating your patients struggles .","275176":"this sounds like a you problem instead of a me problem .","275177":"i agree , and the anon who was sympathizing with my year old ex ? disgusting . i m but i wouldn t even feel comfortable dating anyone who was , like . . . under the age of or something .","275178":"if the solution was to move away from my parents , then my problems would have disappeared last year when i moved out , lol . mental illness is much more complex , and it s obvious that you don t know the intricacies of mental health besides probably taking some rudimentary psych class in high school .","275179":"no , i don t use skype . i m also not interested in talking to random people from askfm .","275180":"no , i m single .","275181":"that s not something i m willing to discuss in detail on the internet . i don t talk about my sex life .","275182":"hence why i m also in therapy .","275183":". . . wow . well , this conversation is ending . it s entirely clear what your beliefs are , and i m not willing to have discussions with pedophiles . bye .","275184":"i never really had a choice in the matter .","275185":"the medication has helped my depression and anxiety for the most part , so those balanced my brain chemistry . everything else has been the result of trauma .","275186":"sounds like you re deflecting because you ve also had attractions to minors and you re trying to defend yourself in a subconscious way . an year old dating a year old is pedophilia , point blank . this isn t something i m going to debate . it s entirely wrong because children cannot consent , and it isn t an issue of morality . so i suggest you stop victim blaming and look internally to understand why you feel the need to defend pedophiles .","275187":"it s a combination of both my environment and brain chemistry , from what i ve gathered over the years .","275188":"victim blaming is disgusting , and you should really re evaluate yourself before you go and blame someone who is a child for entering a relationship with an adult . it s a power imbalance , and the adult has the control in those types of relationships .","275189":"yes , i ve been seeing a psychiatrist since i was years old . at the moment , i m taking lamictal , prozac , rexulti , and xanax .","275190":"i wholeheartedly agree . i ve been dealing with mental health issues since i was years old , which has been basically almost years at this point . if there was a simple cure , i would have found it a long time ago . mental illness is chronic in most cases , and when people do recover from them , they re still diagnosed with the illness they re simply in remission . mine has gotten worse with age too , despite the fact that i m on medication and go to weekly therapy sessions . but that s the personality disorder , not necessarily my depression or anxiety . i m extremely impulsive , i have bouts of rage , i can be s icidal and self destructive , and my mood swings are all over the place .","275191":"i wasn t a pedophile , lmaoo . my year old boyfriend was when he decided to date a year old . that was entirely his wrongdoing . it wasn t my fault that he had an attraction to a literal child .","275192":"i would never date a person years younger than me , considering i m years old and that person would have just turned years old . as for older , i have no qualms with older people . however , i m not interested in dating at the moment .","275193":"? ? ? like i said , you re not my therapist . we are not trying to psychoanalyze my life , you are . there s a reason why i ve been seeing a licensed therapist for three years now and have been on medication for nearly four years .","275194":"the age of consent in new york is years old , but it varies depending on the state and where else you live in the world .","275195":"last time i checked , you re not my therapist . lol . i ve had anxiety , panic attacks , and depression since i was years old . i was diagnosed with a personality disorder when i was years old . my issues are chronic , they don t just magically go away .","275196":"because i was interested in him , and he was wrongly interested in me , and we dated for a few months . he was a groomer and his interest in me was completely disgusting , but i didn t realize that until years later .","275197":"i don t need help because it doesn t affect me positively or negatively . it s just a fact of my life , and it doesn t make a difference overall .","275198":"no , i ve never sewn anything in my life .","275199":"there is no pattern . it entirely depends on my mood , which changes drastically throughout the day . i can go weeks or months without being hypersexual , and then be hypersexual for a few days to a week . there is no pattern .","275200":"probably not , considering i don t know what that is .","275201":"neither , it hasn t happened again and our friendship has remained the same .","275202":"you re speaking as if my sex drive is on some sort of schedule , lol .","275203":"because it is pedophilia , lol . the fact that i was years old and he had just turned years old isn t pedophilia . pedophilia was when i was years old and dating an year old . that s the difference .","275204":"we did , but neither of us had the financial capabilities to afford it at the time . i was only able to afford to move out of my parents house last year .","275205":"i m either not sexual at all or hypersexual , there s really no in between .","275206":"that doesn t make a difference to me .","275207":"i ve only been vip once because i purchased it with coins , ahah . it lasted for maybe weeks , but i didn t do any tasks , i just enjoyed the surplus of questions and likes coming in .","275208":"no , we didn t formally live together . during the middle of our relationship , i sorta lived with him to a certain extent because of my own family issues i would pack a bag at home and then stay over his house for a week at a time , then go back home and do laundry and pack another bag and go back to his house for the following week .","275209":"i believe that most leaders of nations are corrupt and greedy by default , as they soak in their leadership as believe themselves to be such powerful and untouchable people . if there was a world leader , i can t imagine how that would affect the world because of how corrupt with power they would become . it would definitely divide people , much like how leaders of specific nations divide people . look at the united states , for example trump s presidency has divided the nation entirely , not to mention the fact that the whole democrat vs . republican thing has already been dividing people to begin with .","275210":"no , war never lends itself to peace . it just brings increased tension among nations , unnecessary violence , and the brutal m rder of innocent lives .","275211":"the best thing you can do in any circumstance like this is to simply sit down with her and talk to her . i went through a similar situation with one of my close friends she isn t my roommate , though , we slept together about a month ago and when i woke up the next morning , i thought it would ruin the friendship we had fostered . but we talked through it , and our night spent together hasn t affected our friendship at all . tl dr talk to her about it and come to a mutual resolution agreement . communication is key .","275212":"zero , haha .","275213":"i wholeheartedly agree with you . which is not only wrong in itself , but also totally lends itself to the desire of men who want young adults and even children because those girls are seen as pure or untainted . it s gross .","275214":"no , not really . i did hook up with one of my friends a month ago , but it was just a one time thing . she s willing to fool around again so it might happen again in the future , but i don t really have any direct intentions of hitting her up again for it right now .","275215":"i was years old , and he had just turned years old .","275216":"i don t have an interest in dating anymore at the moment because i m still somewhat getting over my ex , and i just simply don t feel ready to enter another relationship or even go on dates with people . i would think it s a bit unfair for me to enter another relationship knowing that i still have feelings for my ex .","275217":"i m passionate about writing , video games , and mental health advocacy .","275218":"i can t predict the future , lol . i m not interested in sending nudes to anyone , and i m also not even remotely interested in anyone right now .","275219":"i would love that , ahah . i have nearly every other app on my phone set to dark mode .","275220":"yeah , caffeine pills exist .","275221":"eh , not really . every website that i went on back in the day when i was researching zodiac compatibility for my ex and i told me that we weren t compatible at all , and that we would clash often that wasn t the the case whatsoever . while we were dating , we were actually very compatible .","275222":"societal conditioning , and pressure from past generations for boys to grow up to become sexual beings their sexual behaviors are encouraged , as opposed to women , whose sexual behaviors are discouraged .","275223":"i d like to believe so , at least i am now compared to who i was when i was younger .","275224":"i m doing pretty well ! ! i notice that when i smoke while i m drinking , i don t wake up with a hangover , ahah . the only downside is that i think i was up until like am last night because i was so high , so i didn t wake up until am this morning . i just ordered starbucks breakfast , and i m currently drinking an iced pumpkin spice latte and listening to music . i bought spotify premium last night , so i don t have to worry about ads anymore .","275225":"no , i haven t . when i was growing up in high school , there was really no anonymous option to tell someone that i had feelings for them . plus , i was certain they didn t reciprocate those feelings so it would have been useless .","275226":"my favorite number is .","275227":"i don t believe i have , no . i ve come close to it , but if i knew i was tired and wasn t going to make it through the class , i just didn t attend the class .","275228":"yes , i say no pretty frequently , and i have no issues with saying no to people .","275229":"have sex , probably . i can t think of anything more impulsive or reckless than that .","275230":"nah , i have zero interest in relationships rn .","275231":"we were together for nearly years .","275232":"going on about a year now .","275233":"everyone is entitled to their opinion .","275234":"yes , i m single .","275235":"yes , that s correct .","275236":"some legitimate fucking questions would be nice .","275237":"yoooo , y all should ask me questions !","275238":"well , not their biological sex it s more of the gender a person is assigned at birth .","275239":"no , but there s a pretty large percentage of men who are .","275240":"no , although i do know a few people who have that sense , it s like they just get this bad vibe or feeling of dread and can t understand why until it happens .","275241":"lmfao i feel fucking great .","275242":"i m really high and i m going to try to write creatively , wish me luck","275243":"yeah , they re pretty much never true for me , lol .","275244":"i don t have an onlyfans account .","275245":"i m not sure what this means , and this also isn t a question .","275246":"my passions in life , whether it s for writing or video games or mental health advocacy .","275247":"i don t believe this is accurate in most circumstances . most of our problems are external , and then how we chose to react to those initial problems can either help them or worsen them . it s about being responsive , not reactive .","275248":"? ? ? obviously it s because you re an anonymous stranger .","275249":"honesty , loyalty , and communication . if you love someone whether it s romantically or platonically then you need to have those three things in order to have a healthy relationship .","275250":"my roommate s girlfriend came over this weekend , so we all hung out and talked and had a great time last night , and then this morning , i made breakfast for everyone . we sat around the table talking for a few hours , and it was just a really nice , relaxing time .","275251":"i honestly have paid much attention to the guidelines regarding re opening schools in new york , so i don t have an opinion .","275252":"i have unhealthy coping mechanisms , so i usually do something destructive , lmaoo .","275253":"eh , i don t really care very much personally , but my roommates love decorating for holidays .","275254":"this afternoon , tbh . my mother texted me something that really irritated me , so i was angry for a few hours .","275255":"i smoke weed occasionally .","275256":"i m just wearing leggings and a shirt from the bonfire a sirius xm comedy podcast .","275257":"i ve never given out coins before , lol .","275258":"last night then again , i was hypomanic , lmaoo .","275259":"my mother being petty , as always .","275260":"house md ! ! i ve been obsessed with it recently . my supervisor texted me this morning told me i needed to watch the witcher , rofl . so i might watch that next .","275261":"i m not interested in either one these days .","275262":"yes to both .","275263":"tank tops . i would look absolutely disgusting in a crop top .","275264":"it depends , i ll go to bed anywhere between pm and like am .","275265":"it s been good up until minutes ago . after i showered , my head started hurting and it feels like my head and ears are all foggy and clogged up . i also can t stop clenching my jaw , which is probably anxiety , so i took allergy meds and xanax and i m going to try to sleep it off .","275266":"work takes up the majority of my time , even when i m sleeping apparently . i had a lot of dreams about work last night . other than that , i spend a lot of time listening to music .","275267":"the air conditioner in the living room .","275268":"no , i ve honestly never heard of that before .","275269":"first psl of the season . ?","275270":"neither .","275271":"pretty much anything as long as they re not trolling , invasive , fetishes , or inappropriate .","275272":"i m always honest to begin with .","275273":"hello do you have a question ?","275274":"i d rather give up my love life , considering i don t have one rn . lmao .","275275":"i m not a fan of surprises .","275276":"i haven t seen it before , but i m planning on actually watching it this weekend .","275277":"i don t have children . as a filler i got ridiculously drunk and high last night , but somehow i feel perfectly fine today . i haven t even had my gfuel yet , but i m very energized , rofl .","275278":"it s supposed to storm all afternoon , so i have zero plans , haha . i just want to play video games all day .","275279":"i haven t eaten breakfast yet , but i m planning on making scrambled eggs with buttered bread for myself and my roommate s girlfriend .","275280":"i just just relax , open the blinds so i can see and hear the rain falling , and watching something on television or play video games . i absolutely love rain and thunder storms .","275281":"i don t really care about your pictures . i don t talk to people on instagram unless they re already my friend , and even still , i only talk to people through instagram . i don t give out my instagram through askfm , and this is no exception .","275282":"i can help you on askfm , depending upon the subject matter .","275283":"this goes for someone of either sex , but it s integral to have an open line of communication with your partner and be honest with them as much as possible . talk to them when you re having issues , particularly within the relationship , so that you two have the opportunity to discuss them and come to a resolution as to how to fix the problem . communication is key in any relationship .","275284":"i don t give out my instagram to others unless i really know the person and have talked to them extensively .","275285":"i guess both , in a way ? when i m faced with challenged in a professional environment , i take the situation head on and also use rational thinking and organizational skills to map out what i have to do over the span of time i m allotted to do it . i usually devise a plan in my head of how i should do the task and then do it accordingly . in my personal life , it s a totally different story . lmaoo . i usually use irrational thinking and try to ignore the problem entirely .","275286":"i graduated from college in .","275287":"either a dog or a cat , because when they re placed in the right loving home , they re absolutely spoiled , lmaoo . i d love to have zero responsibilities and just sleep and play and eat all day .","275288":"try to seek out professional help , if possible . it s difficult to go through depression alone , and talking to a therapist or seeing a doctor for medication is extremely helpful . if you can t seek professional treatment , then it also helps to talk to a trusted person s in your life , whether that s a friend or a family member or a coworker , etc etc . the bottom line is , don t hold it inside of you . don t try to hide it from the world . teach yourself to reach out to others when you need help .","275289":"strangely enough , i enjoy doing the dishes . i find it to be really therapeutic , haha . i also like doing laundry because of how fresh my clothing and bedding smells when it s done .","275290":"no , i don t use public wifi generally . i think i did once or twice while at the bar when they did offer public wifi , but that was at least a year ago .","275291":"i ve never traveled on a ferry before , but there are loads of ferries that go from long island to connecticut people take them with their cars so that they don t have to drive through new york city if they re going to new england , which makes complete sense .","275292":"besides allowing me to work from home , it hasn t been affecting me all that much these days .","275293":"somewhere in the back towards the middle . however , i haven t been to the movie theater in years , i don t really have an interest in beating out the crowds and whatnot . i d rather just wait for the movie to come out to rent .","275294":"been there , done that . lmaoo .","275295":"ask me questions that i can answer with video responses ! ! ?","275296":"the only times i can stand myself are when i m not sober , so yeah .","275297":"blood , blood , blood , pump mud through my veins , shut your dirty , dirty mouth , i m not that insane . blood , blood , blood , pump mud through my veins , i m a dirty , dirty girl , i want it filthy .","275298":"that i ll probably be alone for the rest of my life because my trauma controls me and no one else has been able to handle my sh t besides my most recent ex , who has no interest in me anymore . ?","275299":"i don t care about other people s tattoos . it isn t anything special like of the people i know have tattoos . if you want one , get something you like .","275300":"wherever you want . it s your decision .","275301":"i honestly don t care if someone else has tattoos , especially an anonymous stranger on the internet .","275302":"i know . i deleted it because it wasn t a question .","275303":"people s opinions of things are wholeheartedly influenced by other people s opinions of things , no doubt . especially when that person is well known .","275304":"yes ?","275305":"i ve been using a moonstone bath body works spray lately .","275306":"they re painful , but absolutely worth it .","275307":"yeah , that s pretty rude and closeminded . trends have and always will exist and there s nothing wrong with enjoying what you enjoy , regardless of how trendy it is or isn t . people are allowed to enjoy things .","275308":"yeah , there s more artistic freedom with tattoos i eventually want full sleeves .","275309":"no , i have no piercings anymore . i thought about getting my nose piercing redone but haven t gotten around to it .","275310":"yeah , i used to have my lip and nose pierced when i was younger too .","275311":"i wanted tattoos since i was like years old , lol . i saw them on my favorite musicians and wanted to decorate my body with art .","275312":"my first tattoo was the yin yang on my back .","275313":"well , just two of them back in . i got my first tattoo when i was years old .","275314":"! ! ! this is so true i m a bit of both , as much as i like venting my feelings online , i way too often keep my feelings to myself when it comes to my friends , especially if they ve done something to hurt me whether accidentally or otherwise . i bottle those emotions up and then my coping mechanisms are disastrous .","275315":"they re all meaningful to me , so i can t really choose a favorite . my most recent ones are the avocado linkin park ones i got them done in the same day , haha .","275316":"thank you","275317":"this is indeed true .","275318":"i never have before , but i ve always wanted to . sometimes my roommate and i will take a drive just for the hell of it , but i wouldn t really consider that a road trip .","275319":"yeah , i have seven tattoos .","275320":"i mean , i watch gore movies for fun , so . . . lol .","275321":"hello do you have a question ?","275322":"in all seriousness , you need to continue watching . it ll pull at your heart strings more , which can be either a good or bad thing , lmao . i ve cried at so many episodes .","275323":"yes , but only very close friends . i ve given my number to a few friends i ve met through askfm .","275324":"i m a scorpio , which is a water sign and i think that suits me best . water signs are often very intuitive , emotional people .","275325":"sometime last weekend , i think . i accidentally took a nap last night after work , but it was for maybe minutes and i didn t even realize i fell asleep .","275326":"i sorta had a stalker in high school , but i just kept ignoring him and avoiding him . i was one of the lucky ones where he eventually lost interest . that doesn t happen in most cases .","275327":"nah , i didn t think you were judging . i just don t know because i ve never been a comic person myself . like , i read manga when i was a teenager which i guess is similar , but not recently .","275328":"lol . honestly . . . both . mulder scully are both hot af .","275329":"maybe that s the appeal of it ? idk .","275330":"well , most of them aren t friends at this point . they re just people i went to high school with and old coworkers . regardless , i know plenty of people who like comics .","275331":"liking comics isn t really a big deal , lmaoo . i have plenty of friends who read comics .","275332":"no , i ve only ever flown in a plane .","275333":"most people can survive without food for three weeks , but we only last maybe days if we don t drink any water .","275334":"they re just being petty and trying to stick their nose in other people s business where it doesn t belong .","275335":"lol , this is assuming i was ever sane to begin with . i ve been fine i m somewhat of a recluse anyway , so covid hasn t changed me at all . i ve been working from home since march , which i absolutely love and i hope i have the option to continue this even after covid . the only other things i ve been doing have been video games and binge watching television shows . i also got back into therapy .","275336":"most likely my writing ability , the stories and essays and poetry that i ve written over the years .","275337":"i can promise my friends that i ll support and encourage them in all of their endeavors , but i ll also be real with them and tell them when they re going down the wrong path or doing something unhealthy toward themselves or others .","275338":"nah , i m good . i ve only ever posted one full body shot on askfm , and that was a long time ago .","275339":"you re better off asking a doctor or a nutritionist . everyone s bodies are different , so there s a lot more involved than changing your eating habits and exercising . what you re doing may help someone lose weight , while for other people , it won t do anything . it entirely depends on your body chemistry .","275340":"i wouldn t really consider it a diet , but there are times where i actively try to eat healthier than other times such as limiting carbs , eating more lean proteins and veggies , etc etc .","275341":"i experience that feeling on a regular basis , lol . although i m comfortable in my home , i feel the need to escape from myself . i don t think i could be able to live off the grid , though . there are too many luxuries that i enjoy which make my life easier , lol .","275342":"my favorite song always changes , but right now i ve been listening to lucid dreams by juice wrld on repeat . https www . youtube . com watch ? v mzb vgegcsu","275343":"i m currently listening to this compilation of relaxing halo music https www . youtube . com watch ? v x z bq p m","275344":"the last movie i watched was guns akimbo starring daniel radcliffe .","275345":"lately i ve been binge watching house md , but i also love shows such as wentworth , it s always sunny in philadelphia , parks and recreation , how i met your mother , the x files , dexter , castle , bones , criminal minds , and the punisher .","275346":"i don t think the typical love letter has lost its meaning . in fact , i think they re even more sentimental now than ever before because of the fact that they re not written as often at least physically written . most people use social media and text messaging to express their love for a person , so that makes standard love letters even more significant .","275347":"yeah , i usually watch a few episodes of a show before i fall asleep at night .","275348":"the structure of our dna .","275349":"i honestly can t think of anything besides when the car in front of my at the starbucks drive thru purchased my drink and breakfast for me , lol . it was one of those pass it forward sort of deals , so i paid for the person behind me .","275350":"not necessarily , no . some people simply do not face consequences for their actions , and other people face consequences for other people s actions that they had no direct involvement in . life isn t fair .","275351":"i m not really ashamed of anything that i m interested it and or do .","275352":"i used to attract the wrong kind of people when i was younger , but as i ve gotten older , i ve sorta learned which people to accept into my life and which to keep away because they won t be productive to my own self development and self esteem .","275353":"because they re boys , not men . when you enter a mature and healthy relationship , your partner won t have any reservations about showing affection in public . obviously there are some men who don t use social media very often , and therefore , won t post about their partner , but if it seems as if your partner is trying to hide the fact that they re in a relationship , then that s a definite red flag .","275354":"depends on the type of bug , i suppose . luckily , there haven t been any bugs in the house this summer ! ! however , there are a few crickets in the garage , but i leave them alone because it s not as if they re bothering anyone .","275355":"that could be an explanation , sure . i honestly can t give an opinion , though , because i only know one person who s middle aged and gay , and she s the type of person who doesn t care about what other people think of her and will call you out when necessary .","275356":"avocado ! !","275357":"i m outgoing around my friends , but that s the extent of it . i wouldn t necessarily consider myself to be shy because that would imply that i care about how others perceive me . however , i am quiet when i m out in public and i mind my own business .","275358":"all of the above , haha . i m a compulsive skin picker , and my arms are covered in scabs and scars as a result of it . my cuticles are also just as bad because i pick at them rip them off , as well .","275359":"i don t have any plans for this weekend , no . the only thing i have to do is pick up my medication from the pharmacy .","275360":"times per day .","275361":"i mainly follow bpd memes and other trauma related subreddits .","275362":"lol . i listened to her a lot when i was in middle school , ngl .","275363":"when i was in college , i threw a lot of parties with my ex , haha . i didn t go to parties when i was in high school , though .","275364":"welcome to the club , your designated crying corner is over there .","275365":"introverted simply means that you have to recharge after being around groups of people by being alone and doing solitary activities , while extroverted means you re energized by being around others . i don t have a lot of friends because i prefer my inner circle to be small , but i definitely have my periods where i don t want anyone interacting with me .","275366":"i don t really put any faith in astrological stuff personally , so i wouldn t let that deter me from pursuing someone just because our signs are allegedly not compatible .","275367":"eh , yes and no . i wasn t disliked necessarily during most of high school , but i also was not popular whatsoever and was mainly a loner .","275368":"there are obviously certain parts of reddit that are gross , but i like the mental health memes and posts , as well as the writing prompt pages i follow .","275369":"i m honestly not too sure , i just followed certain subjects and scroll through my page . i don t comment on anything and i ve only saved a few posts memes , haha .","275370":"this makes zero sense .","275371":"haha , no it s not a literal meaning where you share a room with someone . it s just a term to describe people with whom you share a common living space , whether it s an apartment or a house or a dorm .","275372":"i feel that way mostly about some of the natural environment places i ve visited , like beautiful parks and the mountains . when i lived in massachusetts , my friends and i hiked to the top of a mountain and it was sunset and we could see the clouds below us , which was astounding . there s also a park by the college i went to , and the gardens trees were amazing . there was this one really old tree that had carvings on almost every inch of its bark , things like lyrics and people s initials .","275373":"in some rare circumstances , sure . however , it s best to be realistic about situations so you re not blindsided should they go wrong .","275374":"i didn t even know there was a term for that , lol . i actually kinda do that on facebook since a lot of my friends post about current events .","275375":"my closest friends ! ! shehitsback manicmartyrdom courtneyuwu celinem heartofstitches","275376":"i don t know what that means , lmao . i only joined a few weeks ago .","275377":"since i was a teenager , the internet has affected everything about my life but most importantly , the friendships i ve made online have been life changing for me . the internet is also where i conduct some research into things and where i ve gotten most of my information , as the internet is a boundless resource of knowledge .","275378":"i don t normally lose my temper , because it s mainly a matter of who is affecting my life in that moment as opposed to what is affecting my life . if i feel strongly against someone , their words are going to anger me much more than if someone else were to say those same words if this makes sense .","275379":"askfm , facebook , twitter , reddit , and youtube .","275380":"i mean , i usually just go to the bar with a few friends but who knows how long this pandemic is going to last , so that might very well not be an option .","275381":"not really , no . i m terrible at dancing besides .","275382":"personal information that indicates where i live , where i went to school , etc etc .","275383":"lol . brooklyn is diverse but it s filled with young hipsters at this point .","275384":"for a room i guess isn t terrible compared to other prices , but i wouldn t live in manhattan regardless . i would be extremely wary of prices that low , it might not be the best quality place .","275385":"it depends on a variety of factors , including where in new york , the type of house it is or apartment apartment complex it is , the landlord s preferences , etc etc .","275386":"i don t really have one , because i m not interested in cars like that . i like the car i drive now .","275387":"yeah , i ve been coloring my hair since i was like years old , lol . i ve done red , orange , blonde , blue , purple , pink , brown , some silver , and black . the only color i haven t tried is green . i think purple and red have always been my favorites .","275388":"you re free to post in my inbox , but i can t guarantee that i ll feel comfortable with the statement or respond to it .","275389":"i follow around people .","275390":"no , i m not a vegetarian .","275391":"i don t really have any , haha . i m working for the next ish hours , and then i m going to have dinner and relax for a little while .","275392":"well i m single , so this doesn t really apply to me .","275393":"yeah , lol . a lot of anons try to start arguments with me over a variety of different things , mostly related to social justice issues .","275394":"when i drink coffee , i usually just put in a small bit of flavored creamer . however , i haven t drank coffee since last wednesday .","275395":"i ve always loved huskies and pit breeds , as well as golden retrievers . i also like reptiles like bearded dragons and chameleons , and i ve become especially close to the cats in the house over the past few months .","275396":"i ve been wearing nothing but leggings and pajama pants with tank tops since march , lmaoo . if i have to go out , then i ll throw on a pair of jeans but that s pretty much it .","275397":"yes , that s why latin has always been attractive to me .","275398":"probably because people in general are beginning to realize that they should take their health seriously , and take steps toward ensuring that their health and lifestyle are being treated properly .","275399":"no , i don t believe in angels or demons .","275400":"my bedroom is fairly clean and organized .","275401":"that s also a matter of opinion , lmaoo . however , how i feel about myself depends entirely on my mood . some days i think i m uglier than dirt while other days i can tolerate myself .","275402":"sorta , yeah . i don t have any formal latin training but they re the root words for poetry and moon .","275403":"that s a matter of opinion .","275404":"i am insecure , and the filters are also cute .","275405":"probably the kitchen .","275406":"not really , no . i think what i eat the most often is scrambled eggs , i have them maybe mornings out of the week .","275407":"hello do you have a question ?","275408":"i did a lot of stupid sh t when i was younger .","275409":"no , i surprisingly haven t .","275410":"i m tipsy feeling good","275411":". . . i can t tell if this is a fetish question or a regular question .","275412":"lmfaoooo . yes , every damn day .","275413":"perhaps .","275414":"no , that s definitely not my scene . i d rather live somewhere more quiet .","275415":"i m on four prescriptions and they never work all the time . lmao .","275416":"sometimes , yes . it entirely depends on how i feel on that particular day .","275417":"no , i have major depressive disorder .","275418":"idk , i haven t been doing very well lately .","275419":"my roommate bought us dinner the other night , if that counts .","275420":"perhaps . if someone is different from the norm , then they re automatically targets of ridicule or harassment . that goes for whether someone is a bit more intelligent than the rest , has different interests , etc etc .","275421":"exercise , go out and experience things , etc etc . i ve been in a slump lately .","275422":"when i was in high school , i always enjoyed english .","275423":"it isn t lame at all , and i appreciate you reaching out . thank you . ?","275424":"i m sad and angry , but trying to distract myself by watching television .","275425":"he doesn t love you , he s trying to groom and use you .","275426":"alcohol , considering i m on the verge of an anxiety attack and or anger episode because of work today , so i m trying hard as hell to calm down .","275427":"you know i m no good . https youtu . be b i s zrbhg","275428":"getting my hair finally done ! !","275429":"depends on what the person did . in most cases , i ll forgive forget , but in other cases , i do hold a grudge .","275430":"nope ! ! the movie the exorcism of emily rose which is an amazing film btw was based on the case of anneliese michel , who underwent over exorcisms . that was only around years ago .","275431":"i ve always wanted to be a published author , so i would release books novellas into the market .","275432":"i got my first tattoo when i was years old .","275433":"i posted this last night , but here","275434":"extreme cold . i can t handle the heat .","275435":"i don t really know much about them , but i watched a movie re enactment of an exorcism and it was super interesting .","275436":"no , i have major depressive disorder .","275437":"that doesn t mean i m obligated to follow you in return . thank you for the follow , though .","275438":"i honestly don t remember , it s been for a variety of different reasons . it hasn t happened in a while , though .","275439":"yeah , on quite a few occasions , lol .","275440":"i m pretty ordinary , tbh .","275441":"because i don t want to . i only follow people whose answers i enjoy , and also people who don t feel the need to ask for follows .","275442":"i don t follow people upon request .","275443":"i don t usually wear any jewelry at all , but i own some nice pieces that i ll wear from time to time .","275444":"i like moderately spicy food , nothing ridiculously hot though .","275445":"aw , farewell tobbe ! ! i ve enjoyed your questions a lot even if i didn t get around to answering them all , and i wish you luck on your life post askfm .","275446":"most of my dreams are either nightmares or just downright bizarre . speaking of , i actually had a dream inside of a dream last night if that makes sense . like , in my dream i was actually asleep and having a dream and then my dream self woke up and had to frantically tell my job something that had happened in my dream s dream .","275447":"life is very far from fair , lol . life is extremely unfair .","275448":"i believe mentally ill people are usually more qualified to discuss mental health compared to people who have never struggled with mental illness before .","275449":"painties . lmaoo .","275450":"writing mental health advocacy .","275451":"no , i don t give out likes or coins upon request .","275452":"considering you live halfway across the world and i don t want company ,

blonde .","275461":"no , that s pretty normal .","275462":"a regular journal , written by hand .","275463":"yes , that s perfectly acceptable . you re not obligated to talk to someone , especially if that person doesn t make you comfortable at all .","275464":"not really a diary , no . i ve been writing my moods in a journal every night to keep track of them and see if there are any patterns .","275465":"yes , that makes perfect sense . i mean . . . i personally didn t think life was simpler back then because of my own mental illness issues , but i do know that the whole life was simpler back then ideology is extremely common .","275466":"it definitely does make sense . when we were teenagers back then well i was a teenager , we didn t know the entire scope of what was going on in the world we only really knew what was in our own inner circle . that could make us perceive the world as being better than it actually was .","275467":"yes , absolutely . it creates a sense of distrust between the child and the parent , and overstepping your boundaries as a parent by invading your child s privacy is extremely controlling .","275468":"very much so .","275469":"we get together for thanksgiving and christmas .","275470":"i honestly have no idea .","275471":"it isn t really my style , but i can tolerate it .","275472":"love my shaved head .","275473":"town , i suppose . cities are too busy and crowded for me , and villages seem as if they might be too rural .","275474":"not during school , no . however , i did briefly play volleyball for one season with my friends in an adult league through the catholic church , which was fun .","275475":"it s been good i worked my full shift at work , then talked on the phone with manicmartyrdom for half an hour . then i ordered dinner now i m just sitting in the living room relaxing . i m debating on whether or not to play video games , or just watch television .","275476":"lol . i can only imagine .","275477":"very cold and distant .","275478":"oh , goodness . doesn t it rain a lot where you live , though ? i honestly love rain storms , haha .","275479":"we had a sudden rain storm roll in , but it only lasted maybe minutes . i think we re supposed to get another round later tonight though .","275480":"i d rather have the power of teleportation , that way i wouldn t have to drive anywhere .","275481":"so are a lot of other things i do .","275482":"it was nice ! ! i m usually hella awkward on the phone too , especially talking to someone on the phone for the first time , but it felt natural . cc manicmartyrdom","275483":"yeah , i guess what i drink every morning is considered an energy drink , lol . it has caffeine taurine in it , along with other vitamins and antioxidants . i also sometimes drink red bull but it s rare .","275484":"vent to a friend , drink , play video games , and sleep .","275485":"never , considering i don t think the us is the best country in the world .","275486":"probably a week or so .","275487":"perhaps , you never know what will happen in the future . my decision to quit smoking was pretty impulsive and spontaneous , so if i were to quit drinking , it d probably be the same thing .","275488":"aw , omg this is so sweet . thank you ! ! ?","275489":"yeah , i quit self harming when i was around years old after years of being addicted to

legs are hurting today . nothing unmanageable , it s just been a while since i felt that muscle burn .","275491":"no , i ve never done that before .","275492":"bugs , lmaoo .","275493":"wandering around in the woods and taking photos of the natural beauty , walking on the beach and hearing the soothing sounds of the waves crashing on the shore , being in the mountains and looking at other mountains and hills in the distance , and laying in the grass in the sunshine and taking in the natural sounds around me .","275494":"i m not really afraid of people .","275495":"i don t believe i m

been cheated on .","275503":"i prefer savory foods over sweet foods .","275504":"yeah some people just aren t happy in their relationship and don t want to communicate to their partner that they re unhappy , so they cheat . they could simply be looking for sex if they re not satisfied sexually and want to get that from someone else . there are different reasons .","275505":"there could be a variety of reasons why someone would cheat in a relationship . not everyone is the same .","275506":"graduating from high school . quitting self harm . returning to new york during my first year of college due to my ex s family difficulties . graduating from college . obtaining treatment for my mental health for the first time . obtaining my first entry level job . moving out of my parents house

that it was often a necessary class to keep kids in shape and active .","275509":"i don t use lights most of the day only after the sun sets , i recycle bottles and cardboard , and i reduce the use of

conditioner is basically running .","275510":"it s so silly , but hilarious .","275511":"lol , yes ! ! honestly , i love it . i ve been trying to find more artists in that genre in my spare time

person ? if not , then honestly it isn t any of your concern .","275529":"public speaking is one of my biggest fears , haha . i used to have panic attacks when i knew i had to speak in front of a crowd .","275530":"only if you re concerned that someone is going to get hurt , i suppose . kinks are supposed to be consensual and safe practices .","275531":"i never said i couldn t lose the weight . i just said i was lazy and obese .","275532":"because i have low self esteem , obviously .","275533":"a lazy , obese piece of sh t .","275534":"penne ala vodka .","275535":"coffee ,

the work opportunities that i ve had over the years .","275542":"both ? there are some moments where i can let go of my past , but there are also other moments where i m immersed in my past thoughts and memories because they resurface so dramatically .","275543":"do you mean dictates ? if so , then a variety of factors genetics , environmental influences , the person s natural personality , who they surround themselves with , their interests , hormones brain chemistry , etc etc .","275544":"that isn t necessarily true either . someone s gender doesn t really define how complicated or simple they may be .","275545":"humankind as a whole is both simple and complicated . that doesn t necessarily mean that s true for individuals , though .","275546":"both , simultaneously .","275547":"i m not in the path of the two hurricanes , but i experienced hurricane sandy in .","275548":"it doesn t sway me either way . i don t care about how old i might look , lol people have said i look both younger older than my actual age .","275549":"no , that isn t weird to think that way . i would bring it up to him gently and ask if he s okay or going through anything , because sometimes environmental issues and even changes in medication if that s applicable can cause low libido . there are also a lot of other reasons why someone could be having sex less than usual , but yeah .","275550":"hopefully soon .","275551":"not necessarily . they could just be experiencing low libido .","275552":"depends on the individual person , lol . everyone will feel differently about it

religion since that can be highly personal for them not everyone owes you an explanation for their beliefs . however , if you are questioning about their religion and are challenging their beliefs , with the knowledge that your friend doesn t want to discuss it , i don t really believe that ending the friendship over that is warranted unless they go too far and insult your religion or you in the

perfectionism . weaknesses mental illness . relying too much on the approval of my supervisor . getting frustrated very easily .","275612":"i mean , you shouldn t be disliking your significant other ,
