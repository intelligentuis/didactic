Does it still hurt? Because of the does there's tons of different remedies that you can do that you can look up online. Including one with gargling hydrogen peroxide, warm water, salt and mint mouthwash together. (GARGLE ONLY. DO NOT SWALLOW) Gargling that three to four times and then going lay down without eating or drinking for 3 minutes. Preferably go to sleep on that. What that hydrogen peroxide and those ingredients do they attack the acids that are hurting your throat and cause them to deteriorate and it causes a scab and makes sore throat shortened. But it depends if your throat is already raspy that means that you are past the hurting stages and don't need the hydrogen peroxide and those ingredients. At this point it seems that you have probably had a sinus drainage with the acids in your throat and you are now in the last stages of it you...\n  \n  If you do use the hydrogen peroxide you only a little bit. The warm water is for soothing. The salt is for drying which is what you want and the mint mouthwash is also for soothing and other reasons to help.\n  \n  Probably calling your doctor and asking for medication. I'm not sure what they're prescribed....probably steroids and\/or allergy medicines. But I don't know exactly what you have and what stage you're in... But consulting with your doctor is probably the best thing for you to do.\n  \n  Also eating and drinking things that are sugary. Things that provide vitamin C. Staying hydrated. Lots of showers. The changing of your clothes daily are good for you when you are sick. Not sleeping in a room that is really hot. Make sure your AC filters in your house are cleaned\/ changed or just make sure the air around you is cleaned.\n  \n  Another good help...\n  \n  Ricola cough drops. Chloraseptic spray. Warm tea, raw honey, lemon, little salt and a little whisky help.\n  \n  Warm tea, Lemon, honey again.\n  \n  Peppermints.\n  \n  Orange juice.\n  \n  And more.\n  ","50192":"\n  Right\n  ","50193":"\n  Tiny person.
