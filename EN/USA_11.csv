  Are you talking about flipping people off? because I could see why they would all get angry if you’re calling everyone a bitch? Because holding the middle finger up a.k.a. “the bird” is technically calling a person a bitch. And if you’re walking around and showing it to everyone that you’re calling everyone a bitch.
  
  But if you’re talking about something else pertaining to that certain video game then I don’t know? ?‍♀️
  
  I walk around in Elder Scrolls Online wish I could do that, but if I do ? I’d probably get banned offline. Then mutherfuckers are a group of sorry ass snowflakes. ? I love the game and all, but some of those people take some of that shit way too seriously..

   If you cut off someone from your job because they’re spreading rumors, then they make a fake page cursing you out, what do you do? Need advice not to hurt this person
  ","
  Honestly it’s kinda too late you shouldn’t have fed into any of the bullshit from the start. You ignore petty drama bullshit and do your job, get your paycheck and go the fuck home. Your not their to make friends. Your there to do your job and that’s it.
  
  Don’t beat the shit outta them... Unburn the bridge you’ve build or attempt.. or tell a supervisor and then just start over from there and just do your job best, how you know it. Get along with your boss. That’s all you need to do. I think. That’s just coming from me though. Don’t go to jail over some petty bullshit.. go to jail for fighting for your life or something. Not for someone that honestly doesn’t have anything better to do in their life but to create a page to humiliate somebody. That’s pretty petty if you asked me and isn’t worth going to jail over. Be the bigger person.

  I don’t understand what the fuck you’re trying to say but my opinion on love is that it is great if you are looking for it the right way and are being loyal and faithful to that one. Also the key to a relationship is attention. Show attention. Want attention. Care and communicate. Don’t rush love. But actually look thoroughly. Don’t take the 1st opportunity and seem desperate. Have confidence and a little bit of an ego. Self esteem. Believe in yourself that you can do it. Don’t give up constantly. And when you think you have met the right person you need to first make a friendship with that person and then work on a relationship. But yeah. Hopefully in all what I said, I answered your question because I did not understand anything that you asked.

   How to be a morning person?
  ","
  Wake up when the sun wakes you up.
  
  I started doing that this week and it helps me get up.
  
  Learn to brush your teeth before bed. Don’t eat anything after. It helps when you wake up. Helps to not have your mouth too dry and then do it again when you wake up.
  
  Wash your face riiiight before going to sleep. Then when you wake up maybe have some wet wipes by your bed or a water bottle and a towel or napkin. wet it and wet your mouth, eyes, forehead, nose and neck and ears. Helps me wake up quick!
  
  I get on my phone for a few minutes or watch the news for about 10 minutes. Helps me see something slightly bright 1st thing in the morning and it helps me ear things.
  
  Try talking when you wake up. And yawning and stretching. Makes you feel like you had a great sleep and helps you prepare for morning movement.
  
  Make it cold when you go to sleep. Maybe keep a fan near.. so then when you wake up. You are able to turn it off. Do not have the fan facing towards your face and nose.. this is not good. It can cause you to get stuffy and sick.. ??
  
  When going to sleep, dress in very thin clothing unless you are a very cold person then bundle up! Helps for your comfort!
  
  Add more pillows than usual to your bed for comfort.
  
  Comfortable sheets and blankets are important.
  
  When you wake up. Choose to get dress 1st and brush your teeth and hair and shower/ wash face and look decent to feel more awake. I try to. Helps me wake up in clean clothes and feeling cleaned.
  
  Lastly.. eat something.. maybe something light or a breakfast ? ? item or a rice cake or some sort of a granola bar.
  
  If you don’t have lotta ideas for breakfast items. Look up on Google lists of breakfast items.
  
  Night time preparation to have a good morning ☀️ ? waking up and then morning preparations to having an awesome morning and fantastic day!
  
  If you are working at some sort of a job.. maybe try waking up extra early and maybe try going to sleep a bit early... I’m a gamer and I like my midnight plays.. so the time I lay down is 12:30 and I wake up at 8:30-9
  
  That is about 9 hours of sleep. I like my sleep. You only need 6-8 hours of sleep, but I choose to sleep a bit longer. I wake up and do all this! I feel great! I have dogs too and I try to go out with them and just stand outside for a minute or two. This helps me wake up as well in the morning.
  
  Hope I helped! Cause these are things that help me be a morning person. Do most to all and you will be too!

  Intelligence and smarts and know lots of different skills.

  Depends on the situation because some listen and some don’t.

  With stupid people that are dangerous it’s better to just mind your own business and ignore them and get away from them as far as possible.
  
  People that are simply just making a mistake and are making themselves look stupid it is better to try your best to smooth over a learning process for them. It’s called being caring. It won’t work all the time but hey at least you were trying your best to work with people. Some people can do this and some people can’t.

  True story that I am about to tell ya.
  
  Was asleep next to my husband and on the wall, I have a Mardi Gras mask. If you don’t know what it is, real quick go and google it. It is awesome. I am coon ass French, southern cajun French. Indian and a little Irish in my family. Mostly Cajun French. But I got that mask during Mardi Gras and the parades down here in Louisiana where I’m from originally. I am not specifying where. I brought it here and it sits on the wall now. Are moved to Mississippi. But umm... we got up in the middle of the night to go to the restroom. On our way back into the room, we started to lay back down. As we started to lay back down, my mask on the wall is quickly lifted, disturbed and then quickly stops moving immediately.
  
  We had a fan on, but it wasn’t pointed towards it and it does move throughout the night slightly, but I have never seen it just jolt and then it stop all the sudden? Immediately.
  
  Newton’s law of motion did not play role in the object continuing its motion. If it has moved or was pushed or was lifted? wouldn’t it have to continue its motion? I’m not no genius.. but I know basic physics. It did not apply here. It was shoved to move and then abruptly stopped. I asked him if he saw that happen? Him a skeptic, said yes.
  
  I said was that normal? He waited a minute and looked at the mask and thought a second and thought the same as me, no.
  
  I have researched the paranormal off and on for the past decade and enjoy the subject and haven’t had a ton of activity happen to me in my life, but that definitely was something.
  
  May I remind you I just moved here. Yeah... true story. I have heard unexplained knocks and sounds throughout the house, but nothing fully bold to say that it’s haunted, no. Hopefully it’s not, cause I sleep here! I am so used to going to the houses, I don’t wanna live in one!
  
  Again.
  
  This is a true story.

  All Cabaret Singers
  
  Cabaret is a form of theatrical entertainment featuring music, song, dance, recitation, or drama. It is mainly distinguished by the performance venue, which might be a pub, a restaurant or a nightclub with a stage for performances. The audience, often dining or drinking, does not typically dance but usually sits at tables. Performances are usually introduced by a master of ceremonies or MC. The entertainment, as done by an ensemble of actors and according to its European origins, is often (but not always) oriented towards adult audiences and of a clearly underground nature. In the United States striptease, burlesque, drag shows, or a solo vocalist with a pianist, as well as the venues which offer this entertainment, are often advertised as cabarets.

59440,"
   If your crush has fallen for someone uglier than you does that mean you have a less chance or more chance ?
  ","
  I would’ve lost interest. I would want my crushes to swing high all the time.
  
  I don’t have any crushes. Didn’t have too many as a kid or teen and usually if I wanted someone I made it known. I never kept it from them as a secret. But if they are with someone, be careful not to interfere too much because you don’t wanna start drama. Don’t medal. If thy are available, go for them. If they do not have some sort of life successes or goals, at least try to care for themselves why try? They have got to care for themselves mentally and physically (hygiene is important). Attitude matters.
  
  Don’t try to swing low when you get people but don’t go for the hottest model on the block either. Have some confidence in yourself when trying to find someone right for you. Ladies like to see that. You want to make sure that you’re able to take care of not only yourself but the other person as well. That other person that you find needs to be able to take care of themselves and also you was well also. It’s same both ways. You want to at least try to get these types of things in a row.

   What's the best dating advice you have?
  ","
  Guys, every single girl is 100% different.
  
  So go into each new relationship open minded and starting fresh.
  
  Guys, don’t bring her home on the first day.
  
  Do not talk about your other relationships with her.
  
  Do not take her somewhere shitty on the first few dates.
  
  Be honest with her.
  
  Do not pressure her into doing anything.
  
  Protect her at all costs, even when she doesn’t want you to.
  
  Go into a relationship with confidence and try not show your insecurities so much yet. Don’t be Jumping into a new relationship and being cocky.
  
  Treat her like she’s your angel and never put a hand on her. You are a man, not a coward, so do not under any circumstance try and control her. You are not intimidating to your woman. You should purely be her world. When she’s upset give her space. Listen to her. Trust her abilities. And lastly guys.. so important.. your body is also your sanctuary, just because you meet a girl.. do not let every single woman touch it.
  
  Girls, when you go out with a guy do not play him and lead him on.
  
  Girls, do not aggravate the shit out of your man.
  
  Understand the abilities that your man can do.
  
  Girls, all guys are different so when you go into a new relationship be open minded and treat them as if it was a new relationship, and start fresh.
  
  Don’t tell your daddy about him at least for the first week, but still tell people about him for safety precautions.
  
  Do not let a guy pressure you into doing anything.
  
  Your body is your sanctuary you are pure and you are a woman, respect all of that.
  
  Have your own control over yourself and only. Do not purely control him. Let him have space. Not only make a relationship with him but for my friendship first.

   Favorite summer memory?
  ","
  Probably the one year that I went canoeing with my volleyball team. It was really fun. We traveled miles and miles down the river in little boats and had a blast, jumping into the water and cooking and camping together. We all got sunburned and we’re all aching after together. Hahahahaha. ? I got to be with my team. And on my volleyball team are some of my best friends so we had the time of our life’s together.
  
  I went to Florida a few years and that was awesome, because we stayed at a really nice hotels. Went to the beach and swam in really cool pools. All of the activities were very fun and we got to go and eat it really nice places.. Ya know.. now a days nobody gets to do things like this because it’s so expensive. I definitely don’t get to do that a lot and it was nice. Got to go with my family. I like to go on vacation with my family.
  
  Another good memory was spending the summer with my fiance, his family and our pups. We were in a long-distance relationship for about five years and now we’re together. But we could only see each other so many times throughout the year. The summer we spent together was fun with everybody. We had fun in the sun with everyone. Good memories.

  ","
  I never knew this person but, I wish she was still alive. She was my idol, my inspiration in my life, someone so kind and someone I looked up to. Her momma had cancer.. and was fighting back and forth with it. I have watched her from day one grow as a star and she was on The Voice, if you don’t know Adam Levine or The voice you can look it up. You can look Christina up on YouTube at ZELDA LOVE. Look Adam Levine up on Youtube through the VEVO channel and you can check out him and his encounters with Christina Grimmie. She was so nice and loved by many.. She was murdered, shot and killed a couple years ago... you should look her up she’s the sweetest person in the world and is an amazing Christian. She is beautiful.. if you go and look her up it will tell you all about her and how she got shot. She was shot at a meet and greet. Rushed to the ICU and died there.. no one deserves to die.. but she certainly did not deserve to die. She was not ready to go. I still mourn from today over that.
  
  I also wish my cat was back in my life. She disappeared this year I had her in my life for over 12 years. Awesome cat. She’s been stolen from me. Found and got her back. It’s been a few years now since that happened and now she has disappeared again. I think she went off and died somewhere because she wasn’t looking the greatest. It’s okay.. just miss her.
  
  I wish my grandfather was back in my life. He was a wonderful person. Can you talk me all kinds of silly things. He was hard on me but he wanted the best for me. He was a wonderful person and a hard worker and a hero in multiple different ways. He save lives in many different ways. Miss you Paw Paw!

  Many long extended definitions to what love is..
  
  And some information from the urban dictionary that I agree with I will state bellow.
  
  love ISN'T when you want or need to be with them every second of the day
  
  love IS when the time you spend with them is perfect, and the time you spend apart is equally as good
  
  love ISN'T when you depend on them and your whole life revolves around them
  
  love IS when they are a perfect addition to your life, it doesn't make everything else seem perfect, it makes everything else bareable and manageable
  
  they help you grow as a person, and make you a better person and feel better about yourself and life in general
  
  love ISN'T when you hate saying goodbye
  
  love IS when you see ""goodbye"" as the possibility of saying ""hello"" all over again
  
  love DOESN'T cover their flaws
  
  love DOES show their flaws for all they are, but you love their imperfections, cuz it makes them who they are, and you love and accept them for everything they are
  
  love grows
  
  and encourages growth
  
  love isn't perfect
  
  but it's always close
  
  love,
  
  real true love,
  
  is the best thing that will ever happen to you

  Usually when I smell something, I can taste in my mouth.

  Ummm no because your not exactly “sighting” them, but emotions can progress and a relationship can be formed shortly. It can also work out perfectly.

  could typically be also love at first sight being there looking on point and looking healthy, look nice, hygiene?
  
  But no. I do not believe that you can spot love at first sight through the Internet. I do believe you can, believe in love at 1st vibe maybe? Thought. And if you are strictly focusing on looks that’s not a good way to go about things.. you could have a beautiful woman or handsome man but they have an awful attitude. They could one day take everything you own. So I definitely believe in love at first vibe more. That a good view?

  and encourages growth.
  
  Absence strengthens love.
  
  Love isn't perfect
  
  but it's always close.
  
  Communication is key.
  
  Not only make a relationship with that person, but a friendship 1st.
  
  Here’s some more.
  
  - Quotes from and Urban dictionary style -
  
  Here we go.
  
  None of these definitions that I have read are a true definition of love
  
  That is infatuation,
  
  obsession,
  
  lonliness,
  
  despair,
  
  or any combination of the above
  
  Love ISN'T when you want or need to be with them every second of the day
  
  love IS when the time you spend with them is perfect, and the time you spend apart is equally as good
  
  Love ISN'T when you depend on them and your whole life revolves around them.
  
  Love IS when they are a perfect addition to your life, it doesn't make everything else seem perfect, it makes everything else bareable and manageable

   What does friendship mean to you? What should your friend be like? Do you have a lot of friends? What could be your reasons for discontinuing friendship with a person?
  ","
  This is quite a few questions just saying..
  
  ——————
  
  What does friendship mean to me?
  
  Friendship means a lot to me. My friends mean a lot to me. I feel like friends keep your socializing and positive. I feel like everyone should have some sort of friendship and everyone does whether they realize it or not, whether it be small or large. Whether it be with an animal or human. Friendships are made every single day.
  
  ——
  
  What should my friend be like??
  
  I don’t understand this question?? I mean? my friends are going to be different from any other person’s friends? and your friends? because were all different, ya know?
  
  Unless you’re meaning influential? Friends should be positive, outgoing, trustful, honest, loyal in ways, keep you out of trouble and safe, out of harms way, real, kind to you, at least partially healthy decisions both physically and mentally. Some of these aspects should be in a friend.
  
  ——
  
  Do I have a lot of friends?
  
  I mean I feel like I have a lot of friends. I have people that look up to me. I have people that I look up to. I have lots of actual friends in many different places all over the world. And then I have friends that are right in front of me. I have family from different parts of the world. And then I have family right in front of me. To me I see no difference family and friends are all family. What I am trying to say is I have people that know me worldwide, both friends and family. Honest. So yes. I would say I have quite the bit of friends. Both girls and boys. It’s OK to step out of your comfort zone and explore different cultures and traditions. I feel like that makes you (us) smarter.
  
  ——
  
  What could be my reasons for discontinuing a friendship with a person?
  
  If they are negatively impacting my life or a negative influence? That could be a reason for discontinuing a friendship with that person. I can forgive people but it depends on the level of the decision... you only get one life. There are slight mistakes that could be made, possible regrets, but you only get one life? Is it really worth it? You want to live your life to the fulllist and in a happy healthy way too.
  
  This is a lot of questions but I guess I see why you asked them all together because they are related.
  
  Hopefully I can answer the questions well enough for ya.

  ","
  Don’t be too over obsessive  (not saying your doing this, but...) with the person that you’re with. Some advice there. That will run them away..
  
  It is OK for her to hug a guy? 2 guys? Their people, just like girls are. We are all huggable... but not like 50 guys?? Ya know what I mean. Specially if she’s trying to do it to make you angry, that’s not right.
  
  Also ask for her intentions on that if seeming suspicious...
  
  Also another thing if you can’t trust them.. then why are you with them?
  
  I am being honest and trying to help is all not trying to offend.
  
  Trust, loyalty communication is all important in a relationship. Not only to make a relationship with them but to form a bond, a friendship.
  
  If their intentions turn out to being bad or malicious or selfish then it may not be a healthy relationship. Find ways to make it work. Talk to each other. If you can’t talk to your other.. then what is the point of the relationship? If ya know what I mean. You should be able to talk to them about anything and everything. That one of them biggest points of a relationship.

  I’m about to find a job that I’m going to try to stay at for a while or forever. Hopefully.
  
  I enjoy gardening, being creative, helping people, socializing and cooking. I like to work with animals. And so far I’ve only been here for a week and I am already seeing job opportunities in these fields for me. This makes me happy and is technically the future if you think about it? I expect big things for me in the future. Good, bigger and better things and a family.
  
  Though my actual family is far away I hope to stay productive and in contact with them still fully. That’s what I hope remains. I love and miss them.
  
  Worked really hard to get where I’m at now. Years and years of hard work, patience and saving money. I’m happy. I am more than happy to expand my family from the Louisiana border all the way over the Mississippi!

  ","
  Be careful and make sure she’s not with the dude at all when you go back to Ohio. You don’t want conflict. But if she’s for sure done with him then he can’t do anything about it. But like I said just make sure for less drama. Ya know? Bs? You don’t want all that bullshit. If she broke up with him fair and square that he can’t say shit to you. Plus the dude is no good for her if he’s on drugs. He’s not good for anyone. Don’t exactly just swoop in and save her? because then you could just simply be a rebound... go actually if she really wants to try it again with you. You’ve got things to live for. Don’t get into much trouble with that guy. He’s not worth it. After all..? he’ll go to jail eventually with those drugs. Pieces of shit never win. Hopefully she’s not too enthused with the guy and his bad boy, trashy like mischief. You need to explain to her, under any circumstance.. it is not good to be around drugs. Even if they’re not offering them to you? that does not matter, it’s not a good environment.
  
  Hopefully this helps.
  
  Good luck.  ? ??

Don’t take much to excite me honestly. Museums. Movies ? Site seeing. Going to the casinos or get something to drink. I don’t really gamble that much at all. 1 or 2 times a year.

  Describe myself as very abrupt with people. I do see myself as a nice person but am taking a vantage of way too much. I am easily misunderstood. I find it hard to comprehend people. Understand specifics in questions. I tend to be exact about stuff and I don’t mean to be. Take a lot of things literal because life is literal and realistic? I do know how to take a joke, of course, but I just don’t know sometimes when people are joking? Ya know? I don’t realize things sometimes and don’t mean to do it at all. I try to think before I speak, but sometimes it doesn’t work. I try my best at things that’s literally the best way to describe myself. Stay determined. Describe myself very scruffy, tomboy, punkish, & slightly tough. Not some scary, intimidating, and mean person. No.

   Favorite singer ,and why
  ","
  I’m going to say two of my favorite singers and why if that’s okay.
  
  Christina Grimmie
  
  She was just amazing at singing. Hundred percent spectacular. Just a very talented and beautiful voice. Literally the best person I’ve ever heard sing. Not only was she the best person I have ever heard sing, but she was just the kindest person. Even growing through the fame didn’t get to her. she just kept her pureness. She was such a Christian. Was just so kind people. She had the sweetest and bubbliest personality. She was hilarious. So funny. She sadly was killed during a fan meet up. She was just getting her way up in the Fame world. She had just won and came off of The Voice. She was just exceedingly successful. Everybody could see the raw talent this girl had. She was not ready to go.. at all. :( For me she wasn’t. I cried for weeks and literally months after.. Her first year anniversary since she’s been gone just passed... even if I didn’t know her. I felt like I did and it’s still hard listening her music. She’s what I turned to and said you know what? There really is good people in the world! ? Music is my Safe haven I turn to when I’m upset or feeling alone. Her music was and still is. Rest in peace Angel.
  
  Christiana ?
  
  ——
  
  Throughout my life.
  
  Avril Lavigne has always been my idol.
  
  Still today I listen to her new and old music. I grew up a skater girl, hard tomboy, punkie type girl. I would play in the mud. The boys more than girls. I would play Street football ? and Street basketball ?. We would play baseball out in a handmade field that we out together.
  
  Avril Lavigne’s music I just grew up through.
  
  My sister kinda introduced her to me.. Thanks for that Sam! But we both loved her a lot. We both grew up through her music. Avril and my sister are what got me started singing! ? Which is what I love the most to do. She was just straight up idol to us. We loved Avril Lavigne and still do!
  "

   Favorite books to read ,and why
  ","
  Don’t read much.
  
  Reasons being, I have a bad reading disorder called dyslexia. I use audio recordings sometimes when I read and it helps reads the book to me as I’m going along.
  
  Sometimes I use different highlighters or sheets that are highlighted to read through the book.
  
  Sometimes I have to use a ruler.
  
  ——
  
  But here some books that I did enjoy reading ? and listening ? to.
  
  ——
  
  Where the red Fern grows. It was a book on a little one growing up and learning the ropes in life. With 2 pups along the way. You should look into reading these books. ?
  
  It’s just a fun book. ? That I read with very deep meaning. Good book. I want to get into much detail.
  
  ——
  
  Max the Almighty.
  
  Max the Almighty had a lot about bullying and stuff. I don’t remember too much. My memory is crap.
  
  ——
  
  The Giver was a good book. Good movie. ? ? makes you realize life isn’t perfect. But even if it was. This is how it go. Read the book to find out what I mean.
  
  ——
  
  (I had to read these for school. At the end of each book. ? ? ? I felt like it taught me something.)

   What is the secret to a happy life? ?®
  ","
  Be positive.
  
  Live a little.
  
  Go out and socialize.
  
  Do things that you wouldn’t. But do them accordingly. Think smart.
  
  Seek some sort of education throughout your life. Be successful with that some sort of education.
  
  Make close relationships with your friends and family. Go out and have fun with friends and family. Take road trips. Express your favorite hobbies and talents with them.
  
  Explore nature alone.
  
  Then explore nature with people.
  
  Maybe meditate or exercise occasionally.
  
  Eat a moderately healthy diet.
  
  Care for people.
  
  Help other people even when not asked.
  
  Do for others even if they don’t do for you.
  
  Volunteer work.
  
  Buy something for someone random that you know. Tell them you don’t want nothing in return.
  
  Buy something for someone you don’t know.
  
  Then tell them you don’t want anything back in return.
  
  Do random kind gestures.
  
  Be a lady or gentleman in life.
  
  Get you a regular job and work your ass off. Go buy something that doesn’t make sense with that money that you worked your ass off for. (Don’t do this all the time.) Enjoy that item. Appreciate that item. Live life. I feel like these are the keys to happiness.

  If you’ve ever heard of the Mississippi River. Well it’s a humongous river. It’s one of the widest rivers in the world.
  
  Well there is levee’s that hold it back because the water rises very high at some times of the year. Well up here on these levee walls, there are very beautiful views. Scenery is just absolutely insane. You can see over the city ? here. It’s absolutely stunning.
  
  Well the reason why this is my favorite place to visit is because my grandfather when he was still alive this was his favorite place to go with or without somebody. Every time I go up there, I feel like I am up there with him. I feel like I’m in a very happy and spiritual place. I feel like he is standing right next to me. I miss my grandfather.. He was a wonderful person. Definitely. He taught me a lot in life.

   Tell me about your flaws ?
  ","
  Me, I try to be pretty honest about my flaws. I have quite a few.
  
  I like to talk a lot. Some people think that that is annoying but honestly I don’t think people know what they want? In this world ?? Because sometimes I don’t talk a lot and they get mad when I don’t talk more? It doesn’t really make any sense. I guess you can’t please everyone and anyone honestly. But that’s one of my flaws.
  
  Besides my real bad reading disorders and anxiety problems. I have problems with my eyes  adjusting to different lighting‘s. Say I went from going inside to outside and it’s really dark for my eyes it would take longer for them to adjust than the normal eye. Considering I’ve never been checked by a doctor on this I don’t know if this is normal or not? But I feel like it’s not. Can’t see that well at night or in the dark at all. Sometimes my eyes adjust and sometimes they don’t at all. So therefore that means I can’t really drive at night. Sucks.
  
  I do get really aggravated easily. Trying to work on that I just have really bad pet peeves.
  
  I have really bad compulsive OCD. Meaning my anxiety leads to repetitive overactive routines and really aggravated compulsions.
  
  I don’t really like it when people touch me. I like things very neat and clean. If I see something out of order, I have to fix it. Not like big things, just like if a room is a little messy, I have to try to tidy it up a bit. If I don’t do it, then I tend to get really upset and little anxiety comes in.
  
  I mean it’s not like I am psycho and trying to kill people? I just have some anxiety that needs releasing and I release it through cleaning. It makes me feel good when I complete something. So I try to be really determined about things. That’s a good thing.
  
  —-
  
  ... So really bad cleaning problems. Organization freak.
  
  Quite a bit of phobias. Claustrophobia. Touch phobia. Have bad driving phobia.
  
  Get easily aggravated. That’s pet peeve’s, but don’t we all have them?
  
  Talk a lot & have moments when I stay mute. Times when I don’t talk enough and times that I do not talk enough. Lol XD this one keeps me confused still. I think this is just human? What do I know? Lol.
  
  Overactive compulsion disorder OCD I have dealt with this for over 10 years.
  
  A lot of anxiety from having really bad reading problems as a kid. Was bullied a lot for my disabilities. Got special treatment in school because I really did struggle with ?. reading and comprehension. People thought it was unfair. But I wasn’t passing because of the disability was alway holding me down... I worked hard every day... I studied. I wasn’t a bad kid. I paid attention in school. I took tons of notes ?.
  
  But this being also known as Dyslexia. I was slightly diagnosed in the first grade with it and then again in the 8th. They were for sure I had it. It’s a struggle throughout my day today life. There isn’t anything I can’t not do. I still try my best to complete things that are a little more challenging. Still human. We all have flaws.

A lot of it is just beautiful, is history, and is just spiritual. It is a hobby I enjoy every much. Not really any super natural powers that come with it? I mean... there is people that are medians and that are sensitive to the unknown paranormal world. But that’s not really a supernatural power. It’s just a talent that some people are blessed with.

   What’s the nicest thing a complete stranger has done for you or vice versa?
  ","
  I paid for this ladies groceries that was not fully English and didn’t understand that she owed me more money. But that was okay.. I could understand her a little and she could understand me a little.. but not much. So I just paid for it for her stuff, she didn’t have enough. She had kids with her and all she had was groceries to feed them. So I was like why not? I didn’t have much to give, but I knew she needed a hand. She then noticed after what I did and was surprised. I still don’t know if she understood what happened or what I was saying, but I think she caught on when she saw me swipe my card. A few months later, maybe a few weeks or so, she came back and bought me a dozen of roses. I didn’t want anything in return but I didn’t know she already bought and paid for them. She gave them to me and thanked me over and over again. She said, “You help me out, so that is for you. “ (something like that she said) It warmed my heart.. That was the nicest thing anyone’s ever done for me that I didn’t know at all. That was a stranger. ♥️

   How can we admire people ,and why
  ","
  I still don’t really understand what you’re asking.
  
  Do you mean like how do you can I love someone? And why?
  
  I mean that’s how life works. We meet people, we love people, we don’t like people. I mean we are only people. We all have opinions of who we’d like to be around.
  
  But we love people because of who they are. Sometimes we have things in common and we like that about them. Sometimes they are completely different and that’s also something that some people like. Sometimes they don’t want anything in common with that other person and they love that. I don’t know like I said we’re all different. We like different types of people to hang out with. I like people that are good influences. I don’t like people that are discriminative. I don’t like people that are just rude, disrespectful, have a little morals, and that don’t appreciate life. I don’t know if that answers your question. That’s the best way I understood the question. Sorry. You may have to ask it in a different way next time.

  Went out to eat at a really nice restaurant.
  
  We went to the river, this is where we ate at and we spent a few hours there. The weather felt great.
  
  After that I went back to visit where my Ma-mare and Pa-pare used to live and where I grew up at. We visited there for a little and then went and got coffee.

   What would you choose? & Why? 1.Power 2. Fame 3.Money.
  ","
  Mostly none of this would make you happy in the end.
  
  I mean I’ve always wanted to sing and be a little famous and get around but I would never want to be on top of the world famous.
  
  Power. if I had power I would use it in a good way. I would not abuse it.
  
  And money, with money you don’t get as many enemies as you with power and fame. This is something my friend just said, it makes alot of sense. At least with money you can keep quiet. In his opinion and I agree with it.
  
  I wouldn’t want millions and millions and millions of dollars, but just money.
  
  So of course, I could get a house for my family. Some vehicles for a family. Go to school. Get some doctoring done with myself. Go on a nice vacation. Have the wedding I’ve always wanted. Meet famous people I’ve always wanted to see in person. Go on explorations I’ve always wanted to go on and be able to pay for them.
  
  So I’d probably choose money, but I don’t really care too much for money. Honestly, if I possibly had a little bit more than what I have now, I could probably accomplish more. It would make my life a little easier. I wouldn’t want millions and billions of dollars. I would just be straight up miserable honestly.

Get out there more with the world and maybe inspire people even more than I already feel like I do. Would really enjoy doing that. That’s honestly probably my dream job.
  
  I love animals and plants so anything around that would be a dream job for me honestly.
  
  Absolutely love marine animals. Would love to work around those types of creatures.
  
  If I could do any sort of hurricane pick up, cleaning, or preparation. I would like to do a job like that.
  
  I’ve always wanted to be a meteorologist but the amount of schooling it takes to get up there.. not worth it to me. Too much money. Too much time.
  
  I enjoy Cajun food. I am from the south. I like making boiled foods like boiled crawfish, boiled crabs, or ? boil shrimp ?. Like to make many southern dishes. I wouldn’t mind helping make some food ? taste yummy!

  ___
  
  I’m going to answer it saying the closest person to me would have to be my best friend Jason. We literally 100% adore one another. We trust and get along so well. We literally are inseparable. We live really far away from each other but we still somehow seem inseparable. We’re always communicating, calling one another, texting, Skyping, whatever! We are together. We always want to know what the other one is doing (in a good way) because it just simply infatuates us. We never leave a day untouched without including one another in it.
  
  Everything I’ve ever done he just thinks is beautiful, everything, in every way. And everything he does is just great! and is the greatest! He’s just so smart! It’s crazy! I love it! He’s handsome as hell and strong! He’s literally my everything, my best friend. He says I’m the only person that understands him truly. We just understand one another fully, honestly. We have been together for five years almost and I don’t regret a single day being with him. He’s the best person in the world to me. He is kind to me. He knows good people. He takes care of me. I care for him. Protects me and wants the best for me. I don’t think I could honestly picture a day without him and without him I don’t know what I would really do. Life without him would be quite empty.. He is the closest thing to me. ♥️ Jason

   If you found  a hundred  dollars on the grocery store floor would you :
A.) Keep it 
B.) Turn the money in
  ","
  I have found $100 on the floor at the store I work at. And I have turned it in and I found out who it was for and then returned it. My store awards honest behavior so if someone doesn’t come and get it by the end of the day they give it to you. I was happy that I found the person it was for. Because they were able to get their groceries.
  
  How did I know it was for them? because when they went to get their money they said that they had $100 and that it was gone. They knew nothing about the hundred that I found. So obviously it must’ve been for them and it happened right after I found the hundred. So I went back to the lost and found and I gave it to them.

   What questions do you usually ask when you want to get acquainted with someone?
  ","
  I mean they (the questions) could be anything. Anything to what they like? or to what they like to do maybe? Their favorite things? What’s their hobbies? Biggest fears? What they can’t stand? You can ask him anything almost. The problem is when asking questions, you don’t wanna get too detailed with the questions. People get personal and nosy. You don’t want to ask the person like... for example.. What street do they live on in the state that they live in? Or you don’t ask them where they live in the intentions of going there. Unless of course it is consented by that person, and that it is OK for you to go to that location. There’s nothing wrong with someone being interested in another person, BUT before you actually let it be known, check out the person‘s profile, their bios and just find out more information before asking questions, look at the basics. People forget these extra things that are there. They tend to not care, are lazy, don’t look and so forth. When someone obviously looks like they are in a relationship or are married, don’t interrogate them with questions and intention of being interested in them. Does that make any sense? Just common courtesy.
  
  I’m not talking about you. Like I’m not saying this to you. I just put in this context so maybe it would be better to understand.

  Bread that is dense, yet fluffy and soft, when on the search for the perfect muffaletta. When making the sandwich, the muffaletta loaf is split through the middle then stuffed with olive spread, cured meats such as ham, pepperoni, and salame, and a variety of cheeses such as Swiss, provolone, and mozzarella.
  
  So good!
  
  Origin: Italy

   I wish you had brown eyes...I am disappointed. ⬇⭐⭐⭐↩
  ","
  Wtf?
  
  1. Wtf does it matter what color my eyes are? And to you?
  
  2. My eyes are hazel which means that they are green, yellow, and brown. They change colors. They change to an occasional grey.
  
  3. That is the 1st time any has said anything bad about my eyes. Usually everyone’s crazy over my eyes.
  
  And you say disappointed??? It’s not like I chose the color of my eyes? Wtf? I was born with them??
  
  Lastly? Eyes are so unimportant in a person. All it is is a characteristic. That’s it. Looks and characteristics should be the last thing that you look in a person. If that’s what you look at that that’s sad.
  
  Look at the characteristics of their personality.

   How can you change the World?
  ","
  Do you mean as a whole? The world? I’m trying to think... is this some sort of a category or something? I’m trying to think of a way to answer this question. There’s just so many ways you could answer this question. I do not know if I will answer it in the right way your asking.
  
  How can you (you, me, us) change the world? Honestly this question is actually kinda hard to answer or at least for me it is.. I’ll try. because this is like a whole question, type thing? Idk. Here we go...
  
  Honestly, you can do any action and it change the world whether it’s good  or not.
  
  But environmentally, emotionally, socially, politically, physically, mentally, traditionally, culturally... etc.. we can change the world.
  
  All of that can result in a worldly change. It’s just up to people to choose to do it and in a positive way.
  
  *Me* as an individual *I* myself feel like I have in some ways, may have changed the world. Everyday I try to be kind and as helpful as possible.
  
  I treat people the way that they would treat me. If people choose to do something very nice for me obviously I’m going to say thank you and try to return the kind act. Be realistic, and remain trustful at the same time. Not hurt or be offensive.
  
  I try to help elderly people, the blind and deaf. I have penpals from all over the world and some that speak many different languages. I still try to translate and talk to them no matter what kind of barrier is in the way. I try to keep them company. I know American sign language in Spanish. (Language for the deaf and Spainish) I know a tad bit of Spanish sign language. I know some forms of braille. (Language for the blind) any other language I know how to translate from their native language to English. I try to let them feel more comfortable talking to me then me talking to them. When talking to them I let them speak their native language and then I figure out what they’re trying to talk to me about. Non-stress conversation for them.. I try to make it.
  
  I used to volunteer at a food pantry that my grandmother and grandfather were in charge of and would help feed some of the poorly living people down here in Louisiana sometime hurricane victims. I did that on and off for years and years, probably over 10 years? Yeah. About.
  
  I research the paranormal heavily. Occasionally I get people that need help with certain things going on in their life in this area and I try my best to openly help them as much as I can. Freely.
  
  I work at a convenience store and try to openly help people with anything they need in the area. Tourists that sometimes need answers. Just try to be as convenient as I can about things.
  
  Enough about me!! I know this question is about how I can change the world. But honestly every day each one of us wake up and decide to do something in a day it’s changing the world. So when you decide to wake up tomorrow make sure you think twice before you do something, because it is impacting our every day life’s!!! ^_^ -

   Two people that flirt a lot and it's obvious that they like eachother?
  ","
  Well.. for one it depends on the intentions of each person. People aren’t perfect. One person might enjoy flirting just to flirt because it something they just like to do and they might not be taking the flirting to the extreme thought of liking that other person. If that makes any sense.
  
  No, thats not always the case sadly. If two people flirting together all the time, it doesn’t mean that they like each other automatically. It **shows** that they may.. but you never know until you know the intentions of each person. (Also you have to take in that one person could be leading on the other, which honestly.. is not good.)
  
  You would have to honestly ask each person. Hope that answers the question well.

  And than there's football! I will sit down occasionally and watch it with them, but we have huge get togethers and the t.v. plays a a big part in some of the get togethers. Like I said, considering that is the reason of the get together.

  The Chorus from Parabola
  
  “This body, this body holding me
  
  Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
  
  This body, this body holding me
  
  Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion”
  
  Whats hitting the entirety now
  
  Another song by Tool, the entire song “Schism”
  
  “I know the pieces fit
  
  'Cause I watched them fall away
  
  Mildewed and smoldering
  
  Fundamental differing
  
  Pure intention juxtaposed
  
  Will set two lovers' souls in motion
  
  Disintegrating as it goes
  
  Testing our communication
  
  The light that fueled our fire then
  
  Has burned a hole between us so
  
  We cannot seem to reach an end
  
  Crippling our communication
  
  I know the pieces fit
  
  'Cause I watched them tumble down
  
  No fault, none to blame
  
  It doesn't mean I don't desire
  
  To point the finger, blame the other
  
  Watch the temple topple over
  
  To bring the pieces back together
  
  Rediscover communication
  
  The poetry that comes from the squaring off between
  
  And the circling is worth it
  
  Finding beauty in the dissonance
  
  There was a time that the pieces fit
  
  But I watched them fall away
  
  Mildewed and smoldering
  
  Strangled by our coveting
  
  I've done the math enough to know
  
  The dangers of our second guessing
  
  Doomed to crumble unless we grow
  
  And strengthen our communication
  
  Cold silence has a tendency to
  
  Atrophy any sense of compassion
  
  Between supposed lovers (2x)
  
  I know the pieces fit (8x)

  Because people are greedy.  when they hear that somebody has money- their attitude changes- their character changes- the judgment changes- and they show you their true side. Which is greedy, ungrateful, fuck who would probably try and screw you over to get their money the first chance they get.

  I went with loyalty because for me loyalty is everything. If it’s a part of everything that we do. It a part of work, it’s a part of family, friends, relationships.
  
  If you lose that sense of loyalty with somebody- you lose more than that. you lose your sense of trust and commitment. Helping a fellow friend. Being Faithful to your significant other. Or just about anybody you deem close.
  
  For me it goes for everything like if you’re my friend I’m gonna stay loyal to you as my friend. I’m always going to have your back. I’m always gonna be there for you. I’m always willing to go through this shit with you. the same goes for family. the same goes for a lot of things

   Don't give up. I believe in you. Keep fighting. You're gonna make it through
  ","
  Why... all I have done is cared about each and every fucking person around me... to go through and stand right next to them to make sure they didn’t have to go through whatever it is alone.
  
  NOT ONCE has anyone done that for me. NOT ONCE has someone offered me help when it was obvious I was hurting. THERE HAS ONLY BEEN ONE PERSON who has noticed that something was wrong or bothering me. It was my producer and she gave me a cupcake with an m&m smile on it. I fucking cried. Because as little of a gesture it was. It was the fact the she was the only person to ever notice, and she was the only one to actually say/do something nice.
  
  But since then, that was 2013 mind you... and since there has one other person asked to see if I’m alright, is everything alright. Not one person who’ was ever there evenwhen they said they’would be.. no one had kept there. So why?!
  
  Why should I keep continuing with trying to help others who either don’t want it or don’t care to notice it.
  
  When can I just give up on everyone and finally just focus on my self. Because every single time I help someone to be in a better place, I always end up being the one who’s gets broken into pieces because of the weight of the situation.
  
  I’m tired. I’m so fucking tired.  I so sad and depressed for so goddamn long and no one noticed or no one put a hand out to help me for sinking in my depression. Until I met someone who unknown their knowledge took it all away. And when they left without a word, I was crushed like I was back to the beginning.
  
  I don’t ask anyone to take some of my burdens, or ask them to do things for me, I ask for nothing!
  
  I legit feel dead inside at times bc of that feeling.
  
  Do you know what that’s like?!
  
  To be the one who’d do any and everything for someone, take help take a burden to always be there for a friend or a loved one... just so they have a chance at being happy, yet no one is willing to do that for you?
  
  It’s fucking soul crushing. I’m fucking breaking down just writing this because I don’t have any one I can just talk to about this. Just random fucking people who are asking me me random questions ... I might as well answer them on here.  It’s not going to change the situation at all. No ones gonna hear them; no one is going to read them.
  
  So trust me when I say, “yes. I keep fighting... I just don’t know if I should anymore....”
  
  The joyful and happy life that I want in life doesn’t want me,
  
  and doesn’t want my help...
  
  What do you say to someone who feels that way....
  
  Do they keep fighting?
  
  After all they’ve been through, who’s gonna be there for them when THEY NEED IT......
  
  what do they have to fight for? what? . more people who don’t give a fuck about them?

  They have ever right to be cautious. what if it has happened to them before and it didn’t end up being true and they actually got hurt.

  BELIEVE ME when I say, I’d do ANYTHING to make sure it’s out of your life. I don’t care if you end up hating me for it, but I promise you, it’s be worth it. Because at least you’d still alive to be able to hate me. That would make it worth it.....

  Then boom.
  
  The injury after was kind of a pain in the ass because I waited until after football season was over to have a surgery that probably wasn’t the best idea but at least I could play the rest of the season on and my knee will always be slacking in and out of that place my knee will always sort of fall like would been back in words it was it would be painful at times but I got so used to those kinds of fuck it the surgery itself was a cinch.
  
  it was done in no time and super quick. The doctor I had was fucking awesome. I wish I kept pictures of it but I had them give them to our athletic trainer because whenever students have surgeries and all the shit; we would give them to him because that’s just what we’d do. As a token of appreciation. They’re always be watching over us and like doing all the physical therapy with us and shit like that. Mike was the homie.

  Disconnect.

  You get a chance to to see what’s in front of you. You give your senses the ability to focus on things most people normally miss. you get a sense of what nature like is like, even if it’s from your balcony or window.
  
  You start appreciating everything that goes around you.
  
  I do it all the time, though I shouldn’t, ha. But you start to really to get an  appreciation for anything, everything and everyone around. You see life as it is. Well it’s like that for me. I don’t know if it’s like this for everybody else. I don’t take for granted and come to appreciate the value each and every moment we spend not only just being alive. But spending those moments around those we love.

   What would you do with a billion dollars?
  ","
  I would split that into 4 quarters.
  
  Then I’d take the first 25% and put that into a bank account that wouldn’t be touch unless 1000000000% absolutely needed.
  
  I’d take the 2nd 25% piece and invest. In risking tech/ others start up companies that all have the potential to explode. Surprisingly, I’ve been pretty on the nose about these types of things.
  
  Hint hint.
  
  Give me your money to invest.
  
  You won’t be Disappointed
  
  I’d take the 3rd 25% piece and pay off any and all outstanding debts. As well as any accounts as needed. Then use it to take care of my family members. then probably donate a bunch to communities whom actually need It. I will of course oversee to make sure that all the donated funds be spent where needed and so it may be put to proper use.
  
  Then the last 25%, that is for me to spend as I said choose and do whatever I want with it.
  
  I think I do it ok with having only $250m to spend
  
  The same goes for only have $250 to put away.
  
  I’d be OK with only investing $250m.
  
  Im sure foundations/charities as well as other projects will be OK with having only $250m to spend.

Understand, someone who could also very well be a narcissist themselves do know how to read when someone is lying.. So it's more on if the reason you'd want to come back, are honest and true, and that you really want to come back.
  
  Im more than certain that the other party would be more than happy to accept your back. But I don't think they'd be willing to put up with the unnecessary pettiness. You know, being ghosted- can change someone, I would know. As I'm speaking from my own experience.
  
  There's a certain pressure point that is developed in the person who was ghosted. That pressure point is self made, in case they need some sort of defense mechanism. They don't WANT to have it, but it's one of the side of effects of losing trust in people. I'm sure the person has a side of them that' is still as compassionate as ever before, but there's also a cold side that perhaps they kept down for years because, well, they needed to.
  
  basically without the repetitiveness, if you do come back. Come back for the right reasons. Come back because you're reasons are true, and are you. Give and Show they why they should believe you. I'm not saying just lay it all out on the table, I get things take time to develop/rebuild but as long as both are willing and WANTING to heal old wounds, it' takes the trust and honesty from both side..  Letting people hurt those who didn't deserve it, is done. Just be your true self if you do decide to do that, because you'd be taken back with arms wide open.... sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith in order to find out.
  
  Also, since we're both speaking in VAGUE as FUCK riddles, lol, What do you mean by""How likely is it that he will come back to Hoover?"" Are you referring to a vacuum ""hoover"" or like ""Hoover St."" down in compton..

   What is the best way for a person to obtain happiness?
  ","
  To always pursue what YOU want.
  
  Not worry what anyone else says or thinks about you.
  
  You know what makes you happy. It's not just about ""doing you""  It goes deeper than that. It's when you're able to do that, you start your journey of independence and to be able to stand on your own two feet. Not many people are able to do that, which is why you hear about so many people be miserable. It's beause at the moment, they're unable to do what they want, or they're unable to. Me- I love editing. Editing is what bring me happiness, as in I have a special ability to make a person feel by watching something i edit. There's a sense of satisfaction when I get a particular response. I'm doing what I dreamed of doing, I'm fortunate enough to get that chance and opportunity to do so. When I found this, this is what I spend every single moment trying to perfect. I focused on me and myself, because, you're the only one whos going to be affected by your choices, good or bad.
  
  So with the time you have, is it better to worry and kill yourself over what other people who mean no real significance in your life, control your life. Would you prefer to be yourself, do your own thing, and create you own happiness?
  
  Sorry if this feels more like rant. lol

  I’m going to write my answer in the perspective of this “crave for a women’’ is someone other than your wife. No other bullshit “what if’s apply to this question either. My answer:
  
  If you think your wife deserves to be cheated on, you’re a bitch.
  
  You’re also a bitch if you do it.
  
  Don’t be a fucking cunt.
  
  Your wife should be the only women your allowed to crave and actually indulge in.
  
  Don’t be a bitch and back out of the vows you made to you wife. So man the fuck up, stick to your vows you promised her. Bitch.
  
  If she’s not the women you don’t crave, then your bitch ass shouldn’t have married her in the first place. I mean if you’re willing to just throw the happy and  faithful life you promised your wife, over what- a piece of ass?
  
  If you didn’t have her before getting married, “oh shucks” I guess that time had come and passed.  If you had her already, well1- you had your time- no move the fuck on and make due with your dignity, bitch.
  
  Or continue to be a bitch and cheat on her. That way, that’ll lead to you getting get a divorce so some other man can take you spot.

  So what reason did you have to put this in the shout out? You know this never would’ve crossed my mind had your never written in the first place. Me being the person I am, I purposely like to test the waters.
  
  Also I’m not a real big fan of somebody give me an ultimatum on how I should act or how we should be just so I can be friends with them so if that’s the case or you can block me now I really don’t care. But that’s YOUR choice if you decide to be uptight or not be able to take jokes. Or if you choose to be so serious about everything, perhaps doing the shout out demanding whatever the hell it is you’re trying to say in your isn’t the best place.
  
  Also if you have to tell me that it’s my loss before I even know who you are I highly doubt it.
  
  And if it is, well then that’s all on me. But I don’t give me an ultimatum on on whether or not I could be your friend or not. If that’s the case, block me because you’re not the kind of friend that I want. If anything that’s a toxic trait. And if you don’t like my answer, perhaps you should try going about things another way. Remember you ask the shout out, not the other way around.

   look at it with this point of view, women are raised being told they have to change so much if they ever want to be loved, they change and change but still are told no one will love them, its not always confidence issues, sometimes its that we've had all our confidence broke until we are deemed done
  ","
  I don’t think that’s women in general. I think that’s more individual’s rather than generalizing that up-bringing.
  
  Nor can we make assumption.

   na you're a cheap fuck who can't use their own car to get their own food. Uber drivers don't got shit to do how late your food gets dropped off or how it's being delivered. you got a complaint tell it to Uber. you can't tip? don't use the service. karma is a bitch for those thinking they're saving $
  ","
  Well considering my car was in the shop at the time I didn’t go pick it up. You told me I’m cheap fuck but you’re one riding the bike.
  
  Do yourself the favor And just shut the fuck up. 🤫
  
  Also. If you’re working that, AND riding a bike, you in NO WAY shape or form are in ANY position to tell someone they’re cheap.
  
  No no no no see that’s why you got a fucked up. if YOU got a complaint, YOU tell Uber. I’m not obligated to leave you shit. Remember that. If I do, out of courtesy bitch.
  
  Another thing to remember. this it’s your job. Delivery is your fucking JOB, dip shit. If you don’t like it quit; otherwise shut the fuck up.
  
  I think you got fucked up. I wasn’t trying to save money, I said was a personal choice.
  
  Here’s a little fun fact for you stupid.  I’ve been a fucking delivery driver. So I know what it’s like.
  
  Do you want to know what I got for fucking every single delivery??
  
  I got ONE for every PER fucking delivery and guess what- I also knew what the job entailed when I applied for it. I did my fucking job. I never bitched about not getting a tip. I never bitched about anything.
  
  I shut the fuck up and I did my fucking job.
  
  Not like you faggots that bitch, “oh I this, I need a insurance,  I need this tampons, I need coverage.” fuck you
  
  You stupid sour puss whiny little bitch. You idiots fucked up every freelancer job and means of getting work in California with AB5 with all of your pathetic fucking asses.

   If you're ordering off Ubereats and you're not tipping at all because you think you're saving a few bucks. you're a real POS. Those poor drivers have a life to maintain as well the car they use to deliver YOUR food. Only use it if you can AFFORD TO TIP.
  ","
  Sounds like a first world fucking problem now doesn’t it?
  
  Also, I’m not the one that put them in that position am I?
  
  Also perhaps if Uber eats didn’t charge six fucking dollars on top of an additional three dollars maybe they might actually get a bigger tip there’s a reason why I need to pay an extra $12 it’s also include tax before I even leave my fucking tip. So you can eat a dick.
  
  Also I think I know who this is considering the last Ubereats person who delivered my order didn’t get that tip for those reasons. Along with the order being 30 to 45 minutes later than what it said. Even after the fact that it was late they decide to pick somebody that rode a fucking bike.
  
  And if there is a person which I’m pretty sure it is, I’m more than POSITIVE Uber eats would love to hear about this post.
  
  Again, you can eat a dick.

  I air my shit out in frustration only when the chance to listen is constantly ignored or denied. I’m a very patient person so it takes A LOT for me to actually do it. But yea. I do.

I think there’s a lot of time, ok most times, I have a lot to say on particular topics, and so I regret the times when it does happen?
  
  No. At least not every time. There’s moments when those of “frustration” are necessary.

  Did you think perhaps it could just be your choice in men that are the fucking jerks.
  
  Also it could be that you keep fucking with boys and not MEN.

  That being said, what do you think is the problem for said bitch boy to act like a jerk. What lead you to them acting like a bitch to you.
  
  I’m mean besides blaming social media for building relationships into a unrealistic fantasy and users/followers, viewers, whoever the fuck eat this shit up. Thinking that’s how all relationships are. But they never tell you about the hardships in relationships and sticking with each other even if times are bad. (But only if it’s worth it. Not if it’s an abusive mentally or physical. If that’s the case get the fuck away and fast. After they accidentally fall on a knife 26 times....)

  tell me what makes you say all boys... because I’ll tell you this, not all men are like that. And like I previously stated, maybe it’s just your shitty taste in boys.

  Are used to give homeless people money but I stop doing that because they were either ungrateful or fucked up or rude or just you know would be doing in decent things out in public like for instance whip your dick out and pissing on the sidewalk while people are standing there or like there’s kids walking behind or when you’re trying to tip put money in the tip cup you realize it’s fucking mess dick is in the tip cup or when you try to offer them food and they call you fucking I got some bullshit ass names of you little Jimmy to give him your groceries that you just bought and he want to be in a group of fuck so you never know

  ","
  how do you think relationships are built?
  
  through interaction.
  
  through those awkward moments.
  
  Moments where you’re both able to recognize and can joke with one another.
  
  Once you’re able to create that foundation you’re building everything on top of, it’ll make your work easier.
  
  Bc you’ll be more comfortable in  each other’s presence. Ideas, vibes, will be bouncing off one another like a mofo.
  
  Just work on building your foundation strong and the relationship will mold into place.   Like I said just, let things happen naturally and it’ll all work out in the end. It doesn’t matter if you’re in a new relationship or an old one, never force anything. And never try to prevent something that’s inevitable from happening.
  
  Just let the shit flow

  ","
  OK first thing-
  
  •Has it been made clear to them that that you like them?
  
  Second-
  
  •don’t think too much about HOW you should respond to them flirting;  and just react naturally to what is happening in the “NOW.”
  
  Third-
  
  •That’s a problem. don’t think too much about it, don’t let yourself get inside your own head. let it play naturally. The results will be even better than what you anticipated.
  
  And last-
  
  •Well I don’t really know the last thing because your sentence got cut off.
  
  You don’t want to tell them because why- it’s stupid?
  
  As long as they know that you’re OK with them flirting with you and you like them and they know that you like them it’ll be OK just be transparent about it because if he is unaware of this he’s definitely gonna be holding back because he doesn’t wanna cross a line impossibly do something based off anon a Sumption rather than what is actually now. You have to be able to give them something to work with.

  Seeing people help out others while actually being genuine about it. Not recording it and posting it on social media, so get likes, or tweets, or for clout. Or whatever the fuck you wanna call it. But seeing someone help somebody because you’re able to. And if they actually need it. Perhaps they needed it more than you. You do it out of the kindness of your heart, not because you seek recognition.
  
  For instance a couple weeks ago I was driving home and I saw this person I am who’s car was stuck like in the middle of the intersection that was pretty busy. and not one fucking person offered to help this lady push her car. She was obviously struggling, and she was a small lady too. I saw that, and instantly, pulled over, got out, and helped her push her car. She was trying to push the car while trying to steer the bitch at the same time. Not a very easy thing to do when your a small person.
  
  I shit you not, there wasn’t one other person to offer help.
  
  It took all but 5-10 seconds to do.

  That’s not necessarily true. There should be some sort of context to each scenario, as each situation is different. As well as what the circumstances in each instance. There could be some extra ordinary circumstances in some scenarios.
  
  For instance, (obviously hypothetical) let’s say you’re dealing with a person whom if you happen to look into their eyes, can cause some serious fucking damage to you- depending on their mood. If you were to look into your eyes your fucking head explodes. Or your eyeballs melt out of your sockets, your dick falls off, your vagina implodes, or your blood gets turned into 50 year old semen.
  
  You can’t just be like,
  
  “Shit. I’m not weak. I’m going to prove to them I’m a strong person.
  
  I’ll look at them in the eyes”
  
  Then BOOM. Just like that, you’re now in a Ziploc bag.

   Why do people choose to miscommunicate instead of hearing others out and listening to their side of the story? It’s crazy to me how some people would rather start drama and then blame you for it...
  ","
  Well that sort of all depends on the context of the situation at hand. You have to look at it from both perspectives. And take into consideration to how each side she’s it from their perspective.
  
  •Is the miscommunication happening from one end and not the other.
  
  •Is it happening because of both sides?
  
  •Are they both to blame?
  
  •What has caused led up to hem not wanting to hear out or listen?
  
  •Are they even giving the other side a chance to hear them out?
  
  •How does the other side see things?
  
  •Perhaps they’ve waited and wanted to hear them out; but were never given the chance?
  
  •What if they just got so tired of waiting?
  
  •What if they chose to rant so they can put something out there expressing their frustration for being forced to wait, and the other side not falling through with that was said.
  
  •What if ranting was the only way to get out what they wanted to say because it might either catch the other sides attention?
  
  What it that was their only way to get across that frustration because they haven’t been getting any sort of response at all.
  
  There are assortment of questions that should be asked as well as answered before anyone make the assumptions that those are just some out-of-pocket rants/ means to start drama, or to say they’re putting blame on someone else.

  ","
  I would take my child out to a ranch; and find a horse that is either close towards the end of its life; or one that’s just not gonna make it. I’d pay the rancher to go and put a horn on the horses head. Then I asked my child do you want to go see what happened to the unicorn. But they have to decide. Then we’d go out back and I’d show them up close- the unicorn get his brains blown out.
  
  Then I’d look to my child and say, “See child. I  wanted to show you that unicorns used to exist.
  
  USED TO.”
  
  Then they’d give me that look of shock, and it’d say, “They don’t anymore. That was the very last one in existence. You killed it...”
  
  “BOOM”
  
  :::DROPS MIC:::
  
  Then I’d walk away.

   until a month ago i didn't know that toilet paper in Venezuela is so insanely expensive that most residents can't afford it, and that was before the pandemic. I've already had two stories on my news feed about the outrage of a commentator during Wednesday's game who poorly chose his words.
  ","
  Venezuela’s unfortunate problem are due to it’s corrupt leadership. Thought it’s previous leader did help the country with the corrupt shit he did, he also fucked up at the same time. He counted solely on the high oil prices to keep their country’s currency sustainable due to his insane spending to help the country. When the oil prices fell after he died, and then new, now current leader failed to do anything. Causing an insane spike in inflation.  Which has fucked their currency. That’s why they can’t afford toilet paper, because their currency isn’t worth shit.  It’s unfortunate.

  "
64333,"
   true. I'm not disapproving anything your saying. but in my old job, I probably had the worst resume, I dont have a really good attitude or charisma, and my interview was trash, but I was the hardest worker there. always did the most work, always stayed overtime whenever they needed me. came in for

  ","
  You are absolutely right about that. And that’s where the references come in. They play a big role, at least for me. I think that’a what it comes down to. What others say about your work.
  
  They’d be able to tell any hiring manager about their work ethic, about keeping a gold standard within work. Whether it’s on their attendance, leadership, assertiveness, do they have initiative, are they problem solver, etc etc. I get people do have their own internal social communication issues. And I’d be willing to allow that as long as that person would be willing to work on it then themselves.
  
  Because not only would it help benefit the company, but it’s benefit that employee in both life and in the work field.
  "
64335,"
   yeah but I'm a bum that's ready to work, they literally just sit and choose names
  ","
  I think there’s a lot more to it than just that, ha.
  
  If I was hiring someone, I’d look at the resume first.
  
  To look and see the way it’s formatted as well the way it’s structured, how much you say, how much you don’t say.
  
  It all depends on how much valuable detail you provide, and how much you don’t.
  
  Also depends on your job experience; I’d look at the job experience between each candidate to see who would work best. Who has the right attitude, and compare and contrast them to see who’d be the best pick for the company out of the bunch.
  
  Also I’d look at your references.  I’d check with the provided references to see what made them hire you, and what made you leave.
  
  You can learn a lot about someone just through their resume.

There was a personal situation that, unfortunately took all my attention away from the job; which I always give my undivided attention to, and it affected everything. I was worried sick and I felt abandoned. It was shit. I couldn’t focus on work to save my life and this was some easy fucking work. My depression, something which I was just starting to make some real progress on overcoming, reappeared. It was a total shit show.
  
  It was unprofessional, and was fucking embarrassing.
  
  That was the very first time I’ve ever lost interest in something I worked hard to get. Not any time before this recent moment, have I EVER lost interest in my pursuit for it. I know this because I don’t pursue things I think might work, or “it’s a maybe”.
  
  I know what I want and i cherish everything I work for.

   Hello how was your day?
  ","
  Why is everyone asking this same goddamn question. If you’re going to ask this, as it in a way that doesn’t just feel copy and pasted or generic/typical. Don’t mean to come off rude about it, but I’m sure you can get where I’m coming from with it.

  You know, when you copy and paste your answers(if you did... it seems like it) onto something that did not ask or mentioned that particular thing you replied back with, it makes your answers feel hollow.

   What's the biggest amount of jobs you've applied at the same time?
  ","
  Idk. I think 20-30 I believe.
  
  I don’t apply to any and all jobs just to say I did it either. These were jobs I was more than qualified to do

   Do you believe there is good in everyone?
  ","
  From the moment of Birth to roughly our adolescent/teenage years, yea- I do believe there is some good inside of everyone....
  
  But from that point on till their present day age, no.
  
  Not everyone. People can be cruel.
  
  And as people grow older, some tend to grow and become more cruel. After so many years of that cruelty, that “Good” that inside can only last so long before it withers away and there’s nothing left.
  
  Unfortunately.

   What do you prefer - to love or be loved?
  ","
  To be loved.
  
  You can love someone all you want, but that doesn’t mean they’ll ever know or acknowledge it.
  
  There’ll always be more satisfaction in knowing that you are loved by someone, than to love someone ,but never be loved.

   Why do we wash bath towels? Aren't we clean when we use them???
  ","
  Yea we use them when cleaning ourself. But that doesn’t mean they still don’t go in and all around a persons shitty asshole, their gooch, their balls and/or va-jay-jay, their armpits. So unless you’re using your own hands to clean out your doo doo maker, you’re gonna be “cleaning” yourself with a shit rag.

   If you have any pets, do they have any habits that irritate you? If you don't, what kinds would you eventually like to have?
  ","
  No. I Don’t any pets.
  
  Not anymore that is, home slice done went and died. Old age, 🥺.
  
  What kinds would I eventually want.... mhmm. Well, most of my- I’ve dreamt of owning a midget farm. And purchase some land for them to go play in and roam around in the open. I wanted a whole farm full of them.
  
  So yea- I guess my next pet could very likely be a midget.
  
  Damn... it’s getting me kinda exited now that I’m thinking about it.
  
  🤔 mhmm..... decisions, decisions....
