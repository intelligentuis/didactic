  "

  yeah, that sounds like they're still bitter about the exchange even though it's been (presumably) years ago. that reminds me a lot of my cousin and a close friend of mine, they were best friends for a few years until something happened between them that was a misunderstanding. my close friend got over it ages ago and doesn't care anymore, meanwhile if i bring her name up to my cousin, my cousin gets irrationally angry still.

  i don't know what's going to happen come tomorrow, so the weekend is really up in the air right now regarding how i'll be feeling.
  
  i touched upon this briefly on askfm last week, but my job decided to make their employees return to the office, even though COVID cases are rising again in new york and schools keep opening and closing because people are catching COVID so quickly. my job is ""confident"" that the work place will be safe, but literally everyone in my department disagrees with that, including my supervisor.
  
  upper management sent out an email stating we had four options to choose from, which i don't want to get into the details of particularly. but i'm excluded from two of the options because of the nature of my position, and the other two options are (1) return to the office or (2) continue working from home with a camera on you during the work day and a 20% reduction in salary.
  
  our initial deadline to respond was this past monday, but because upper management received so many emails and questions from people in my department (myself included), they extended the deadline to tomorrow. they had a big meeting about everyone's concerns on tuesday, but we've received radio silence since then. so how are we supposed to make a decision when none of our questions have been answered?
  
  it makes zero sense. i feel so unsafe and it's just wrong to make people choose between their health or their salary/privacy.

If nothing made you smile, just know you deserve good things and good times and that your smile is precious 💙

Much love to you all.
  ","
  thank you, i need the support and encouragement right now.
  
  i haven't been in a good mood at all today. i woke up exhausted despite sleeping for 10 hours, work was mentally and physically exhausting, and i laid in bed for two hours after work just because i couldn't handle any form of reality.
  
  i'm just so out of touch and everything is in limbo, and i'm honestly terrified of everything. i don't want to be here.
  "

  ","
  no, most cops ab*se their power and the majority of the protests did not get violent until after a police officer did something that caused violence in the first place.

  i'm not comfortable with public speaking at all. it gives me anxiety and panic attacks when i have to confront a group of people and give a speech or any type of presentation.

  ","
  i play it on the phone, and my friends and i are always in an xbox live party with each other so we can talk to each other instead of typing.
  
  the game is pretty much ... you're either a ""crewmate"" or an ""imposter."" you're set on some sort of space ship, and the crewmates have to complete tasks and the imposter has to try to k*ll the crewmates one by one (you cannot talk during this time period). if a body is discovered, then the discussion panel opens up and you can talk to your friends about where you were, who you were with, who you think is the imposter, etc etc. then it pretty much continues going until the imposter k*lls mostly everyone on the ship or if everyone completes their tasks.
  
  it's ridiculously fun, especially with friends instead of random people. the other night, we had a group of about 7 people, so we could have two imposters.

386493,"
   I know and I vaguely told them or at least I gave hints that it bothers me/makes me feel uncomfortable. It's also the fact that somehow is hard for me to just be straight up, you know? Even though It's my right to ask for basic respect, I still prefer to be quiet and ""swallow"" it.
  ","
  i understand that, sometimes i'm the same way in certain circumstances. you should stick up for yourself though, ideally -- your concerns and boundaries are just as valid as theirs, and you shouldn't feel obligated to do something if you're not comfortable doing it.
  
  and if your friend(s) don't like that, then well they're not as good of friends as they appear to be.
  "
386494,"
   I'm currently in this situation with a friend. I'm a person who struggles with mental illness and there are certain things that neurotypical people don't understand and they insist on me doing things i don't feel comfortable doing, for example hanging out at the pool. Why can't they just understand
  ","
  ack, that's one of my pet peeves tbh. if you're not comfortable doing something, then they should be understanding of that and not try to push the subject.
  "
386495,"
   When someone doesn't respect your boundaries, is it ok to cut them off without any remorse?
  ","
  i think that's perfectly fine -- then again, that's what i've always done with no remorse, so that's my own personal opinion.

  this person i'm talking to is an adult, and we both live in new york state. i'm also suspicious because this person has been giving off ""woe is me"" vibes by talking all the time about how they have treatment-resistant depression and mentioned like three times how many medications they're on, and how they were diagnosed as ""passively s*icidal"" (which doesn't sound like a diagnosis to me ... s*icidal thoughts are a symptom).

  i've been talking to someone (on a friend level, nothing more) and they informed me that they're diagnosed with bipolar disorder and on one of their birthdays, their mother called the cops on them because she thought they were s*icidal. this person went to the hospital and was released in 6 hours after seeing a doctor and they decided that they weren't dangerous to themself.
  
  is this ... valid? i was under the impression that cases like this, there's a holding period of like 24-48 hours just to keep the person under observation. i've never been hospitalized before so i don't know the routine, but it just struck me as odd.

  ","
  the way i view it, police show up after crime happens -- not while it's occurring. the police have taken advantage of their positions for far too long, and there has been little justice served to them when they *do* do things wrong. it's an unfair system, and the u.s. government places too much emphasis on the police and military when it can be spent on more innovative projects.
  "

  absolutely wild. myself, with the aid of a few coworkers, sent out emails to more than 100 clients asking them for edits and approvals for their magazine articles so that we can begin laying them out in the magazine. i spent the entire morning sifting through emails, doing edits, forwarding them to other departments including customer service, etc etc.
  
  i wrote a very long email to my HR manager about her proposal to us returning to the office, because nearly everyone in my department is against the idea. i was shaken up and anxious about the entire ordeal, which resulted in me not eating at all today. i haven't eaten much of anything since yesterday afternoon because of my anxiety.
  
  i clocked out of work at 4:30pm, accidentally fell asleep, and then began drinking. so now i'm on my fourth drink (three glasses of wine and now a beer) and listening to music. i just want to be f*cked up tonight. i'm so done with everything.

386616,"
   Yeah that’s way too close unless they’re changing seating in your office space. That sounds like a breeding ground for the virus.
  ","
  i don't know what they're planning, but their initial email was extremely vague and has been met with hostility with nearly everyone i've spoken to about it. pre-COVID, if someone got sick, then there were at least 3-4 people who came down with the same illness a few days later.
  
  for example, strep throat was going around my office back in february. i haven't had strep throat since i was a young child, under the age of 10, but i somehow got strep because of the fact that one person had it in my office, spread it to others, and then spread it to me. it's absolutely ridiculous.

  yeah, they basically gave us four options (one of them including going back to the office, and the other three are literally ridiculous), and said that if we don't choose an option, we'll have to resign.
  
  my department has around 30 people in a very small space. there's no air flow, the air quality is awful, there are no windows, and the space is very cramped. i can literally reach out my arm and touch my coworker on the shoulder. what they're proposing is absolutely inappropriate.

Tell us a bit about it!
  ","
  during my therapy appointment this week, my therapist asked me if i had ever done any ""inner child healing"" exercises. i didn't even know what that was, so she asked me if i would be willing to try it, so i said yes.
  
  basically, she had me do deep breathing exercises while my eyes were closed and she spoke to me, guiding me through a scenario where i was in a park and i found a bench with a person sitting on it. she then said it was me as a child, and she asked me how old my child version was who was sitting on the bench. i said they were 7 years old. my therapist guided me through sitting down next to the child version of myself and told me to think about how the conversation would go, and that i could stand up and walk away when i was ready.
  
  in my mind, i had asked the child version of myself how they got there and how they were feeling. but the child didn't respond or even make eye contact with me. after i ""came out"" of the exercise, i told that to my therapist and she said that it would make sense that as a child, knowing what ab*se i went through, i wouldn't want to make eye contact with people. and i informed her that i still don't even do that now.
  
  it was weird, but interesting. apparently we're going to revisit it every once in a while and see what happens. i'm not necessarily sure i believe in it exactly, but i'm open minded to it.

  even certain things that aren't necessarily romanticizing can leave a bad taste in my mouth, tbh. like when people say ""yeah my x disorder makes me feel more deeply for people and the things i love,"" which is ... fine on a surface level, i suppose. but it's also just as damaging because that's very much a symptom too, and a lot of harm can come of it due to personal attachments and whatnot.

   Exactly. Neurotypicals are so quick to dismiss it too, which is why I don't discuss mental illness with people who don't have it. “Everyone has mental issues""! Like.. No, being sad occasionally isn't akin to literally not being able to function and a lifetime of misery and trial and error.
  ","
  as much as it frustrates me that the stigma exists, i still try to talk about mental health and mental illness often *because* that stigma is still there. i want people to understand that while everyone has mental health, not everyone struggles with mental illness, and you can't compare a small bout of sadness to chronic depression.

   How are you coping with COVID being around?
  ","
  when everything first started happening, i was coping very poorly with COVID. i was terrified that i was going to catch it, or my family or friends were going to catch it, so i took the protocol very seriously and it also affected my mental health in light of my paranoia and anxiety. i started working from home mid-march, and i'm still working from home now in september.
  
  now that it's been several months and things seem to be getting better COVID-wise, my worry about the virus has lessened, but my mental health is still on the decline.

  my roommate came home shortly thereafter, and we talked for a bit and he told me that our friend who admitted themselves to the hospital is getting out tomorrow, and they're coming over tomorrow afternoon. so i'm looking forward to talking to them and seeing how they feel.

  "
387061,"
   Tysm for responding, you're an angel and I always appreciate your genuineness. I hope things get better for you soon. I'm still torn bc it's either I take things day by day and keep him in my life as a friend (which seems impossible bc I'll always overthink things due to attachment) or cut him off.
  ","
  (cont) ... In conclusion, BPD sucks lmao. I'm religious so the only thing I've been able to rly do is pray to God to let his will be done & allow me to feel at peace with the outcome, but the situation still makes me incredibly anxious bc I can't cope with the thought of us never speaking again.
  
  --
  
  i understand, and no need to thank me -- i'm here if you or anyone else needs to talk, and i'm happy to provide my support and opinion. you're in a difficult situation no doubt, and i understand the BPD part of it (although honestly, i think my therapist is leaning more towards bipolar disorder at this point, idk what's going on). i'm also attached to my ex to the point where idk what i would do if he wasn't in my life at all, i can't imagine a life without him even in a friend context.
  "
387062,"
   Oh also, I've been debating on us just being friends but he still has strong feelings for me and I worry my attachment will get in the way of that. I'm just super lonely irl and life is tough right now, so I cling to who I can. I'm not ready to be alone and sad again :( sigh
  ","
  ugh, i feel this hardcore. :/ i'm attached to my close friend, and surprisingly enough, my supervisor. and i'm still somewhat attached to my ex, but i guess my feelings are a lot stronger than i initially thought because i keep having dreams about him. ugh.
  
  you shouldn't let your loneliness lead you into an uncomfortable place, though. i know it's difficult, but try to compartmentalize your feelings and understand that this friendship/relationship shouldn't supplement your loneliness, especially if you don't think your feelings other than the attachment will go anywhere. you need to preserve your own happiness first and foremost.
  "
387063,"
   Yeah, he knows. And all he says is we don't know what could happen in the future and life is unpredictable. I feel so dumb for being so anxious about this. Either way I look at it, I'm gonna get hurt. /:
  ","
  you're not dumb for feeling the way that you're feeling. i understand the confusion and your worry that you're going to get hurt. i suppose my advice would be to take each day as it comes and try not to focus heavily on the future, because like he said, the future is unpredictable -- and that can go both ways.

  "
387065,"
   So there's a guy I've been talking to for a few months now (online) & I've gotten rly attached. He told me he loves me & sees something serious in the future. Only thing is, I have a lot of doubts.. mainly abt our religious differences, him being a lot older, & feeling like we don't have too much
  ","
  (cont) ... In common. In my heart, I feel we won't end up together. Still, I'm EXTREMELY attached due to BPD & when we didn't talk before, I was miserable & obsessing over him. What do you think I should do? I feel like this is torture lol.
  
  --
  
  i'm sorry you're going through this. i mean ... personally, if i thought something was going nowhere with someone, i would cut them out. but i understand the feeling of attachment because i'm currently very much attached to a close friend of mine (not the same thing, but still), and i could never imagine them not being in my life.
  
  is there any way you can be honest with them about these feelings you're having, both the negative and positive ones? it might provide you with a sense of direction and some closure.

  i also found out that a close friend of mine admitted themselves to the hospital for s*icidal ideation, and i feel so helpless. i just hope the hospital helps them, because i've heard a lot of stories of people going to that particular hospital here and leaving worse off than they started.

  you're allowed to keep working here as long as it's under a certain amount salary-wise. a lot of people retire and act as a consultant for whatever industry they're in for extra money while still getting their retirement benefits.
  "
387135,"
   how does retirement work though?
  ","
  from my understanding, people who choose to retire can obtain social security benefits for retirement depending on how long they worked and the ""credits"" they've accrued over the years (it also depends on how much money you've made throughout your career).
  
  the average age of retirement for people in the united states is around 65 years old, but people can choose to retire earlier or later than that.

  ","
  there is definitely stigma surrounding toxic masculinity and men's mental health, meaning that men are conditioned to not express or feel emotion, be more violent, etc etc., and in turn that makes underlying mental illnesses go unnoticed (which is why more men die from s*icide).

  "
387191,"
   do you think IP block would be a good solution for those who constantly send hate and harass people? i mean, if you block someone, they shouldn't be able to contact you even if they make a new account. or maybe to limit people from creating numerous accounts.
  ","
  yes, i wholeheartedly agree with you. i know several people whose computers/phones should be IP blocked because they constantly make new pages even after being banned solely to harass other users.
  
  however, IP bans can only do so much, and there are easy ways to get around them unfortunately.

  addictions can kill you. if you're not ready to seek help, then that's perfectly okay. but any kind of addiction is harmful for you both mentally and physically, and it also harms your relationships with friends, family, partners, etc etc.

. ThanQ.. What is called addiction???
  ","
  addiction is a mental illness characterized by a compulsive use of substances (or things such as sex or gambling, for example) to obtain a level of satisfaction despite the consequences associated with the addiction. people who are addicted to things feel as if they can't live without the substance, and often people go through withdrawals if they stop.

  the feeling of happiness, much like any other emotion, is a chemical reaction from a scientific standpoint. however, that can be triggered as a result of the presence of positive emotions, if there is an absence of negative emotions, and a person's satisfaction with their life. happiness is much more complex than people realize, as it ranges in intensity and everyone's experiences with happiness are subjective.

  this may or may not answer this question, but it's the only thing i can think of -- i started smoking weed when i was 15/16 years old, and i did it pretty much all the time until i was 20 years old. although i graduated high school with honors, my habit became too much during my first year of college, and i ended up failing two classes.
  
  fast forward to today -- up until last week, i only smoked maybe once every 1-2 months because i was cautious about how i would be able to handle it. i finally decided to buy a pen for myself last week, and i've been smoking every night before about two hours before i go to bed, and i get the most restful sleep ever. it's definitely helped me a lot, and it's also helped decrease my alcohol intake as well.

  i wouldn't involve yourself in all of the terms and catchphrases related to all of this though, there are so many micro-divisions of the neuroatypical community that it becomes somewhat weird, and people often ascribe themselves to terms and identities that don't necessarily relate to them as a result. i just stick with ""neuroatypical"" because it's an umbrella term that's fairly understood in most circles.

  yeah, that's very sh*tty. if they're fully aware of the things your ex did to you that were ab*sive and they still remain friends with your ex, then that's kinda a slap in the face to you. nobody should remain friends with ab*sers.

  don't think too much into it, and just ask them. if you dwell on the ""what-ifs"" then you'll terrify yourself even more. people aren't as scary and unapproachable as you may think, and sometimes it's easier to just take the leap.

  that's why i've always been attracted to the arts in general, tbh. sometimes when i can't feel anything, i'll look at art or music or a film. and i'll feel alive again. and even when i feel too much, doing the same thing kinda channels those emotions into a straight line.

   is anger management issues a high level of disability or do you believe with proper medical diagnosis one could function a job without disability?
  ","
  anger is an underlying symptom of a medical condition, or it could simply just be part of someone's personality. anger alone is not a disability, it's just an emotion.
  
  if someone's anger is so bad, they likely have underlying mental health conditions that may qualify them for disability benefits if it prevents them from holding a job. but it obviously goes on a case-by-case basis.

   in your opinion are the ones being denied “fair”? or is the system too harsh/hard to navigate
  ","
  the entire disability process and social security administration as a whole is difficult to navigate, and there were so many claimants who were clearly disabled and kept getting denied, especially because judges place too much significance on independent medical examinations (IMEs) and vocational experts who have only seen the claimant on one single occasion.
  
  even if someone meets a listing (basically it's a set of qualifications that a claimant meets to automatically be deemed disabled based on their different symptoms and doctor documentation), judges will still ignore it and deny the claim. some judges are harsher than others, and it's very subjective.

   how *does* the social security system work? (in brief lol) in my country they make it really really hard to get disability
  ","
  this is going off of what i remember from when i worked for the law firm, it's been three years since i've worked there (which is wild to me, wow).
  
  basically, it starts off at the initial application stage, where a claimant can either get approved or denied. if they get denied, then can appeal the decision and choose to go to the hearing stage and appear before a judge. this is when people tend to hire a lawyer or a disability advocate, who builds their case by obtaining medical records and doctor opinions, etc etc. the claimant appears before the judge at the hearing, and the judge issues either an approval or denial. if the claim is denied again, the claimant can appeal the decision again, which will place the case in the appellate circuit depending upon where they live. most approvals come from the appeals courts, actually, because law firms write legal arguments and other documents stating why the judge was wrong and the court of appeals will either approve or deny the claim.
  
  at that point, the claimant can either go back to the hearing stage or submit another initial application. it's a very long-winded process.

  so, today is world suicide prevention day. even though it's trending on social media to post about suicide prevention, mental health awareness and advocacy, ideally this should be *every* day. i'm thankful that there are such strong individuals sharing their stories; however, we need to face the facts.
  
  -- 800,000 people die by suicide worldwide each year.
  
  -- suicide is the second leading cause of death for 15-24 year olds.
  
  -- lgbtq youth are 3x more likely to attempt, compared to youth who are straight.
  
  -- black, latino, native american and asian people who are lgbtq attempt at *much* higher rates.
  
  -- suicide is 4x higher in men than women, and this is largely due to toxic masculinity and the de-emphasis of mental health awareness in men.
  
  in addition, mental health advocacy and suicide prevention isn't *solely* about raising awareness of stigma and various disorders. we also need to enact affordable, accessible behavioral health care. there are so many people who struggle because they cannot get help, whether it's because they do not have access to care or they cannot financially afford care. this has to end.
  
  suicidal ideation does not discriminate, it holds no prejudices, and it can afflict anyone. chances are, you know someone who is either struggling, has attempted or has completed suicide. we all need to begin taking mental health more seriously, and not just when celebrities take their own lives. this needs to be constant.

   Not that anon but that sounds like good advice. I usually try to give ""practical"" advice instead and not only does it not work but also it annoys me when people do that because it makes it feel more distant. Your aproach sounds way better.

  considering i struggle with mental illness myself, i'm always much more receptive to supportive statements and my friends asking me if i need to talk. sometimes venting or talking through an episode helps more than anything else because you're not holding it within you anymore.

  ","
  i understand. throughout the course of my advocacy for mental health awareness, i've found that productive responses are things like ;
  
  -- ""do you need extra support right now?""
  
  -- ""is there anything i can do that will help you?""
  
  -- ""i'm here to listen if you need me.""
  
  instead of offering stereotypical alternatives that don't necessarily work, it's important to show your care and support for someone struggling with mental illness. that's always been my perspective, anyway.

  i have a keen sense of pitch when it comes to music and listening to various instruments. it isn't really a productive talent or anything because i don't use it for anything, but it makes me enjoy music more, knowing the complexities behind it.

  graduating from college with latin honors despite enduring mental illness.
  "
387729,"

387734,"
   How common? I literally don’t know anyone in person that’s friend with their ex

  i learned a lot of about social justice and civil rights from askfm, way back when during the 2014-2016 ""era"" of askfm, haha. i especially learned about women's rights, trans issues, and mental health stigma during those times from a variety of different users (most of them don't use askfm anymore).

  "
387744,"
   Hola
  ","
  hello -- do you have a question?
  "
387745,"
   So? It was ages ago.
  ","
  it's a derogatory slur that people who aren't black still use to degrade black people even in today's times.
  "
387746,"
   What do I do when I have suicidal thoughts?
  ","
  reach out to someone you trust (such as a close friend or a family member, or even if you have a therapist), and explain your feelings. it's often better to let them out instead of keeping them within you, especially knowing that you have a support system to help you when you need it most.
  "
387747,"
   So, why do black people get a pass for using the n word?
  ","
  because they're reclaiming the word as it was used for centuries to degrade and enslave them.
  "
387748,"
   When is it okay to call someone the n word?
  ","
  if you're not black, then it's never okay.
  "
387749,"
   What would be your reaction if you were groped by a female friend?
  ","
  i would be disgusted and explain to them that their behavior is wrong and invasive.
  "
387750,"
   Are you changing the world or is the world changing you?
  ","
  i would say neither at this point in time. i don't believe i'm significant enough to change the entire world, but i'm also not being changed much by the world around me.
  "
387751,"
   when’s the last time someone was rude to you?
  ","
  probably a few days ago, here on askfm. i don't encounter rude people very often in my daily life because i seldom leave the house, LOL.
  "
387752,"
   What are the biggest things you have learned from past?
  ","
  one of the most important lessons i've learned is that a friendship is not worth investing in if it's one-sided. if you're putting in all of the work to keep that friendship alive and the other person doesn't reach out, doesn't make plans, etc etc., then you're not under any obligation to be their friend. friendship is a two-way street.
  
  at the same time, however, if you suspect your friend may be struggling with mental health issues and *that's* why they're not putting in the effort, then you should try to help them. often people who are depressed self-isolate, and it isn't anything personal because they don't want to feel like a burden to their friends.
  "
387753,"
   What's something every teen should know?
  ","
  what you're doing or going through now isn't going to define the rest of your life. you may feel the pressure of being ""perfect"" and doing everything a certain way, but you're still a child and a teenager, and you deserve to have fun before you become an adult and accrue responsibilities.
  "
387754,"
   How does bad criticism affects you and how do you deal with it? ??
  ","
  it depends on who the criticism is coming from. if it's coming from someone i trust and am close with, then i'll usually feel terrible as a result (especially bad criticism, not constructive criticism).
  
  however, if it's coming from a random stranger, then it doesn't affect me. they don't know anything about me or my life, so it ultimately doesn't matter.
  "
387755,"
   Worst dish you've ever tasted?
  ","
  meatloaf. i just can't stand the taste of it.
  "
387756,"
   If you're given the chance to talk to your old self from a specific event, what would you tell him/her and why?
  ","
  i'd tell myself not to start self-h*rming when i was 11/12 years old because it would turn into a 10-year addiction with multiple relapses along the way. it would take over my life and i would feel horrible and paranoid as a result most of the time.
  "
387757,"
   What is the worst purchase you have ever made?
  ","
  i don't tend to make bad purchases because i'm very cautious (most of the time, lol) on what i spend my money on. however, the other day i ordered earbuds off of amazon ... and they sent my a face shield instead. smh.
  "
387758,"
   What's youre favourit Disney Movie? And what's youre favourit Song from a Disney Movie? :3

  i wouldn't necessarily say filth, but my depression has gotten so bad as to where my bedroom had clothes everywhere, empty bottles that i couldn't bother to throw out, plates and cups, etc etc.

  my ex was always confident that i could fight my own ""battles"" (which really were just random men trying to talk to me at the bar), and he wouldn't intervene unless i asked him specifically. i never needed the help, i was always able to shoo the people away who were bothering me.

  i understand that -- do you think that's related to work or related to COVID, though? there's somewhat of a separation between the two. i think i would *thrive* if i could work from home, and then post-COVID, do what i want to do (such as go out at night) without restriction or having the anxiety of working in the office/commuting to and from work every day.

  i would prefer to sort out the issue immediately, in most cases. there are some cases where it may be better for both people to sleep on it, as emotions can run high during a disagreement or confrontation, but it totally goes on a case-by-case basis.

  i sneeze whenever i look into direct sunlight, i have astigmatism, and i never learned how to ride a bicycle.
  "
388142,"
   will having a shit load of money make people happier?
  ","
  in the short term, i believe so. finances no doubt can completely change someone's life and how they view their own lives, seeing as how we can finally pay off our debts, get medical attention we might need, purchase goods and services that may be needed, etc etc.
  
  in the long term, that isn't necessarily true. there comes a point where if you're wealthy and can pay for things like proper health care and not worry about bills or rent or a mortgage, you might be lacking substance in your personal life. regardless of how much money a person has, it's important to have people in your life who love and support you.

  my father and grandmother both have anxiety disorders, but that's the most i know.

388156,"
   Oh, sorry. I didn’t see the whole thread. I just really hate when financial pressures arent includes in mental health issues. I’ve had psychologists suggest things to me which were totally ridiculous due to my financial situation which they knew about! Like fuk you, a$$hole for doing that
  ","
  i understand completely. that's partially why i never sought help for my mental illnesses until i was in my mid-20s — alongside thinking i didn't need help much, i also wouldn't have been able to afford it when i was younger because doctors and therapists and medication is *so* much money, ugh.
  
  mental health care should be a right, not a privilege. and right now it's a privilege. smh.
  "
388157,"
   This anon raises very important points about social and economic conditions. My mental health improved drastically when my financial position did. I don’t know why you are being so dismissive?
  ","
  i never denied that socioeconomic circumstances were detrimental to mental health. it prevents a lot of people from seeking proper treatment. what i was dismissing was the anon's assumption that my mental illnesses would get better if i didn't choose to feel however i feel (or however they worded it).
  
  their words were very invalidating to people who struggle with mental illness, especially chronic disorders that are more complex than depression and anxiety. they also never took into account trauma-related disorders — it's not a choice, and people who struggle with mental illness don't voluntarily act the way they do.
  "
388158,"

  "
388163,"
   i didnt send this but i feel it.
it is beyond frustrating when you do everything for your friends but they dont really do the same for you.
I wouldn't talk to anyone other than my boyfriend and my best friend if i wasnt the one who always messaged first - like do they really not care about anyone??
  ","
  honestly, i already have my own personal issues with thinking that i'm a burden on my friends & they're only friends with me out of like... pity, or something. so when things like this happen, it makes me genuinely wonder if i'm even their friend to begin with.
  
  the only people i'm comfortable with in the knowledge that they *do* care about me are my roommate, my roommate's girlfriend, my ex, and my best friend. i have a few other close friends, but we only talk when i initiate the conversation. i've thought about closing myself off entirely, but there are also nights where i get into one of those moods where i need to chat with someone, so i always break it.
  "
388164,"
   It frustrates me how some people can go weeks/months - or probably forever - without talking to me, I'm always the one to initiate conversations. I understand we're adults and have our priorities, but it doesn't require much of an effort to check on someone once in a while, seriously.
  ","
  i can relate to this. if i didn't reach out first, i don't think most of my friends would contact me. there have only been a few rare occasions where my friends have texted me first, and that was because they wanted to talk about something they were going through, not necessarily to check in.
  "
388165,"
   Why do doctors even bother to study for years and years and do research all their life, clearly ppl with zero knowledge know more abt mental issues than them. I remember when people were self-diagnosing lol. So stuuuupid, so dumb, so childish.
  ","
  LOL, ugh i totally agree with you.
  
  i'm against self-diagnosis, especially when it comes to complex disorders like personality disorders and dissociative disorders and whatnot. you simply *don't know* what you could have, because plenty of symptoms from different illnesses overlap. it's fine to say ""i *think* i might have this, but i'm not going to say definitively,"" while it isn't okay to say ""well, i feel this way so i have x disorder.""
  
  most people with mental health problems have suspicions of their disorders prior to being diagnosed. and that's normal and very valid, and it helps with the diagnostic process. but i don't believe it's right to say you definitely have a disorder when you haven't been properly diagnosed or even looked at.
  "
388166,"
   And that's what I'm talking about. ""random person"" is not going to satisfy me enough. There are specific ones on my list. It seems you are one of them. As weird as it may seem to everyone.
  ","
  you can cross me off your list because it's not going to happen. i believe it's time for you to move on to someone else.
  "
388167,"
   The problem is that these psychiatrists and psychologists are receiving the wrong patients. Most of them are unable to give social consulting. Depression and anxiety are more than mental problems.

  ???
  
  this makes zero sense. there's no such thing as a ""wrong patient."" if you're struggling with mental health issues, then you're entitled to receive any and all kinds of professional treatment you need. your views on individuals struggling with mental health issues are so skewed.
  "
388168,"
   Then fix this problem for me and get paid. just give me a price. don't tell me that it's not moral or you have self respect and such. your body is not something holy. no one's body is. Showing me your naked body is no more than showing me your face. come on
  ","
  ROFL. i never said it was immoral, and i'm not here to satisfy you. if you want to see people nude, then subscribe to some random person's onlyfans account.
  "
388169,"
   No I've actually read some books about it. The fact is that these psychologists you talk about don't really care about solving your issues. For them your are just a costumer not a real patient. Any doctor could prescribe a bunch of pills and give a cliche, pre writte therapy from someone else's book
  ","
  (cont) ... When you choose not to forget your past or you don't have enough achievements to replace your past memories and help you cope with it, no drug and no therapy will change anything. If these medicines and therapies were useful, you would have no illness at all anymore.
  
  --
  
  this is... completely wrong and inaccurate, but okay. i really hope you don't become a therapist or psychiatrist in the future because you'd be completely invalidating your patients' struggles.
  "
388170,"
   I'm not going to hide my emotions I have a very strong sex drive when I want someone, it means I'd pay any price for it. What does stop you from sending a bunch of pics to someone online and even getting paid for it? Is there anything immoral about it to you?
  ","
  this sounds like a ""you"" problem instead of a ""me"" problem.
  "
388171,"
   i just don't know how can some people be attracted to minors. even if you're not doing anything physical, how is it possible to look at a minor that way? it's disgusting. they're a child, ffs! i mean i am 25 and even 18-19 is TOO YOUNG for me, even tho they're legal. i see them as kids still.
  ","
  i agree, and the anon who was sympathizing with my 18 year old ex? disgusting. i'm 28 but i wouldn't even feel comfortable dating anyone who was, like... under the age of 25 or something.
  "
388172,"
   Since must of these problems arise from economic and social conditions, mental therapy is not going to help with any of them. Social problems have social solutions. For example if you are experiencing poverty, only money can help you. For family abuse, only moving to another place is the solution
  ","
  if the solution was to move away from my parents, then my problems would have ""disappeared"" last year when i moved out, lol.
  
  mental illness is much more complex, and it's obvious that you don't know the intricacies of mental health besides probably taking some rudimentary psych 101 class in high school.
  "

  that's not something i'm willing to discuss in detail on the internet. i don't talk about my sex life.
  "
388176,"
   In a way that drugs do, yes. What matters is not the symptoms themselves but the problems underlying them. Psychiatrists try to clear the problem, not solve it. The root cause will remain forever if it's not dealt with in the right way.
  ","
  hence why i'm also in therapy.
  "
388177,"
   Pedophilia is a made up term. It doesn't exist as you think it is. There are very few people who are specifically interested in children. Child abuse is something different. Having sex or dating a teenager is not immoral according to human nature.

  well, this conversation is ending. it's entirely clear what your beliefs are, and i'm not willing to have discussions with pedophiles. bye.
  "
388178,"

  ","
  i never really had a choice in the matter.
  "
388179,"
   Have you been born with those problems? if not then it's entirely an effect of your family and environment. For example psychopathy or schizophrenia patients are borned that way. How is medicine going to cure you if the problem is not lying in your own body?
  ","
  the medication has helped my depression and anxiety for the most part, so those balanced my brain chemistry. everything else has been the result of trauma.
  "
388180,"
   He didn't force anything on you. You can't be a victim when you choose it on your own. If it was rape or abuse, I would agree. You knew what you were doing, you didn't feel abused so it was fine. doesn't matter if you have changed your morals years later.
  ","
  sounds like you're deflecting because you've also had attractions to minors and you're trying to defend yourself in a subconscious way.
  
  an 18 year old dating a 14 year old is pedophilia, point blank. this isn't something i'm going to debate. it's entirely wrong because children cannot consent, and it isn't an issue of morality. so i suggest you stop victim-blaming and look internally to understand why you feel the need to defend pedophiles.
  "
388181,"
   Are your illnesses related to your environment or your own brain?
  ","
  it's a combination of both my environment and brain chemistry, from what i've gathered over the years.
  "
388182,"
   So you say that you had no brain and mind on your own as 14 years old and it wasn't your decision? If you were a ""child"" you wouldn't have any sexual or romantic feelings towards anyone. If you were a child you would have no idea what sex is.
  ","
  victim-blaming is disgusting, and you should really re-evaluate yourself before you go and blame someone who is a child for entering a relationship with an adult. it's a power imbalance, and the adult has the control in those types of relationships.
  "
388183,"
   What medications? Are you visiting a psychiatrist?
  ","
  yes, i've been seeing a psychiatrist since i was 25 years old. at the moment, i'm taking lamictal, prozac, rexulti, and xanax.

388184,"
   omggggg i HATE people like this. i’m 24 and have been chronically ill only gotten much worse with age since 13 and people still have the AUDACITY to say shit like this esp regarding sex drive like that’s any of their business anyways???? fuck off dude
  ","
  i wholeheartedly agree. i've been dealing with mental health issues since i was 12 years old, which has been basically almost 17 years at this point. if there was a simple ""cure,"" i would have found it a long time ago. mental illness is chronic in most cases, and when people do recover from them, they're still diagnosed with the illness -- they're simply in remission.
  
  mine has gotten worse with age too, despite the fact that i'm on medication and go to weekly therapy sessions. but that's the personality disorder, not necessarily my depression or anxiety. i'm extremely impulsive, i have bouts of rage, i can be s*icidal and self-destructive, and my mood swings are all over the place.
  "
388185,"
   you can't call anyone a pedophile if you have done it yourself when you were a teen. It's not just you it's millions of you western girls who are being hypocrite about it. you have sex in your teenage years and when you get older you claim that you are regretting
  ","
  i wasn't a pedophile, lmaoo. my 18 year old boyfriend was when he decided to date a 14 year old. that was entirely his wrongdoing. it wasn't my fault that he had an attraction to a literal child.
  "
388186,"
   Would you ever date a person ten years younger than you, what about older?
  ","
  i would never date a person 10 years younger than me, considering i'm 28 years old and that person would have just turned 18 years old. as for older, i have no qualms with older people. however, i'm not interested in dating at the moment.
  "
388187,"
   And we are not trying to use magics here. We are trying to go deep in your life, look at what we that made you what you are today and then neutralize those causes one by one. Your mental problems have roots and we are going to destroy those roots. this is how we cure you.

   It's mostly because of your anxiety and depression. those things drain your energy and perioritze things other than sex drive. if we find out what is causing your anxiety and depression and then get rid of those factors then your sex drive will become stable
  ","
  last time i checked, you're not my therapist. LOL.
  
  i've had anxiety, panic attacks, and depression since i was 12 years old. i was diagnosed with a personality disorder when i was 25 years old. my issues are chronic, they don't just magically go away.

   Why did you go out with an 18yo when you were 14? ?

  because i was interested in him, and he was wrongly interested in me, and we dated for a few months. he was a groomer and his interest in me was completely disgusting, but i didn't realize that until years later.
  "
388191,"
   I just wanted to help.

  i don't need help because it doesn't affect me positively or negatively. it's just a fact of my life, and it doesn't make a difference overall.

  there is no pattern. it entirely depends on my mood, which changes drastically throughout the day. i can go weeks or months without being hypersexual, and then be hypersexual for a few days to a week. there is no pattern.

  "
388197,"
   Then why you people say that 18+ guy dating underage girls is pedophilia?
  ","
  because it is pedophilia, lol. the fact that i was 17 years old and he had just turned 18 years old isn't pedophilia.
  
  pedophilia was when i was 14 years old and dating an 18 year old. that's the difference.

   10 years is a long time. Did you live together for most of that

  no, we didn't formally live together. during the middle of our relationship, i sorta lived with him to a certain extent because of my own family issues -- i would pack a bag at home and then stay over his house for a week at a time, then go back home and do laundry and pack another bag and go back to his house for the following week.

   Do you ever think there could be a world leader that has power over all countries? Would that unite people or divide them?
  ","
  i believe that most leaders of nations are corrupt and greedy by default, as they soak in their leadership as believe themselves to be such powerful and untouchable people. if there was a world leader, i can't imagine how that would affect the world because of how corrupt with power they would become.
  
  it would definitely divide people, much like how leaders of specific nations divide people. look at the united states, for example -- trump's presidency has divided the nation entirely, not to mention the fact that the whole democrat vs. republican thing has already been dividing people to begin with.

  ","
  the best thing you can do in any circumstance like this is to simply sit down with her and talk to her. i went through a similar situation with one of my close friends (she isn't my roommate, though), we slept together about a month ago and when i woke up the next morning, i thought it would ruin the friendship we had fostered. but we talked through it, and our night spent together hasn't affected our friendship at all.
  
  tl;dr -- talk to her about it and come to a mutual resolution/agreement. communication is key.

  i wholeheartedly agree with you. which is not only wrong in itself, but also totally lends itself to the desire of men who want young adults and even children because those girls are seen as ""pure"" or ""untainted."" it's gross.

  no, not really. i did hook up with one of my friends a month ago, but it was just a one-time thing. she's willing to fool around again so it might happen again in the future, but i don't really have any direct intentions of hitting her up again for it right now.

  i don't have an interest in dating anymore at the moment because i'm still somewhat getting over my ex, and i just simply don't feel ready to enter another relationship or even go on dates with people. i would think it's a bit unfair for me to enter another relationship knowing that i still have feelings for my ex.

  "
388216,"
   if this is not too personal to ask why do you think some men become more perverted?

  societal conditioning, and pressure from past generations for boys to grow up to become sexual beings -- their sexual behaviors are encouraged, as opposed to women, whose sexual behaviors are discouraged.

  i'm doing pretty well !! i notice that when i smoke while i'm drinking, i don't wake up with a hangover, ahah. the only downside is that i think i was up until like 3:00am last night because i was so high, so i didn't wake up until 11:00am this morning. :/
  
  i just ordered starbucks breakfast, and i'm currently drinking an iced pumpkin spice latte and listening to music. i bought spotify premium last night, so i don't have to worry about ads anymore.

  try to seek out professional help, if possible. it's difficult to go through depression alone, and talking to a therapist or seeing a doctor for medication is extremely helpful.
  
  if you can't seek professional treatment, then it also helps to talk to a trusted person(s) in your life, whether that's a friend or a family member or a coworker, etc etc.

  !!!
  
  this is so true — i'm a bit of both, as much as i like venting my feelings online, i way too often keep my feelings to myself when it comes to my friends, especially if they've done something to hurt me (whether accidentally or otherwise). i bottle those emotions up and then my coping mechanisms are disastrous.

  you're better off asking a doctor or a nutritionist. everyone's bodies are different, so there's a lot more involved than changing your eating habits and exercising. what you're doing may help someone lose weight, while for other people, it won't do anything. it entirely depends on your body chemistry.

  ","
  i don't think the typical love letter has lost its meaning. in fact, i think they're even more sentimental now than ever before because of the fact that they're not written as often (at least physically written). most people use social media and text messaging to express their love for a person, so that makes standard love letters even more significant.

   Why do girls like to show affection, Show how much their partner loves her, how excellent their partner is, but boys rarely show these?

  because they're boys, not men. when you enter a mature and healthy relationship, your partner won't have any reservations about showing affection in public. obviously there are some men who don't use social media very often, and therefore, won't post about their partner, but if it seems as if your partner is trying to hide the fact that they're in a relationship, then that's a definite red flag.

  introverted simply means that you have to recharge after being around groups of people by being alone and doing solitary activities, while extroverted means you're energized by being around others.

  it definitely does make sense. when we were teenagers back then (well i was a teenager), we didn't know the entire scope of what was going on in the world — we only really knew what was in our own inner circle. that could make us perceive the world as being better than it actually was.

  no, life isn't back to the same level of normalcy as it was pre-COVID. i went out to dinner last night, for example, and the restaurant only allowed one-third of its regular patrons for seating, everyone had to wear masks unless they were seated at their table, there were no physical menus, etc etc.
  
  i was a bit nervous to go out, but i felt fine overall. it felt nice to be able to eat and drink out for the first time in five months, lol.

  that's what i thought too, but who even knows. i do experience hypomanic episodes (not full blown mania), but that's a symptom of both BPD and bipolar 2 disorder.

   Thank you for responding! I'm just starting to get on track to recovery after several years untreated. I'll be starting therapy soon. My BPD is honestly super severe and I absolutely hate how long it takes me to get over the most miniscule things and how I can't function until I do.
  ","
  i understand that completely, trust me. even with therapy and medication, i still get super bothered by the smallest of details and think them over a million times, which ends up upsetting me even more.
  
  i do have to say though... i'm not sure if my BPD diagnosis was valid, or if it was a misdiagnosis. my first psychiatrist treated me for BPD, but my second psychiatrist who didn't have my medical records almost seemed offended when i told her i was diagnosed with it, and now my current therapist (whom i've only seen three times) says she doesn't think i have a personality disorder.
  
  it's just making me super confused, so i'm not sure what to even think anymore. i almost... ""connected"" with my BPD diagnosis after being diagnosed, and now that it's in question, i'm super lost and confused. if it isn't BPD, then what is it? i don't have *just* depression and anxiety, and i need to talk to my therapist more about this next week because i feel like a fraud.

   Hey, since you've been in therapy for BPD for a while now, do you have any tips for calming yourself down when you feel triggered in any way and not letting it ruin your day/escalate?
  ","
  i've been taught some coping mechanisms, but granted i don't really use them very much, lmaoo. however, some things my previous therapist taught me ;
  
  -- deep breathing exercises. inhale for six seconds, exhale for six seconds, and repeat three times. it helps sometimes if you close your eyes, and especially if you relax your body if you can.
  
  -- be mindful of the present moment. point out to yourself things that you can see, feel, smell, etc etc., in that moment. it's a grounding technique.
  
  -- vent to a friend and have them validate your concerns if possible. it's all right to reach out if you need it. it's helpful to talk to someone who can tell you that you're not being irrational and that your feelings are valid, and that usually does help me calm down a bit too.

   Um Leigh. I need your advice? So I’m really beginning to look at the friendship with my best friend in detail and I’m not sure whether I have been looking past some red flags or this is normal? Well is it normal for your friend to say that she wants to slap you in the past for saying you -
  ","
  (cont) ... Have a pimple just because she struggles with acne? I mean I get where she was coming from but I was a bit shocked. But that was one time and I think she felt like that in the past every time I said that when we were still in school and idk it makes me feel... idk. And I feel very unsafe around her for unrelated reasons. I get anxiety attacks when I think about her (btw she doesn’t do anything to warrant that but it’s the vibes she gives me). I can’t tell her anything because I feel so unsafe. And yeah that’s all.
  
  --
  
  i think her saying that she wants to get violent with you is wrong just because you complained about something going on in your life. that's definitely a red flag, and it isn't healthy.
  
  do you know the root reason why you feel anxiety when you think about her? that isn't really normal -- ideally you should be super comfortable around someone whom you consider a best friend, not the total opposite of that. i think you should reflect on why this is happening, because it probably is a lot more in-depth than just getting bad vibes off of her.
  
  however, i think you should trust your gut overall. friendships are supposed to be encouraging and helpful, and it isn't helpful if you're around a friend who doesn't do anything to aid in your mental health. if someone is making your health worse, then that should be a reason to not be around them.

  my best friend's bachelorette party (i believe it was in 2017). we stayed at a spa resort in the wine country of long island for two days, and the first day we went on a wine-tasting tour to several vineyards in the area. one of the vineyards was also a horse ranch, so we got to pet horses, and they also had rose wine slushies.
  
  the second day was a spa day, you could choose whatever type of massage or whatever you wanted. i don't remember which one i chose, but nevertheless, i didn't like it, lmaoo. it didn't make me uncomfortable or anything, but it also didn't relax me like spas generally do to a person. i got up from the table in pain.
  
  even though i didn't like the spa, spending the two days with my best friend and her other bridesmaid was wonderful.
  "
389063,"
   What are the two biggest lessons you've learned from previous relationships?
  ","
  -- it's best to communicate your feelings than remain silent. if you're in a healthy relationship, your partner won't necessarily be offended by your feelings, and instead take the time to understand them and work on helping you and/or the relationship. by remaining silent, you're allowing your feelings to control you, and that will only damage the relationship.
  
  -- don't settle for anything less than what you deserve. there's no such thing as being ""too picky,"" and the right person will walk into your life eventually (sometimes when you least expect it). don't tolerate ab*se or lying, shifty behavior, or people trying to control what you do or how you should feel. the right person will accept you as you are and have enough trust in you to allow you to be the best version of yourself.

  saying ""i'm sorry you feel that way"" isn't taking responsibility for their own behavior, it's honestly just a bullsh*t way of acknowledging that someone feels a certain way and putting the blame on them, in a sense.
  
  if they said ""i'm sorry, i'll work on being better"" and actually changed their behavior, that would be different.
  "
389106,"
   Why do people post food and fitness routine photos on social media so much?

  sometimes it can be for the validation of others while other times it's because they're sincerely proud of themselves and want to help inspire people. it all depends on the individual.
  "
389107,"
   Do you think you get more mature by getting older?
  ","
  in a sense, yes — at least most people do. maturity mainly deals with experience and how you've learned from those experiences, and as we get older, we obviously accrue more experiences. however, there are some people who are mature from a younger age because they've dealt with harder experiences than others.
  "
389108,"
   Do you believe that global peace is attainable?
  ","
  not really, no. at the bottom of it, most people are selfish and only care about themselves and what personally affects them, not necessarily the welfare of others. in that regard, i don't think humans will ever come to a common ground.
  "
389109,"
   What makes someone instantly likeable?
  ","
  having a humble, down to earth attitude.
  "
389110,"
   I actually tried this just a few weeks ago, and all I got was a ""I'm sorry you feel that way"", and that was it...
  ","
  that isn't a real apology — those are just words, and i hate when people say that honestly because they're not taking responsibility. changed behavior is an apology.
  
  perhaps you should reiterate it again and tell them they haven't changed, and if they continue to ignore you, then you're going to stop talking to them. it's better to be up front with people.
  "
389111,"
   Do you think its okay to criticize a religion in public? Hows it different than criticizing a race or culture?
  ","
  i think people have freedom of speech, so they realistically can criticize what they want. however, that doesn't absolve them of responsibility if their words hurt someone.
  
  criticizing religion is a bit different from criticizing race, because the latter is obviously racist. organized religion, on the other hand, obviously has its flaws. but as long as you're criticizing the religion itself and not individual people, i don't see the big deal.

   I have to wash mine everyday! I get so jealous when I hear ppl say they only have to wash it once a week! There’s just no way I could do that without looking awful
  ","
  you definitely have to get used to it, i used to wash mine every day when i was much younger but i started prolonging it after i started coloring my hair funky colors so i could keep the color longer. eventually i got to where i am now.
  
  obviously during the summer, i sweat more which makes me build up more grease but considering i haven't left my house and don't work outside of my home, i still let it go a few extra days without washing because no one sees me. lmao.
  "
389123,"
   Have you heard of the “no poo” thing where you stop using shampoo and apparently your hair starts to “clean itself” and not need shampoo after a while? Would you try it?
  ","
  i've seen instances where it works and some instances where it doesn't work — it all depends on your hair type. i only wash my hair once per week, for example, but i've been doing this for years since my hair takes a while to get greasy now.
  
  there's also a cleansing conditioner people can use to cleanse their hair without using the harsh chemicals that are in regular shampoos. that might be worth looking into if you're curious.

  the basements stairs will creak even though no one is on them.

  ","
  gender is fluid, but i don't really believe that your gender is in question here (based on the little information you gave me). it sounds more like you're just realizing gender stereotypes and realize that you don't fit into the mold of being a typical guy, because from young ages we're just conditioned into thinking blue = boy, pink = girl, dolls = girl, action figures = boy, etc etc.

389460,"
   So every man who prefers his female partner to shave het armpits is probably a paedo? Are you fuking serious?
  ","
  you're missing the point again. lmao.
  
  number one -- if a man ""prefers"" his partner to shave their armpits, that says a lot about them as a person. they should love and accept their partner regardless of their body hair. body hair is natural and superficial.
  
  number two -- i'm referring to society as a whole. the media and the beauty/fashion industries have conditioned us into believing that hairless = beautiful, when that isn't the case whatsoever. historically speaking, the idea of women shaving stems from the fact that men preferred women to be hairless because it represented an adolescent image. now that we're in contemporary times, we've recognized that it's gross and problematic, and therefore, there should be less pressure for women to shave because they're a woman regardless of what hair is on their body.
  "
389461,"
   So any woman who prefers to shave her armpits and pubic area is doing so because she wants to attract paedos? And no, its not “logical” to call anyone who prefers less body hair a paedo.
  ","
  you're missing the point. the fact that men prefer hairless women is what's p*dophilic, because that's the society that influences us, and people can choose whether or not they want to shave. i shave every now and again because it's my own choice.
  "
389462,"
   Why are you liking answers by someone inflating a preference for preferring less body hair to being a paedo? Is child abuse a joke to you?

  the idea of someone being hairless as s*xually appealing stems from the idea that prepubescent adolescents are more ""attractive"" than adults who grow hair. it's a logical association.

  i've been taught plenty of lessons throughout my life, although most of them were a bit late in life because i was too arrogant or naive to believe otherwise.
  "
389473,"
   What did you learn too late in life?
  ","
  the value of my own self-worth. i went through more than two decades of my life absolutely hating myself and believing i deserved nothing good, and it's only been recently that i've been learning of my own worth and value.
  "
389474,"
   What is something that most people learn only after it’s too late?

  the value of some friendships and certain relationships. you may think you're grateful in the moment, but it isn't until you lose that relationship or friendship that you begin to wonder whether or not you were truly grateful for those moments and experiences -- especially if the person in question died.

   According to you: What’s the difference between being conceited and being confident/self-aware?
  ","
  you can be confident and self-aware without boasting about it. to be conceited means that you're so full of yourself that you feel the need to express that confidence in exuberance to others, almost to the point where you're seeing yourself as superior to them. regular confidence and self-awareness doesn't give you that pompous attitude.

  my psychiatrist did that to me once. my old psychiatrist (before she retired) diagnosed me with BPD, but they somehow lost my paperwork when they transferred me to a new psychiatrist. my psychiatrist wouldn't hear me out when i told her that i exhibited the traits, solely because i wasn't exhibiting them in her office, and basically told me to not to talk about it to her again because she didn't believe i had it.
  
  she's still my psychiatrist because i honestly don't care anymore. i'm just there to see her to refill my meds at this point.

   when did your mom become disabled?
  ","
  i don't remember exactly, but it was when i was in high school. she had a heart attack, and afterwards she never took proper care of herself, which eventually led to her becoming morbidly obese and develop a host of bad diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and gout and diabetes, among other things.
  
  she's essentially couch-bound. she can't move from the couch except to use the bathroom and go into the kitchen, and she stays on the couch all day watching television. all of the cleaning used to be done by me from the age of like, 15 onward or so. now all of that responsibility is put on my father.
  "

   its a shame for both of them that she wont accept external help. your dad will have a breaking point
  ","
  we've discussed it with her on several occasions, and she was offended by the idea -- stating ""well, i have my family,"" as if we're all supposed to run to her at a moment's notice even though my brother and i have moved out and have our own lives. my aunt and cousin won't help her anymore either, my cousin claims that she can't see my mother in the state she's in because it aggravates her anxiety, but honestly i think she's lying because she's fed up with helping my mother as well.
  
  i've only spoken to my mother on a handful of occasions since our initial blowout a few weeks ago, and i've only been over there once in the past month. which honestly ... feels really good. i feel bad for my father and i eventually need to talk to him separately about what to do about her, but i can't keep allowing her to control me and my emotions.
  "
389524,"
   from what you’ve told us your mom seems awful but your dad seems fine. are they happy together? why does your dad put up with your mom?
  ","
  i don't think they're happy together, no. prior to my mother becoming disabled, she actually talked to me about wanting to divorce my father because they didn't get along (in all honesty, he just didn't want to deal with her sh*t probably).
  
  i think he feels obligated to help her because of the fact that she can't live unassisted, and she refuses any sort of external help, even an in-home aide part-time or a cleaning service. he's become the source of income and the primary caregiver, and while i feel bad for him, i also don't want to get sucked into that old life that i had where she had 100% control over me. moving out of my parents' house was the best decision i could make for my own well being.

   I encounter this situation everyday. As a man, you're not allowed to suffer, you're not allowed to show emotions bc ""that's for p*ssies"", you have to BE A MAN ABOUT IT! as people say, ha. When will we learn that men aren't robots, lol?
  ","
  i agree with you, i've had several friends who are men who struggle with mental illness who have never sought help because they're afraid of how they'd be perceived by friends and family.
  
  men in general, like you said, are taught that emotions are for women and to just basically suck it up and be a man. but men obviously have just as many feelings as women, and society as a whole still needs to recognize and accept that.

   Honestly it sucks. Having no valuable property to back your future is equal to having no good life. Property is everything. Especially in this capitalist world. You are what your parents gave you. Inheritance is everything. Both genetically and economically.

  it's the unfortunate truth. although there are some people who take advantage of their own circumstances and make a better life for themselves outside of their families -- it's entirely possible given you have the resources necessary to succeed.

389644,"
   It really sucks having to live in a big city just to work for your whole life and pay rent and debts. This isn't the right way to live. I know that there are always people who are destined to live like this but I can't. It's impossible to have a healthy mind in such life.
  ","
  i somewhat agree with you, but it isn't only in big cities -- it's pretty much everywhere (at least in the united states). most people live paycheck-to-paycheck, saving up enough money to pay for rent/mortgage, groceries, and bills, alongside any other debts they have which can include credit card payments or car payments, car insurance, etc etc.

  it entirely depends on how much money you have to sustain yourself. it's much harder to immigrate to the united states now than it used to be in the past, and job opportunities are scarce unless you're thinking of becoming some sort of physician or scientist.
  
  it's ultimately your decision. i understand having ""the american dream,"" but life in the united states isn't as glamorous as what they make it out to be in the movies.

  i'm being serious in that it's expensive to live in new york, particularly if you believe you're going to live in the city or any of the boroughs or long island. i rent a house with two roommates because it was the cheapest option available for us all, and single bedroom apartments on long island in particular are upwards of $1200+ per month. it's even more expensive in manhattan.
  
  most people work 2 jobs or more to sustain themselves, so if you really want to live in new york, you're going to need a definitive plan and crunch a tight budget.

  "
389661,"
   Yes I've actually read that different types of weed may have different effects and even that depends on the person. It can be depressant, stimulant or hallucinogen.

  yup, exactly. salvia, for example, is a hallucinogenic type of strain of weed. i've only ever smoked it once when i was a teenager, and it was absolutely horrible for me.
  
  i like ""body highs"" as opposed to ""head highs,"" because when i get a head high, i tend to get more anxiety and get tunnel vision and i feel like i'm spiraling. the second i get one of those highs, all i want to do is be sober again.

  "
389663,"

  "
389672,"
   I'm a man and I used to be like that for years until one day I've decided to try it. I bought a cordless hairclipper, put a large comb on it and did it. Kept moving it back and forth until everywhere was equally shaven. I don't go to barbers anymore unless for special occasions.

  i agree with you !! i think a lot of companies are probably re-evaluating their remote work policies and crunching the numbers to see if it's better for employees to work from home versus working in the office.

389730,"
   I wonder why so many employers were against it before covid? I was literally mine to allow me to work from home for ONE day a week and you’d think I was asking for the fuking moon!
  ","
  it probably has something to do with the lack of control the company has over the employee working from home, and concern about productivity.
  
  which i somewhat understand, but i also agree with you that working from home should be more socially accepted and practiced. in the case of my job, people are actually being *more* productive because they can just easily log on and check their emails even outside of work hours just to keep up with things. i'm actually thinking about logging in for about 30 minutes later, just to check my email and flag things accordingly.

  honestly, probably not. it will hurt a bit, of course, but i can't imagine him *not* in my life in some capacity. if it were to come to that, i would be forthcoming about my feelings about it and make sure he knows how much it hurt me. i wouldn't ignore my feelings like i have in the past just to keep the relationship going.

  ","
  i don't know if he actually cheated on me -- he just liked her. it wouldn't surprise me if he did, though. he never admitted to it, so it might be a conversation we should have in the future.
  
  i think he jumps from one person to another because it's all he's ever known, and i think it does stem from his own past and his addiction to s*x due to his own trauma. he's very hypers*xual and always has been for as long as i've known him.

389739,"
   When in a conversation with someone, which topics are you open to talk about and which topics do you try to avoid or are not happy to discuss?

  i'm usually open to talk about anything, depending on how well i know that person. however, if it's someone i'm meeting for the first time, i generally don't talk about political views with them first. those conversations can wait until we're better acquainted.
  "
389740,"
   Why you say that, wasn’t he a good boyfriend?
  ","
  he was, but he obviously had faults of his own that he needed to work on that i either ignored or was in denial of until the past few months after talking it through with friends. i did find out that he had liked his current girlfriend while him and i were still dating, which explains why him and i were so distant towards the end of the relationship. i had known who she was at that time, but i didn't think anything of it.
  
  he's always jumped from one person to another, and i think he needs some time to be single (if his current relationship doesn't work out) to sort through his own feelings, and also focus on himself. i think he would benefit from therapy too.
  "
389741,"
   Is there a hope you two getting back together?
  ","
  no, probably not. i used to want with every ounce of my being to get back together with him, but over the course of the past few months, i've realized that even if he and his girlfriend broke up and he asked me out again, i would say no.
  
  he has a lot of self-realization to do, a lot of things to work on himself, and he would need some time for himself and be single before he jumps into another relationship. he's never been *out* of a relationship for very long, which means he has had little time being single for pretty much since he was a young teenager. i think he would need time like that to collect himself and find what he truly values in a relationship and in life.

   (1) I researched it a bit and I think it’s legal and required cause they want to know u are able to consent. I want to donate other things other than blood but they all say depression might affect my eligibility. Now I’m scared saying I have BPD will defer me from the list.
  ","
  (cont) ... it’s things like this that makes me regret and wish I never got help because if I never got diagnosed probably I would still seem “normal” and wouldn’t have to declare shit even if I was mentally ill. The processes would be so much easier and I don’t have to worry if I’m going to get turned away. I could not even muster the courage to ask the person “uh, I actually also have BPD. Would I still be able to donate blood?” Because I was afraid of the answer and I was afraid I would get blacklisted. Sigh I might be overthinking :(
  
  --
  
  i don't believe you're overthinking at all, tbh i would probably wonder the same thing myself if i were to ever donate blood or anything (which honestly, i've never done before). i haven't even been to a regular doctor in 3+ years, lol.
  
  i think if you're able to show that you're mentally okay enough to consent (like if you're in treatment or anything) then it shouldn't be a problem. i'm beginning to wonder if it's also relevant to a survey as well -- like they want to know how many people diagnosed with depression/anxiety donate blood compared to people without mental illnesses.
  "
389750,"
   They required me to declare my mental illnesses on paper before donating blood and they wanted to make sure I was mentally sound to consent. I mean, ok. But I’m tired of having to declare my mental illnesses for everything (jobs, school) and getting rejected or turned away every time.
  ","
  that doesn't sound... legal? i'm really unfamiliar with the entire process of donating blood, though, so i'm not entirely sure. that definitely doesn't sound right to me, though.
  
  i'm so sorry you're going through this. jobs and schools shouldn't be discriminating against you for having mental illnesses either. like, my job knows i have depression and anxiety because i have a doctor's note on file excusing me from absences in light of my illnesses, but thankfully they've never held it against me before.

389753,"
   Leigh, do you know if one can donate blood if they have BPD? I just got send away for MDD because I don’t have a letter from my psychiatrist. I did a quick search and ppl with bipolar are not allowed to. I honestly would be crushed if I can’t donate just bc I have BPD. that’s unfair tbh

   What is one awesome food from your country you think everyone should try?
  ","
  cheeseburgers, but not just any cheeseburger -- one from a local diner, where it's freshly made on a huge bun with fresh lettuce and tomatoes. cheeseburgers from fast food restaurants are an insult to actual cheeseburgers.
  "
389766,"
   If you could choose a special talent, what would you pick?
  ","
  i would choose to have the ability to sing well. if i wasn't a writer or creative person in general, then i would have gone into the music industry if i had a terrific singing voice.
  "
389767,"
   What is the strangest thing a stranger has ever said to you (either online or in person)?
  ","
  there have been so many strange things said to me on the internet over the years, that i wouldn't honestly know where to begin, LOL. it's mostly been on askfm, not surprisingly.
  "
389768,"
   Who is the messiest person you know?
  ","
  my ex, lmaoo. i don't know if he's changed ever since we broke up in regards to his cleanliness (i.e. he used to leave plates and cups everywhere), but i'm sorta happy we didn't get a chance to move in together during the latter stages of our relationship. i've realized i'm somewhat of a clean freak ever since i moved into my own house, and his lack of attention to keeping things tidy would drive me wild.
  "
389769,"
   Sorry to vent to you, but do you know what's really awful? When you had to go thru' years of toxicity, manipulation, lies, deceptions, etc. that leave some serious, deep scars on you. And people just tell you to ""get over it"". As if it was that easy. Am I not allowed to be hurt? I mean...for real
  ","
  i'm so sorry that has happened to you -- and that other people feel the need to judge you for how you're coping with the aftermath of it. they have no say in how you should think, act, or feel, and you're doing the best you can do while overcoming the years of ab*se you've endured.
  
  it's never easy, and no one knows the situation better than yourself. i'm glad you've recognized that you didn't deserve to be treated in that manner.
  "
389770,"
   Favourite tv shows?
  ","
  criminal minds, NCIS, bones, it's always sunny in philadelphia, how i met your mother, parks and recreation, house MD, wentworth, bob's burgers, the x-files, the punisher, etc etc.
  "
389771,"
   What are the 3 things that you appreciate about your life?
  ","
  having a good support system, having a place to live where i don't feel caged or restricted, and having an amazing job.
  "
389772,"
   What’s the closest thing to real magic?
  ","
  falling in love with someone who feels the same way towards you, and you have a mutual feeling of commitment and desire to walk to the end of the earth just to make your partner feel special and loved.
  "
389773,"
   What the nicest compliment that you have received?
  ","
  any time a person compliments my writing, it fills me with a lot of pride and joy.
  "
389774,"
   What can totally impress you? ?
  ","
  having extensive knowledge in any area of interest, especially when that person is obviously passionate about that interest.
  "
389775,"
   What makes someone a bad person to you?
  ","
  a person is a bad person, in my opinion, if they have ill intentions -- whether it's through hurting someone else or an animal or something. and when they do go through with their intentions, they don't feel guilty or bad about it in any capacity.
  "
389776,"
   What's the title of the current chapter in your life? ? ?
  ","
  ""destroy and conquer.""
  "
389777,"
   What hobby would you get into if time and money weren’t an issue?
  ","
  i would probably get back into painting again, because i do enjoy painting a lot. it just sucks how expensive paints and canvases are today, and normally by the end of the work day, i have zero motivation to do anything.
  "
389778,"
   What would be your action plan, if there were no more electricity in the world?
  ","
  all of my candles would finally be put to good use !! haha.
  
  otherwise, i don't even know what i would do. obviously i wouldn't have a job anymore unless we somehow adapted to using typewriters and kept paper logs of everything we do instead of having our files saved on a cloud within my job's database.
  "
389779,"
   This wasn’t my question but I definitely wouldn’t want to live back then, unsanitary living conditions, no votes for women and when you’re a child as young as 4 youre sent off to work in a factor or sent up chimneys to die. Not a good time ?
  ","
  this is very true, haha. i've never exactly been a history buff. i took advanced placement history courses in high school, but i can't remember anything from them because that was over 10 years ago.
  "
389780,"
   What is your goal in life?
  ","
  i just want to be happy and content with who i am, where i am in life, etc etc. i also want to eventually write a book, or at least a book of poetry or short stories.
  "
389781,"
   Have you ever had to explain food from your country/culture to an outsider? I seem to do this on a regular basis for all things Scottish :/
  ","
  nah, not really. i don't have much of a culture and american food is just pretty much a conglomeration of food from other various cultures. the most american food i eat are cheeseburgers, which isn't really something that requires an explanation, lol.
  "
389782,"
   How do you think your life would've been if you were born in the 1800s? what would your daily activities consist of?
  ","
  i know absolutely nothing about the 1800s, so i can't really give an opinion.
  "
389783,"
   What's the best thing about getting older in your opinion? ? ?
  ","
  having the freedom and independence to do what you want to do at any given moment, instead of answering to someone else.
  "
389784,"
   What do you think people think of you?
  ","
  you would probably have to ask the people who know me, lmao. i have no clue what others think of me.
  "
389785,"
   If you could be famous for something, what do you wish it would be?
  ","
  i wouldn't want to be famous. i wouldn't be able to handle the constant paparazzi and attention that comes alongside fame.
  "
389786,"
   Do you follow your friend's significant other on social media or would that be a little odd?
  ","
  i've only ever followed my friends' partners on social media if i have met them extensively and we get along well. i don't really believe it's odd unless you have some sort of ulterior motive behind it.
  "
389787,"
   Have you ever thought about writing an autobiography? If you did, what title would you give your book?
  ","
  i don't believe my life has been interesting enough to warrant writing a book about it, haha. i have written a lot of short stories and personal essays that reflected some of my experiences, but they weren't directly an indication that it was about me.
  
  i've always been horrible with titles too, so i honestly don't know what i would name the book should i ever write an autobiography.
  "
389788,"
   Do you ever use third party delivery services (DoorDash, Postmates, UberEats, etc)? Have you ever had any particularly good or bad experiences with them? Have you ever worked for any? If so, what was that like for you?
  ","
  yeah, i've used doordash and grubhub. i've had good experiences with them nearly every single time, and i have zero complaints.
  "
389789,"
   Who was the last person you cried in front of?
  ","
  i honestly can't remember. i don't usually cry in front of other people at all. it's difficult for me to express those sorts of emotions when other people are around.
  "
389790,"
   How's your day? ❣️
  ","
  my day has been rather productive, which i'm happy about. i got a lot of work done at my job today, and then i felt like i deserved a nap so i slept for about 1.5 hours after i clocked out, lmaoo.
  
  afterwards, i fed the cats, made something small for dinner, and now i'm just going through my inbox and listening to music.
  "
389791,"
   I love always sunny sm, I’ve just started Criminal Minds this past month I’m on season 8 episode 23 so far ??
  ","
  almost nine seasons in just one month ?! you're a trooper, lol.
  
  i love criminal minds so much, it's one of my go-tos and comfort shows when i don't really want to watch anything else.
  "
389792,"
   Do you like showing off?
  ","
  to an extent, yeah. i feel as if i need validation for my accomplishments, i.e. someone congratulating me on doing a certain task or reassuring their faith in me, so i'll sometimes talk about things i've done that i think would warrant praise -- that way, i end up feeling much more secure in myself.
  "
389793,"
   You made it to the weekend! You've done brilliantly! ? I hope you have a lovely weekend! :3
  ","
  aw, thank you, kittie !! ?
  
  i've definitely had a trying week, and i'm happy to relax for the next two days. there are a few household things i want to do this weekend, but they're not anything major.

   If you like her, what's your favourite Ariana Grande single? ? ?

  probably ""7 rings"" or ""break up with your girlfriend.""
  "
389795,"
   Be honest... Are you scared of spiders? ???
  ","
  sorta, yeah. i won't jump up and scream if i see one, but i definitely get nervous trying to catch it and/or kill it, lmaoo.
  "
389796,"
   You have air conditioner in your home?
  ","
  yeah, we have one air conditioner in the house.
  "
389797,"
   what has brought you joy today?
  ","
  today, i compiled all of the tasks i completed at work throughout the course of the week (we're supposed to keep a log of the work we've done and email it to our supervisors at the end of the week since we've been working from home). i impressed myself with how much work i got done this week, so that brought me a bit of joy.
  "
389798,"
   Do you miss someone?
  ","
  yeah, i haven't seen a few of my friends in a very long time and i miss hanging out with them.
  "
389799,"
   Bath or shower?
  ","
  i'd much rather take a shower. i don't like baths at all, haha. i've tried it a few times and it was just boring to me.
  "
389800,"
   What is the weather like where you are ? Are you enjoying it or suffering in the heat like me ?
  ","
  it's currently 81 degrees fahrenheit, which is much more bearable than it has been this past week. :/ there's not much humidity at the moment because it rained this morning.
  "
389801,"
   What are some goals (big or small) that you’d like to achieve this year?
  ","
  i don't really have any short-term goals for the rest of 2020 except to pretty much survive it, haha. i do want to get another raise at work, which i *think* is in the process. i emailed my supervisor today regarding an update on whether or not HR contacted her for an employee evaluation, and she told me that she was discussing my review with HR this afternoon. :'))

389803,"
   How'd you describe the envrionment around where you live? Is it urban or rural? What kind of plants or wildlife can you find there? What do you think about it in general? ????
  ","
  i live in the suburbs, so it's more urban than anything else. the houses aren't necessarily super close to each other like they are in new york city or anything, but they're not far apart at all either. there are stores on every corner, and nearly anything you need is usually only a 5 minute drive away.
  
  there aren't any unique plants or wildlife, haha. just regular trees on people's front lawns and backyards, the occasional rabbit, squirrels, birds, and on the eastern long island, there are deer.
  "
389804,"
   Do you enjoy the warm weather? Or are you wishing that things would just cool down already?!
  ","
  i absolutely hate the warm/hot weather during the summer. :/ it's been between the 80s and 90s lately (fahrenheit), and thankfully today it's been much cooler outside since it rained all morning.
  "
389805,"
   Have you ever watched a show or a movie that started off great, but the ending was so bad that you wound up HATING it? Which one?
  ","
  the ending of ""how i met your mother"" caused a lot of grief among fans, and even though the ending was face-palm worthy, i still do enjoy the series a lot.
  
  that definitely doesn't answer your question, but it was the only thing i could think of, lmao.
  "
389806,"
   How come you don’t go on worldstarhiphop?
  ","
  i remember that being a thing when i was like... 13. i don't think i've been on it since then though, lmao.

  i've been cycling between feeling really great and then also feeling really terrible, lmaoo.
  "
389811,"
   Hypothetical situation but I want to know how you would deal with it, say you were dating someone for a couple of weeks and then they told you that they liked you but they didn't understand your gender identity, or did not think it was valid. How would you navigate an issue like that?
  ","
  i'd simply educate them, although there's a huge difference between them not understanding it and then them not thinking it's valid.
  
  i've been educating my roommate on gender identity actually, because when i came out as non-binary to him, he didn't really know what that was so i've been talking to him about it every now and again, and he asks questions to better understand.
  
  as long as the person i'm dating is respectful of it, then i don't really see the big deal. however if they refuse to acknowledge it or try to understand, then i wouldn't date them anymore.

  ","
  i actually don't, lol. i'm pro-vaccinations but i haven't gotten the flu shot since i was a child.
  "
389819,"
   Oh I’m asking because it didn’t actually come up in a casual conversation. I’m pro  vaxx and my friend is probably too but just doesn’t know too much about what vaccines there are since we already got all our essential vaccinations as children. I don’t know if it was a wrong move lol
  ","
  nah, i don't think you did anything wrong. as long as you approached the subject respectfully to educate your friend.
  "
389820,"
   Do you think it’s our responsibility to tell or inform a friend/relative about a vaccination if they are not aware that particular one exists?

  i don't believe it should be a responsibility, but if it comes up in casual conversation, then that's fine.

  last friday, technically? my friend and i wanted to go somewhere, so we ended up visiting a bar i used to frequent and ordered some food and drinks.

   can u gv examples of misogyny is hollywood? the harvey weinstein episode?

  women are constantly objectified in hollywood, showing them as sexual objects and nothing more, and they're under stress due to the expectation of looking or behaving a certain way simply because they're a woman.
  "
389838,"
   why do you hate sex
  ","
  sex is sinful and goes against the orders of our lord and savior. people should only be having sex through sheets with holes cut in them post-marriage. better yet, sex should be performed with paper bags over each other's heads.
  "
389839,"
   do you think Hollywood is corrupted and misogynistic?

   also why is anon talking about other couples lol that doesn't have anything to do with what /you/ want to do with your body lol
  ","
  yeah, i got that impression too — like i should feel guilty for potentially adopting when there are other couples who are infertile who have to go through so much in order to sustain a pregnancy.
  
  that doesn't make my feelings any less valid. if i don't want to be pregnant, and if i decide i want kids in the future, then i would adopt. it's as simple as that.

  the inner workings of the p*rn industry is horrible, filled with conduct with a lack of consent and trafficking and other forms of ab*se. most p*rn actors and actresses say they don't even want to be in the industry because of all the atrocities that occur.

   I am not a women so I can only imagine it’s not comfortable at times. But I just feel like adoptions usually can be unfair to certain types of children since parents usually want a specific type.
  ","
  i agree with you there.
  "
389860,"
   Oh if I may ask why would you adopt rather than have your own child? Cause you would be surprised about how many couples who are infertile are willing to spend so much money and go through so much trouble to get doctors to help them do all this science stuff to make a baby 4 them rather than adopt.
  ","
  pregnancy scares the sh*t out of me, lol.
  "
389861,"
   In other countries yes in the states there are all those tests you take but they just show that you can take care of the child in the end you choose which child you want and the agency doesn’t have much say in it cause there is a high need for adoption and since it’s not payed foster care well yeah.
  ","
  yeah. :/ that's so wild how the adoption process works. if i were to ever become a parent, i would ideally like to adopt instead of going through a pregnancy.

   I think adoption is a good idea but I don’t think it’s fair that the perspective parents should be able to just pick a child from their looks and see which child they want? I don’t think that is right since we all know which majority of kids get adopted and which ones do not. What do you think?

  ???
  
  well yeah, if you don't have a uterus then you obviously can't carry a pregnancy. but in the case of trans women dating cis women or trans men dating cis men (or anything other person who has male genitalia), they can most certainly get pregnant.
  
  to assume that you automatically can't reproduce if you're a trans person is just silly. there are plenty of trans and non-binary people who become pregnant and bring a term to labor.
  "
389919,"
   I think every decent human being supports equality, not everything has to be either black or white, you're either this or that etc, there's room for nuances and I think we can all respect each other. This attitude is counterproductive.
  ","
  i agree with you. some people simply cannot respect others though, which is fine if people don't respect me — i'm not here for respect or validation, and i don't expect it from everyone obviously either, that would just be unrealistic.
  "
389920,"
   Well scientifically whatever gender you were born as is your real gender you maybe able to change your appearance physically but you cannot change your dna... so if you were male at birth then your still a male but with surgery to appear to look like a female. And trans people can't reproduce either
  ","
  you're referring to sex then, not gender. even still, sex is based on chromosomes and that can vary wildly as well.
  
  gender isn't the same as sex, so if you're AFAB but your gender is a man, then you're a man. there's no disputing that, regardless of how you want to spin it.
  
  also... trans people can most absolutely reproduce, lmfao what.
  "
389921,"
   Would it affect you badly? Are you going to look for a new house?

  it's an inconvenience, but nothing any of us can't handle. it just seems so random & i honestly think the house is overpriced to begin with.
  
  but my roommate was comparing the new rent we'd be paying come october with other places in the area & what we pay is still cheaper than most other houses for rent, so we think the increase is due to the market itself.

  be unapologetically yourself, regardless of the hard time people give you for simply expressing yourself. you know yourself better than anyone else, and if someone doesn't accept you for who you are, they're not worth having around in your life.

  sounds like you have some unresolved issues you need to work through if you're that offended by the fact that i don't want to put myself under a label.

  misogyny, particularly internalized misogyny if it's coming from other women (in most cases).
  
  women have been raised in environments where men have overruled them as part of this patriarchial society we live in, so every time a woman does something to advance herself or empower herself (especially if it's sexual), it's seen as a threat to masculinity. even though we've come far collectively in terms of equality, the sexism and misogyny is still very evident.

  i was angry with my parents over a long-winded, disparaging text that my mother sent to me on friday. i'm not willing to go into the details of the text message, but we went back and forth for a little while until i completely stopped answering her. she was essentially still treating me as if i was a child, degrading me, and trying to exert control over my life.

  unless they learn how to take accountability for their actions, then it may get worse in the long haul. not apologizing for the mistakes you have made is not a good trait to have, and when things get more serious in your relationship, that type of behavior is going to spill over into other things, i.e. if you decide to move in together, get married, have a family, etc etc.

  the only real ""solid"" move i've experienced has been my recent move into a house with my two roommates, which we did last october. we've been in this house for about nine months now. this living situation is the best, by far, because i've established my own independence from my parents at last and can do things according to my own terms.

  i've never believed that a markup *that* extreme was plausible, that was just the example another anon in this thread offered. my initial presumption that people can buy things for cheap from thrift stores and sell them for much-higher prices was based on my own limited understanding of the industry, not really influenced by anyone or anything in particular.

  "
390127,"
   When I tried to do it more seriously, it was too difficult. I’d go to two or three shops but only find about five items I thought were worthy. It wasn’t worth the time or effort, so now I just look for myself and if I come across something while doing that....

  (cont) ... You don’t even know if it *will* resell! I found a genuine Valentino skirt once which was exciting but it was ugly af! Lmao. I put it on ebay for bidding and got a great price but that was a rare event. I’ve had losses, things which barely sold over the purchase price!

  i'm unsure. it will be good in the sense that people may be more cognizant of how they interact with other people, especially in terms of personal space and whatnot. but obviously it'll also be bad because our societies have been so shaken by what has happened that it's difficult to envision life going back to the way it was.
  
  like, there are some people who have already tried reverting back to that old lifestyle of going out with friends, having parties, going to the bar, etc etc., and that's why rates/cases have been skyrocketing again. COVID is still clearly here, but some people are in such denial of how severe this is that they don't want to take accountability.

  "
390134,"
   I shop for myself at thrift stores because new clothes are too expensive. I have found things I love but it takes me a long time, so if I find something I love but doesn’t fit me I will purchase and resell. My point is it’s not as easy or profitable as some seem to think.

  ","
  that's different from simply buying a piece of clothing and re-selling it as it already is. if you're putting the time and effort into refurbishing the items, customizing them, etc etc., then you should be compensated for your labor.

  ","
  yes, that makes complete sense. when i was running low on my pack (like, less than 5 cigarettes left), i would get a sense of worry and anxiety and would have to buy my next pack before the current pack ran out. it's an addictive mindset.
  
  quitting cigarettes is difficult, but i went from cigarettes to vaping so the transition was easier for me. my family still hates the fact that i vape because the effects on the body are inconclusive right now, but i still feel 100x better while vaping than i did when i was smoking cigarettes.

  i quit smoking cigarettes, but i do vape occasionally. i've had a cigarette here and there since i quit last year, but it definitely doesn't feel the same and it isn't something i miss. the cons totally outweigh the pros (it got so bad that i would be coughing my brains out every morning before i had my morning cigarette).

  yes, i wholeheartedly agree with you. eventually, the truth always comes out and you end up feeling like an idiot for believing the lie, even though it wasn't your own fault. there are so many negative emotions that arise when someone is lied to and the truth is revealed, it hurts much more than if we were told the truth in the very first place.

  i somewhat agree with the theory, but not entirely. i do believe that fostering positive thoughts does bring about positive change if you believe in your own drive and potential, but it definitely isn't a cure-all. life is ultimately unfair, and we can be as positive as we can but still find ourselves in difficult or negative situations.

  that's ... completely wrong. obviously people *are* offended by it because it's an archaic term, and language evolves alongside the society. over the years, professionals have realized that it's a wrong term that puts people with developmental disabilities in a bad light. by not using the r-word, you're being more inclusive.
  "
390317,"
   What’s your opinion on people who use the R word?
  ","
  the r-word is considered a slur, not only by members of the community of those with autism and other developmental disabilities, but also in society as a whole. there's a reason that facilities that used to use the r-word changed their name.
  
  i think it's a bit ridiculous to use the r-word when there are *so* many other words you can use that would indicate the same meaning as what you're using the r-word for. it's irresponsible.

  i can understand why you're paranoid about how they feel, but the rational part of me also thinks that you might also be overthinking the situation as well. i think the best approach would be to ask that person about their feelings toward the subject and explain that you don't want them to think of you any differently in light of it.
  
  there's *definitely* a stigma against it, even from professionals, so your worries are definitely valid. but again, considering it's all out in the open now, i would simply ask them their thoughts to make sure they don't think any differently of you.

  it should be mandatory, and i'm glad that businesses can refuse to serve customers if they walk in without wearing a mask. wearing a mask protects yourself and other people from spreading or contracting COVID, and it's ridiculous how there are so many anti-mask people wandering around.
  
  there are literally no downsides to wearing a mask for the 15-30 minutes you're in the grocery store. surgeons and other health professionals wear surgical masks all day long. people need to listen to health workers instead of reading a stupid post on the internet validating their wrong opinions.

390563,"
   Do you sometimes feel like you give more than you take? In your personal relationships. I sometimes feel like I'm always the one to initiate conversations, always the one to ask the others how they feel, to try and check on them regularly etc. but I don't feel it's reciprocal.
  ","
  this defines more than half of my friendships, unfortunately. i feel as if i'm *always* the one reaching out to see how a friend is doing or to hang out. i've never brought it up in conversation before because i don't really want to give off the impression that i'm clingy or anything, and i also don't want to lose them as a friend. :/

  i'm literally in shock over trump's new campaign video, he just posted it on twitter 2-3 hours ago...

390578,"
   wait, so you didnt hand it into lost property or whatever? you just kept it?
  ","
  yeah, i just kept it. it's not as if they were going to give it back to whoever owned it last, if they could even track down who that person was, especially with respect to COVID (this was back in february).

  ","
  i honestly can't remember, tbh. it was probably when i had my last car accident 3-4 years ago and filed a report with the officer.
  "
390587,"
   that’s not fair at all. if the man works then he shouldn’t do any kind of work at home.
  ","
  i believe it's fair to divide responsibilities up between partners. you both share that home; therefore, you're both responsible for it. the idea that a man should work and a woman should stay home and take care of everything in the household is an archaic model.
  "
390588,"
   what if the girlfriend doesn’t work and just stay at home lazing?
  ","
  if a partner doesn't have a job and stays home all the time (assuming no children are involved), then i believe that they should take care of some of the chores. however, a partnership includes mutual responsibility, so it shouldn't fall all on that partner.
  "
390589,"
   should a man do chores if he works?
  ","
  having a job is no excuse for not doing essential chores around the house, lol. me and both of my roommates work full-time, and we still find time to do things around the house that need to be done.
  "
390590,"
   Do you think divorce can be bad or good for the kids growing?
  ","
  a child(ren) growing up with two unhappy, angry parents is going to be worse off than a child(ren) growing up with a happy single parent. the happiness of the parents is recognized by the child, and if a child is raised in an abrasive or volatile environment, then that's going to negatively affect them.
  
  in most cases, divorce can be for the better in the long run.
  "
390591,"
   What makes you healthy then?
  ","
  i eat healthy food, lol. i have fruits and vegetables often instead of things like potato chips, i don't snack at night or eat candy, i very rarely have ice cream (it's been a few months, actually), and i don't drink soda, among other things.
  "
390592,"
   Are you a healthy person? Are you a health freak?

  ","
  i don't really think i understand the situation fully ... are you saying that your boyfriend and you broke up for 6 weeks, and during that 6-week period, you slept with someone else and was contacting your ex, prior to getting back together with your boyfriend?
  
  if he's asking for details and you're not comfortable sharing them, then i would simply tell him that. there may be a time and place where you *are* comfortable sharing those details, but try to emphasize that the past is in the past, and your previous relation with whoever the other guy was doesn't matter anymore. especially considering it was many years ago.

   I need your advice I moved in with my bf but he doesn’t clean up after himself and it pisses me off. I talked to him so many but nothing changed. How should I deal with it?

  ah, that's a difficult situation -- especially since you've already talked to him so often about this already. my go-to answer is always open communication, but considering you've already been doing that, i'm not sure what else to suggest. :/
  
  i'm lucky in that both of my roommates clean up after themselves, so i never have to pick up after them. but i can definitely understand your frustration because that would get on my nerves too.
  
  perhaps approach the topic differently? instead of saying, for example, ""hey, you need to clean up after yourself"" -- go for an approach where you tell him that cleanliness is a value you appreciate, and you feel much more comfortable in your place when things are in their rightful place, and he would likely be more comfortable too.

  unless you have a legitimate question, this conversation is ending. this is silly.
  "
390607,"
   Let’s settle this right now. 1. Other than L.A New York was at the centre of the crack epidemic so there is a good chance you’ve seen it, have friends or you consuming it. 2. When we were all in school don’t remember the “teachers/professors reinforcing you saying there are no silly questions”
  ","
  there's a bigger heroin problem on long island than crack, tbh. i'm not sure about the city or upstate new york, though.
  
  perhaps when you were in elementary school, they reinforced the idea of ""no silly questions,"" but definitely not in high school and for sure not in college, rofl.
  "
390608,"
   Of course I never asked you this question before I was saving it for a rainy day to prove my point to you how you would never answer my questions when they are on a similar to this.Cause this is a serious question that has merit and precedent to start a debate and take sides on wether it is or isn’t

  "
390609,"

  honestly, i've always wondered if i was in denial about potential alcoholism. there are some nights i do drink to get drunk, but it's maybe once per week if anything. otherwise, it calms me down and puts me in a relaxed state of mind and body.
  
  my father was/is an alcoholic, so my family has always been concerned about my drinking habits. they obviously don't know that i drink every night, otherwise they'd freak out. my mother also always gave me a hard time about going out and drinking with my friends on friday or saturday nights, so there's a certain stigma associated with it in my family.

  ","
  toxic masculinity *does* exist, and it's exhibited in the mental health stigma men face on a regular basis. men with mental health issues aren't taken as seriously as women's mental health issues because men have been conditioned to suppress their emotions, being told that having emotions is ""weak"" and ""not manly."" more men attempt s*icide than women, from my understanding, in light of this.

  now, i'm living on my own with two roommates away from my parents, and although i'm single now, i'm still close friends with my ex and our friendship is pretty strong, stronger than it was during the last few months of us dating. i have my anxiety managed for the most part, and i haven't had a panic attack in months.

   Leigh, honestly, as a writer yourself, does one really need to have an innate gift at writing to be good at it? I cannot write to save my life and I’m not good with words. Is it something that can be trained? Or do you need to have some talent? I really do think it’s the latter lol

  i think it may be a combination of both, in my experience. some people are just naturally gifted at writing while others aren't -- something i've learned over the years through editing other people's work throughout high school, college, and in my regular workday.

  i would say to do things in steps and try to compartmentalize each part of the process so it doesn't feel like you have this large project ahead of you. take things step by step, and space it out over the course of a few days or weeks instead of expecting yourself to do everything in one shot.

  pros ;
  
  -- lots of diversity in the environment (i.e. you can go upstate to see mountains, there are lots of parks, and you can go to long island for the beaches).
  
  -- pretty much everything is close by, or within 20 minutes of one another. there are some towns where you can walk to get your groceries.
  
  cons ;
  
  -- expensive as hell. the cost of living is too high for most people, and no one makes a liveable wage at minimum wage.
  
  -- very congested and crowded. traffic is horrible.

  ","
  uh, no? i've always made my own money. i don't need an ""allowance"" from someone else, lmao.
  
  spending money on your partner isn't an obligation. if you don't have the money to spend at a particular time, then there's nothing wrong with that. my ex and i only really spent money on each other when we knew we had the spare money to do so, and also most of the time, we would spend it on different vacations and day trips as opposed to material items.

  ","
  i'm at a stage of my life where if i were looking for a potential partner, i'd prefer to date someone who's financially stable with a job and possibly their own place. they're responsible in that they pay their bills on time, etc etc.
  
  money didn't really play much of a factor in my past relationship because we both had a firm grasp on our finances — i.e. we knew when to spend it and when not to spend it, and if we were low on money, we'd do our best to conserve it by not going out and whatnot. we'd take turns paying for things for one another depending on who was more stable in that moment, and we lent money to each other if it was necessary (although we were both too headstrong to accept it most of the time, lmao).

  nope, men aren't oppressed because of their gender. meanwhile women are oppressed because of their gender every day.
  "

   Seems like by your own arguments, you've made a decision that hating women is wrong without needing to consider any logical argument. You've demonstrated your opinions are coming from a place of emotion and bias, not logic. By your own demonstration, your opinions are incorrect.
  ","
  what the hell. ?
  
  hating women is wrong, point blank. this is getting quite trollish, so i'm not partaking in this conversation anymore.
  "
391079,"
   My reasons for being here shouldn't be relevant if your argument holds water. And there are some things that are difficult to measure with a study, but when you have enough anecdotal examples that add up, that's also considered to hold weight, which is also the reason #metoo is taken seriously
  ","
  my argument is ""you can't judge an entire group of people based solely on the ones you know from that group.""
  
  i.e. if you know women who are insecure, then that doesn't automatically mean *all* women are insecure. it's just common sense.
  "
391080,"
   You've also made your own blanket assumptions about the intellect of a person based on their opinions. You aren't following your own principles, and you haven't been taught how to think critically. Which is maybe related to why a person would advocate a hatred for women.
  ","
  LMAOO.
  
  you're honestly just trying to justify your hatred for women at this point. get out of here with this nonsense.
  "
391081,"
   No, actually, the logic of an argument is either valid or invalid on that argument's own weight. A person's opinions have nothing to do with the validity of that argument, regardless of whether they're related to it.
  ","
  if you want to go down the logical fallacy route, then sure — but the only reason why you're here is because i said something you personally disagree with, based on your own experiences with women. it appealed to your senses, and you figured you could make ease of an afternoon discussing this knowing full well that your opinion is wrong.
  "
391082,"
   Are you comfortable posting pictures that show off your body?
  ","
  no, i dislike my body.

  i can say that i dislike nutella because it's disgusting to me. i can't say that all women are insecure simply because only the women i've met are insecure.
  "
391084,"
   You can't dismiss a person's argument by their opinions, either. You aren't thinking quite as critically as you'd like to believe. And lesbian relationships usually follow the same dynamic, where you have one very insecure partner, sometimes both are very insecure.
  ","
  ???
  
  this thread is about women being insecure, and you as a misogynist jump in to offer your opinion. considering it's directly related to the topic at hand, then yes — i can criticize your opinion. not to mention the fact that anyone who's proud of being hateful towards women is automatically an idiot.
  
  there are also more relationships that cishet and lesbian relationships, lol. you're not taking into account the full gender spectrum where women may be involved.
  
  regardless of this, i still stand by the notion that you cannot make such a blanket statement based on your personal experiences and claim it as factual. that's just the way it is.
  "
391085,"
   No, it's women of all ages. I've 60 year old men who understand they need to immediately denounce any suggestion of cheating the minute it's brought up in front of their wives. It definitely is the case as young as the teen years too, but it never stops. All women are insecure.
  ","
  you can't make a blanket statement that ""all women"" are insecure based solely on your own experiences, lol. that's also taking into account that you're likely referring to cishet relationships, not the plethora of other relationships that exist.
  
  either way, it's not as if your word means much to this thread considering you consider yourself a misogynist (which is proving to be true). if you're going to try to troll, at least have a reasonable thing to say.

  "
391088,"
   No, women are definitely insecure in a way that men aren't. Women will look through their boyfriend's phone to make sure he isn't cheating, like it's just normal. They need to be constantly reassured that he isn't interested in anyone else, that he won't cheat, that he still finds her attractive etc
  ","
  this is definitely a minority of the women out there who are in adult relationships, lol. when you reach a certain point or age in your life, then you find that relationships like that are far and few in between. those are immature relationships between young people, for the most part.
  "
391089,"
   Every women I met is insecure, I can’t say the same about men. This is a fact
  ","
  experiencing something personally doesn't make it factual, lol. insecurity doesn't discriminate by gender. your friends who are men probably do feel insecure, but there's a large stigma placed on men to not express emotion so they likely keep it to themselves.

  you don't sound clingy, no. i understand how you feel, and if it's something that bothers you, you should try opening up a line of communication with your boyfriend discussing these feelings and how you would like to see him more often (if you haven't tried that already).

  a best friend is a person or multiple people to whom you're close, much closer than any of your other friends. they're generally one of the first people to come to mind whenever something significant happens in life, they're your greatest supporter, and you feel comfortable going to them with pretty much anything.

  when i'm feeling as depressed as i have been over the past two days, it's difficult to accept the truth that the feeling will be temporary. when i succumb to these episodes, i genuinely believe that nothing is worth fighting for and everything is meaningless, and it will never cease.
  "
391244,"
   To what extent do you trust mainstream media?
  ","
  i don't trust the mainstream media at all because it often distorts messages and only displays the news from a biased point of view (whether left leaning or right leaning). that's why it's important to try to get your news from multiple different sources, that way you have a well-rounded perspective of current affairs and can accurately form your own opinion.
  "
391245,"
   As a writer can you describe the emptiness you feel with BPD in words? I’m not a good writer so I struggle with finding the words. If you don’t mind of course
  ","
  when i'm feeling empty, it's just an overwhelming sense of hollowness inside of me -- like someone reached within me and removed a portion of who i am, there's this gaping hole that echoes with my heartbeats. the emptiness is a dark void, and when you're feeling empty, you discover the meaningless of everything around you, even when you're grasping for straws to find meaning in something. in anything.
  
  if i had to describe the emptiness in a few words, it would be feeling simultaneously hollow but also numb at the same time. there's a nothingness involved in feeling empty, you're just a shell of yourself.
  "
391246,"
   What's special about you?
  ","
  i don't believe i'm anything special at all. i'm just a person trying to survive life and try to find meaning to everything.

  i'm not entirely sure, tbh. i know most people are innately empathetic, and it follows them throughout the course of their lives. but if someone isn't empathetic to begin with, i'm not sure how someone could be taught to be so since it is such a deeply-rooted feeling.
