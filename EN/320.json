favorite vegetables .","296057":"italian , austrian , irish , portuguese which surprised me , russian , and ashkenazi jewish .","296058":"sometimes , yeah . i ve learned to let things go more recently though , because anger ends up hurting yourself more than anyone else .","296059":"lol . i wouldn t know , i don t stand there and analyze my sh t every day .","296060":"lestat de lioncourt from anne rice s vampire chronicles . he s a terrific character , but he s also very high maintenance and flashy .","296061":"incredibly unstable emotionally , but also much more empathetic and understanding than the world is now .","296062":"watch netflix , play video games , write , paint , read , and hang out with friends .","296063":"i have gloves , but they re not in my glove compartment . lmao . they re in my center console .","296064":"i barely open my glove compartment , so nothing is missing .","296065":"at least years , lol .","296066":"yes , lmao . there have been a few times i ve pretended to be sick in order to get out of plans with a friend because i didn t feel up to seeing that person . i felt like it would have come across as rude if i told them straight out that i didn t want to see them .","296067":"no , i don t believe so . my parents have one of those smart doorbells that they can check using their phone , but that s it .","296068":"i m more of a listener than anything else . i do talk occasionally , especially to get some thoughts out that are weighing me down , but moreso than not i m willing to listen if anyone has a problem .","296069":"yeah , generally . occasionally i ll splurge on junk food like cheez its or chips , but it isn t a regular thing . most of my meals consist of proteins like eggs and grilled chicken , as well as vegetables and small amounts of carbs rice , potatoes , etc etc .","296070":"unpopular opinion but . . . i love cold , rainy days . i like opening the windows and letting the cool air blow in and listening to the sounds of the rain on the roof and glass . during those times , i normally light a candle inside and watch a comfort movie or television show . sometimes if i m feeling creative , i ll put on some instrumental music and try to write something .","296071":"i normally like going out to the park or the beach ! ! however , if everyone else is busy or if i don t feel like leaving the house , then i ll spend a portion of the day outside in the backyard , tanning and reading .","296072":"good morning afternoon , friends ! ! my inbox is empty , so y all should ask me some questions . i ll be spending the rest of the day doing bits of laundry and reading outside in the sunshine","296073":"i m doing well . i just finished up my weekend work , and i m about to do a load of laundry and make breakfast .","296074":"i poured my heart out to my boyfriend last week while we were having a serious discussion around the campfire . it s something i try to do regularly , otherwise my emotions and thoughts get bottled up inside of me and it becomes toxic to my own well being . i believe it s more difficult for people to reveal their feelings these days because they often don t want to burden their loved ones with their negativity , even though that only increases those negative feelings in the long run . everyone is always so busy and preoccupied with their own dilemmas that we feel guilty if we put our stresses on someone else , even if just to talk it out .","296075":"i was terrified of ju on the grudge when i was younger , probably because i was too young to watch it at the time . it gave me nightmares for weeks , haha .","296076":"i don t follow any blogs , just random people and friends on social media .","296077":"rofl , no . i took a photo of myself with my eyes closed .","296078":"i like the diversity of environments . you have urban settings , but if you drive a short distance away , you also have beautiful forests and ocean views .","296079":"i was born and raised in new york .","296080":"the same reason why some people are cisgender . it s just something innate in me .","296081":"i m a good storyteller , but through the written word instead of verbally . i don t really know how to get the words out well enough to tell a coherent story , which is why i m a much better writer than i am speaker .","296082":"my favorite day is saturday i pretty much have the entire day to do whatever i want to do , which normally includes working in the morning , doing a bit of laundry and cleaning , and then napping . yesterday , i actually sat out in the sun and read a book for two hours , which was really nice .","296083":"breakfast , lmao . i can make a pretty decent omelette or fried egg , which i usually put on a toasted roll with bacon and cheddar cheese .","296084":"face down by red jumpsuit apparatus . never too late by three days grace . swing life away by rise against . somewhere i belong by linkin park . broken by seether .","296085":"sandwiches , chips , hummus baby carrots , spiked seltzer , and beer .","296086":"yes , i m a writer both as a career and as a hobby . outside of work , i enjoy writing both poetry and prose although unfortunately i haven t written anything in a while . i wrote a piece about depression last year which garnered a lot of attention on medium . com , which is where i post most of my writing . it s one of my favorite short essays . https medium . com invisible illness depression is everything and nothing all at once b e b","296087":"in order to be successful career wise , i believe a person must have a tenacity to do well in their life , as well as believe in themselves wholeheartedly . you won t go very far if you don t have the confidence that you ll succeed in the first place . in addition , success takes tremendous hard work and diligence , and it isn t easy . you have to put the time in and work steadily towards your goals , they won t just come to you automatically .","296088":"i would never post details of my personal life , i . e . the names of my family and friends , where i live , my phone numbers , where i went to school or work , etc etc .","296089":"i really want to have a bbq and grill up some burgers , but i m not comfortable inviting anyone to my house nor do i want to grill with my parents . my boyfriend just purchased a new firepit , and i m been aching to see him test it out . apparently it s three feet long , so we can have a really nice fire inside of it .","296090":"i ve had people tell me that i inspired them , whether it was because of my openness with mental health or because of my writing . regardless of the reason , it always makes me feel good when people tell me that i m inspiring to them , because often i don t feel that way about myself and it feels nice to hear that from someone else .","296091":"my boyfriend , last night before i went to bed . he called me before i went to sleep he told me to sleep well . so i said thank you .","296092":"uh , apparently i made brunch plans for today ? ? i originally found this last week , but i have no idea how those plans got into my calender , nor do i know who i made those plans with . lmao . i must have been hella drunk when i did this .","296093":"i don t discuss my sex life on the internet .","296094":"no , i m not open to making new friends at the moment . thank you , though .","296095":"i don t have a picture of the last tattoo on the list , actually . it was my first tattoo that i got when i was years old a yin yang on my back , with each half on each shoulder blade . i also made the yin yang look like the bass clef symbol in music .","296096":"another one of my most recent tattoos i actually got this one the same day that i got the linkin park tattoo . it s another matching tattoo with my best friend , she got the side of the avocado with the pit inside of it .","296097":"the tattoo on my arm says amor vincit omnia , which is latin for love conquers all .","296098":"probably my most cherished tattoo and my most recent . it s actually the symbol for the band linkin park .","296099":"another really old tattoo lol . i actually got this tattoo with my best friend , except she got hers on the top of her foot .","296100":"this was my second tattoo , i got it when i was years old .","296101":"this was my fourth tattoo i believe . i got it more than five years ago .","296102":"a person who knows they re a fool but doesn t do anything to change it that s worse , in my opinion . because they re very well aware of their behavior and or thought patterns , but they won t take responsibility for their actions .","296103":"here s one of them . i got this tattoo maybe three or so years ago .","296104":"i currently have seven tattoos , and in the process of scheduling an appointment for my eighth tattoo .","296105":"yes , i ve called before .","296106":"i don t give out my facebook to random strangers on the internet .","296107":"no ? ? my age is clearly listed in my bio .","296108":"i suppose that s true in a sense , haha .","296109":"i would likely answer the question the same way because this is one of those situations that i cannot look at objectively . i can merely answer these questions based on what i already know , and quite frankly , i don t really care enough about the question to investigate further .","296110":"i agree with you . that s why i was basing my opinion on my own experiences . i obviously don t have statistics in front of me , i m basing my thoughts on what i ve experienced firsthand and also what i ve seen on other websites i . e . twitter .","296111":"aren t all viewpoints biased to a degree ? ? lol . that s why it s called an opinion .","296112":"you didn t point that out i personally believe that comments on a person s body are rude and disrespectful , especially if they re geared toward someone breasts or any other private area , regardless of the reason behind them posting the photo . i find it hard to believe that a person can oogle at someone s breasts and then make an appreciative comment without it coming off as gross .","296113":"i ve never seen that situation before . i think you misunderstood me when i mentioned a picture whose sole focus is on their breasts i was talking about lewd , nsfw photos . in those cases , i ve never seen someone get angry over a person making a comment on their body . i m sure it happens occasionally , but it isn t as common as you re making it out to be . any other photo that s sfw and just an average selfie , you can t assume that their intention is to show off their breasts . and again , regardless of that person s reasoning , making inappropriate comments on someone else s body is rude and disrespectful .","296114":"uh , no ? ? lmaoo .","296115":"if someone posts a lewd photo like that , then most of them time they don t care about comments regarding their bodies at least in my experience .","296116":"some people are uncomfortable with any comments on their body , so unless you know that person on a deeper level , you re better off not saying anything at all to them .","296117":"a person can flaunt their body however they wish , but i agree with you that something like quick glances isn t really a big deal . the original question was regarding physical comments on someone s appearance , though .","296118":"you mean jean shorts ? ? yeah , all of my shorts are of denim material .","296119":"then evidently they re not posting a picture with their boobs out , not unless they re literally posting a picture where the sole focus is on their breasts . regardless of a person s reason for posting a picture of their body like that , it doesn t give others permission to make inappropriate comments on that person s body .","296120":"perhaps they re proud of their bodies and like showing off a bit of cleavage that s something that makes them happy , and it isn t for other people to oogle . it s basic human decency . i honestly don t see why people cannot keep those types of comments to themselves . they re unnecessary , and surely those people know they re being inappropriate .","296121":"it generally isn t something obvious , most people with big breasts cannot hide their bodies and they shouldn t be expected to for the sake of other people either . like i said , it s rude and disrespectful . there s nothing stopping you from keeping your comments to yourself .","296122":"because calling attention to something that a person cannot help or fix is rude and disrespectful . instead of making gross comments about a person s body , keep those thoughts to yourself .","296123":"i don t believe i ve ever seen his acting before . i thought he died a few years ago .","296124":"yeah , i bought them when the television series first came out but i never actually got around to reading them until now .","296125":"yeah , i watched the entire season and the final episode last week . i just started reading the books today , actually .","296126":"yeah , it s one of my favorite shows .","296127":"maisie williams and sophie turner ! !","296128":"i ve never watched it before because it wasn t a show i was ever interested in seeing .","296129":"i prefer television series , although it ultimately depends on my mood . sometimes i m in the mood for a comfort film .","296130":"no , i don t like sports . i never have , even when i was younger , haha .","296131":"at least . i ve never counted them , but i still have all of the books i ve purchased from when i was a teenager .","296132":"the best bad news i ve gotten recently is that i think i just got sunburnt , lmao . it s not a bad thing because i really want to get tan this summer .","296133":"i have so many favorites ! ! i think the x files is definitely up there in terms of the best , though .","296134":"none . i don t read e books .","296135":"thank you","296136":"no , i m actually a direwolf .","296137":"thanks , my dude","296138":"idk , it s hard to explain . it s like a spiritual connection and i ve been fascinated by wolves since i was a child . my first favorite books were call of the wild and white fang .","296139":"i ve always felt connected to wolves .","296140":"i like to spend my weekends relaxing , which is usually what i end up doing . the weekends are my days to do work , drink lots of coffee , do laundry , and take naps .","296141":"lmao , what . no , my gender is non binary .","296142":"i don t generally have arguments , so i don t remember . both my boyfriend and i are civil people , so if we have a disagreement over something , we discuss it instead of arguing about it .","296143":"well , it would have been laundry but it s already pm and i haven t started yet . i ve been sitting outside reading a book .","296144":"i don t chew gum . but i used to like spearmint .","296145":"waking up with a loved one and going out to breakfast together in a low key , not so crowded breakfast spot .","296146":"no , that s not an excuse at all . people have the capability to unlearn prejudices and behaviors , and there s nothing stopping those people from being more open minded and accepting besides their own ignorance or selfishness .","296147":"i ve been watching inside the mind of a serial killer it s really good ! ! idk if you re into true crime , though .","296148":"i usually just order a large popcorn with butter .","296149":"as if you were on fire from within , the moon lives in the lining of your skin . pablo neruda .","296150":"i know what they are , but i ve never actually used one before . when i was growing up , we already had landlines although they were wired to the wall , haha .","296151":"good morning ! ! i don t have anything planned today except that i ll be working , cleaning , and doing laundry . i m also thinking of sitting outside with a book for a while to try to get a tan .","296152":"i m still not sure if this is a myth or not , but i believed for so long that shaving hair forces it to grow back thicker darker . i m under the impression now that it isn t true , though .","296153":"the stigma of mental health , especially revolving around the lgbtq community . even though there s slightly more awareness of mental health problems now when compared to the past , the stigma still affects teenagers whose concerns are often not addressed because mental health isn t taken seriously when it comes to young people . most adults attribute teenagers mental health issues to hormones and claim that they ll grow out of it , but that doesn t mean that we shouldn t take their emotions and feelings seriously while they re already happening . it leads to further isolation and an exacerbation of symptoms when we don t acknowledge that something is a problem .","296154":"i don t have just one favorite of anything , which is why i answer questions such as these with a short list .","296155":"my favorite weather depends on my mood , haha . lately i ve been really loving sunny days with a chilly breeze , where it isn t hot or humid at all . however , i also like rainy days with thunderstorms . my ideal location would be somewhere that can experience all four seasons . i wouldn t be able to move somewhere like florida where it s basically summer all year long .","296156":"deathbeforedecaf","296157":"just a standard two story home , honestly . most regular houses average around , .","296158":"no , i disagree . having the right kind of love in your life certainly helps in coping with past wounds and trauma , as they can provide support and encouragement , but ultimately the healing must come from within yourself .","296159":"johnny depp , jack nicholson , jason statham , paul rudd , and keanu reeves .","296160":"go to the park or the beach and enjoy the weather without being worried about getting bothered by people .","296161":"self sufficiency . centuries ago , our ancestors did everything for themselves , such as hunting and gathering , and created what would now be known as the agriculture industry and the economy . you don t see much self sufficiency these days we mainly rely upon other people for things like food , shelter , clothing , etc etc . we ve become so used to the idea of capitalism and spending money on products and services that we rarely make things for ourselves anymore . that self sufficient nature is lost .","296162":"the last scary thing i did was bring up a topic that has been bothering me to my boyfriend , because i couldn t keep it to myself any longer . i needed him to know what was going through my head , and it was scary at first to reveal those thoughts to him because i didn t know how he would react to them . in the end , the conversation was actually comforting . he understood my thoughts and feelings , and we had a long discussion about the topic .","296163":"home is wherever my boyfriend and i are . my home isn t a physical place , it s a feeling i have when i m with my boyfriend regardless of where we are . with him , i feel most at home , i feel safest , and i feel most confident and secure in myself .","296164":"this is going to be dreadful and depressing , but my favorite songs from when i was a teenager and or pre teen are only associated with bad memories . the songs were a source of comfort to me , and to this day i still find solace in those songs , but the reason why they were comforting to me is because they reassured me that i wasn t alone during a difficult time in my life .","296165":"i like black craft cult s clothing a lot . i bought a hoodie from them a few months ago , and i can t find it anywhere . it occurred to me last night and i searched my house somewhat , but it never turned up . which sucks , because it s a really comfortable hoodie .","296166":"i would spend it with my boyfriend probably doing simple things that make us happy , like going out for breakfast , spending time in nature , having a campfire , etc etc . we would probably also drive out to montauk and spend the day there too .","296167":"lol , it s funny you phrase it this way because favorite person is actually a thing associated with borderline personality disorder . my favorite person is my boyfriend . he s the person i m attached to the most emotionally . everything in his life affects my own thoughts and behavior , so if he s upset then i m upset and if he s happy then i m happy .","296168":"i prefer reading . i get a better grasp on what s being told to me through reading as opposed to simply listening .","296169":"my boyfriend . i always text him good morning when i wake up .","296170":"i don t ever feel shame when people ask me questions . if i feel uncomfortable answering a question , then i just delete it .","296171":"a general subject or reiteration of the question would explain what it was . not something as vague as a question you didn t want to answer . that doesn t describe the specific question you asked me previously .","296172":". . . this doesn t explain what the question was .","296173":"what was your question ? ?","296174":"i m drinking staying awake for a few hours . y all should ask me questions","296175":"i know what you intended to say , but the execution portrayed something else entirely . lol .","296176":"i don t even use whatsapp , lol . and no , you re not getting my instagram , snapchat , or facebook either .","296177":"hello do you have a question ? ?","296178":"drinking alcohol . i ve cut back severely , but for a while i was drinking every night in excess .","296179":"thank you i am too . i still have strong urges and i ve relapsed a few times , but overall i ve broken free of the habit and i know all too well how much more terribly i would feel if i sank back into that again .","296180":"self h rming i censored it because idk if askfm would delete that word . it got to the point where i was doing it because i was addicted to the feeling of it , even when i wasn t necessarily feeling bad in that current moment . it became such a strong habit and i couldn t see myself recovering .","296181":"in order for me to vote for someone , they have to be protective of reproductive rights , as well as equal rights for the lgbtq community . they also have to believe in climate change and want to work towards fixing the climate and environment .","296182":"i regret starting up a seven year long addiction when i was years old . it controlled my life up until the time i was around years old .","296183":"no , but i am overweight .","296184":"i either wake up naturally or to my alarm . my alarm is set for am every morning , but sometimes i wake up before my alarm goes off .","296185":"i assume that people dislike me right away before giving them a chance to get to know me , or even when they do know me talk to me , i assume that they down talk me behind my back and are only acquainted with me out of pity .","296186":"lol . the spirit of halloween perpetually lives within me .","296187":"i would rather choose to do what s right as opposed to what s easy , especially if doing something easy means that it s the wrong thing to do . most things that are morally right are harder than taking the less moral route , but you end the day with a cleaner conscience .","296188":"i would likely prefer to be loved , because it could be a source of encouragement and support depending on who it s coming from . simply loving someone is uncertain , because you could love someone who doesn t return the affection and end up feeling heartbroken .","296189":"probably sushi ! ! it s pretty versatile , and it s one of my favorite foods .","296190":"i d rather be an antihero someone who fights for the greater good , but albeit goes about it in a questionable or unconventional way .","296191":"i want people to remember me by my passion for giving a voice to those who struggle with mental illness by using my platforms to talk about stigma , misconceptions , and my own experiences . i want people to remember me by my writing and be comforted by the words i write , much like how i was comforted by the writing i read growing up .","296192":"honestly , it was falling so deep into a habit that it became borderline addictive and was ruining my relationships with people , as well as my health . i ve taken back control for the most part by now , but it s something that still plagues me every day .","296193":"my boyfriend and my best friend both inspire me in different ways , although their stories are quite similar . they re both strong willed and strong hearted people who have been through a lot of hardship , but they have also never allowed their struggles to define them or prevent them from chasing their goals . they re also both extremely passionate about things in their life , whether it s people or animals or their hobbies .","296194":"a state of disillusion created by adequate levels of serotonin .","296195":"much better than yesterday , thank you for asking . i woke up at am and my migraine was gone , so i was able to get through the day as i normally would .","296196":"this is a difficult question to answer , because they re equally important to me . it s hard to be with a person when you don t find humor in the same things , but it s also difficult if not impossible to be with someone who doesn t have the same interests as you either .","296197":"mental health advocacy . i try to raise awareness of mental health disorders and other problems as often as i can by talking about my own personal experiences , as well as misconceptions displayed through the media . ever since i started becoming more open about my own mental health , i ve had people come up to me and tell me that i inspired them to either get help for their own issues or be more open about their issues themselves .","296198":"i m constantly worried that my loved ones are going to get fed up with me and abandon me because of what an unstable mess i am most of the time . i try my best to make some sort of semblance of stability in my life , but i have a habit of spiraling out of control incredibly fast , and i often shut others out so that no one can witness me fall .","296199":"yeah , definitely . i would probably donate money to charities revolving around juvenile diabetes , mental health awareness , and environmental conservation .","296200":"it s a combination of a sedentary lifestyle , my habit of drinking alcohol , and side effects of medication .","296201":"a house for my boyfriend and i to live in , new cars for the both of us , a new wardrobe for the both of us , and i would pay off all of our debts .","296202":"any product made by a person who spews hateful rhetoric on social media or whose marketing techniques are distasteful .","296203":"coffee , smh . my keurig machine at home broke , so i stopped at a coffee shop after work and picked up an box of coffee for my family to drink over the weekend .","296204":"you can t force people to join a gym , lol . not unless you made gyms free of charge and more accessible to people , then maybe there would be more incentive for people to exercise .","296205":"no , i don t believe it would be easy otherwise it would have been done already . there s such a culture of indulgence in the united states that obesity has become the new normal , and in order to combat against obesity rates , we have to challenge the very notion of that culture itself .","296206":"honestly . . . i ll probably be coloring my hair for so long to the point where i won t even know when it starts to turn gray , lol .","296207":"i probably have at some point , but i honestly can t remember . most pictures i have aren t terribly important to me .","296208":"praise is more motivating to me , personally . i can handle constructive criticism , and i always strive to improve on myself and my work especially in terms of my job , but it s nice to receive positive reinforcement every now and again because it reassures me that i m doing well and that i can be trusted with the tasks handed to me .","296209":"yeah , most athletes earn way too much money . they earn more money than people like police officers , firefighters , and other civic service jobs , which is wrong in my opinion .","296210":"i don t like the way my country is headed , but i also can t foresee myself moving to a completely different country either . if i had to move abroad , i would probably choose england or australia .","296211":"no , i don t spend money on clothing really to begin with . i also seldom wear jackets unless it s the winter time .","296212":"i went out drinking a few weeks ago and got absolutely hammered . i woke up the next morning feeling horrible , i couldn t function like a normal human being for most of the day .","296213":"you have to think about how often you may wear it , your current economic situation , and whether or not the pros outweigh the cons . if you re really breaking the bank to purchase this jacket and you don t think you ll wear it very often , then perhaps it isn t worth it .","296214":"i don t believe so , no . i actually think that it s an attractive quality to have there s so much stigma against men for being in touch with femininity or embracing parts of themselves that aren t masculine . you re not any less of a man for that , and the notion that men should always be rugged and emotionless is nonsense .","296215":"like i said to dera just before , some anons love to simply stir the pot and create nonsense drama out of something that s supposed to be private . thank you , though ! ! i got home from work not too long ago , and i m currently relaxing with some iced coffee catching up on my questions .","296216":"probably the dress i bought for my best friend s wedding . it was around .","296217":"i believe it s important to some people , but not to others . it isn t a universal thing where everyone should go to college . some people simply are not cut out for standard academia , and that s perfectly okay . you shouldn t be expected to attend college if that isn t something that aligns with your skills . i believe that everyone has marketable skills , though , and sometimes traditional college isn t the way for people to improve on those skills . there are also things like trade schools , apprenticeships , etc etc .","296218":"meeting my boyfriend greatly impacted my life for the better . he accepted me for who i was during a crucial point in my life , and he helped me get over an addiction ultimately recover . i can t thank him enough for his influence . even today , he s a strong source of comfort , support , and encouragement for me . i wouldn t have accomplished as much as i have if it wasn t for him rooting me on and instilling in me a sense of confidence .","296219":"yes , it still means something at the very least . some places of employment like seeing that people graduated from college , so a bachelor s degree is still reputable . i believe that it isn t as meaningful as it used to be in the past , though . more and more jobs are looking for applicants with master s degree or above because they re more valuable .","296220":"i would reveal the usernames of everyone on anon , lmao . it would be interesting to see who exactly is hiding on anonymous and sending people gross questions .","296221":"i don t want to erase any more memories . most of my life has been forgotten as it is , i wish i could remember more instead of having amnesia all the time .","296222":"i don t desire to be given advice from my parents , so nothing . i m content with what they know about my life already .","296223":"it s pretty self explanatory . you just feel hollow and void of emotion , like nothing excites you or even saddens you anymore . you simply exist .","296224":"i am good at saving money , but that s because i have little money to save so i try to save whenever possible . if i was given something as large as million dollars , i would probably spend a decent amount on a house , cars for people i know , a new wardrobe , etc etc .","296225":"i d rather have k per week for the rest of my life . at least it s a steady income , so i won t blow it all at once , lol .","296226":"yeah , i agree . they re just trying to stir the pot .","296227":"oh , i assumed they meant like a friendship breakup , lol .","296228":"i own maybe beanies .","296229":"yes , i have one brother .","296230":"i don t reveal that to anyone , let alone to someone anonymous on the internet , lol .","296231":"i don t concern myself with other people s personal lives . if you re going to spread rumors about people , at least tag them . cc manicmartyrdom","296232":"no , i ve never seen a fortune teller before .","296233":"yeah , i looked ugly af with a beard , lmao . i didn t save any pictures .","296234":"i don t really know anything about the situation , so i m neutral .","296235":"i m either easily distracted or incredibly hyperfocused , haha . there s no in between .","296236":"i don t self advertise unless i ve written something new and posted it on medium . com . i haven t written anything new in a while though .","296237":"yes , i got bullied in middle school and early high school .","296238":"probably any of the ages between and . i can t really choose a specific age , but my teenage years were a really dark time in my life .","296239":"most likely someone i don t even know , lol .","296240":"i don t know who dua lipa is , so billie eilish . i also love billie s music .","296241":"building new ships , lol . it would be good for trade .","296242":"no , i just have a regular phone case .","296243":"manicmartyrdom apparently sitting down when you re tired is problematic now .","296244":"i don t have any tea to spill .","296245":"lol , no that certainly isn t the case .","296246":"it keeps shutting itself off when i make a brewing selection instead of actually brewing the coffee . and i honestly don t have the energy to try anything else rn . getting up for those five minutes made everything worse .","296247":"i guess migraines every so often , it isn t unusual for me . they re just not usually this bad . on top of the migraine , i ve been lightheaded , very nauseous , cloudy , and sore . i also just got my period which is probably why i have a migraine , and my spring allergies certainly don t help either .","296248":"i haven t since i ve been laying down for the most part , but when i was at work and driving , i was extremely dizzy and lightheaded .","296249":"i went downstairs to make a small cup of coffee so the caffeine can help the migraine , and my keurig just flat out broke . i m literally on the verge of tears because hormones suck , why is this happening .","296250":"rainbow cookies or cannoli cake .","296251":"i can think of three within a minute drive .","296252":"i would make my boyfriend happy . sometimes i care about his happiness above my own , and he deserves everything in his life to be going well and for him to be healthy .","296253":"yes , i know quite a few people who fit that description .","296254":"i don t think i would want to go to an escape room at all , they sound absolutely nerve wracking .","296255":"it s almost as if people are allowed to have cheat days . o thank you for the suggestion , though . i have a cold compress on my head rn . this migraine is hormonal because it happens every month , i just have to wait for it to subside .","296256":"he s a terrible person with a dishonest heart . he s only looking out for himself and people similar to him , not those who are already struggling with issues of racism , sexism , homophobia , transphobia , or ableism . throughout his presidency , his presence had given permission for closeminded americans to express their ignorance with full freedom because they know they wouldn t be reprimanded for it .","296257":"yeah , i don t feel any emotional attachment to food so it would be easy for me to give up meat and fish . i m planning to transition to a vegetarian lifestyle eventually , i think it would be interesting to see how i would feel if i cut animal products out of my diet .","296258":"surprisingly , i ve never broken a bone before .","296259":"i don t own any sportswear brands .","296260":"i prefer chips over popcorn . i don t like when popcorn gets stuck in my teeth or anything .","296261":"i normally eat times per day . breakfast , lunch , a small snack , and dinner .","296262":"i don t generally experience insomnia . most of the time , i m exhausted so i have no problem falling asleep regardless of what time it is .","296263":"i woke up at am , so i was delighted to find out that i could go back to bed for an additional hour before i had to get up and get ready for work .","296264":"no , not at the moment . however , i do own all of the game of thrones books , so i might begin reading them soon .","296265":"it s technically legal because they re both adults , but the year old should remain vigilant of her partner s motives . there s little rational reason for a year old to be interested in someone who s barely of legal age , so i would be mindful of his intentions in the relationship . it could be a power trip .","296266":"no , college prepared me for the job opportunities that presented themselves after i earned my degree . granted , i ll be in student loan debt for the next years , but what i wanted to do with my life required a degree , otherwise i wouldn t have had an entrance into my field .","296267":"i don t give out my snapchat either . askfm is the only place you can talk to me , and even so , i don t have conversations on askfm . i m only here to answer questions .","296268":"it went well this morning , but i haven t been doing well the past few hours . after lunch , i developed a migraine and it still hasn t quelled . for the last two hours of work and driving home , i felt like i was going to vomit and or pass out . now that i ve been home , i ve been sipping on ginger ale and trying to relax my body . i already took so much ibuprofen today so i m hesitant to take more . i think i just need to sleep it off .","296269":"no . i don t give out my facebook .","296270":"hello do you have a question ? ?","296271":"i ve never eaten authentic mexican food , so i don t know . i like spanish food in general , but i m sure most of what i ve eaten is just an americanized version .","296272":"it depends on what you ultimately want to do with your life , honestly . these days , it s becoming more and more common for people to go to trade schools because you won t end up in massive debt , you learn new skills that are highly marketable , and the job market is always booming .","296273":"no , at least not purposely . i ve developed a collection of mugs but that was mostly unintentional .","296274":"i don t really consider those states to be the south . it would be different if i intended to go to alabama or georgia , though probably .","296275":"is one of those tricky ages because it s the age of consent in some places , but not others . it s in new york , for example .","296276":"i m honestly not sure . it depends on how the next few months play out .","296277":"yeah , adults cannot legally have sex with minors . it s considered statutory r pe .","296278":"no , i ve never needed surgery before .","296279":"the two months between graduation and moving to college were spent with my boyfriend . we had just started dating at that point , so we tried to spend as much time together as possible . most of the time , we were at the park or the beach .","296280":"my boyfriend and i were looking into north carolina , actually . we want to visit there , as well as west virginia or virginia .","296281":"i m years old .","296282":"i don t reveal his name on social media .","296283":"rofl . damn , y all are strict around these parts .","296284":"what makes you think i m not ? ? lmao . god forbid i have a single cheeseburger on my day off from work .","296285":"i live in new york .","296286":"you can ask me questions if you d like .","296287":"friendship isn t forced , lol . you can t exactly just confront a person and say we re friends now . it has to happen naturally .","296288":"i don t care if you follow me or not .","296289":"no , i don t do that sort of thing .","296290":"i don t follow you . i don t know if you follow me or not .","296291":"that would require me to have picked the burgers up in the first place , lol .","296292":"we went out to breakfast , took a nap , grilled some burgers , and had a campfire in the backyard .","296293":"my day yesterday was fantastic . my boyfriend and i got to spend the entire day together , which is something we haven t been able to do in months . it was such a relaxing break that i so desperately needed .","296294":"no , i didn t post it because i was busy yesterday and only got around to answering two questions , lmao . i just answered it , so the answer you re looking for is below .","296295":", per month is the bare minimum , and i ve only ever seen that maybe two times and they were questionable listings , lol . anything . k or lower isn t a good place to be in , most reputable listings are at least . k , unfortunately .","296296":"people who have never lived in new york really have no idea what they re talking about .","296297":"yeah , exactly . that s why my boyfriend will be looking into different states , because we cannot afford new york housing and neither can most other people who live here .","296298":"i can t choose just one favorite show . however , some of my favorites are parks and rec , how i met your mother , supernatural , criminal minds , ncis , bones , game of thrones , and wentworth .","296299":"i live in the suburbs now , and i can t find a one bedroom apartment in a decent area for less than . go off , though .","296300":"it s am , lol . i wake up around am every day .","296301":"if i was rich , then i would have bought a house already .","296302":"i meant that i could buy a house as long as it isn t in new york , lol . new york housing is expensive af .","296303":"thanks for the follow ! ! i don t follow people upon request , though .","296304":"as long as it isn t in new york , then maybe .","296305":"ideally , i would prefer to buy a house .","296306":"my mental health has been better lately , but i m still unstable , lol . i just don t air my grievances on social media .","296307":"unstable .","296308":"you can be the hero in your own story .","296309":"i assume its a festival that occurs on halloween .","296310":"continued living when all i wanted to do was lay down and die .","296311":"no , not generally . when i was younger , i used to listen to ayumi hamasaki , though .","296312":"only if there s a work related function , haha . i dressed up last halloween because my office had a costume contest .","296313":"no , that s going back over ten years ago .","296314":"yeah , i ve been doing it since i was a teenager .","296315":"i routinely wax my upper lip and eyebrows , haha . it isn t painful to me anymore .","296316":"november th .","296317":"ask me questions , friends . my inbox is empty","296318":"it s difficult to make connections with people when everyone has a different concept of the type of connection they expect to have with someone else , if that makes sense . what each person wants will be different , so even though everyone wants an intimate connection with others , it s hard to find someone you re compatible with .","296319":"i don t have a favorite movie of all time , but i do have a lot of comfort movies that bring me peace and joy when i m feeling down . one of them is heathers . i like the themes of the movie and it just makes me happy .","296320":"no , they re uncomfortable to me .","296321":"if you saw my last answer , you would see that i said i don t feel comfortable explaining it .","296322":"something really terrible that i don t feel comfortable explaining on askfm , haha .","296323":"i need to improve on my self care and self confidence . i don t care for myself as often as i should .","296324":"i ended my last friendship because they were toxic for my mental health and caused more problem than solved them . it wasn t serving me to be friends with them , and i only try to surround myself with friends who bring out the best in me these days .","296325":"the weather , lmao . it s such a small talk sort of subject , and people only talk about it when they have nothing else to talk about .","296326":"yeah , i use paypal to purchase things online .","296327":"yeah , i know how to swim .","296328":"i used to watch it in the past , but that was many years ago .","296329":"? ? ?","296330":"i ve honestly always admired heartofstitches for his strength , sense of humor , and individuality . we have a lot in common and i think we would be amazing friends if we met irl .","296331":"my boyfriend is a positive male role model for me . he s extremely hard working almost to a fault he s on vacation this week , but he still checks his work email , smh . he s also endured significant hardship and trauma , but despite it all , he has never allowed his setbacks to define his life or his future . he also has type diabetes and has to be careful of his diet and activities , and his knowledge of his health problems is astounding because he knows more than his doctors at this point .","296332":"depends on which holiday you re talking about , haha . if i m giving someone a gift , though , i usually try to make it more relevant to a season as opposed to a particular holiday . i like finding quirky , cute things on etsy ! !","296333":"lol , that dragon show . funnily enough , i do know exactly what you mean by that . i don t believe the ending was silly , no . the ending was disappointing , in my personal opinion . it left viewers with more questions than answers , a lot of the plot turns didn t make sense compared to the rest of the series , and it was simply underwhelming . i sat there pretty emotionless throughout the entire episode , when beforehand i thought i would be rather emotional .","296334":"i ve never fallen for any of them , but i ve definitely thought that a lot of them were beautiful or handsome .","296335":"two weeks ago , i went out to dinner with a coworker , and we spent hours at the restaurant just talking and laughing and drinking and eating . it was actually a lot of fun , and it felt nice to go out and have a good time without it being at a bar .","296336":"i took tomorrow off from work so that i can spend the day together with my boyfriend . i haven t had an entire day off from work in such a long time , and i also haven t been able to spend an entire day off with my boyfriend for even longer . excited is an understatement ! !","296337":"laurel ! !","296338":"askfm , instagram , and facebook .","296339":"i m not comfortable with my body regardless of what i wear , lol .","296340":"i used to play sims a lot when i was younger ! ! i still have it downloaded on my laptop actually , lol . occasionally my boyfriend and i will play on his xbox one since sims is on there .","296341":"i d rather have the power to be invisible so that people can leave me alone .","296342":"i didn t have a gap year . i went to college straight after high school .","296343":"i don t count them , but i always choose low calorie options when i can .","296344":"i m five feet tall . i don t know my weight .","296345":"i try to , but right now i m more focused on my outer appearance and my health as opposed to my inner self , i . e . my mental health and stability . don t get me wrong both are equally as important , but because my mental health has been pretty stable these past few months , it has led me to focus more time on getting my priorities in order when it comes to my physical health .","296346":"i mean , nearly everything causes a fight in my household , lol . it isn t a specific topic , it s just how my parents feel on that particular day because some days they feel more argumentative than others .","296347":"my best friend is a positive female role model for me . she s endured such hardship throughout her life , and she struggles with a plethora of health problems , but she still finds the beauty in her life and has succeeded in all of her goals through hard work and determination . she s such a passionate person and i aspire to be more like her .","296348":"good morning , and happy tuesday ! !","296349":"i wasn t awake when you sent this to me , no .","296350":"it s cheese , but vegan cheese . i don t know what they re made out of , but apparently they still taste like regular cheese .","296351":"there are a bunch of vegan alternatives to cheese . i probably wouldn t miss much of anything because there will always be an alternative that s vegan .","296352":"i could probably do that too , just not at this point in my life .","296353":"probably , i rarely eat meat as it is .","296354":"when someone treats someone else , particularly people in the food or drink service industry , in a nice and considerate manner that makes me have respect for others . in the same vein , i lose all my respect in others if they treat service workers poorly and act rude or entitled when they re being waited on .","296355":"the last beautiful thing i heard was my boyfriend s laughter while we talked on the phone this afternoon .","296356":"i m not sure if this would be considered a typical risk , but last week , i agreed to take on extra work in the form of training a new employee on top of all the other work i m doing . at first , i was concerned that i was going to get anxious and overwhelmed with everything i had to juggle , but as the hours and days went by , i managed my time a lot better and was able to allocate an adequate amount of time to training the new employee while also finishing my own daily tasks .","296357":"becoming a reliable person isn t something you can follow steps to do . it takes a lot of hard work and self realization , knowing that if you were once unreliable that you have to improve yourself and actively work on bettering yourself for the future . it s a conditioned behavior the more you do it and work towards it , the more it ll become second nature to you .","296358":"i understand why some people are secretive , because it usually means that they re simply a private person and don t feel comfortable sharing much about their life . i don t avoid people like that , because i know where they re coming from . however , it s difficult to really navigate a friendship or relationship when someone won t open up to you .","296359":"wild horses by the rolling stones has always held a deep significance to me . it doesn t really describe my life at all , but it s simply a song that was playing during a heartfelt and important moment of my life , and it s always been a source of peace for that reason .","296360":"sometimes i think too deeply about my own existence the point of me being alive , the point of anyone being alive , the purpose of life , what exists outside of this life we ve been conditioned to live in , etc etc . it sucks , because it makes me dissociate so badly , but i can t stop myself from thinking these things at times , especially late at night when i m trying to go to sleep .","296361":"men who struggle with mental illness , i . e . depression , anxiety , personality disorders , psychosis , body dysmorphia , eating disorders , etc etc . there s so much of a stigma against men who have mental illnesses because it makes them seem weak , which leads to less men speaking out about their issues and further decreases the amount of men who seek treatment for their problems .","296362":"if my organs are healthy enough to harvest , then yes . if not , then i definitely would want to donate my body to science .","296363":"no , not particularly . on the contrary , it s more of a combination of those senses which provide a very real feeling to me . when i can see hear something , or feel taste something , or any combination or two or more senses , it s that much more grounding .","296364":"my mental illnesses have been one of the biggest challenges i ve had to face , and to a degree , i still have to cope with them every day although they re not nearly as bad as they used to be .","296365":"there is one thing i regret , although it s an internal battle for me to try to forgive myself of that mistake . i don t think about it most of the time , but at certain moments , it does really mess with me and i begin to wonder what if scenarios .","296366":"honestly , i m curious about drama when it doesn t involve me . lol . but it s just curiosity , i don t feel any emotional connection to drama whatsoever unless it s something very serious that can t be considered drama anymore . i keep my online pages drama free for the most part , but i do occasionally find myself in debates with people simply for voicing my opinion on things .","296367":"lol , no . i definitely didn t believe the world was ending or that the apocalypse was coming . i felt amused by the entire situation .","296368":"eh , yes and no . i liked some of the outcomes of a few of the characters at the end , but at the same time , the writers of the episode did not answer all of the questions or tie up some of the loose ends . a few of the scenes honestly made no sense when comparing it to the rest of the series , and there were some inconsistencies as well . i was prepared to be emotional , but i was ultimately left emotionless and neutral . i was just watching it , not moved by any particular scene or emotion the characters were going through . it just sorta happened . however , i do have to say that the cinematics were beautiful .","296369":"probably . i don t really know where it originated from , but it makes sense if younger people don t know what it means . i hardly ever hear people say that anymore .","296370":"lol . oh jeez . say it s just an expression , meaning like do you work too much or something .","296371":"no , that isn t selfish at all . you shouldn t stay in any kind of relationship if you re unhappy . considering you re a parent , you should do what s best for yourself and your child . it s better to raise a child with two happy , separated parents as opposed to in a broken home .","296372":"i guess you can consider me that , yeah . i work hours a week , and on top of that , i write freelance on the weekends .","296373":"overpriced and underwhelming , as per usual .","296374":"i have no clue , i ve never measured my running speed .","296375":"all of the new game of thrones memes since last night , lmao . the only things better than the show are the memes that come out of the show . they re fantastic .","296376":"i honestly don t believe i ll live to see my th birthday , lol . however , i said that about and then , so who knows for sure . i guess i would rather age gracefully , although i ll probably always look on the younger side .","296377":"i ve never left the united states . i prefer coffee over tea .","296378":"any of my favorite movies like the punisher , heathers , sweeney todd , i am not a serial killer , the crow , american psycho , queen of the damned , and the shining .","296379":"no , unless it happens when i m proofreading someone s assignment at work , lol . otherwise , i don t care how people spell things on social media .","296380":"no , just leigh .","296381":"it depends on the questions being asked to me .","296382":"i admire my boyfriend for his tenacity and diligence . he s an extremely strong and hard working person , and i ve always admired his persistence despite the obstacles against him .","296383":"for the most part , yes . occasionally i ll splurge on taco bell or something , but it maybe happens once every two months or so .","296384":"i don t believe i ever did in the first place .","296385":"no , i m absolutely terrible at giving speeches . i have social anxiety , so the idea of standing in front of people and talking makes me panic .","296386":"my name is leigh , so apparently not .","296387":"i have a lot more resilience than i give myself credit for , and i ve been pushing myself a lot harder to work toward my goals than ever before .","296388":"i m in love with my boyfriend , so i definitely recognize love at this point in my life . he s my biggest support system .","296389":"i ve been all right . honestly , i ve been dealing with a lot of anxiety lately for some unknown reason , i guess it comes and goes in waves . my depression has been quelled for the most part besides lethargy , but i ve been trying to combat that with exercise every other day or so .","296390":"i don t reveal his name on the internet . i don t generally drink soda .","296391":"good ! ! i ve been using the treadmill at least x per week . i feel an increase in my stamina already .","296392":"no , i was extremely disappointed actually . it brought out no emotion in me whatsoever .","296393":"no , i ll be working on memorial day .","296394":"depends on the day .","296395":"i already said , people watching me .","296396":"i don t know what else there is to existence , or what exists outside of life , so that s difficult to say . thinking about it makes life seem rather meaningless .","296397":"i mainly said it as a joke , lol . but my life always has the tendency to be filled with miscommunication , pitfalls , hardships , etc etc . there s rarely an easygoing moment .","296398":"people watching me , mainly .","296399":"yeah , i m paranoid fairly often .","296400":"i can t say whether you were in the wrong because i know nothing about the argument you had .","296401":"yeah , it wasn t bad . the only bad thing that happened today was finding out that my anxiety medication is on back order , so my pharmacy is in the process of contacting my doctor so she can authorize a prescription for a different dosage . which means that i probably won t have my medication for a short period of time .","296402":"i remember . i don t really see the point in bringing this up , though . lol .","296403":"yeah , i ve seen spoilers for things on social media prior to me watching the episode , i . e . game of thrones . i don t hate spoilers because hate is a strong word , but they re just inconvenient , lol .","296404":"i used to be when i was a teenager , but i haven t tried drawing anything since then .","296405":"that was proven to be false , actually .","296406":"it was all right , nothing too extraordinary but nothing terrible happened either . i woke up around am and worked on some freelance assignments , ate breakfast , took a shower , and then headed off to a doctor s appointment . after my appointment , i ran some errands and i ve been home for the past three hours , just scrolling through social media and listening to music . i m re watching last week s episode of game of thrones rn before the series finale premieres tonight .","296407":"yes , i was bullied in middle school and in early high school . i was bullied for my appearance and my clothing style .","296408":"my boyfriend is italian and cuban , so yeah . prior to meeting him , i wasn t interested in dating men only women .","296409":"smh . some decent questions would be appreciated","296410":"depends on what the situation is . you ll have to be more specific , anon .","296411":"my lowest moment was the time i attempted s icide when i was a teenager . i didn t pull myself out of it , i just failed .","296412":"que ser , ser .","296413":"i honestly don t see why your anons always come to my page to try to justify their dislike of you , lol . clearly we re friends .","296414":"yes , it s normal to get a period between the ages of around to . some get it sooner , some get it later , etc etc . everyone s body is different .","296415":"rofl .","296416":"no , he would never do something like that . if my relationship got ab sive , i would try to do everything in my power to leave although obviously leaving an ab sive relationship is much harder than just leaving .","296417":"i don t see how this concerns me . cc littlesha","296418":". . . this is making zero sense . you can t justify r pe through bodily autonomy , it simply doesn t work that way . i already explained why this hypothetical situation is false .","296419":"i didn t say he should get a longer sentence just that they do . i don t agree with sentences not fitting the crimes , and hypothetically if a male and female committed the same crime , they should get the same sentence . i m on your side with this one , don t worry . the justice system is , too , extremely biased and backwards .","296420":"he can do what he wants with his own body . not someone else s body . when you infringe on someone else s person without their consent , then that s a terrible thing to do . it doesn t even compare to getting an abortion . people have bodily autonomy , which means they have rights to what they can do with their own bodies .","296421":"it isn t really priority if the sentences fit the crime , tbh . if a male is more aggressive than a female , then logically he s going to get a longer and more severe sentence than a female . however , i do agree that there is a societal expectation placed on men to be aggressive as a whole to be more manly or masculine , and there s so much stigma attached to males showing feminine qualities .","296422":"uh . . . that s doing something to someone else s body , not his own . people can do what they want with their own bodies , but when it infringes on someone else s rights or consent , then obviously that s extremely wrong .","296423":"wow , askfm deleted all of my previous answers regarding abortion . smh . probably because we were talking about r pe .","296424":"this is true ! ! there are more cases of male aggression than female aggression .","296425":"did askfm delete my answer ? ? ugh . to reiterate yes , i do believe that people can do what they want with their bodies without government interference . the government does not own someone s body , and abortion is a health care issue above all else .","296426":"oh goodness . no one dies with an abortion either . an abortion is a termination of a pregnancy before a fetus is viable . regardless of your stance on abortion , we can at least agree that every person should have the right to choose what they can do with their bodies without government interference .","296427":"i don t consider any of my skills to be special , lol .","296428":"no . that s why i m actively trying to change how i look .","296429":"how old are you ?

boyfriend .","296434":"i wouldn t know , i ve never lived or visited the west coast before .","296435":"i don t have physical copies of most of my games .","296436":"of what ? ? lmao .","296437":"doing nothing throughout the week except work , eat , and sleep . we weren t meant to live to work , and my world feels colorless and dull when i have those weeks where i don t do

child .","296439":"it isn t different for me compared to everyone else . i experience things that most other people experience .","296440":"i definitely read this as have you recently had a poo poo as in asking us when our last bowel movement was , lmfao . yeah , it happened at work . i thought i had a good idea but it turned out to be pretty shit .","296441":"not generally . i m more of a realist so i try to look at things from several perspectives instead of just simply being hopeful .","296442":"i already discussed this in depth yesterday . however , to summarize my beliefs , i strongly don t agree with the ban . it s not going to prevent abortions from occurring , only safe and legal abortions .","296443":"not very often at all . perhaps once every few months , if even that often .","296444":"i didn t know that was a thing . i m honestly not sure , that s something you would have to look up .","296445":"i m ready for the series finale , but i don t know whether to be hopeful or to prepare for the worst , lol . i think jon will ultimately sit on the iron throne , even though danaerys wants it regardless of jon s true identity . my thinking is that after last week s episode , arya will do everything in her power to either stop danaerys or actually k ll her she has green eyes , like the prophecy said . and considering danaerys has essentially gone mad with power and anger , i don t think she s suitable for the throne anymore .","296446":"i m not sure . most of the books i read have dark themes to them , so they certainly wouldn t make the world a better place , haha .","296447":"well , i hope so too . however , i m a realist and i don t believe anything would come of it . if i ever brought up the notion of ab se to them , they would react unfavorably and deny any involvement , and they would likely get extremely angry at the thought that i would think such a thing occurred . they ve been gaslighting me for years regarding that .","296448":"no . i don t believe i m capable of doing that , at least not within the next few years . they don t believe that they did anything wrong in my upbringing , and they constantly talk about how they don t know why you turned out the way you are , meaning my plethora of mental health issues . it s difficult , if not impossible , to reconcile with people who don t believe they did anything wrong in the first place .","296449":"parents ab sing their children is a lot more common than people believe . it s just seldom discussed because of the shame and guilt associated with it . i m not going into the details of

we would invite my boyfriend s best friend and his girlfriend to the campfire , but i m not much for social interaction these days .","296453":"waking up with my boyfriend and having breakfast and coffee with him outside on a beautiful day . later on , we would go to the park and walk around and take pictures . perhaps we would go to a restaurant for lunch , and then go home and take a nap . in the evening , we would have a campfire in the backyard with some alcoholic drinks . then we would go to bed after maybe watching something funny on youtube or rewatching a tv show or movie we both like .","296454":"i like all of the above except the wind . i like cool breezes , especially in the summer , but i dislike when it s too windy outside .","296455":"as i stated previously , i m currently in a relationship .","296456":"no , the only person i have a crush on is my boyfriend . lol .","296457":"i ve always felt a spiritual connection to the moon . however , i also enjoy the sunshine .","296458":"i d much rather have an extra large coffee than a small coffee , so yes .","296459":"uh , no ? ? lmao . that s quite a concerning way to view the world .","296460":"like i said before , you re incredibly misinformed on tattoos . do a bit of research before you spout misinformation on the internet . tattooing is a completely safe practice .","296461":"i like italian cuisine the best . my favorite dish is either chicken francaise or steamed mussels with white wine garlic .","296462":"broccoli and or spinach .","296463":"i haven t been a virgin in a very long time , so it isn t something i think about at all . if someone wants to abstain from sex , then they should be allowed the freedom to do so . not everyone is interested in having sex , and they should be respected regardless of what their decision is .","296464":"i m not sad necessarily , but i just genuinely hope they end the series in a way that makes sense and isn t extraordinarily out of character or with bad writing , lol . i m expecting the worst but hoping for the best at the same time with this last episode , especially considering last week s episode was disastrous and so anticlimactic .","296465":"bullies are likely insecure with themselves , which is why they sometimes feel compelled to bully others who don t find the standard mold of what a person stereotypically should be , especially in a young school setting . bullies either have hardships going on at home or they re incredibly uncertain about their own personality , looks , or future , which is why they feel the need to transfer those feelings onto someone else . it puts them in a position of power .","296466":"there wasn t an influence . i ve just never wanted to have children for as long as i can remember .","296467":"yes , i was bullied mostly in middle school to the beginning of high school .","296468":"you re incredibly misinformed about tattoos . tattoo do not have poison in them , otherwise tattoo ink would be outlawed in society . tattoo ink is very much safe , and there are even a lot of vegan inks out there that artists enjoy using .","296469":"no , i don t invite people over to the house .

on where you live in new york , lol . if you re talking about new york city , then that s where dreams either flourish or go to die .","296473":"yes , but not the typical let s have children sort of family . i m perfectly content with marrying my boyfriend and adopting a lot of pets , lol .","296474":"i m just emphasizing the word love . i put words between asterisks when i want to emphasize the word , since we can t italicize on askfm .","296475":"no , i don t like sports generally . the only sport i can say that i m semi interested in is ice hockey , but that s mainly because of my boyfriend , who used to be heavily into ice hockey when he was younger .","296476":"no , i m just planning on exercising , taking a shower , eating dinner , and then settling down and watching the series finale of game of thrones .","296477":"ah , i used to love that movie . i watched it during an italian media studies course i took in college . i don t remember the soundtrack at all , but i ll definitely look it up . i love listening to instrumental music when i m working .","296478":"no , i ve never believed in a higher power , even when i was a child . i used to take religion classes when i was younger , and even then , i viewed the bible as merely stories instead of a text that told the truth . i never believed in god .","296479":"yes , i value my personal space very much . i don t like people getting too close to me or touching me .","296480":"no , i don t believe in god . i m an athiest .","296481":"right now , it s harry potter the sorcerer s stone by john williams . however

the most real things in this world . it just depends on where you find love and with whom you share love .","296483":"i like some classical music , but i haven t listened to it in a long time . i normally listen to video game and movie soundtracks .","296484":"talk to your partner about your dilemma it s perfectly all right to be nervous about losing your virginity , it s quite common . establish some ground rules with her and don t be afraid to ask questions , especially when it comes to her own likes and dislikes . if she s a good person , she ll accept the fact that you re nervous and allow you to take your time to navigate the situation . if you re not doing something right , she should tell you and you can adjust accordingly . if you are doing something right , she should reassure you and tell you to continue doing it . communication is absolutely key in these situations .","296485":"no , i haven t . i don t even know where the closest volcano is , haha .","296486":"this happens to me often , usually because it s difficult for me to really explain what i m thinking verbally and sometimes the words come out wrong . i can t think of any examples at the moment , but it s the reason why i prefer email at work , because at least i can sit there and write what i mean instead of stumbling over my words in person or on the phone .","296487":"i d definitely play lotto , lol . i could definitely use a substantial amount of money .","296488":"aw , lol . that s so adorable . as long as he doesn t try to mimic what they re doing on tv , you guys should be fine , haha .","296489":"yes , i m a very competitive person , lol . mostly when it comes to video games , to the point where i get really down on myself if i don t win something . that s why i sometimes avoid large multiplayer games , because i know i would just get really angry and upset if i don t win .","296490":"when i m with my boyfriend , we really love watching vine compilations , fail compilations especially failarmy , and try not to laugh challenges ! ! the best try not to laugh challenges are those recorded by markiplier , they have us cracking up every time

terrific idea .","296492":"honestly , i would just go about my daily routine and enjoy the fact that no one is bothering me . lmao .","296493":"these days , i haven t really been taking part in any hobbies . most of my days are filled with work , and then when i m home , i usually exercise , cook and clean , shower , and maybe watch netflix before going to bed . i used to be able to say that my favorite hobby was playing video games , but i honestly can t remember the last time i even did that .","296494":"i don t believe it s insulting , no . there s a huge pool of actors and actresses who are lgbt , disabled , trans , etc etc . the reason why a lot of people push for actors to have the same traits as the person they re acting is because there will be more representation in the media of those types of actors . there s really no reason why a gay actor shouldn t play a gay celebrity in a biopic , especially when the pool is so large .","296495":"no , i don t believe in reincarnation . i believe it s an interesting theory , but it isn t something that i believe exists .","296496":"i prefer console games over games on the phone or computer .","296497":"i think it ultimately depends on who you re with . when i was single , i did the same thing i pushed people away , especially those who wanted to get close to me . however , when you do find someone that you feel you can share your feelings with , it does become easier to open up to them at least , in my personal experience . like i said , i shut myself out from most people from an early age because i thought i was too much for them , and even though there were plenty of people who were interested in me , i nevertheless did not return their feelings and totally shut myself out from everyone . it wasn t until i met my current boyfriend that i felt i was able to open up to someone , because he first and foremost opened himself up to me . i felt as if it almost gave me needed permission to open up as well . long story short i believe you do have the capability of opening up to people , it just has to be the right person , and you won t know who that person is until you meet them or get to know them on a deeper level . i think it does get easier with time , especially as you get older and instill more confidence in yourself .","296498":"i think it s a cute tradition , but it isn t really necessary in modern times anymore . first dates should be directed based on each person s preferences , i . e . if they both believe that a man should pay for the entire meal , then they should be allowed the freedom to do that . however , if they prefer the bill be split , then they should also be allowed to do that too . i believe my boyfriend paid for our first date because we were young and traditions were still strong , but these days , we normally switch back and forth on who pays the bill , i . e . he ll pay one day and i ll pay the following day , etc etc .","296499":"i glean inspiration from the little things in my life that move me , whether it s nature , relationships i witness between friends or partners , or current events . if i feel strongly about something , regardless of what it is , i can draw inspiration from it . my boyfriend inspires me the most , and he inspires me to be the best version of myself i can be . whether that s through exercising often , being honest with myself and with him regarding my emotions , or standing up for what i believe in .","296500":"i m not really sure . i normally make my interests and my knowledge quite apparent .","296501":"yes . depending on who i m with , i sorta adopt my friends personalities . it isn t a conscious decision , it just happens because i don t have a personality of my own , so i have a tendency to drift toward people who have bold strong personalities .","296502":"i always offer my help , but they insist that i stay and hang out with him and his family .","296503":"no , i dislike family gatherings when it comes to my own family . i much prefer going to my boyfriend s family gatherings .","296504":"the hormone monster ! !","296505":"everyone before you become friends with them is someone you don t know . however , i m not looking for new friends at the moment .","296506":"uh , something i d rather not discuss on askfm . lmao .","296507":"i normally remain calm and try to go through the argument as civally as possible . in the past , i use to cry and shut down but as i ve gotten older , i ve learned to control those emotions . i don t usually argue with my friends or boyfriend . occasionally my boyfriend and i will have a disagreement , but it isn t really anything major .","296508":"only of those close to me , particularly my boyfriend . if he s upset , then i normally become upset because i feel helpless in making him feel better . when he s happy , on the other hand , i feel on top of the world .","296509":"i think it ultimately depends on who you follow . my feed is normally incredibly active .","296510":"i can t really think of a right answer to this question besides when i said yes to my boyfriend initially asking me if i wanted to date him , lol . he wanted me to be his partner , so after a few dates , i decided to give him a chance .","296511":"celinem littlesha sweetnothings urlsareshittbh kittiemeowsie misphire jonesymo all of these people are fairly active ! !","296512":"people have told me to just tough it out regarding my mental health before i was seeking treatment , thinking that my episodes were a phase and i would get over them . i m thankful that i didn t listen to them .","296513":"perhaps not for most people , but my worries do conflict with my optimism although i m not an optimistic person to begin with . when i m worried about something , i generally expect the worst .","296514":"idk , i ve never done research on different countries like that . probably somewhere in europe or in australia .","296515":"? ? ? just because i m non binary doesn t mean i don t have the capability to become pregnant , lol . i still have a uterus , and i m not sure if i m infertile . i ve only ever has my suspicions . even if i was infertile , that doesn t mean that i don t get the chance to have an opinion . i still have a uterus . and everyone should be outraged , the new laws that are being passed are ridiculous .","296516":"yes , definitely . the united states is becoming less and less desirable to live in .","296517":"no it s not ? ? jesus , how young are you .","296518":"i don t know anyone who s old on askfm , lol . if you re talking about shehitsback , then allison isn t old . you re probably just hella young and can t accept the fact that people will have different opinions than you .","296519":"no , it wasn t really productive at all . i had a fever from last night until this morning , so i didn t sleep very well and ended up staying in bed until around am . i ve only written out of the assignments that were given to me , and the only productive things i ve done have been those assignments and putting on a face mask , lmao . i was supposed to see my tattoo artist for a consultation this afternoon , but because i was running a fever this morning , i didn t want to risk going to the shop in case i was still carrying something .","296520":"i got stitches when i was a toddler because my hand got slammed inside of a door , and doctors basically needed to stitch the tip of one of my fingers back onto my hand . i don t know how many stitches it was .","296521":"super conservative , backwards ass , bible thumping cowards who have zero understanding of the human body and the rights we have regarding our own lives . most of these senators and legislators believe that life begins at conception , that god makes everything happen for a reason , and that the fetus life is more important than the mother s life , even if that mother s life is at risk .","296522":"i live in new york , and no , i don t believe the state enforces the death penalty .","296523":"i sincerely hope not . the united states is supposed to be a developed and progressive nation ha . the amount that we have backpedaled over the past few years is remarkable .","296524":"yes , they would prosecute her too . from my understanding of alabama and ohio s bills and i guess missouri too , people who obtain or perform abortions will end up getting more prison time than those who have r ped impregnated that person . i read somewhere that the penalty for a doctor to perform an abortion is up to years .","296525":"i disagree with you . regardless of someone s reasoning , people should have the bodily autonomy to do what s necessary with their own bodies . if that means they want an abortion , they should be allowed the freedom to have an abortion . women s and trans men and non binary people too bodies are not up for debate .","296526":"she s a radical conservative political commentator .","296527":"if you read some of what these legislators and senators have to say regarding abortion and fetuses , your jaw would drop . some of them are claiming that it was meant to happen because of god s will , even in the cases of r pe inc st . others have zero understanding of how the female body even works .","296528":"without a doubt , yes . abortion is a health care issue and should not be within the state s rights to decide upon . there is no such thing as life at conception , and everyone with a uterus has the right to obtain an abortion if they want or need one , regardless of their reason . they should have the bodily autonomy to do so . right now with these laws passing , people with uteruses have less bodily autonomy than the deceased , which is absolutely ridiculous .","296529":"i just looked it up briefly yeah , alaska legislators are trying to introduce a bill outlawing abortion as well , with those obtaining an abortion or performing one being treated as a felon on assault or homicide charges . absolutely despicable .","296530":"i honestly have no idea . but i honestly hope there s enough of an uproar to change some people s minds . i mean . . . even tomi lahren opposes the abortion bans , lmao .","296531":"yes . alabama just passed a major bill outlawing basically all abortions , to the point where people who have abortions can be imprisoned and treated as a felony , as well as doctors who perform abortions . they d be getting more prison time than if someone were to r pe someone and impregnate them . ohio passed the heartbeat bill a short time ago , banning abortion at the week mark . before most people even realize that they re pregnant .","296532":"missouri too ? ! i just had to google that to see if that s correct . to sum it up for my followers , missouri just passed a bill outlawing abortion at the week mark . i think it s absolutely absurd . all of these abortion limiting measure being taken by various states like missouri , alabama , ohio , etc etc . are extreme and not necessary . by banning abortion , you re not going to stop abortions from happening you re only going to stop safe abortions . people are going to be seriously injured and potentially d e because they re going to be forced to take drastic measures to terminate a pregnancy , and it s extremely irresponsible on the state s part .","296533":"well , evidently men have priority over women when it comes to reproductive rights .","296534":"thankfully i don t sit next to her , but i also have a coworker who clears her sinuses and then you can hear her swallowing the phlegm that she just snorted up .","296535":"i try to keep it as short and to the point as possible .","296536":"i ve never ridden a bus to work before , but i ve had to take the bus once or twice to go to college .","296537":"my parents usually give out candy since i m not normally home until later at night .","296538":"no , one is a painting by salvador dali and the other is a painting that was done by a friend of mine . there s also a spraypaint painting on my wall that my boyfriend did in his spare time that i liked a lot .","296539":"i don t have just one favorite movie . however , my favorite movies are heathers , i am not a serial killer , the punisher , the crow , django unchained , les miserables , girl interrupted , secret window , the shining , american psycho , v for vendetta , and queen of the damned .","296540":"these are getting redundant . no , i ve never thrown toilet paper at someone s house before . if my answer is no to any of your subsequent questions , i m just going to delete them .","296541":"no . similar to the last question you sent me , that s immature and even as a child i wouldn t have done something like that .","296542":"no . however , i do have tapestries and paintings hung up .","296543":"i honestly can t remember that far back in the past . it was probably when i was still working at the drug store , so between the years and .","296544":"no , that s immature .","296545":"yes , i ve stolen things from stores in the past .","296546":"obviously not . unless you re going to ask better questions , i m not answering things such as this .","296547":"hello do you have a question ? ?","296548":"lol , no . that s never happened to me before , and i ve certainly never done it on purpose .","296549":"a combination of the two , i think . i m silly around certain people but certainly not all the time , and i m serious when i need to be .","296550":"i don t know the specifics about these cases , but i definitely think it s possible that the assassinations were orchestrated by the government in order to put forth their own agenda or make a political statement .","296551":"i would be most interested in knowing about government cover ups of alien activity and technology . i feel as if there s so much we don t know about certain things regarding extraterrestrial life , and the government is simply hiding them from the general public .","296552":"i think it s something that s innately in a person , to be honest . there are some people who can be classified as evil who had a good upbringing , but their behavior turned out terrible anyway . while someone s environment could be attributed to the way someone conducts themselves later in life , i don t believe it is percent their environment . there are thousands , if not millions , of people who endured similar hardships growing up , and they did not develop the social or behavioral traits that other people such as serial k llers do . more often than not , people who are raised in ab sive environments are more likely to hurt themselves than other people , which leads me to believe that evil behavior is something innate to them .","296553":"hello , this is an inappropriate question to ask someone on the internet . go take your fetish elsewhere , kthx .","296554":"lol . yes , a lot of people have issues with confronting the truth and only wanting to hear what suits them best .","296555":"i can assure you that i , in fact , speak with complete honesty when i post my answers . if i didn t feel comfortable posting something , then i simply wouldn t post it .","296556":"i ll use this to post a fact sheet i made regarding bpd","296557":"taking singing lessons would be interesting , but i have no intention of doing so .","296558":"if they re distant , then i rarely talk to them . i only talk to my closer friends once a week or less as it is .","296559":"no , i rarely eat chocolate .","296560":"there s a complete difference between someone who s addicted to alcohol to receive therapy and recover , and someone who s a p do who cannot recover . studies have shown that p dos who undergo therapy rarely improve on their condition and their feelings don t go away because it s so innate to them . either way , the mother in that instance should stand trial to see if she s unfit to be a parent for the time being , depending on the other circumstances . a p do shouldn t be around children , ever .","296561":"it ultimately depends on the severity of the situation and where the accident occurred . i can t predict something like that .","296562":"what thoughts am i supposed to have other than that s irresponsible behavior ? ? she deserves to have a trial to see if she s unfit to take care of her children and to enact aa meetings , with possible inpatient rehab .","296563":"somehow , i highly doubt that . you purposely send messages to celinem imposing slang to the point where your posts are incomprehensible , you sound like you re trying too hard .","296564":"i don t hate slang because i use it occasionally myself . however , you re purposely using slang to anger celinem , which is disrespectful .","296565":"i travel very lightly only bring what is necessary . i don t like having multiple bags of things because i don t want to lose anything , and often i only have one small carry on for a weekend trip .","296566":"i don t remember my childhood , so none .","296567":"no , that s incorrect . if you answered the question already , you would say , i answered that question already . likewise , you could also say i was already asked that question .","296568":"yeah , i ve been watching it since it basically first premiered years ago .","296569":"i would eliminate my tendency to overreact to situations . sometimes i think too deeply into things and draw conclusions out of small details when it isn t warranted , which causes conflict in my interpersonal relationships . i think end up feeling extremely guilty when the conflict is resolved because it shouldn t have happened in the first place . eliminating that weakness would change me as a person for the better , so it s something i try to work towards on a regular basis . instead of jumping to conclusions , i try to stop myself and think rationally about the situation . i try to look at the situation from different angles or from someone else s perspective .","296570":"it depends ultimately what the conflict is . some conflicts i m apt to avoid , while others i face head on . if it s something concerning my boyfriend and i , then i ll put the work in to confront the situation so that we can solve it . however , if it s something silly concerning a friend where it s a really insignificant issue and either myself or my friend are being dramatic , then i ll try to let the situation blow over .","296571":"no , i go to the office monday through friday .","296572":"no , it s incorrect . the correct way to phrase that sentence is you already answered the questions .","296573":"can you resend it ? ? i deleted it because i thought it was trolling since i didn t understand what the question was asking .","296574":"i just sent out questions about an hour ago , and a few of them were answered . i don t know what you re talking about otherwise .","296575":"good morning afternoon , askfm ! ! does anyone have any questions while i do some laundry work on freelance assignments today ?","296576":"aw , thank you . i appreciate it .","296577":"i do believe that aliens exist , but they re definitely not reptilian or little green men like the media likes to portray them to be . i definitely think that they re more humanoid than anything else , and perhaps they can adapt so easily to what earthlings look like that there are aliens walking among us . i also believe we ve been visited at least some point in the past or present .","296578":"i like reading about conspiracy theories behind being an inside job , the moon landing being faked , the existence of aliens and possible abductions , and ancient alien technology .","296579":"yes , there are definitely some conspiracy theorists who try to impose their beliefs onto others in an extreme fashion . as with any belief system , there will always be people who so strongly believe in their theories that they will purposely try to force those beliefs onto others because they feel as if no other opinion is correct .","296580":"i try not to research certain things online or discuss online things that could potentially be a red flag toward the fbi . i do genuinely believe that we re all being watched and scrutinized by the government , and our browsing history is being monitored , as well as phone calls and whatnot .","296581":"i ve always been interested in the existence of such creatures , but i don t believe that they exist besides maybe bigfoot , lol . i feel as if we would have definitely had evidence of their existence by now , especially with respect to the loch ness monster . there are some pieces of footage that are questionable and definitely raise some flags , but i find intrigue in them more than anything else .","296582":"the truth is unbiased and supported by factual evidence , usually scientific evidence . you cannot deny facts and statistics , although there are a lot of people who like to claim that facts are wrong or catered toward a certain audience because it doesn t align with their personal beliefs . opinions are usually emotionally oriented , and people have the tendency to base their opinions on their own emotions and feelings , even if they re irrational . sometimes they do parallel factual evidence , in that case the person has learned how to guide their opinions based on the evidence , but there are also plenty of people whose opinions are based on their own personal experiences and has nothing to do with facts at all .","296583":"yes , i believe birth control should also be available for men . it isn t fully the woman s responsibility to ensure that pregnancy does not happen if they don t want to be pregnant , and it s wrong in today s age to place that heavy of a responsibility solely on the woman . i read somewhere that vasectomies are actually reversible after a person of time , but of course men won t want their bodies being controlled like a woman s body is being controlled , so it s a toxic double standard . i also believe that people should have the option to be sterilized if they vehemently know that they do not want children . it isn t a matter of oh , they re going to change their mind , especially if it s something they ve known from a very young age . there are so many standards a person has to meet in order to be sterilized , which is ridiculous in my opinion .","296584":"i m on the fence with this situation , because on the one hand , i believe that as long as you call out problematic behavior with a person , you can still enjoy their products . we all like problematic people at some point or another , it isn t something we can really avoid . however , as long as you re pointing out that the person s behavior is wrong , i don t necessarily see why you shouldn t be able to enjoy their products . on the other hand , however , it still doesn t sit right with me how you can disagree or vehemently be against someone s behavior while endorsing them by giving them money by buying their products . that s why i m ultimately on the fence with this dilemma . for example , even though i enjoy kat von d s products , i probably won t buy any more of her products in the future because i believe that her opinions are wrong and harmful .","296585":"isoleatlantic has always had countdowns for as long as i could remember . her reasoning for doing it is her decision entirely , so your best bet is to probably ask her why she has countdowns .","296586":"sushi , spanish style veggie bowls , hummus and pretzels , vegetable soup , and tacos . however , it ultimately depends on my mood . lately i ve been in the mood for hot food , i suppose because it s a comfort food .","296587":"you gotta stop trying to pry into isole s personal business . it s extremely disrespectful to her privacy , and obviously she isn t going to reveal what it is that s going on until her countdown is complete . i have no intentions of asking her , because i respect her decision and you should as well . also , the fact that someone probably you , tbh pretended to be me in order to pry information out of isole was extremely disrespectful to me , and i don t appreciate that at all .","296588":"i don t see any problem with adults swearing , unless you re in a work setting such as a formal meeting . it s just a matter of expression and sometimes there are no stronger words to express how we feel than to use swear words . it shouldn t be seen as disgraceful or wrong . children , on the other hand , i believe should be taught not to swear until they re adults . even though i don t see swear words as a big deal , children should be taught to use language that expresses how they feel without swearing in order to advance their vocabulary . even so , i don t think it should be punishable or anything if a child does swear , just explain to them that those words as adult words and they can better express themselves using a plethora of different phrases .","296589":"i used to believe in vampires when i was a child . i thought they were going to attack me in my sleep , so i always slept with the blanket over my head . now that i really think deeply about it , i think that had a lot to do with my anxiety over being hurt by my ab sers , and it was simply a defense mechanism i concocted in my mind so i didn t have to deal with the thought of me actually being ab sed .","296590":"i was reading about the true crime case regarding novelist michael peterson and the death of his wife . i was originally watching a documentary on the case called the staircase on netflix when i wanted to learn more about the case , so i ended up reading a bunch of articles on it online for over an hour because it was so interesting to me .","296591":"racism is a plague on our society not just american society , but the world as a whole . racism has existed for centuries , and there are a lot of ignorant people who believe it doesn t exist anymore , when in reality it s becoming stronger than ever . i m not sure how we could resolve the problem of racism besides continuing to advocate for equal rights among races and pointing out injustice when it occurs . there needs to be further education on what racism is and where it exists , and unfortunately that isn t taught in school unless it s a course in college specifically geared toward race relations .","296592":"uh , that has literally never happened to me before . lmao . if it did , i would definitely feel strange or awkward , though . i don t like physical touch , so it would make me very uncomfortable if someone got that close to me who wasn t my boyfriend or a close friend .","296593":"i don t know if i would change any specific day entirely like that . even though i ve gone through some hardship and went through situations that were extremely toxic or harmful , i wouldn t want to change anything because it has all led me to the person i am now . although i m not completely happy with who i am , i m definitely more comfortable with myself now than ever before . i m on a good path and i m constantly trying to better myself , even through the pitfalls , and i m grateful for the good opportunities that have come my way . that likely wouldn t have happened if something in my past was different .","296594":"i don t have any pets .","296595":"i wholeheartedly believe that we re the creators of our own destinies . i don t believe in fate , and i m more inclined to believe in the domino effect , i . e . one situation influences another , whether or not it s completely apparent . you can make a decision about something and through courses of events , can influence someone else s life . i think people use fate in order to put some magical spin on something that was just a matter of circumstance , and we should give ourselves more credit when it comes to what happens in our lives . sometimes things are also coincidences more than anything else .","296596":"i don t believe in love at first sight . you don t know the person at all , so what you feel towards them is merely infatuation . you don t develop love for a person until you get to know them . i support online dating , but i don t believe it has any correlation with love at first sight . again , you can be infatuated with someone and then fall in love with them after getting to know them . i think with online dating , though , you have to always remain vigilant of who you re talking to , because you never know if someone is flat out lying about who they are or just trying to appease you in order to take control of you . it s dangerous , but i do know some success stories .","296597":"if i wanted to break up with someone , it would be because they had cheated on me , was mentally and or physically ab sive towards me , didn t respect me , was controlling towards me , or we simply didn t have the spark we once had and i felt as if i could find something better elsewhere .","296598":"i m not really a big fan of battle royale styled games , honestly . i prefer single player games .","296599":"if you re referring to the way i dress , then i m more casual than anything else .","296600":"uh , i m always honest when i speak .","296601":"i never played it before .","296602":"is this a serious question . lmao .","296603":"my entire life is a joke .","296604":"because you re a troll , and i don t entertain trolls . i m here to answer questions and have civil discussions based on my answers to those questions .","296605":"religion . i believe that most religions have the same origins because many of the stories are similar , but that s all they are to me stories . i don t have faith in any form of god or higher being , and i ve always viewed religion as a slew of stories meant to teach people lessons , as opposed to something factual .","296606":"aw , thank you","296607":"i have , but the accident wasn t my fault . i was driving down the road and someone drove through a stop sign right into the intersection i didn t have a stop sign , so i had the right of way . i tried cutting the wheel , but it was too late and i wound up t boning the car . everyone involved was fine , including myself , but i ended up totaling my car .","296608":"i think it depends on the individual and their own circumstances . personally , i wouldn t be comfortable with myself if i found myself settling for something less when i knew i could achieve more . it s simply the way my brain is wired . however , other people might be comfortable settling down for the sake of ease , even if they know they can achieve more . it isn t really my place to put judgment on other people s actions like that , and the only thing i can wish for is that they re doing what s best for them in that very moment .","296609":"before i went on psychiatric medication , i would be told horror stories about how people acted and felt while on medication , which deterred me from seeking professional help for several years . i assumed i was going to be void of feeling , act like a zombie , have no outward emotions or concerns , etc etc . how very wrong they were , though . eventually it got to the point where i either had to seek professional help or die , so i got started on medication . over the course of about . years , i found the right types of medication and dosages that helped me best , and i ve honestly never felt better . i m fairly stable these days unless i forget to take my medication for several days in a row .","296610":"it makes me happy when my boyfriend tells me , i picked up firewood , come over and let s have a campfire . some of the best nights spent with him are nights where we sit back watching the fire roaring , drinking coffee or something alcoholic , listening to music , and talking about anything that comes to mind .","296611":"i probably did at some point , as a stupid pre teen or teenager . i can t recall anything of the sort , though .","296612":"well , you re not completely wrong . lol .","296613":"not while i was in high school , no . i skipped classes fairly often in college , though .","296614":"at the rate the world is going these days , i wouldn t want to be born at all .","296615":"i m in a relationship .","296616":"yeah , plenty of times . i started smoking when i was years old and basically stopped around the age of years old . i only smoke on rare occasions these days .","296617":"i almost never have any alone time , besides early in the mornings when everyone else is asleep . otherwise , i m constantly being beckoned to do things around the house . on the occasion when my parents are asleep in the afternoon evening , i like reveling in the quietness of the house . because i never get privacy , i very much value my alone time when it s given to me . there s nothing better than having a few hours to yourself where you don t have anyone to answer to except yourself .","296618":"that s how my body is when it comes to straight up coffee , haha . energy drinks like monster and red bull actually can give me heart palpitations , but coffee doesn t do anything for me anymore in terms of energy and focus .","296619":"ah , i understand . no , the culture here in the united states is largely different . back in the day , it was customary for men to approach women first if they wanted to pursue something it was seen as gentlemanly . in contemporary times , however , it doesn t really make much of a difference . men can approach women , women can approach men , men can approach men , women can approach women , etc etc .","296620":"no , i don t want to be awake all night , lol . i m probably going to buy a spiked seltzer or something .","296621":"well it s already pm on friday night , haha . i went to work today , though . i came home early because i experienced an anxiety attack , then i napped for a few hours and i just finished eating dinner . i m planning on getting something cold to drink from the gas station in a bit and relaxing with a true crime documentary tonight .","296622":"no , quite the contrary . abortion happens before the fetus is even viable , so there s no loss of life or anything of the sort . the only potential loss of life there would be would be in the rare case of late term abortions , but those are only performed in dire circumstances where the mother s life is at risk or the fetus is already dying and or dead .","296623":"i don t really see the correlation between not wanting to talk to a person and having self respect .","296624":"lately , yes . i ve been getting angry over the smallest , most insignificant of things these days .","296625":"i normally don t enjoy celebrating my birthday or calling attention to myself like that . i like what my boyfriend and i did last year for my birthday we went to a local aquarium for a wine tasting event , and we listened to live music and ate delicious food the entire night . it was low key , interesting , and a lot of fun .","296626":"in a way , yes . my happiness is tied to my boyfriend s happiness i can be happy when he isn t happy , but i definitely do feel guilt or a feeling of helplessness when he isn t in a great mood or is going through a rough time . on the other hand , when he is happy , then my happiness skyrockets .","296627":"sounds like they re shy . there s nothing wrong with being shy at all , unless it prevents you from doing things you need to do . if you would rather wait for someone to approach you first , then that s perfectly acceptable .","296628":"i mainly said it as a joke , but there s also a degree of truth to it .","296629":"cis white men .","296630":"my entire life is one big awkward moment .","296631":"i don t get excited over much these days , although i am excited to make an appointment for my next tattoo tomorrow . at least that will be something i m looking forward to .","296632":"i m going to go to the tattoo shop tomorrow for a consultation to put down a deposit for my next tattoo . on sunday , i have a doctor appointment to refill my medication .","296633":"i can t choose one favorite song of all time , i like too much music for that . however , my favorite genre is alternative rock metal .","296634":"forensic files ! ! they have all of the seasons and episodes on netflix , and it s the perfect show to binge because the episodes are only minutes long .","296635":"i have plenty i wouldn t be able to choose just one . heathers , i am not a serial killer , the crow , the punisher , girl interrupted , v for vendetta , django unchained , american psycho , the shining , the lord of the rings , les miserables , secret window , and sweeney todd .","296636":"i prefer playing from a first person perspective .","296637":"you obviously didn t answer them to their satisfaction on your page , so they decided to come to me , thinking i wouldn t know what they were talking about . lmao . anons like these have no arguments , they re just spewing bullsh t to see where it sticks .","296638":"i won t date anyone who isn t my current boyfriend . also lmao . you really think you re hurting someone by posting about them on other people s pages ? ? i see you , and it s hilarious . cc littlesha","296639":"honestly , nothing happened except that i went out and drank myself into oblivion . i lost my patience with someone and instead of confronting the situation , i walked away from them . it realistically would have escalated the situation had i stayed and told them exactly how i felt , so instead i channeled my anger into alcohol . which is something i definitely don t recommend doing , btw . i have very unhealthy coping mechanisms .","296640":"i m not embarrassed or ashamed , i just know what the intentions behind asking that question is . and because i know that intention , i purposely won t post a picture .","296641":"lmao , no . at least with frontal pictures , it shows the outfit and whatnot . by looking at a picture of me from the back , the only thing you ll be seeing is my ass . that isn t something i would like to advertise on the internet .","296642":"i only take showers , not baths even though i have a bathtub . i just never really enjoyed taking baths because i get bored easily , and someone is always running to use the bathroom so i would never be able to have privacy anyway .","296643":"ah yes , the deflection is strong with this one .","296644":"i don t take baths , so neither .","296645":"life has had its ups and downs lately , and some days are more difficult than others . however , i ve been mostly in a content and motivated mood for the past few weeks , which has been wonderful . my mood swings are minimal , and even when i am feeling an episode coming on , they re mild and short lived . my anger has been a bit much for me to handle lately , but that isn t anything unusual lol .","296646":"i m wearing blue sweatpants and a gray tank top .","296647":"personally , bravery means that you re willing to step outside of your comfort zone to do what you believe is right . this can be manifested in various ways , whether it s through a person reaching out for help after struggling with depression , or speaking out against injustice even if no one else is speaking , or putting your own life on the line to save someone else .","296648":"i absolutely love beer , but very few people i know like the taste of it regardless of what kind of beer it is , lol .","296649":"it depends on the individual and the situation itself . from my own personal experience , i self sabotage because i don t believe that i deserve to be happy and those terrible behaviors and bad coping mechanisms are ingrained in me , to the point where it has become second nature . in return , those behaviors and methods of coping wind up hurting me and my loved ones and it becomes a vicious , continuous cycle because it feels too out of my control .","296650":"i went out to dinner last weekend with a coworker , and i tried a fish taco for the first time ! ! i was always hesitant to try them because i thought having fish in a taco would be kinda weird , but it was actually delicious . the menu said it was fried mahi mahi with cheddar cheese , chipotle sauce , and salsa .","296651":"i don t think it s strange or outdated , no . i don t ever take offense to when someone says that they re praying for me or sending their prayers , because it s meaningful to them and their religion they re extending that notion of compassion out towards you . you don t necessarily have to believe in the same religion to appreciate when someone is wishing you the best the most sincere way they know how .","296652":"i believe that people often do not say i love you nearly enough to their friends , partners , and or family as they should . it s always meaningful unless you re manipulating your loved one by telling them you love them , and we should express our love for each other on a consistent basis . not only does it spread positivity and connection , like you said , but it s also always good to leave a lasting impression on the people you love in the event that a tragedy happens . i normally tell my boyfriend i love you , and i tell my friends either love you or ily . idk , i feel like including the i in i love you makes the statement that much more personal and intimate .","296653":"i learned from someone that if you use milk soaked in a cloth on sunburn sun poisoning , the milk will actually extract the heat from the skin and the vitamins in the milk will heal the skin .","296654":"yeah , i can be passionate about all forms of art , particularly writing and painting and music .","296655":"i enjoyed the aspect of learning as a whole , but i disliked my classmates and a few of my teachers when i was in high school , at least . i found that my classmates got in the way of my learning experience , and often they didn t take school as seriously as i did . i found college to be a much better environment because the people who were there wanted to be there , and it was productive to the overall educational experience . people actually listened and asked questions and had discussions , whereas in high school that did not happen as often .","296656":"no , probably not . the reason why trash cans are colored black , red , green , etc etc . , is so that no one can see what s inside of them . even if the trash is in bags , you would probably still be able to see the outline of certain things .","296657":"it can be interpreted as such , yes . the celebration of what we now call halloween can trace its roots back to ancient celtic and gaelic festivals .","296658":"absolutely despicable , and honestly , my jaw dropped when i read that it was passed because i didn t think we were regressing that far in society . people need to realize that this isn t going to stop abortions . it s going to stop safe abortions , and now people with uteruses are going to be in extreme danger if they want to terminate a pregnancy because of the lengths some people will go to do so . before abortion was as accessible as it is now , people died from coat hangers , ingesting poisons , etc etc . it s putting the safety of these people at risk . also , the fact that even having a miscarriage can be considered a felony is completely outrageous and unbelievable . i wholeheartedly cannot believe how the government treats women and people with uteruses in general in this day and age , it s absolutely astounding . this isn t a law against abortions , it s a law against women .","296659":"i have unintentionally started a collection of coffee mugs , lmao . i only had a few at first , but then i kept buying them everywhere i went because they were cute , and now people gift them to me since they know i love having coffee tea . my cabinets are overflowing .","296660":"there s nothing wrong with having an outie belly button , lmao . it s just an indication of where you were cut from the umbilical cord . a lot more people have them than you think .","296661":"people have always said that i either look younger than my age or older than my age , lmao . i ve had people assume i m in my s , but there are also people who think i m in my late teens or early s .","296662":"to a degree , sure . everyone has body hair .","296663":"thankfully , no . i ve dropped my phone plenty of times , but it s survived nonetheless .","296664":"i graduated from college almost six years ago .","296665":"that s why i said he s pretty strong , lol . he s lifted things much heavier than me anyhow .","296666":"i once watched a documentary or maybe it was ancient aliens , lol about how it would have been impossible for the pyramids in egypt to be build with the lack of technology they had back then . the documentary suggested alien technology , and while it seems far fetched to me , it s definitely something i can t dismiss .","296667":"the only one that comes to mind is being an inside job conducted by the us government . i would like to believe that the government wouldn t commit such an atrocity in order to start a war , but the few things i ve read about it proving the contrary were really strong .","296668":"this morning , lol . my coworker left work early yesterday and allegedly went to urgent care , but she claimed that they said she didn t have insurance even though she does so they refused to treat her . so this morning when i saw her , i told her that they can t refuse a patient if they re sick regardless of whether or not they have insurance , and they would just bill them later . she made up some bullsh t excuse about not wanting to be billed so she just went home , but i really do believe she just didn t want to be at work anymore and left for the hell of it .","296669":"it depends ultimately on the vibe they give me upon first meeting them . i normally keep it formal and i keep my distance , unless they give me a reason to feel otherwise . however , i m normally very to the point and distant if someone tries talking to me in public .","296670":"i had quite a few toxic friends in the past whose presence in my life was harmful and detrimental to my well being . i m glad those bridges were burned because it helped me and probably them in the long run .","296671":"i honestly love having campfires with him in the backyard , while we listen to music and talk about anything that comes to mind . it s such a good bonding moment and it makes me appreciate our relationship so much more .","296672":"a good sense of humor , loyalty , honesty , a hard work ethic , and the ability to talk about anything and everything .","296673":"i think it can be helpful to people who want to meet someone new , as long as they remain vigilant about who they will be potentially dating . you can t deny the dangers associated with dating sites , but i also know a lot of people who have found partners on them .","296674":"of course . most of my friends are a bit different from me , and it s good to have diversity in your life like that . you learn things from different perspectives .","296675":"i take on as many challenges as i can muster , although sometimes it can be too overwhelming . especially when it comes to work , i never say no to a new task .","296676":"probably , lmao . he s pretty strong .","296677":"you can t tell that just by looking at someone .","296678":"i don t know who you are . the only person i m interested in is my boyfriend .","296679":"he s like ten months older than me .","296680":"i m dating a man .","296681":"yeah , i had a girlfriend before i entered my current relationship .","296682":"yes , i m bisexual .","296683":"no , not usually . perhaps once or twice a year i ll get a minor cold or a stomach virus , but that s it .","296684":"lol .","296685":"yeah , of course . even though no one was in the room with me , i couldn t help but turn around and look at the doorway every few minutes .","296686":"in another room i was in where i was by myself .","296687":"yeah , sometimes . last night , i had the horrible sensation that someone was in the room with me and i couldn t shake it .","296688":"lately it s been watching true crime documentaries .","296689":"you have lesbian in your profile , so clearly you re just trying to see who does what with their genitalia , lmao . you can scurry along now .","296690":"lmao . this is a creative way of asking this question , but you re still not getting an answer .","296691":"hello do you have a question ? ?","296692":"i like freckles , and i get them on my nose during the summer time if i ve been out in the sun .","296693":"mayonnaise . it literally disgusts me .","296694":"i don t use perfume , i just use body spray . i have a bunch of them that i use depending on how i m feeling that day , including ones from bath body works and victoria s secret .","296695":"i have scrapbooks , journals , and photo albums ! ! i used to keep a detailed scrapbook of items and stories detailing my relationship , and i would keep movie tickets and concert stubs and pressed flower petals . i also have tons of photo albums of all of the vacations i ve taken with my boyfriend and our friends .","296696":"i ve seen the statue of liberty although i ve never been inside , and i ve climbed the empire state building .","296697":"my ideal boyfriend is my current boyfriend , lol . although it wouldn t matter his gender , i would love him all the same . he s incredibly loyal to his friends and family , and he has a twisted but hilarious sense of humor . he doesn t sugarcoat things at all and keeps it real all the time , and he isn t the type of person to tell you things you want to hear , he ll tell you what you need to hear . i love his taste in music and general perspectives on life , and he s also incredibly hard working at his job and in his life in general .","296698":"i m not currently vegan , no . i would like to try a vegetarian , and eventually vegan , lifestyle once i have control over the food that enters my house , though . i would feel better supporting animals and the environment , and i also believe i would eat a lot healthier food because i would have more incentive to stay away from processed foods .","296699":"i would learn how to speak , read , and write spanish so that i could communicate with my boyfriend s family .","296700":"i m mentally ill , and crazy is an ableist , antiquated term used to refer to people who have severe mental illness during a time when mental health was rarely understood . so no , i m not crazy . i have mental illnesses , but i function as a regular member of society on a daily basis .","296701":"fried eggs on a croissant with a large cup of iced coffee .","296702":"i don t watch the news on television or anything , especially since i don t use cable . i get my news from the radio and online sources .","296703":"i normally vent about my day to my boyfriend he reassures me and makes me feel better sometimes . i also usually put on a movie or television show that i love while doing things like showering , putting on a face mask , putting lotion on to smell nice , etc etc . i also like lighting candles because they bring me peace .","296704":"i love peaches , as well as anything that s peach flavored . peach flavored iced tea is my favorite .","296705":"are you talking about courtney ? ? she s doing great ! ! she deactivated her askfm account a few weeks ago , but we talk nearly every day .","296706":"yeah , specifically long island and new york city . i live on long island , and i can t find a reputable one bedroom apartment for less than , which is pushing it .","296707":"coffee and flavored seltzer .","296708":"i ask people questions because i m bored in the times when i send out questions , and i m interested in knowing people s answers .","296709":"hospitals are institutions medical facilities . they don t represent society , they re a necessity for the welfare of people . as for government , yeah the needs of my loved ones are more important than the government . the government has done nothing but reduce my loved ones needs to ash . they ve only made life more difficult for most people .","296710":"i don t remember . it probably happened within the last week or so . i normally lie about small , insignificant things so that people don t worry about me .","296711":"i m not concerned with what society is interested in because it isn t a living entity . i look after my loved ones before myself , unless something happens where it becomes detrimental to my own well being .","296712":"no , not generally . not unless i need to be .","296713":"it s almost as if the word has a true meaning other than when people use it in a sexual manner .","296714":"many people don t know that i have a decent following on askfm , lmao . only my boyfriend and my best friend are aware that i have an account here . it s the only social media account i have that s genuinely active on a regular basis .","296715":"yes ! ! i really enjoy watching documentaries about mysteries , legends , the supernatural , etc etc . i also love true crime documentaries .","296716":"i m thankful for my boyfriend . i was feeling a bit down when i came home from work today , but he called me on his break at work and told me a hilarious story without knowing i was feeling bad , and it actually made me feel better .","296717":"i usually just delete the question statement . it isn t worth my time or energy to respond to those sorts of inquiries , and the person sending them doesn t deserve a response or whatever reaction they hope to receive .","296718":"yes , i have . when my boyfriend advises me to calm down if i m panicking about something , i usually try to control my breathing and slow down my thoughts because i know that he s right . he s incredibly patient when it comes to my panicked thoughts and anxiety .","296719":"i wish that i had the time and dedication they do , lol . that requires someone to get up super early in the morning to do their makeup before going into work each day , and that s a level of dedication that i simply do not possess .","296720":"i wouldn t consider myself poor , considering i keep myself afloat comfortably . i just can t afford an apartment by myself since that would be an additional out of my paycheck each month , on top of all of my other bills .","296721":"no , i ve never been pregnant before .","296722":"i know a decent amount about how to save money and allocate accordingly , but no one has ever really asked me for advice about finances . my boyfriend knows a lot more about finance than i do .","296723":"probably not . i ve never had an interest in having acupuncture done .","296724":"when i play video games , i usually play in one long session as opposed to several shorter sessions . they re only perhaps hours at the max , though .","296725":"no , i haven t heard of him until this very moment .","296726":"it s silver with a diamond in the middle .","296727":"i didn t know the exact statistic , but i did know that most homicides are towards victims who were struggling to leave the ab sive relationship . which is why when people say just leave ! it s incredibly ignorant . no one knows how difficult it is to leave an ab sive relationship unless they ve been in the situation themselves .","296728":"i ve noticed a decline in my memory , especially over the past few years . my long term memory and sometimes even my short term memory has dwindled to the point where i can only remember crucial things if i repeat them over over again .","296729":"i just don t care that much by matt maeson https www . youtube . com watch ? v bahct hbgq","296730":"nah , not really . the closest thing would be ariana grande , but i m not ashamed to say that i like her music .","296731":"december of . i m overdue .","296732":"lol , yes . i m in a monogamous relationship .","296733":"no . just because i m an atheist doesn t mean i can t appreciate other religious music .","296734":"of course . they re real people , so they re real friends .","296735":"i bought breakfast for the family .","296736":"not every question requires an in depth answer , lol .","296737":"why are you so bothered ? ? lmao . if you don t like the way i answer questions , then unfollow or block me .","296738":"probably over a year ago . i don t really remember , it s been a long time .","296739":"the question asked if i ve ever dated a rascal . because i didn t know what anon meant by that , i said i ve dated men and women . i don t see how you could interpret that was bragging , lol . it was just a direct answer to the question .","296740":"yes . i m bisexual .","296741":"uh , what ? ? i ve dated men and women .","296742":"it isn t something that concerns me . i m too busy living my own life and meeting my own goals .","296743":"i ve never driven a toyota before , haha . i ve only owned hyundai and volkswagen cars .","296744":"anyone have any questions while i watch forensic files ? ?","296745":"video games ! ! i haven t played in a while , but it s something i ve always enjoyed since i was a child . i remember being obsessed with my gameboy .","296746":"i suppose liberal , although i don t really put a label on my beliefs these days .","296747":"i ve embarrassed people , but definitely not on purpose .","296748":"not particularly , no . but that s because i don t feel like a member of society , considering i don t contribute to society or my community in any way at all .","296749":"death , considering i ll probably be dead already by then .","296750":"the same thing i would do if i was alone in the house and it wasn t raining , lol . which isn t much at all , i would simply be watching television , exercising , cleaning , or scrolling through social media .","296751":"any sort of small talk , especially about the weather .","296752":"i d rather be a pirate so i can pillage drink all the rum .","296753":"it was all right not the best day , but not the worst day either . work went as scheduled with nothing extraordinary happening , but my commute to and from work was terrible though . i just finished eating dinner now i m going to exercise and take a shower . hopefully i ll feel better after i do .","296754":"the memes from this past episode of game of thrones were the only good things about it .","296755":"i would choose teleportation . it would be amazing to simply teleport to where i need to be , instead of having to commute and drive everywhere . driving is a major source of anxiety for me and it would be a weight off my shoulders if i didn t have to worry about it anymore .","296756":"i typically view being verbose as a bad thing because it gives off the appearance that someone is trying too hard to sound educated , and often they don t understand the meaning of the words they re trying to use . the best way to get your point across is to recognize your audience and use terminology and copy that is in the best interest of the reader . by using excessive , floral language , it can lose the interest of the reader .","296757":"for the most part , yes . however , i had to earn the respect of others through hard work and diligence it wasn t automatically granted to me . i felt the need to consistently prove myself , and to a degree , i still do . i hold myself to a high standard so that i can maintain the same level of respect people have for me .","296758":"quite the opposite , actually . it s interesting how people view women who don t shave as unhygienic , but when it comes to men who don t shave , then it s perfectly fine . it s a silly double standard . i never had any issues with hygiene when i didn t shave my underarms . i still don t shave my legs unless i have to wear a dress to a formal occasion . shaving is a personal choice .","296759":"do you mean for tanning ? ? it depends on where i am when i m out tanning . if i m in the comfort of my own backyard , then i ll use tanning oil because then when i m done , i can quickly take a shower and get the oil off . however , if i m at the beach , then i ll use lotion because it at least absorbs into the skin .","296760":"yeah , definitely . i feel like if i didn t stop watching the movie , then i would be wasting my time . there s no point in watching something if you already know you don t enjoy it .","296761":"sometimes i make strange sound effects in response to someone talking to me instead of actual words , lmao . i say meep a lot when i don t know how to respond to something , and i can get sorta squeaky especially when i m nervous .","296762":"this may seem meaningless or silly to some people , but i haven t left work early or called out sick in over two weeks . i m incredibly proud of myself because that s an indication that my mental health is becoming more stable and i haven t felt so overwhelmed and anxious while at work these days .","296763":"for the most part , i believe so . it really does depend on my mood , though . in some cases , i go with the flow and react accordingly to whatever is thrown at me . however , in other cases , i become really rigid and anxiety ridden about how events unfold . it s never consistent .","296764":"i can be both , lol . there are some instances where i can help solve dilemmas and offer sound advice to those who need it . however , i m definitely a problematic person myself with my own host of issues , and sometimes my thoughts and behavior only exacerbate problems .","296765":"yes , i have the tendency to grow very attached to people , to the point where their emotions dictate my own emotions and feelings without their realization and i base my entire persona on their thoughts and behavior . because i ve never truly known who i was on a deep level , i attach myself to other people and adopt their personas because it s the only way i can really have a personality . at the same time , however , if someone wrongs me then that attachment is quickly cut off and i have absolutely no issue removing them from my life . there are no feelings of regret or guilt in those cases .","296766":"i don t really believe in destiny . i believe life is a continuous motion of cause and effect .","296767":"i ve never had an argument or fight with my brother before , simply because he s much older than me and we never had a close relationship anyway . i also haven t had an argument with my parents in a long time . when things get heated , i choose to walk away instead of engaging with them . it isn t worth me getting angry and flustered over something that will only become worse if discussed . my mother , in particular , is insufferable when it comes to arguments because she ll believe she s always correct even when presented with evidence and logic proving otherwise .","296768":"i would love to receive your conspiracy theory spam ! !","296769":"favorite ice cream flavor chocolate chip cookie dough . least favorite ice cream flavor strawberry or chocolate .","296770":"i m sorry i m sure the weather isn t helping at all . my boyfriend texted me that he felt terrible today , so that was my response . it s been raining heavily all morning and afternoon .","296771":"there s not really much of a correlation between choosing not to shave smelling bad , not unless you already don t take proper care of your personal hygiene . when i chose not to shave , i didn t smell bad because i wore deodorant to prevent myself from sweating or releasing odor , and body spray every day . however , i think everyone should try to be cognizant of their hygiene , mostly for themselves but also for the sake of people who are around them , lol . it s never pleasant when you have to sit close to someone or interact with someone they smell terribly .","296772":"i don t read fan fiction , so i don t have a favorite .","296773":"i don t like the general population of people , no . i try to avoid crowds of people whenever possible .","296774":"i m not a big fan of the show . it simply isn t very funny to me . if i had to choose a similar cartoon like show , then i prefer american dad , bob s burgers , and big mouth .","296775":"i like both , but i drink far more coffee than i do tea . i have at least two cups of coffee every day .","296776":"i wouldn t say that i necessarily hate it , but i couldn t get into the show the office regardless of how much i tried to watch it . however , everyone else i know loves the show .","296777":"yes , i met my close friend from when i was a teenager i visited her when i was traveling to different colleges , and we hung out twice . i also met courtney who recently deactivated from askfm because we both lived in new york at the time . there aren t really any stories to tell about my friendships with people from different countries , lol . the only thing that sucks is the time difference since we re rarely online at the same time .","296778":"one friend i made online was from the same state as me , but everyone lives in different states or countries .","296779":"i ll have to look it up ! ! thank you","296780":"i have ! ! he s actually a creature in fallout because it s set in west virginia , lol . what s the documentary ? ? i m curious .","296781":"i didn t hear about it , so i don t have an opinion .","296782":"just because i don t have a stable personality doesn t mean i can t be unhappy and want to change my appearance .","296783":"i don t personally like pineapple , but i don t care if other people have it on their pizza .","296784":"i love both cats and dogs , but i would probably choose to get a dog as my first pet when i get my own place .","296785":"no , you were simply protecting them . there s nothing wrong with that .","296786":"yes , i do believe that children are growing up with too much screen time . i think studies have been done showing that too much screen time is bad for a child s health and development . i m also strongly for allowing children to have fulfilling experiences outdoors and with family and friends , instead of sitting them in front of a television all day . the same can be said for adults too . we get so wrapped up in technology and social media that we neglect to live out own lives to its fullest potential . to answer your question regarding aggression and video games , i disagree that playing those games is a cause of aggression in children . often when children play video games and show signs of aggression , it s already something predisposed in them . the game itself doesn t cause it , but it could exacerbate the existing condition .","296787":"i m not a parent , but i do believe that there are a plethora of unrealistic expectations placed on mothers in society from what i ve seen and heard . mothers are typically seen as the primary caregiver and are expected to take responsibility for most of the parenting , even if they have a partner . they re also expected to feel happy and fulfilled , when in reality being a parent comes with so many challenges and worries . it s perfectly okay to have bad days . it s okay to drop the kids off at a trusted person s house every now and again so you can get time to yourself . you re an individual person and mother is not the only title you have . you deserve to have your own interests and dreams outside of being a parent .","296788":"considering i m always an advocate for mental health awareness and reform , i believe that there needs to be more awareness for stigmatized , lesser understood disorders such as personality disorders , dissociative disorders , and psychotic disorders . people always advocate for representation of depression anxiety but rarely talk about other disorders that are much more complex . by talking about these disorders and mental health and illness in general , we seek to spread more understanding of them , including underlying causes and treatment methods . more people will be likely to seek help as a result .","296789":"i believe in this notion to a certain degree , but it all depends on the severity of what someone did in their past , especially if they hurt other people . i wholeheartedly believe that most people have the capability to change , especially as they get older , but certain things cannot be forgiven or forgotten i . e . abvsing or assaulting someone .","296790":"i think it s terrible that people take advantage of skills like that in order to do harm to people . it s merely a method of self defense that should be used to protect yourself and those around you , so to use those talents for nefarious reasons is wrong imo .","296791":"oh boy , there s so many of them ! ! the ted bundy tapes are pretty good , and i also enjoyed watching aileen life death of a serial killer . i m pretty sure they re both on netflix .","296792":"ew , that s disgusting . especially for him to think that he s automatically desired just because he s a youtube star . i ve only ever seen like one video with him in it , and he was annoying af to me .","296793":"they really do , i was just thinking how often i have to write that sentence these days . lmao .","296794":"my living situation , my weight , and my financial stability .","296795":"i don t know if they re considered old , since they only came out in the s and s . but i love the princess bride the rocky horror picture show .","296796":"is this inspired by the recent question i just got ? ? lol . he s some sort of makeup artist who got popular on youtube , but honestly his skills are trash from what i ve seen . i m not percent sure why he s canceled , i haven t looked it up myself .","296797":"my day has been fine . i woke up around am , had breakfast and two iced coffees , and worked on the remainder of my freelance assignments . then i took a nap , and i just finished eating dinner . i m going to take a shower before watching game of thrones tonight .","296798":"like . . . people who promote s icide ? ? if so , then i think that s absolutely horrendous .","296799":"apparently he is , although i don t know anything about what he s been saying . apparently he assaulted someone , or something ? ? i haven t watched any videos , so i have no idea .","296800":"it s not really high pitched , but it isn t low either . i don t really know how else to describe it , and askfm won t allow me to take videos .","296801":"i would ask them what their dreams and passions are .","296802":"no , it isn t something that ever crosses my mind weirdly enough , considering how many documentaries i watch .","296803":"i don t know anyone named abby , so i wouldn t have followed someone by that name , lol . no drama appeared on my feed .","296804":"i answer most questions sent to me , unless they re statements and not questions , trolling behavior , and intrusive and inappropriate questions .","296805":"that s not necessarily a bad thing . everyone needs a break from work every now and again , and it s good that they guarantee you one day per week where you can relax .","296806":"i don t know anyone by the name of abby , except for an old high school acquaintance of mine who i haven t seen in years .","296807":"the office is closed on the weekends , but i do freelance work from home on saturdays and sundays for extra cash .","296808":"i believe that relationships are complex , so while someone pay post only about their successes with their relationships online , that doesn t mean that they re not being truthful . it s simply one facet of their relationship and doesn t encompass the relationship as a whole . the only exception , in my opinion , is when people flat out lie about their relationships online and post that they never have dilemmas or arguments or anything of the sort , when in reality they do . in that case , i think someone is better off not posting anything at all rather than pretend that everything is fine for the sake of their image .","296809":"i m not religious , so i don t follow that sort of rhetoric . my sundays are normally pretty busy , so it isn t a day of rest for me . usually my day of resting is on saturday , although i do work from home on saturdays as well .","296810":"i use coconut milk jasmine petal body wash , rosemary mint shampoo conditioner , and the hello beautiful body lotion from bath body works not too sure what the scent is , but it s really fresh smelling .","296811":"i don t discuss my sex life on the internet .","296812":"there isn t any song that puts me in the mood like that . however , my boyfriend and i have songs that remind us of each other in a romantic way .","296813":"well my week just started , considering it s sunday , haha . last week was fine , though . i got a lot of work done throughout the week , began exercising again , and had a good time having a campfire in the backyard with my boyfriend last wednesday .","296814":"i usually pour my drinks into a cup , with ice when necessary .","296815":"i always found the whole lizard people conspiracy theory to be absolutely ridiculous . it makes zero sense to me .","296816":"if i m in a bad mood , then there really isn t anything someone can do to cheer me up . i just have to wait until the episode passes . in those instances , i prefer being alone because i also don t want to put my bad mood on someone else , thinking it might also bring them down .","296817":"no , i know absolutely nothing about the stock market .","296818":"i never take cold showers , haha . i m supposed to wash my hair in cool or cold water to preserve the color , but i can t handle the cold water like that so i always wash my hair with hot water .","296819":"i prefer working alone . i don t like relying on other people to get work done correctly .","296820":"do you want to go out for drinks ? i have such a hard time saying no to that question .","296821":"sometimes , but only when i need new clothes . i do most of my shopping online .","296822":"no , i don t need to do that . i listen to music at work and wear headphones , but everyone else is working so i don t talk to anyone anyway .","296823":"no . the ocean is about a minute drive from where i live .","296824":"yes , hyundai is a south korean automotive manufacturer .","296825":"i don t have a subscription , and i m not entirely sure . you can check the website .","296826":"no , i don t do overtime . they offer it sometimes , but you have to be approved for it first .","296827":"it s a lot better than my last job . at my last job , we also accrued hours per month , but if you missed a day of work within that month without using your paid time off , then you didn t receive those hours the following month . it was never guaranteed . i never had paid time off because my mental illnesses made me miss work around three times per month on average .","296828":"not necessarily . it only damages the hair if you don t take proper care of your hair post bleaching and coloring . i ve been coloring and bleaching my hair since i was years old , and my hair is still completely healthy , soft , and shiny .","296829":"you re right , it sounds like your friend doesn t understand social anxiety . have you tried talking to her about this at all ? ? if you have tried to explain how your social anxiety works she still insists on bringing you to crowded , public places , then i do believe she s in the wrong especially if she gets mad at you over it . there s no way you guys can go out to a low key place , like a small coffee shop ? ?","296830":"my entire persona goes against the teachings of the bible , lmao .","296831":"oh wait , no . i was wrong . you re right , it would be a reduction in salary if someone takes time off as unpaid .","296832":"no , we simply just don t get paid for any additional time we take off . it s called unpaid time . it doesn t have any correlation with our salary at all .","296833":"we accrue hours per month of paid time off , so it equals out to six days per year .","296834":"my boyfriend is and he s moderately muscular . he doesn t have abs or anything like that , but his arms are really strong .","296835":"yeah , especially considering my hair is already colored so she has to remove the color first , bleach my hair and roots , and then tone it before adding the color .","296836":"i eventually want to cover my body in tattoos , so yeah . it just takes time and a lot of money unfortunately . thank you ! ! you can kinda see my natural color in the shaved parts , it s a light brown tone . and yes , my hair gets bleached out every time i color it .","296837":"no , i only ever sing when i m in the car where no one can hear me .","296838":"if i didn t want to tell anyone something , why would i post it online for everyone to read ? ? haha .","296839":"yes , i have seven tattoos thus far . these are my most recent coloring jobs . the blue was done this past december , and the purple was done about six months before that .","296840":"i have a hyundai accent .","296841":"i ve made quite a few friendships through the internet , including one of my closest friends when i was a teenager who helped me through a lot of hardship during that time of my life . in more recent years , i ve made good friendships through askfm with people i talk to on a semi regular basis .","296842":"he s never given me any advice before . we don t have a close relationship .","296843":"no , the size of someone s beard doesn t much matter to me . my boyfriend has had both long beards and scruff , and i find him attractive regardless of what kind of beard he has .","296844":"i really have no idea . all of my memories are fragmented and combined into one slew of memories , so i don t really have much of a time frame because i don t know their consecutive order .","296845":"most likely me . sometimes i struggle with bouts of anger , but i haven t been destructive or violent in that way in numerous years .","296846":"thankfully , no . hopefully this question doesn t jinx me , haha .","296847":"oh no ! ! perhaps you need to do some research , find some reputable stylists in your area through instagram maybe that s how i found the tattoo artist i ll be going to next . but no , i ve never taken pictures or videos in the process . just directly afterwards so she can portfolio it on her social media pages .","296848":"i do ! ! one of my friends is actually my hair stylist , she went to beauty school for hair cutting , styling and coloring . she s one of the best colorists i ve ever seen , and her work is always beautiful . but no , it wasn t scary . honestly , it happened completely on impulse . i was just going in to get my hair colored and trimmed , and then i told her , let s shave it . i didn t have plans of shaving it prior to making the appointment , so it just sorta happened . lmao .","296849":"aw , thank you ! ! this is a picture from when i first got it done . i still have it shaved , but i don t maintain it as often as i probably should so it s a bit scruffy right now .","296850":"not overly , no . it probably should be a concern of mine , but it s not something that goes through my head when i do smoke . it s really my one form of relief , and it s perhaps the most harmless compared to everything else i used to do as a coping mechanism .","296851":"are you talking about my selfies ? ? no , they re very much real current , lol . i ve only had blue hair since december , so all of my current profile pictures have been taken since then including my most recent picture , which was taken yesterday .","296852":"not currently , no . the last drastic change i made to my hair was last year , when i decided to shave off half of my hair .","296853":"i believe so , yes ! ! working out has honestly already decreased my desire to drink because i ve been going to bed earlier from being tired after exercising , and most of my cravings happen at night .","296854":"no , i don t need to go to the gym anymore because my family said i could move the treadmill upstairs . we moved it last sunday and i ve been walking on it almost every day since then .","296855":"i wasn t awake when you sent this to me , but i m awake now .","296856":"ah , thank you ! ! that was my goal .","296857":"i agree people can wear whatever they want .","296858":"lol . yeah , i constantly say on here that i m overweight .","296859":"i think i lost a little bit of weight already because i don t mind the way i look in this picture .","296860":"small fact sheet i just made","296861":"rofl . my birthday is november th . i ll be years old .","296862":"dark gray tank top and light gray pajama pants .","296863":"like , my stomach gets really upset and i get acid reflux .","296864":"my anxiety causes migraines , trouble breathing , and indigestion . my depression makes me have zero appetite and causes me to become extremely fatigued .","296865":"i don t believe it s predatory , but i do think it s an incredibly misinformed notion . you cannot help what your sexual orientation is , and if someone is heterosexual , they won t just magically turn bisexual or homosexual just because someone won t accept the fact that they re straight .","296866":"that sounds like a delusion to me , to be perfectly honest . if he s going to great , irrational lengths to justify miley s behavior in an effort to claim that he can persuade her to be with him , then that could be indicative of an underlying problem .","296867":"not among my close friends , no .","296868":"my personal opinion is that you cannot love someone unless you know them personally . this man clearly doesn t know miley except for what is posted on social media , which isn t always reliable . he s infatuated with the idea of her . not to mention the fact that miley is happily married . he thinking he can win her over is disrespectful to her existing relationship .","296869":"i don t check my cell phone at work unless i m on my break . i don t get service in the office anyway . and yes , there are cameras in the office to monitor employee activity . which i think is a bit ridiculous , considering management uses it to meticulously watch people s actions in the office . however , i believe it may be useful in some situations if something gets stolen .","296870":"yes , i agree that as long as he doesn t begin threatening her , then his wishes are harmless although no doubt they re hurting him greatly . i don t agree with you regarding mental health , though . his mental health problems are probably what s causing his obsession in the first place , because you honestly cannot love someone if you don t actually know them . you can be infatuated with someone , but love goes on a deeper , more intimate level . he doesn t personally know miley or her personality besides what she broadcasts on social media .","296871":"it s illegal when a fan becomes obsessive and delusional and begins breaking the law to try to pursue a celebrity . there are several cases of fans going to great lengths because they believe they re the one , which usually includes excessive stalking , threatening telephone calls or social media messages , etc etc . loving someone so much that it gives you anxiety or depression is not healthy , and this individual probably already has mental health issues that need to be addressed , otherwise his behavior will become more radical and dangerous .","296872":"i don t generally get nervous talking about anything . i just feel more comfortable with those people , knowing that they won t tell my business to anyone else who doesn t deserve to know my life .","296873":"no problem , i m always here for advice whenever you need help with something .","296874":"yes , i have two friends who i feel that way about , as well as one or two coworkers .","296875":"i can understand why they feel that way . unfortunately , there isn t much the public can do though , not unless he begins breaking the law to try to get closer to her .","296876":"i don t dislike you because you haven t done anything for me to develop such strong feelings like that . sometimes friendships simply fall apart over time , there s nothing you can do to stop it unless you try to take an active part in reviving the friendship and develop open communication with the person . however , it s a two way street . if isoleatlantic doesn t want to rekindle her feelings , there isn t much else you can do .","296877":"it isn t something that overly worries me , or concerns me at all . when you re a famous , public figure , you will inevitably get obsessive fans . as long as he doesn t begin stalking or threatening her , i don t see it as a big deal .","296878":"rofl . no , that isn t something i would ever consider . i already have an idea in mind for my tattoo .","296879":"i don t concern myself with other people s friendships or lack thereof .","296880":"i guess this is what i would look like with long , normal colored hair . whoa .","296881":"so , i emailed a tattoo artist last week regarding setting up an appointment because i absolutely love her work she finally emailed me back this morning ! ! i m super excited to have a consultation with her and see what she comes up with for my tattoo . she s extremely talented .","296882":"the last time i cried was earlier this week . i was listening to shallow by lady gaga bradley cooper while driving home from work i started sobbing , lmao .","296883":"um , yes ? ? how else am i supposed to see what i m doing , lmao .","296884":"dating an adult when you re barely a teenager is a horrible idea . however , i was extremely young naive , and i didn t truly understand the repercussions of dating someone who was an adult . it was an extremely risky situation and i m glad i ended it when i did .","296885":"flounder .","296886":"the last mistake i made happened while i was at work . luckily it was a minor mistake i was able to fix it immediately , but it did send me into a panic knowing that i may have royally screwed something up , lol . the mistake that i do often and would like to stop repeating is drinking alcohol on weeknights . i always regret it the following morning because i feel terrible , but i continue to do it every once in a while anyway .","296887":"the best part of my friday was feeling accomplished motivated after exercising .","296888":"no , i don t have children .","296889":"i don t wear skirts , and the only times i wear dresses are to weddings , funerals , and other formal occasions .","296890":"i believe i can inhabit those traits , sure .","296891":"i only need to wash my hair twice per week .","296892":"it s a television show on hulu .","296893":"nope , i m currently watching the act .","296894":"no , i don t own an snes .","296895":"no , i m not lit right now .","296896":"no ? ? where would you even get that idea from , lmao .","296897":"lmao , no . if i call a phone number , then that person gets my phone number . regardless , it s a fake number anyway . i just googled it .","296898":"uh , no ? ? that s weird and i m not giving my phone number out to anyone .","296899":"aw , thank you . have a good night","296900":"i think it s important , but it isn t vital . after all , i have zero sense of self but i still exist , lol .","296901":"i haven t had an argument with someone in a while , so i honestly don t remember .","296902":"everyone has an ego to some degree . it just depends on whether or not you have an inflated ego , lol . having an inflated ego isn t generally seen as a good thing .","296903":"like i said , it varies among individuals . there isn t so much a common thread anymore because people don t feel the need to have children out of obligation as much as they did in the past .","296904":"it varies depending on the individual . some people simply want children while others feel the need to do so because of family pressure , which in my opinion isn t healthy . most people i know who have children have wanted them for a long time .","296905":"for the most part , yes . there are only some aspects that aren t necessarily in my control , but i m currently working towards gaining a better grip on them .","296906":"i don t know if i want children at all .","296907":"i envy people who have thin body types , but it doesn t really affect my own self image . i m self conscious about my appearance but that s because i m comparing myself to what i looked like ten years ago versus now .","296908":"yes , i edit all of my photos prior to posting them . i don t like the natural brightness contrast levels of photos in their raw form . i also usually make them more cool toned as opposed to warm toned .","296909":"i m not sure . it s just something i ve always believed in for years .","296910":"yeah , definitely . there are so many accounts out there dedicated to showing off ideal body types , and even thinspo accounts on tumblr and such , and it can make a person feel quite self conscious about their body and how other people may perceive them . especially considering most of those posts are photoshopped as well , they re unattainable body types but it isn t apparent from the outside .","296911":"yes , i believe in the existence of a spirit .","296912":"it s pushed by society for people to be thin because it s more desirable , and there s such a culture surrounding thinness that some people become self conscious because they don t fit into that specific body type . in terms of eating disorders , it s also something that may arise out of trauma or being self conscious about your body in some form or another from a young age . it becomes so prominent that it really rearranges your thought processes and behaviors .","296913":"no , i just wanted to be thin .","296914":"it s been ingrained in me from a young age , so it s natural for me to revert back to those old mindsets since it s all i ve ever known .","296915":"i experience intrusive thoughts on a near daily basis , mostly thoughts regarding hurting myself .","296916":"i went a few days without food before my blood sugar rapidly dropped and i had no choice but to eat , even though i didn t want to . it was during a period of time in my life where i was restricting , purging , etc etc .","296917":"this can be interpreted as an insensitive question , just fyi . especially toward people who have eating disorders . but , yeah . i have before .","296918":"i suppose i give good relationship advice , considering people always ask me what to do in their particular situations .","296919":"nope . it doesn t matter if they ve offended yet or not , they re still a risk to children and that deserves zero respect from me .","296920":"that s an unhealthy thought to have . when you get a girlfriend , you should accept her for who she is instead of comparing her to someone else .","296921":"obviously not .","296922":"i m wearing tank tops in not one , but two of my profile pictures .","296923":"my boyfriend s smile laughter , the sunset over the ocean , silence in the dead of night while snow is gently falling , animals showing their appreciation for their owners families , and nights spent having deep conversations with loved ones .","296924":"hello ! ! my week was pretty good , honestly . i got a lot of work done throughout the week , started working out consistently , and got a lot of positive feedback at work regarding the projects i m working on . today , i actually started training a new employee and will be providing her with feedback since i m considered a senior editor at this point . i also had a huge campfire with my boyfriend the other night , which was a lot of fun . we don t get to see each other as often anymore , so every time we spend time together is a wonderful night ."}}
