  Well it holds you back not taking the chance but I wouldn't say that someone is a loser. There might be underling insecurities why you don't. Nobody is ever a loser for not making a move. Could be the wrong time, not invested enough in the person or yourself, other things going on etc
  
  Nobody can tell you what to do or when to do it. It depends more on how you feel about being single instead of what others put on you.

  Knowing could help things especially in relationships. The reason why they might act a certain way at times, how to know when to give space or not, be there for them when they need it more. To know what is going on with them if they act distant or whatever the case could be.
  
  Uh.. I suppose not tell people that wouldnt understand or be supportive? I feel that family and doctors would be the ideal ones. Friends.. I guess it just depends how close you are with them, nonjudgement factor etc

  ""Pink: Your dominant hue is red... you are passionate, energetic, and unafraid of life's changes. You're all about getting out and trying something new, even if it means taking risks that other people would be afraid of. Hey, if they're afraid and you're not, more power to you, right? Your saturation level is low - You stay out of stressful situations and advise others to do the same😂 You may not be the go-to person when something really needs done, but you know never to blow things out of proportion. Your outlook on life is very bright. You are sunny and optimistic about life and others find it very encouraging, but remember to tone it down if you sense irritation.""

  Alternative factshave been called many things: falsehoods, untruths, delusions. Afactis something that actually exists—what we would call “reality” or “truth.” Analternativeis one of the choices in a set of given options; typically the options are opposites of each other. So to talk aboutalternative factsis to talk about the opposite of reality (which is delusion), or the opposite of truth (which is untruth).
  
  “Alternative factsare not facts. They’re falsehoods.”

  I think that depends on your mood that day. If they act like nothing happened or ask if something is wrong. I'd just go with gut instincts about it.

  No clue. Each girl and relationship would be different. Nobody can really put a price on love. Still think it should be 50/50. Nobody wants to feel like a burden. A guy doesn't always need to pay.

  It's a topic to discuss with the gf/bf. See how they feel.

  If I did have one and it was a new relationship, they told me how they felt then obviously I'd be on the same page. I wouldn't view that as controlling, more concerned. Lots of creepy people out there.

  I think that depends on what is being said. If true or false. Your perspective on the situation, how you identify. The reality of the matter. Know who you are. It can definitely be a journey lol over time. Listening to intuition.
  
  ° breathing techniques, take time for yourself, healing powers, maybe set a limit on thinking about it and then switch to something that brings the mood up higher. Do good things for yourself. Know that you don't always need to justify everything to others.

  Hard to say, really. Not always based on the age factor. Think we all have both sides to ourselves. Some are more mature in certain instances and ""lack"" in other areas and vice versa.

  2010 and a few nights ago.
  
  I'm stronger now because of what I went through then. Always something to look forward to. Breathing techniques. Knowing I'm just being silly. Saw something on IG and got me emotional in the moment. Idk I just snap back to reality. Think of what I want, be positive. View things that hopefully wont trigger sadness. Self love. Know I need to cut off whatever thoughts because rather not have them or spiral down. Need to be strong for myself.
  
  Crying.. letting out emotions instead of caging them up. Writing could be a good idea to understand why you might feel that way. Focus on the small things.. don't always need to dwell on the bigger picture all the time but still strive for it?

   you are known for flirting and more with lots of guys on here ffs

  So I always need to be that way? I say no and I'm a shitty person? I make it known that I don't want that and get these comments. God forbid I don't need to talk to everyone in that way. I say no a lot, actually.
  
  God forbid two people have only viewed lingerie pictures. I was never nude. Nor did they ever see me with my di!do. It was all sexting. (M &1%rose)
  
  Scott, Kevin, and Stephen didn't even get any pictures. All adults. All in private at different times.
  
  The ones who try on here are more ridiculous than I'd ever be. I'm open about s*x.. who cares? I'm not trying to get with them or anything. Do you ever see me write suggestive things on other people's pages? No.. because I don't want them. They come to me not the other way around. Even when I make it bluntly obvious that I don't want to behave that way I still get sh!t or them nonstop writing dirty messages. I'm accountable for my own actions. I can't be accountable for every anon I get. Also been deleting a ton of bullshit too. Stop acting like you know everything about me, the guys I've talked to or anything else.

  Wedding- my nephews were throwing rocks at the photographer.
  
  Xmas - my dad ended up giving pictures to my mom and me. I ended up opening hers... it was a picture of dog poop with a fly on top of it 🤣 mine was a picture at graduation with my friends. By then I barely talked to two of them. So ya.. was pretty awkward.
  
  Halloween- my dad would put marker on our old dog and do his face up in the same pattern. Had a plastic bag around her collar and she ended up chasing a cat. Came back and all the candy he collected was gone.
  
  Last Halloween was fun. People didn't know if I was real or not. Almost got poked in the eye. Scared some lady when I said something. Some teen wouldn't even go near me. Creepy thinking that people have pictures of us dressing like that XD

  The one that wore pjs and a robe on the first day. He also came in late. I didn't learn anything from that class lol Literally watched movies everyday it seemed. Could use the book for exams, even the final! Was some history course.
  
  The childhood class I took. He was a DSS member and would literally brag about taking away the kids at grocery stores, how the children would cry out for their parents. He ended up marking me absent (another girl with the same name in that class) so a scheduling conflict happened. I could either drop the course or try my best at the next test. I probably missed two days. We had a bunch of snowstorms.. I had evidence of being there. I ended up taking the dropping that course route because he was such an ass lol l dropped it before the deadline which was good. Didn't effect anything.

  If my profile picture was a couple picture then I'd change that and the relationship status. I don't think I'd care enough to delete things straight off the bat. Keeping them could show healing and growth too. You would also have the memories so deleting pictures isn't really 100% necessary?

  You can't speak on everyone's behalf. Nor do I care what you think. Nobody asked you to travel with me either so why even send this? You clearly have problems with yourself if you need to nonstop be negative to others.

   You've been told the same thing again and again and again and again by many different people. If you don't understand what they're telling you, then you're incredibly naive or incredibly stupid. Take your pick.
  ","
  Nah.. pretty sure it's just been the same person.
  
  Or I know more going on than you guys do.
  
  Even if he was single you'd say shit to doubt the relationship.
  "
461280,"
   If you sell someone the answer key to an exam, you are just as guilty of cheating, even though you didn't take the exam yourself. If you let a guy fck you who's cheating on his gf with you, you're just as guilty by helping him cheat. It's a simple matter, don't play stupid.
  ","
  Still don't think that means I hold the title of it.
  
  Would you call yourself a cheater in a relationship when you never had a relationship/cheated? No, you wouldn't.
  
  Someone ""cheating with me"" and ""me cheating"" is a bit different. Still guilty but different as well.
  
  Done with this since you just keep going around in circles and calling me stupid.
  "
461281,"
   The only person who deserves better is his gf, lbr.
  ","
  Indeed
  "
461282,"
   ""I'm also not cheating on anyone."" If you tell yourself that a few thousand times, maybe you'll start to believe it.
  ","
  You still don't explain how lol
  
  Someone needs to be in a relationship to cheat. I'm single. I'm not sleeping with anyone else and if I was it still wouldn't be cheating since we aren't technically together either...
  
  I don't control anyone else's actions besides my own involvement.

   Is it rude to ask people what they’re thinking about?

  I don't think it's rude.

   I love how you asked people what makes someone a bad person and most of them have said “cheating/a cheater”. They are basically telling you that you’re horrible and subtly hating on you 🤣🤣🤣

  Not everything is about me. I'm also not cheating on anyone.
