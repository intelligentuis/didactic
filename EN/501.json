I obviously apologized for the millionth time again to her. Like you could tell in the dream that I didn't know her number or else I would have called to say i was going to be late kind of thing. Also in the dream, my friend was still pregnant so I didn't want to wake her up by calling her too. Obviously these were reasonable to me but the mom wasn't having any of it. I went into the bedroom to go sleep but it was more like a tent setting?\n  \n  I basically hear her outside of my tent talking on the phone to cops. Apparently she went through my things. And this is the more odd part to me and hopefully not something that will come true... I had an insulin shot\/needle in my bag. So she basically called them because of that. I'm basically explaining what it is and how i rarely drink and that i don't do drugs so why call the cops on me besides that I was coming in at odd hours?
