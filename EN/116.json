high school friends preferred ihop and my art school friends preferred dennys so i ended up at both","107389":"we ve been here about a year and a half and while i see them in the tree most sunny days i ve never run into them otherwise . our garbage cans have lids and we feed our cats indoors so they ve never bothered us otherwise . some neighbors on nextdoor . com were complaining about the raccoons getting into their chicken coop but really it s their responsibility to keep the chickens safe from predators . so yeah , i d say they re mostly harmless . they don t interact if nothing else

.","107400":"when i was a kid my former stepdad and i tried to bond awkwardly over aquarium fish . i ve had hamsters twice in my life , and once a guinea pig , and they were all pretty good little pets . i ve never had either of those other types of bird besides parakeet with bubo , the only other bird i ve had was a cockatiel my sister had parakeets though . i ve never had a reptile but my two closest local friends both have reptile pets .","107401":"they re both kind of hard lol . making new friends because i m kind of a shut in when it comes down to it maintaining friendships because i have a psychotic disorder and i get really weird about people when i m less healthy","107402":"yeah , they have aquarium and feeder fish , a selection of reptiles , canaries , finches , parakeets , chinchillas , ferrets , mice , rats , gerbils , and hamsters or at least the bigger stores have all of those plus most stores have a few shelter cats they borrow locally","107403":"we buy cat food and litter there , but like i would never buy an animal there and i wish they would stop selling them other than the shelter cats and dogs they sponsor","107404":"i bought her from a parrot store that specializes in breeding small companion birds as well as working with the community rehoming older larger parrots . she was hand fed from the very beginning , before she was even ever moved to the nursery for me to see her . if you buy a bird that way , from a breeder who really knows parrots and has an avian vet and knows what goes into hand feeding , then you re going to get a very docile companion bird . if you go to petsmart and buy a parakeet , you re probably going to have to work very very hard to win it s trust . but , it s possible . i really do recommend not supporting petsmart and petco and the like for that sort of thing though , parrots are very complicated creatures and a specialized breeder is the way to go .","107405":"yup she was part of a bird clutch i was the first to pick one out of them and i picked bubo because she was the most active had the brightest eyes because let s be real baby birds are kinda funny looking it s hard to guess what they ll grow up to

, then yes . for now though i selfishly need her to spend her time with me instead of another bird . tbh i don t know how she is with other birds . she nipped at her brother and sister s feet and she nips at mine too , still lol and she attacks a mirror most of the time sometimes she s just a curious girl she likes to mimic the sounds of other birds in boarding when i ve taken vacations but no one

something that people have been giving it credit for anecdotally forever . all i know is i started smoking right after i found out about them , because i was also struggling with ptsd flashbacks at the time and my psychiatrist was like , dude smoke some weed here s a letter of recommendation . but then , those bitches started shrinking and i was like whattttt so now i m pro weed for all ailments . it s helped my glaucoma optical nerve pressure go down and stay regulated , it eradicated ptsd flashbacks , it made my boob tumors shrink , i sleep better , i have a healthier appetite , i feel more

under the age of or so . that doesn t mean i hate teens i just don t have enough in common with someone at that age to really want to be friends with them . also it s a little creepy for adults to

ago , and my house was cleaned right before that , so probably that was the highlight so far p not very exciting .","107911":"i never listen to instrumental music which is weird because i m not the sort of person who care about lyrics , either , i just like the way certain music sounds overall but i guess i prefer the sound of a voice with instruments .","107912":"how much motivation i lack to complete even small tasks . i used to be a go getter . i used to be able to handle things . but now i don t as well and even the people closest to me misunderstand what i m capable of now vs when i

ago . i have some cbd oil i m testing on a trip across country instead of smoking weed . there are two main components to what people smoke and those are thc and cbd . each has a slew of medical benefits , but the only things i really depend on thc for are muscle relaxant , easing me through flashbacks , and because being high is fun . so i think that if i m careful not to trigger ptsd and i just use my prescription muscle relaxers that i almost never use instead i ll be good with just the cbd in this case it s been harvested from hemp which doesn t even contain thc at all so it s legal in america cbd helps my inner ocular pressure i have glaucoma , has reduced my breast tumors , is an antipsychotic , helps relieve anxiety , helps relieve pain , helps relieve my negative symptoms of schizophrenia . there s a lot of shit out there saying that you shouldn t smoke if you are schizophrenic but the truth is , it s very very good for schizophrenia . the concern initially was that exposing yourself to thc at a young age teen years or earlier might trigger psychotic episodes but there really hasn t been any evidence supporting that at all and in fact some studies have been done to show that any paranoia caused by thc can be sort of cancelled out by a good amount of cbd . so i hate seeing that information spread around , it s saved my life and helped me feel normal for the first time . so i might stop smoking it , to answer your question , one day , because concentrates seem like the future and i do want to take a break with just the oils for a week or so . but i ll probably never give up cbd because i feel like it s really turned my health completely around . thc i don t really want to give up but i may in spurts .","107918":"during psychotic periods of time i ve been very distrustful and angry towards my husbands friends . i regret that but at the same time , whatever . they re his friends they don t have to be mine .","107919":"no none that i can think of at least","107920":"i had this major crush on this one dude all through the last part of high school but we were just friends or whatever but then in my s we hooked up and i was really excited because i thought he really liked me or whatever but it was just a thing and he kinda broke my heart and i haven t talked to him since i told him i was getting married and that was a million years ago","107921":"yeah i buy legal weed all the time . i barter for the bulk of what i smoke but i do end up buying in between or when i want a different strain or i want concentrates or something .","107922":"yes but not in years","107923":"i m a homeowner . the pros are not having anyone all up in your business , having your own space , not paying away your life to some landlord with nothing to show for it . the cons are that you have to fix things when they break , everything is expensive , and things always go wrong and need doing","107924":"i think it s silly . i didn t have that sort of tech when i was a teen , no one was gonna have pictures developed at the drugstore with nudes on the roll .","107925":"i have a half brother who is years younger than me but we re estranged","107926":"i mean i d probably just smoke up and take my meds and go anyway . but if you really can t go to your best friend s wedding then just be honest with them about why hopefully they ll understand","107927":"there s a seafood chain around here called mcgraths that i like pretty well","107928":"i wouldn t unless it was like , a destination wedding i couldn t afford and then i d

so i guess airplane wins , because it s the most normal out of them and what i do more frequently","107935":"i mean , i didn t start smoking until it was legal where i lived . so i would hope if i had kids they would respect that and not start either until they are of legal age . i wouldn t be mad at anyone over like , but i d definitely be discouraging until they were and would hope they made legal choices until they re .","107936":"i like japanese art but i love indian food so it s between those","107937":"nope the only trips i ve taken out of america were to canada and to the bahamas

deep fears and anxieties about losing her as well to the point of being unable to really trust that anyone actually loves me for me lol . fun stuff . anxiety disorders exacerbate it and cptsd causes flashbacks to times when i ve felt especially helpless or unloved . i ve been through lots of therapy though so everything s like , ok . i just worry sometimes that my husband will leave or whatever or dream that my sister secretly hates me and neither thing is actually likely . shrug .","107944":"i don t know of any programs specifically to help older homeless . we don t treat our homeless very well in this country . local areas might have shelters or offer medical assistance but being one of the people chosen out of many for things like that is like a lottery . i know the shelter in portland often has campers outside who weren t able to get a spot to sleep indoors that night because they are full . people under those conditions don t live long lives .","107945":"yup . precisely like that .","107946":"sure , i have some abandonment issues that i struggle with .","107947":"casseroles and crock pot meats i guess are what i think are my best meals my dad would say my chicken

home was not black coffee but like , creamy sweet cappuccino k cups and i can t drink that in the morning so i was sluggish all morning until he very kindly brought me some real coffee at lunch time . i m still waking up . the drain in the bathtub is clogged and i had to stand in water for my shower . i couldn t fit all of the dirty dishes into the dishwasher . the lunch i ate was technically

love us , but she s programmed to be really judgey and jealous . some people are just like that .","107979":"maybe a small percentage , but i think it s just a large group of things including a good dose of bad genes . schizophrenia for instance is most likely a genetic thing though panic disorder and ptsd are from childhood stress most likely . my susceptibility to those things , once again , is probably genetic though .","107980":"that s weird","107981":"maybe ? some people seem to run on envy . i don t really get that . like certain members of my family seethe with jealousy and judgement
