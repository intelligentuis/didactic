the mind is nowhere near complete after puberty so that disproves all of what you re saying here still .","804771":"but i will be in the same place they are and have my integrity and genuineness . that s all that matters . you can t convince me that i want a be in a place where me and the people i love are allowed to be oppressed , so stop trying . i never will want that . that s not the kind of person i am . according to your theories , that s not the kind of person god made me . he made me gay and proud .","804772":"but you don t know that i m wrong . maybe you re wrong . if god knows everything about me , then god knows that i am gay and cannot change and god knows he created me that way .","804773":"this contradicts what you said earlier and that still means god is going unfair advantages to different people in that case .","804774":"nah that s too personal lol . i m only giving that type of info to trusted friends","804775":"that s a personal question . . . why are you interested ?","804776":"what does that mean ?","804777":"exactly .","804778":"people think outside the box all the time . if no one did , we wouldn t have technology . so this analogy of yours doesn t work . people are trying to find ways for humans to fly or hover so apparently people would think of that . what s crazy about wanting to achieve something new ?","804779":"i believe and follow my morals . that way i don t lose my integrity . as you see in the my last post or online if you did your research , hardly anyone follows the law of god completely .","804780":"what qualities from my imagination ? i m only going off of the god that your saying right now . here s some of the thing god thinks are sins . if you re guilty of any of this , apparently you re going to hell . and there s a lot more too , like showing your skin think about times people go to the beach . you can do your own research on google .","804781":"haha alright , maybe","804782":"maybe you live life as a test . i don t live my life as a test . i live it as if it s the only chance i get which sucks , but that s what i believe bc again , i don t believe in afterlife . most people live their lives as if they only get one life yolo because no one knows what truly happens after death . then why make the person disabled in the first place ? why do they have to wait till another lifetime to excel ? all that does is bring a lot of pain to the people who lose the person who god decided to kill off for no reason , for the rest of their lives . you can come with perhaps and what if for anything for the rest of your life doing so , but the point here is , there s no proof or anything that leads to god thinking gay people are bad . anyone can die . people die at different times with different amounts of innocents . that s just how life is . if god is controlling all of that because of who god likes and who they don t or whatever reason , then there s no explanation that you or anyone can think of to justify god not being an a in some way or another for doing so . every possible way , as you are showing an example of now , leads to god being unjust in some way . so either god is overall a bastard or your theories about god are all messed up in some way and it s time to rethink .","804783":"and who says people decide whether they live or die right before puberty ? where did you get this from ? and the mind is never complete . time to do some research . we are always trying to find ourselves and are always learning more about ourselves and becoming wiser . that definitely doesn t stop at puberty . so that kind of disproves this theory of yours you just presented .","804784":"i don t want to be somewhere where i don t belong and i don t belong in world where i can t be myself and be accepted . i don t belong somewhere where it s okay that people i love get oppressed . so i am proud not to go to your god s heaven . the way you put them , both heaven and hell sound like dystopias . so being in hell wouldn t be much different for myself and all the other gays . there is nothing that makes every single person happy in the same way . so there is no one place wirh certain and restricted conditions that could fully satisfy everyone . if god says i will be happy in heaven then that s because i will be with the people i love there . if they aren t there and i can t be proud for being myself there , then i won t be happy and in contrary to what you say , god does not know everything .","804785":"then god is still an unjust a for giving some people the chance to get better prizes in the end than others . you said god does not favor anyone , but he has to be either favoring people who are gay or people who aren t gay in that case because some people are being born able to succeed more than others in the end . that s an unfair set up . and desire is a feeling , so that part of what you said does not make sense . if we can t control our feelings , then we can t control our desires . if god does not create something without a goal , then maybe open yourself up to the possibility that god created gay people because god is okay with them . why do you demand that being gay has to be a bad thing in god s mind ? this brings us back to where our conversation started . might i remind that not everything in the bible is followed to this day anyway and god does not seem to mind . if he did , then just about everyone would be getting punished .","804786":"each of them would be to have more wishes . then i would have","804787":"december because it s winter break and the city is happy and thankful and cheerful because of the holidays and everyone has lights up and we have eggnog and pumpkin pie and sometimes it snows and the snow looks pretty although i hate having to go places in the snow","804788":"in addition to my answer for your previous question if you can make it float in the dessert , then why not ? that means you are doing above and beyond what others were capable of . sounds like you re made to thrive and achieve great accomplishments .","804789":"it is designed so that it can have sex with men and reproduce . it does not have to . there is no rule that we have to . at least not where i live the us . i understand in different countries there are different expectations and the places where getting pregnant is one of them , i feel sorry for them . but that s not a worldwide rule , that is just a government expectation in those places .","804790":"you re going back to where we started now because the fact is , just about everyone disobeys god . this is something i brought up before , near the start of our conversation . there are a lot of things in the bible that god says is a sin , that people do in modern times . i m sure you are guilty of several of those things . i will proudly disobey someone who is bigoted and selfish and oppresses people for nothing but their own amusement or just who oppresses people at all , and i will do it along with the millions of others who support me and agree with me and fight for equal rights . i don t think anyone who is gay finds going into this god of your hell a punishment . and these are your beliefs . not everyone believes the same thing you do and everything you believe about death and afterlife could quite fairly be false .","804791":"who are the people you mentioned ? i say that this version of god that you seem to believe is not fair because they aren t ting some people be born either better futures than others . this god you say , makes some people have to be oppressed and not allowed to be themselves for their whole lives while others can be themselves . that is unjust .","804792":"now you re implying that everyone who was born decided to live , but then not everyone who was born lives because some people die early . so that makes no sense still . so , the five year old who caught cancer lost their chance and are now being punished ? why ? they did nothing wrong . they were just an innocent five year old who never got to live their life . let s say they were battling this cancer for years before they past away . they never got the chance to even walk yet . so that s just god being an a in that case .","804793":"but i am proud of my belief and so are millions of others . so , you are therefore incorrect . it cannot be happy for me to live in god s dystopia that god calls heaven either , if god is such an a as you say , so i might as well be unhappy in the same place as the people i love than just unhappy .","804794":"exactly , actions can be controlled . that s what i have been saying geez , you re impossible . no one has to have sex with someone of the same sex , they can control that . but they can t control their feelings about that person . if they are in love with that person and that gender , that is how they are . if they choose to have sex with someone of the same gender , that is because they are just choosing to be their true self and express their genuine feelings instead of faking their whole life . so , people should not have to hide who they are for their whole lives just because they were born a certain way . they can t control how they were born they can t control how they feel . so how is that fair ? that s i m saying god is an a if they are purposefully setting some people up to fail before they are even born . and i don t want to be living in god s place if that s the kind of guy god is .","804795":"it s not changing nature because nothing is changed when you have sex with someone of the same gender . nothing happens except joy from the two individuals . a vagina doesn t have to go into a penis . that s just how making babies works . if you want to have a baby , you put your vagina in a penis . if you don t , you don t . not everyone has to have babies , in fact , not everyone can . and putting your dick in a vagina is a sexual desire . if people aren t sexually desired to do that , they won t or they will , but they will feel like trash while doing so . if they are sexually desired to have sex with someone of the same sex , they will do that instead .","804796":"we already established that love is feeling and feelings cannot be controlled or changed by ourselves . our feelings are involuntary and are part of how we are born . i am gay and that cannot change . i m am attracted to women and that s how i was made . just like you were made attracted to the opposite sex of yourself i assume . you can t just change yourself and decide to be in love with someone else . that s not how love feelings work . so stop going in circles and get that through to yourself .","804797":"what s to say i haven t felt in my heart that i m doing the right thing ? let s just say there is a right and a wrong way . it just brings us back to the question why would god create gay people at all if it was the wrong way ? this seems to be something you don t have an answer for and if you can t find it , it makes more sense for you to question what you re believing rather than me . since i m here along with millions of other gay people , it must be fine . otherwise how did we get here ?","804798":"but why doesn t god not want to give the people who die earlier more opportunities ? that s just unfair . you think all young people who die early wanted to die ? you think nipsey wanted to die ? martin luther king wanted to die ? trayvon martin wanted to die ? i ve wanted to die , but i m not dead so clearly just wanting to die isn t the answer here . you can keep trying to come up with answers , but you will realize there s no logical explanation . there s simply nothing proven scientifically and or godly that leads to being gay as bad . you re just making guesses now to try and defend something you don t even know as to be true and every time , there s an explanation that questions what you re saying completely .","804799":"i say i prefer hell if that if god is bigoted and sets some people up for failure while others are just naturally born with better fortune . i will be happy in hell knowing i lived life as my true self and not someone someone else wanted me to be after creating me a certain way in the first place , or in other words , just trying to make my life harder on me for no reason . i can t be happy in some place where only people like me who can t live geniunely go . that s an after life dystopia . so then i will be living in eternal happiness in hell where i can be myself and be able to be proud of who i am . and the people i love will be there with me .","804800":"again , killing people is not an emotion or feeling , that is an action . you are confusing actions with feelings right now and you will be confused until you learn the difference . try a dictionary . we can t control what we desire , but we can control our actions . obeying , killing , walking , running , shouting . . . . those are actions . i said that already . instead of just talking , maybe go back and start actually reading what i m saying .","804801":"how is it a change in nature if people are born gay ? that is nature .","804802":"i like them as friends but have never felt romantically attracted to one . i ve fallen in love with women and i find them attractive .","804803":"how will that tell me the right way ? what s to say i don t already pray to god ? and i m still gay so . . . . . if god doesn t prefer one person over another , then why would some people go to a good place and others a bad after death then ?","804804":"that makes no sense and sounds more like you re making things up as you go along . that still unfairly limits the child for getting as much reward as someone else who just happens to be more luckier and not have cancer . what makes the child not have the option to try the test but other s do ? if god can see the future and they know who will be good and bad already , why not just kill off all the good people right away and send them to a happy place right away ? why not send all the gay people and whoever else is or becomes bad to the bad place right away ?","804805":"i m really not worried about afterlife because i don t believe in it . i believe that when we die , we die and are nothing . our bodies decompose and we cease to exist . but if there is an afterlife , i would rather go to hell or the bad place and know that i lived my life advocating for my rights and loving whoever i was truly and deeply in love with instead of faking everything just to please some selfish being who wants to punish people for truly being and embracing themselves . if god is gonna punish people for being gay , then that means god set every gay person up to fail in afterlife before they were even born which would make god a bigoted a hole more than anything else . again , if god created everyone , then gay people would not exist if god had not created them . being gay is about loving someone the same sex as you . love is a feeling and feelings , as we already went over , are not a choice . they aren t controlled by us . so , to punish people for being gay is punishing them for being something god themselves created them to be . something the individual cannot help , control or change about themselves . so that s just messed up .","804806":"what are the resulting actions and how are they bad ? there is no evidence of consistently bad things happening to every gay couple .","804807":"what about men ? men have romance . every gender has romance . i personally am only attracted to women , i have never fallen in love with a man . but that doesn t mean men don t have any romance .","804808":"that s not what i said at all . you should go back and re read if that s what you think i said .","804809":"so now god chooses favorites ? why doesn t he want me to live my life the way i am ? and why did he create me the way i am in the first place if he didn t want me to be this way ? i think i do not need your help for the same reason you think i do . because i have different beliefs than you .","804810":"see past response","804811":"see past response","804812":"see past response","804813":"see past response","804814":"see last response","804815":"so young a five year old who gets cancer and dies but is completely innocent has to die and get less rewards then others who are more fortunate ? that just seems purely unjust . the five year old may not be able to overcome cancer , but that s only because either they are young and aren t very physically strong yet or the cancer is just really bad . it is not the fault of the child in any way . so , it sounds like you re saying now that god sets some people up to get rewarded in the end more than others just because .","804816":"stealing is not an emotion , it s an action . we can control our actions . someone who is deeply in love with someone else should not have to hide it their whole lives and pretend to be in love with someone they are not for their whole life . if that were the case , then those people are being punished before they are even born , which makes no sense and is simply just wrongful .","804817":"we can t control our feelings . our feelings emotions are involuntary . they are just part of us . it s a mix of our intuition and logic that leads us through life . if good people die because they deserve a better place , then why do some good people die really young and others die when they are old ? why do some people deserve a better life sooner than others when they haven t done any more good in life ? and why do many people who have consistently done bad things live very long lives ? no one who is gay wants or needs your help and telling someone being gay is gross is not helping in anyway . you re not showing anyone the right path you re just showing people what you think is the right path . you are trying to enforce your beliefs and your religion on other people who simply don t care because they have their own . no one here know what s happens afterlife . everything you think is just a theory from your religion or your community . you can never really know because you haven t experienced being dead . the best way to help people is to accept and love them for who they are instead of demanding that if people don t live their lives based on how some being who supposedly wrote an outdated book thousands of years ago says , they will forever be doomed when there is no evidence to prove that , in fact , more evidence on the contrary . i know i am lesbian because i am and have always been only romantically attracted to women . we have more neurons in specific places in our brains that allow us to be smarter than dolphins in the ways that we are . so , this distinguishes us from animals aside from humans which proves wrong what you said about being gay makes us no different than being animals . clearly , there is a lot more that makes us different from animals than just loving whoever we were made to love and being proud of it .","804818":"you left a lot of my questions to you unanswered still i am a lesbian . but my support for gay rights ofc applies to anyone who is gay , man or woman . or anyone in a homosexual relationship for that matter , no matter what their pronouns are .","804819":"people who continue to do bad things they still get away with it though . nothing happens . there are many racists in this world who are thriving right now for example . why ? where is their punishment ? if their only punishment is after death , then why does it matter at all ? if all gay people are just gonna be punished after death , then why are you concerned ? what does it matter ? so there s innocent people who get cancer and die really early because god is saving them ? from what ? how is stripping the rest of their lives from them by letting them die from cancer saving them ?","804820":"people are connected to anyone they love because they love them . otherwise there wouldn t be a loving connection between the two . nothing but the feeling of being in love can make two people love each other . we are not robots being mind controlled . . . . . yet haha","804821":"you provided no valid evidence or reasoning to that there is defect though , pretty much negating what you said . if there is no actual example of this , then how is it true ?","804822":"well then answer my question about why many gay people have thrived in life . and why do so many people who have done terrible things get away with it ? and why do many people who have done great things die early ?","804823":"that s just false . we have much more neurons in particular parts of brains than dogs , cats so on . that s why we are capable of so much more . if they have the same we do , then why haven t they industrialized ? if after all this time humans could start realizing their full potential with their brains , than dogs and cats , etc should have by now too . but they can t because the difference in brains","804824":"you were attracted to your woman because of your creator ? not because you loved them ? sounds more like a personal issue . and gay people can still have children so i don t understand your point .","804825":"i didn t say he says bad things i said he says certain things are bad that people on earth have been doing for a loong time now . and you came across that conclusion how ? what does to identify other people mean ? and ability to bear what ? and that doesn t explain why god created gay people if he doesn t approve of them . they came on to this earth somehow and if god created everyone , then what s your logical explanation ?","804826":"what does that have to do with gay people ?","804827":"the purpose of marriage is to be happy with the one you love for the rest of your life . maybe where you live the purpose is different . but that s how it is in the us where i am . and in china , there used to be a rule about how many kids one could have , so clearly their purpose wasn t to have kids either . then why did god create us ? to be his her little robots ? scientifically , we are animals . mammals , more specifically . but we distinguish from animals such as dogs and so on because we have bigger brains and don t walk on more than two legs and don t fly .","804828":"what do you define the modern era ? because the history of the first gay rights organizations seem to go way back . god said a lot of things are bad in the bible that aren t still followed to this day . the bible is simply just outdated . again if god didn t want gay people around , than why were they created ? and why do many of them thrive ?","804829":"this sentence makes no sense . . . . what are you trying to say here ?","804830":"if god didn t create them , then how do they exist ? and this stuff about porn and habits is just a theory you made up . there s no evidence to that . what porn made people gay ? and effects on community ? what ? lol . not everyone wants to have children and sperm donors are a way for gay couples to have kids if they do want . and do you realize that overpopulation is a problem in our world ? the earth only has so much resources . therefore , we can t consistently have drastic increase in human population .","804831":"if that is so , then why did god create gay people in the first place ? and what kind of imbalance ?","804832":"i think it s funny . and what do you think makes it bad ?","804833":"because i think your reaction is funny","804834":"why ?","804835":"i m not sure . it was sometime when i was young though . perhaps it was when i found my stuffed cow after i lost him for awhile . i was like","804836":"i was , i made new friends , i got glasses , my friend s mom was dating my teacher , i got a wii and an mp player , i was really into stevie wonder music . . . . life was fun back then . now it s horrid and

them all the time , it hurts","804846":"i am sort of , but the person who i like doesn t like me back , so i mma pass on the website","804847":"because it s illegal","804848":"uhhh okay then just sit in the sit nearest i guess and ask him about school stuff and maybe that will strike up a conversation . if you really like him , it s not gonna work out , i m just gonna throw that out there . he could be arrested for getting involved with someone underage , but if you just wanna talk , that s cool . just ask him some questions and i m sure he would be happy to respond","804849":"wait , you re in high school ? ? and you re talking about a grown man ? ? and is this a school bus or a public bus ?","804850":"i am a teenager","804851":"it s normal to be around someone you like . but i would just try to get to know him a little better first and see how that goes . you can try standing in the bus next to him","804852":"same though . i ve been ready to die for so long now","804853":"i feel you . i cry about that all the time . i hope things get better for you","804854":"i m sorry","804855":"i m not really romantically attracted to people who are thick , but that wasn t the question . the question was , if i was , what would i do . i m not gonna make anyone change themselves just for my pleasure . if i fell in love with them it was for more than their looks","804856":"if it was a health problem , i would help , but if it wasn t then idc . if i love , i love them . it s not all about how a person is on the outside","804857":"bikes , but i have neither","804858":"if i love him

neither","805378":"zendaya s house","805379":"well , it s never just about one thing . last time i cried was . well sort of today , bc i almost cried and my eyes watered and once i get back to my dorm i ll let it all out , but friday was the last time tears were pouring . the main reason was bc i didn t get the classes and time schedule i wanted and it s frustrating that my major is so competitive and i m not the smartest person , so i already have very little chance of getting in even without only of people getting in and i never took any running start , which i m mad at myself about and added that to the list of mistakes i ve made concerning my future , so therefore i m a freshman by credits one of the few freshman by credits at my school , cause like everyone else did running start so my class selection time is gonna be last pick all year , which means the classes i need to be in to fill my prerequisites will either be full or fill up super fast by my selection time , so i won t be able to apply for my major in time but i guess that shouldn t matter , cause i m not gonna get in it anyway . and then today , i didn t get a score i was aiming for on my calc test , even though i felt like i didn t do that bad and my first test also wasn t a score i was aiming for and i hardly have the time to put more energy into that class than i m already doing so , so i m not gonna get a very high grade in that class which will look bad when i m trying to apply for my very competitive major , so basically my future is f cked . and then i also cried because i hate myself and i hate being me and i wish i were dead .","805380":"not plain chocolate , but when it s mixed with something , yes i do !","805381":"phones . i am a person who like playing and experimenting with

about for a speech , i would first think about what is something specific you re passionate about ? it could be a big issue or topic that s widespread in present time like for example , you re opinion on the discrimination against trans people , or something smaller like perhaps which os system or phone you think is best . then i would think about the goal for the speech . is it to inform , persuade , educate , to share an opinion . . . and then think of how something you re passionate about that can work with the goal . and i guess if there isn t any required goal , then think , what aim would you like to have ? or maybe just what seems easiest ? haha . then think about the time slot you have and what could fit it best . if it s only mins , something smaller less serious might be the best option . if it s like min , a bigger topic that you could talk more about might be better . or just something you feel more passionate about over other things . there s just some ways to brainstorm ideas , if you want more specific suggestions , i can help you with that too and list some , but idk what you re interests are so idk how much it will help haha . let me know !","805396":"hey !","805397":"not really","805398":"always . i feel ashamed about both my present and future too","805399":"idk who coner mcgregor is , but i would rather face him so that he can beat

a popular dancer o","805630":"it was okay . it was my first few days living in a college dorm . it s been pretty lonely because my roommate was supposed to move in with me on friday , but she moved

told me he became friends with my stuffed animal before he became friends with me . so i guess that s an interesting way of making a friend","805651":"intentionally stab someone","805652":"no not

?","805665":"that s a loaded question for me . . . . . if i said fine , i d be lieing . how are you ?","805666":"hey !","805667":"probably about phones , like different phone specs and additional features and advantages disadvantages and processors , chipsets . no one would care though , but it s interesting to me","805668":"friendship is people you can trust , depend on , laugh with and enjoy being with . your friends should be fun , trustworthy , loyal , caring , supportive , uplifting , honest and dependable . if they weren t , then one might discontinue a friendship . and no , i do not have many friends .","805669":"because they already are empowered . men on average get higher pay and more bigger opportunities . when a men is in charge , people listen to him , but when a woman is in charge , people consider her bossy . most bosses , in usa where i live , are men . people think men are more capable than woman . if a girl is fast or strong , men will say you re fast , for a girl or you re strong , for a girl . a program i went to a few years ago was about empowering young computer science pursuing girls because woman are so underrepresented in that field . several of the woman who worked there at adobe which was not many , talked to us about the small bits of sexism they have encountered while working there . but the program with my name was specifically for african american girls actually . in terms of opportunities and salary they are near the bottom the of hierarchy in my society .","805670":"it means mighty and strong . there s actually a whole empowering girls programs named after my name lol","805671":"no . almost , but no .","805672":"nope","805673":"yeah","805674":"idk exactly , but my anxiety makes me do embarrassing things when i m trying to be social , like saying weird things or just getting really nervous"}}
