I feel like it's the same with adult relationships.\n  \n  First, we were all children once so we grew up different off the bat from varied living situations, people who showed up, people who didn't... Then we grow up, and enter into other people's worlds whether it's for a short time or a long time, taking away lessons, physical items, and even mannerisms.\n  \n  We are always changing; our age, who is in our lives, where we live.\n  \n  Relationships are hard because it's (usually) 2 very separate lives coming together.. and that's a lot of experience to pack into one place!

It helps. Especially in labor but that's not something you need to worry about lol - they recommend lavendar, but I'm allergic.. just find some that you find pleasing.\n  \n  \u2022Something cold on the back of the neck is also relieving for me.\n  \n  \u2022Look up breathing techniques and practice them so you don't forget next time an attack happens. I usually write myself a note, \"Don't forget your breathing!\"\n  \n  \u2022Find a focus object while you are doing your breathing or close your eyes and try to visualize something you find calming and happy.\n  \n  \u2022Pressure points are a big thing for me. I find that ears are a hot spot. Have someone (or yourself) massage up and down your ear, as there are many pressure points on your ear that relieve stress, pain, what have you. I rub on my ears for many reasons. It's also comforting.\n  \n  \u2022Natural muscle relaxation. Start with your toes and mindfully relax each body part moving up. I was told to go from up to down, but I find that if my body isn't relaxed first, my brain definitely won't be until then.\n  \n  \u2022I like mantras.

It's very stressful to the body, obviously.\n  \n  \u2022Take a shower or bath afterwards to relax your muscles even more. Having an attack is very straining on your body.\n  \n  With all this, it's very personal, as we deal with ourselves how we see fit..... but I hope at least one of these suggestions finds you relief when the time comes :)\n  ","854431":"\n  I would love to know too.
