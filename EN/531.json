right now . i would rate it a .","491821":"actually they ve done multiple studies about this theory , i had to study the research experiments for a presentation . someone like you was trying to make this point and so their research showed that the babies first year and half don t retain memories in the way we think . dont go flipping off your newborn cause the negativity doesn t help their development of their subconscious but they cant retain those memories . i also read that procedures done on newborns are more successful because their cells are working so well . if you re freaking out about circumcisions , dont ever watch a newborn go through a heart surgery or collapsed lung or when the baby comes out an addict and the shit they have to do to the poor baby that s horrific . if they cut off the penis they have amazing plastic surgery , im sure if they can transition male to female or female to male i think they can make sure someone has a dick and what if the people whos dick got chopped were gonna have a small penis but since they had to get a new dick they got a thigh slapper ? these are the things you gotta think about","491822":"saying things that are hard truths that people are too scared to say themselves","491823":"everybody gets offended and tells you oh i know life is more grey rather than black and white but ending up being so black and white","491824":"it was an alright day . i got some sleep so that was good .","491825":"innocent creatures ? were you never a baby ? and so you re feeling bad for a baby that will never be able to recollect what you re feeling bad for ? its like feeling bad for that baby crying in the chair when they are getting their ears pierced . . . like they wont remember that pain in like a few days and move on to a different pain . also doing something like that as a baby is the best time because newborns heal increasingly faster than when we start getting older . the cells are still piping hot so the baby will be okay","491826":"way too many new shows","491827":"sometimes i sit and think i swear this virus is kinda blown out of proportion . and then i just start thinking of reasons why they would and of course it ends up being this detailed conspiracy theory ?","491828":"am i wrong ?","491829":"well they have no idea the pain cause they cant remember it .","491830":"in june and ill be","491831":"they cant remember it so whats so bad about it ?","491832":"a kickback where all you can do is eat edibles , smoke bowls , or pass around a joint . then talk about things that have been
