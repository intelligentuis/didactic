of all i ve gotta leave them in there for like weeks or until she comes to the conclusion that they re not hatching none of her eggs are fertilized she hasn t seen a male parakeet since she was a baby","110474":"she likes to come out and play on top of her cage sometimes , and i used to keep a little play are up there with a swing and some perches so she could go to the top and play when she wanted but she just got bored with it and kept flying over to my shoulder to see what i was doing so i just adjusted my schedule to spend more time with her on my shoulder and stopped leaving her cage open . i have three cats so i don t feel comfortable letting the door open unless i m watching closely . she has a huge cage though , it s meant for several birds twice her size , and lots and lots of perches and toys so she does love her cage too .","110475":"yes , she spends mornings with me at my desk , and at noon i take her out to see if she wants a sink shower or a bath or not , at i take her out for veggies and playtime , and at i take her out again to replenish all her food and water for the day and to hang out for a bit . right now she doesn t want out of her cage for more than min at a time because she s nesting but when she s not being a egg laying weirdo she spends about hours a day out of her cage","110476":"female parakeets aren t big talkers . bubo hasn t cared about mimicking me , though she does love to imitate bigger birds when she comes back from boarding at the bird store . but the type of bird is capable of talking and in fact can learn more words than any other type of parrot . there s a budgie out there who s name i can t remember but he can say different phrases and whistle a bunch of tunes as well . males are just more talkative , they sing to impress ladies and love to mimic their owners .","110477":"of course not , my parakeet american budgie is a wonderful companion bird in her own right and when i lived in an apartment when i got her she was one of very few types of birds quiet enough to be allowed . and anyway she s still considered a parrot .","110478":"ok","110479":"someone besides ben could send me questions , that would be good","110480":"like what kind of question is this even is there a decent human being out there who does ?","110481":"huh","110482":"i like black jellybeans","110483":"i have recurring dreams about a mall school housing complex that also has weird science and medical labs hidden underneath . mostly the dreams are just normal dreams in this setting , like last night i dreamed i was taking a painting class at the school and was attending a lecture about music and the visual arts . but sometimes , things get dark and scientists and doctors are performing tests on me underground or else are chasing me through the mall . so it depends from night to night . sometimes it s a screaming night terror , sometimes it s just a boring dream .","110484":"neither","110485":"it s supposedly safer , better for you , and from what i understand the animals are treated well under specific guidelines . shrug . i don t like to think too much about where meat comes from no matter what it is","110486":"i ve never gone out of my way to make sure my meat is halal but if i were served it i wouldn t mind","110487":"yeah when travelling like on road trips where you re in a car all day and

really sure i think it varies from bird to bird . i think with bubo i simulated spring with my light box and it made her start nesting chewing her toys to pieces and then fall in love with her toy bell . two days after spending all of her time with the bell she laid an egg . she was supposed to lay again after hours but never did so i guess this is a one egg clutch . i don t know if this will be a yearly thing or if this is the only time she ll ever lay or what i guess time will tell .","110493":"ben when have i ever watched one of your videos like really come on now","110494":"once at a bar restaurant in hampton , virginia my friend at the time s husband put his foot down on a live mouse under the table and squished it . it was just an accident or whatever but there were mice just

anyone","110503":"nope","110504":"grey goose","110505":"i have no idea probably not much i hate spending lots of money on things . i almost never drink it s bad for your blood pressure and since you

emotional service animal parakeet who is essentially on maternity leave right now because she fell in love with one of her toys and laid an egg . now all she wants to do is poorly and clumsily take

knowing their names . mimi and the other two does know what the word treat means . bubo knows what step up and come here mean .","110522":"i dunno ben i don t know what that is but i assume it s

.","110613":"no lol","110614":"probably not but i did enjoy talking to a few people about owls","110615":"i don t really know they re just so adorable . i was in some little antique shop in kentucky in and everything i picked up ended up being an owl so i decided that that was a sign for me to start collecting owls jokingly and then my family took it to the next level and started sending me owl everything under the sun and i ve just sorta gone with it .","110616":"oh , an hour or two . i m not really pushing it . on days i m not painting , i m prepping a canvas or sketching . if i m not doing one of those things then i m looking for source material conceptualizing . overall that s about hours a day .","110617":"the lines are shorter and they move faster because mostly people only use them for a small amount of items at a time so i feel like i can get in and out of the store faster which is always a bonus i hate the lighting in most stores","110618":"i did , it s in london or something i can t remember but def england somewhere","110619":"the show or the people in my life ? i like having friends but i never really got into the sitcom .","110620":"ive never been anywhere in

which seems like they should go hand in hand but nah .","110628":"i don t even know what that means","110629":"yeah , but not always .","110630":"it s a ball of fizzy powders and coconut oil and

.","110640":"that s a very specific reason to not like someone back . i guess it s a type of prejudice but like , a milder kind . i once went into an irish shop in america with my maiden name on a name tag i had on for work , which is very english . i was asked to leave because the owner was like no english people in here ! and i was like whatever lady i m american but still this reminded me of that that was like years ago .","110641":"are you ? your beliefs are dangerous . your attitude is dangerous . do you act on your prejudices and bigotry ? then yes , you re dangerous .","110642":"i really truly do . i want people to be decent and i give them way too many changes to be and am often disappointed but i like people anyway . i m an introvert though so i can t take too much social time in person like it really wears me out . i went to lunch with zoe quinn and some of her friends last month and i was so nervous the whole time that it took a week to recover .","110643":"i love

again and stop learning like every other instrument i ve tried piano , guitar , ukulele","110649":"i was literally unfollowed after smartassed anons like you messaged me . so , i mean call it what you want . they were mad and they unfollowed . meanwhile , let s address why you re so up in my shit that you needed to message me . am i your hero ? are you secretly in love with me ? i must factor really big in your life because i get anons with your tone often enough that i m starting to think it s just one person obsessing over me .","110650":"you absolutely can . i requested female only .","110651":"don t uses gay as a pejorative if you talk to me i m bi and i m fabulous . it s really not bad i rather enjoy my therapist when i go to see her .","110652":"have you considered therapy

parent , like adoption and fostering .","110659":"i mean that s what happens when you re not mainstream i guess .","110660":"yes but i didn t agree so i just ignored it . i have no strong opinions on whitney houston but comparing her to some kinda metal dude that no one s heard of seems kind of weird . like there s no comparison .","110661":"i didn t see them but yeah they probably would have you only pester like , people in my particular circle of people i follow here .","110662":"for a while , i really wanted to have a baby yes . in my mid s . i went through fertility treatments hormone injections etc but it just didn t work out . i have polycystic ovarian syndrome so my ovaries grow cysts and spaz out and don t work right i guess . now , i don t care as much like my husband really

yes","110667":"well it looks to everyone like it s you so now you ve got your haters riled up again . you re going to have to completely reinvent yourself to get along here i think . your specific

.","110669":"wasn t what ? being anon and talking about how you hate women ? it s definitely your style","110670":"but you re still pestering knirck and probably other people with your racist sexist

beings and believing that each other are capable of being decent human beings","110678":"like , a lot of things . i only like chocolate around one time of the month .","110679":"it really depends . if it s someone i ll never see again pushy door to door christians or something like that a passing judgement from an anon , whatever then i might ignore it with a secret eye roll but if it s someone who really aggravates me or else is someone i have to deal with for whatever reason family , friend , etc then maybe i ll defend myself . i ve been overly defensive in the past . and probably present . but i m better about that than i used to be . but yeah , i d likely defend my decision to not do the stupid thing they re advising .","110680":"oh i dunno . i ll answer most things . i feel like i ve put certain topics out there before but someone always finds a way to ruin basically anything eventually so nothing s unexpected anymore and i don t really have a preference . i like your questions . i like questions that don t make the skin on my neck bristle . i like questions that are actually questions and not like , rambling or accusations or insults or whatever else . i do that to other people tho sometimes rambling instead of questions so i forgive it occasionally .","110681":"it s really really stupid but some badly done tumblr meme with sonic the hedgehog that says always pee after sex","110682":"i bought bubo a new toy on thursday and it s been her very favorite thing since . i m so pleased i picked out something she liked , there s always a chance she ll be afraid of a

morning and caught up with an old friend on steam chat and i feel like i ve had an okay day . my husband and i plan on beginning our binge watching spurts of stranger things tonight so i m looking forward to that . i saw that owl in my yard yesterday and i am probably going to paint one like it next","110683":"and yet you re so interested in me that you re still here . i have called that kid out so many times it should be obvious that i m not giving him a platform for anything . he behaves or he gets reported again . i think most young somethings say and do things they end up regretting . anyway , thanks for being a rude dick i ll block anything further . my advice is to just stop following me and get over yourself .","110684":"lol why does what i do bother you so much ? come over here on anon acting like you re morally superior . he s just a kid who wants attention like literally everyone else on this site . if what i do bothers you then like , don t follow me . i ve entertained
