rose","799272":"there s a lot of things honestly . too much to really type out here on askfm . but to sum in up briefly , it s coming from feeling pathetic and like a letdown failure , hopelessness , genetics , very low self confidence , not enough experience that makes me feel comfortable , being adopted , loneliness , abandonment feeling like i m worthless , feeling invalidated , feeling like i don t belong . . . .","799273":"yeah that s what i m saying , i don t keep up with rap battles much bc most don t have the beat and that s one of the best parts for me . otherwise , to me , it s more like spoken word but targeted and i m not a spoken word enthusiast . it always annoys me when conceited on wild n out says his main tag cut the beat bc it loses the vibe for me . but i understand that

people do only what s best for themselves without thinking of others super expensive school tuition lack of gun regulation lack of financial support from people who have the money to people who need the money police brutality the protectors being the killers","799280":"i m taking meds now haha . i think the one targeted to help my anxiety is not doing too much tho . it might be time to try smth

myself successful like that but all i ve done is have to take less college classes at a time bc mental health problems put me in hospitals and lots of therapy . . . i m . lonely . i ve only had one job , the major i want a degree in is super competitive , the work field is becoming super competitive and severe anxiety is preventing me from living my life how i wish i could . all of this more has made my confidence almost none existent . so in my book , you are amazing . a lot of people only share their accomplishments so it makes others feel like everyone else s life is smooth and straight n all , but in reality , a lot of people feel lost all the time . you will figure it out , it s normal . and remember that it s never too late to try smth new and it can inspire others","799284":"nothing but fear keeps me going so living sucks","799285":"i interpret it as someone really loves someone else but the feelings aren t reciorocated and so it hurts . they just can t

vida , entonces s","799938":"i don t have any","799939":"who ? what ?","799940":"i do not know , but i imagine you can somehow . i suggest you google this tho if you re looking for an answer","799941":"haha , that s not unnecessary , that s smart ! i used to have a lot of random handy stuff in my backpack , but i cleaned out my backpack about a month ago and took out some of the stuff i think . but currently , things always carry around in it are thinking putty , a foldable bluetooth keyboard , sodoku books , like different kinds of chargers even though i don t need em all , a sim card ejector tool , an sd card box , an empty plastic bag you never know when one might come in handy , pads , whiteout , spare earrings , a clip , a coin dollar , a double headphone jack , extra earbuds , earbuds adapter for lightning and usb c , panic attack meds , a tape measure , cereve , chapstick , a mini notebook , a journal , a pen , and a flashlight . . . . . yeah , i guess one could say i have some unnecessary things in there , but i got an anxiety disorder so i guess that s what happens my excuse is that you never know when these things might come in handy hahah i just realized i should put like a in there just in case i need more cash and put some change in case i wanna catch the bus","799942":"idk how it is now , i haven t celebrated halloween at all for yrs , but back in elementary school i lived in a residential area and so went house to house and most houses would have candy to pass out . i would typically just stick to our neighborhood . there was one haunted house in the area that wasn t cute that i went to once with my brother and a friend , and then there was also this house who didn t have a haunted house set up but had a small front yard in front of their house and they would make it super spooky and my brother i used to get scared . the dude i think was some kind of public speaking retiree and he owned a microphone so you could him hear doing his evil laugh and saying spooky stuff from blocks away . every halloween he has this huge white beard that he would die all black too . he is also a friend of my dad s","799943":"sure","799944":"wait , so when you say exempted in an exam that i cheated in , doesn t that imply that i already did the exam ? bc , i cheated on the exam so i already took it . . . i m kinda confused on that . . . but either way , i m tempted to say the former bc i would do almost anything to avoid public speaking , and presenter sounds like public speaking . plus , i don t really have an issue with cheating on exams . . . i can t really do it bc of morals i guess , but at the same time , i don t really have animosity for people who do bc i think exams are stupid . if the exams were really just for what they are said to be , which is so that the teachers can see where the students are at , then i would be against it all around , but that s not really what exams seem to really be . exams in my experience typically give students a numeric score that tells the teacher whether they should pass or fail in their class simply bc of this number . rarely are we allowed to retake exams , although as humans , we don t all learn things linearly . sometimes , we start fully realizing how to do something after the exam and then we have the knowledge but that s not reflected in our grade bc we failed the earlier test . so evidently then , the class is not grading us on what we know , it s grading us on our ability to learn complete concepts in small amounts of time , have significant memorization skills , be obedient and get things right on first times the charm . it s not very fair bc it s not giving an accurate representation of what students have gained in knowledge throughout a class , yet that s the determinate for whether they pass or not . then teachers have the audacity to say don t cheat bc the only person you will really be cheating with is yourself . that s not true bc if you cheat and that gives you the right answer , then you have a passing grade and that s what your future is determinate on . so , that went into a very long vent , but basically , my answer is . although , for the record , i don t cheat on tests . . . .","799945":"thanks i m just not convinced tho tbh . and i m tired","799946":"one that i could use","799947":"no , i didn t . i

of smth to try in the morning . and sometimes i ll even be so impatient that i ll get up and outta bed right then just to try out my new idea","799997":"sour patch kids","799998":"doing smth i love","799999":"hm , well , there s a lot to mull over with this question if i had to , well then , i would have to , right ? so , it wouldn t matter if i would or not . i think bestiality is illegal in my state so , i believe i would not date one . although , if this beast was more human like than animal like and we lived in a city like the french ? city that belle did that had magic n stuff , i may date the beast if i truly felt in love with them . though , since a real beast would not be human like , i can t imagine any attraction i would have to one . like i doubt we would even have any way of communicating to or understanding each other . and idk that it would be safe to date someone with fangs and claws even if i liked them . like what if they went all bruce the shark from finding nemo mode for a hot sec and remembered how much they love eating meat . . . . like human meat . . . . like me . . . .","800000":"well , it s the desired way for me at least . it might be the only way also , idk , but unfortunately in modern times , getting a degree in this major is starting to become more and more commonly required to get into the field i think","800001":"yeah , but i don t remember who it s by . it just made me laugh whenever i came across it","800002":"not necessarily , no . but kids need someone to take care of them while growing up . it does not have to be parents","800003":"i couldn t think of very good ones tbh . i m just tired rn . . . . and all the time . but here using var in javascript to define variables is deprecated now bc it s considered bad style and just inconvenient to use global variables . instead , now we use let bc it s more scope friendly . going to college only helps for getting recruiters attention . otherwise , you re likely not gonna enter the field having skills down any better than someone who didn t to college . most people in the field are masters in certain aspects while college instead teaches students a little bit of knowledge in a ton of different aspects most of which you aren t gonna remember or ever use again after the course . kotlin is the main language for android applications now , but all java code works in kotlin .","800004":"had to rewind movies after we watched em bc there was no restart button , memorized all our friend s phone numbers and dial their landline when we wanted to speak ,

have not had a good experience at mine and i wish there a different way that i felt like i could get to where i wanna be in life bc i m not feeling like college is my thing . it s only been depressing

i know many people feel they lack true connection and friends so when they find someone they think is potential to fill that hole in their life , they wanna chat , bond , etc . when they aren t getting responses , it makes em nervous that you don t like em or they are annoying you or that you don t care as much about the friendship as they do and that creates hard feelings . so , they

asf","800113":"that made me laugh out loud omg ! ! but nope , guess again here s another photo . . . . .","800114":"i d be scared for the creepy scenes haha","800115":"oh gosh . . idk , bury it ? good luck with it anyways","800116":"oh gosh hahaha . i try to forget those moments . i m sure there are many but i m not gonna think too hard on it . i will say one time i was in the school band sitting on the couch and then i was bleeding and some got on the couch arm and left a stain that is still there to this day i think by now it just looks like a faded brown smudge . but no one knows that it s from a blood stain and that it was by me haha","800117":"hmmm , idk about one that defines it , but an album i used to love as a child was choo choo boogaloo zydeco music by buckwheat zydeco . i still like listening to that one now and it reminds me of being young .","800118":"i would want to be the god of humor . i would be able to make people smile laugh and release people s tension","800119":"i don t think there is one . at least not that i m familiar with","800120":"well , i don t think the same thing for each of them . some i miss , some i have deep appreciation for , some i have mixed feelings about , some i feel more comfortable with , some i m annoyed by currently , some i love , some i have resentment for . . .","800121":"i ve gotten even more sad , can u believe it . . . haha","800122":"obviously not nobody knows this bc otherwise i wouldn t share it here , but few people know that i own a support page on instagram for my favorite dancer . i m bad at positive self talk , but to practice , i will say i m good at finding posts and update information for the account . a lot of other accounts for the dancer just post the same things he does and don t actually know much about him","800123":"mi amor","800124":"i don t haha"}}
