I haven\u2019t posted a \u201cthis week with Lauren\u201d in a minute and that\u2019s because to be honest, the last few weeks have been really difficult for me. These pictures are all the good and fun times I had, but there was so much hard stuff going on in between each one. I\u2019ve always been a very private, emotionally repressed, conflict averse person and I had to deal with a lot of things in the last few weeks that required a lot of me emotionally. Such as tuning into myself and diving into a lot of painful deep dark feelings that I would have loved to just avoid, having a lot of really hard and vulnerable conversations with people I really care about, asking for what I need emotionally from people when I\u2019m used to just taking care of all my needs myself, standing up for myself and setting boundaries, and having to trust people and let go of control when I have always been a very skeptical and controlling person lol Just want to remind everyone that life is not a walk in the park for any of us. And that it\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to be at your best all the time. You don\u2019t have to be strong for everyone else. You don\u2019t have to pretend like everything\u2019s fine and continue on with this crushing weight on top of you all the time. It\u2019s okay to take a beat, to take a minute, to take a day, a week, a month, whatever it is and just repair yourself. Not push yourself. R e p a i r yourself. You\u2019re not letting everyone down, you\u2019re just honoring yourself. \u2764\ufe0f\n  ","927185":"\n  Its my profile, i can do what i want.

Thats very sweet of you ... Ill post it on here without the pics.\n  \n  \" Right as it was happening I thought, \u201cI am going to die... I could die right now.\u201d I closed my eyes as I experienced the feeling of smashing into a car and the airbag opening, and that loud, loud sound that accompanied it....then I opened them and I was alive. I called 911 and opened my mouth to talk and nothing came out...the woman who answered was saying things but I couldn\u2019t tell what she was saying. Luckily, a man appeared at my window and grabbed my phone and talked to her and told her what was going on. The accident continued to flash through my mind every other minute as everything went on and as Nick drove me home from getting checked out, his phone went off super loud on his car stereo and I instantly burst into tears from the loud noise. I just kept repeating \u201cI\u2019m scared I\u2019m scared I could have died\u201d for a long time up until I finally fell asleep that night.... only to wake up in the middle of the night to my ears ringing and the accident flashing through my mind again and again. \u2022\n  \n  The last couple days I was very tired, sore, bruised and just very subdued and contemplative. I realized just how grateful I am to be alive, that no one was hurt and that I can wake up and breathe every single day. It blows my mind to think that I could have not been here.... but here I am. \u2022\n  \n  I\u2019m so grateful to all the first responders including my husband (second picture) who were there immediately to help us all and keep everyone safe.

Yourself. If you dont like your hair you go to get it cut, if you dont like your outfit, you get a new one, if you dont like your career you look for better. Etc. So emmyn didnt really change her... She changed herself. Also little rewind, dani was 7-8 when she became a part of the band and into the publics eye. She could never be an actual child, as well as me and do or say certain things because she would get criticized for it and people wouldnt agree. She was hated on for being skinny as a child, to pale,  to talkative, to bossy seeming, annoying and told she wasnt a good singer. We been on the internet for over 10 years so think how long it has been. She also got compared to   me and the other sisters about who can sing better and whose the most prettiest and more to be sucessful. So this may be why she decides to change her hair styles up, change the color, cut it short, have bangs, dye it etc. And why she changed her style so many times as well. She tried to be edgy to make friends and get more people to like her. She also was really inlove with someone and he hurt her pretty badly as well as a friend of ours at the time. This is why she cried on stage, wrote many songs about him and then to have deja vu all have it repeated in the same way with someone else? She lost her confidence, her self worth, self love and it has been years trying to get her to feel happy and confident again.

So in a way i think emmyn has taught her how to love and be confident again in herself, maybe theres a deeper meaning to this on why shes doing it or bottled up emotions that are finally coming out and the only way she can express these is by changing herself and telling her story through the changes\n  ","927249":"\n  Thats good to hear\n  ","927250":"\n  A haha funnyyyy anyone who actually knows me knows im not a judgemental person.

I was scared, scared when I got the call, scared to see the truck like that, scared to see my sister in that condition. But mostly scared to lose a loved one. Christina is the oldest sister of is 6. She's my birthday twin, both born on august 12th. 8 years apart, christina has inspired me in so many ways, motivated me to always try my hardest and stand up up for what I believe in. Shes like a second mother to me and took care of me along side my parents growing up. She is the most lovable person, inspiring, motherly and greatest human to know. Me and her have the most strongest sisterly bond even if its not really noticed. Hence why I am lauren CHRISTINE. But just thinking back on everything we done and our memories. It makes me really cherish our sisterhood more. Because I honestly don't know what I would do without her. And we never know when our last moments may be. I'm glad she's going to be okay #prayersforchristina\n  ","927546":"\n  Hello\n  ","927547":"\n  Awe I try to be \ud83d\ude0a\n  ","927548":"\n  Probably not loving enough when I was younger\n  ","927549":"\n  #TBT To our #StealMyGirl cover by #OneDirection!!! \u2764\ufe0f What do you want to see next on Throw Back Thursday?! \u2764\ufe0f\n  \n  WE ARE GOING ON TOUR THIS FALL!!!!!\n  \n  we can\u2019t wait to see you there!!! \u2764\ufe0f\n  \n  Dates below\n  \n  \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\n  \n  Hamden, CT - 10\/19\n  \n  Boston, MA - 10\/20\n  \n  Nashville, TN - 11\/8\n  \n  Greensboro, NC - 11\/10\n  \n  Philadelphia, PA - 11\/23\n  \n  New York City, NY - 11\/24\n  \n  Waukegan, IL - 12\/13\n  \n  Henderson, KY - 12\/14\n  \n  Ticket link : cimorellimusic.com\/tour \u2764\ufe0f\n  \n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/hZuNCRLW5Lk\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","927550":"\n  Probably go out or throw a party at the family house or something\n  ","927551":"\n  He likes BBQ \ud83d\ude02\n  ","927552":"\n  I hope u feel better soon\n  ","927553":"\n  Patreon livestream\n  ","927554":"\n  Thank you \ud83d\ude0a\n  ","927555":"\n  Hello\n  ","927556":"\n  Californiaaaaaa born and raisedddd\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B1wKTEhnSAF\/?igshid=xwx45inaucbs\n  \n","927557":"\n  I'm going to hide....\n  \n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/nET1j7ghOZ0\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","927558":"\n  The one I'm going to tomorrow\n  ","927559":"\n  Mhm and I think emmyn and max have one coming up as well\n  ","927560":"\n  The boys\n  ","927561":"\n  Not performing or anything just going out to support and be there for them\n  ","927562":"\n  :\/\/\/ LIO no\n  ","927563":"\n  Np\n  ","927564":"\n  Cruel summer, afterglow, Miss Americana, it\u2019s nice to have a friend\n  ","927565":"\n  Its okay we believe in forgiveness in this fandom <3\n  ","927566":"\n  it\u2019s ok in this fandom we believe in forgiveness <3\n  ","927567":"\n  Having troubke sleeping is all\n  ","927568":"\n  Remember words hurt just as much as actions do.
