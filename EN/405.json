i was in the wrong and all that they have a go at it . that i can t comprehend anything etc their behavior especially on eggsy s page is more disgusting than what i ve said . it s like they ve never made a bad decision in their life in a general sense .","375492":"i understand that . still not the part i was thinking of . atleast i acknowledge my behavior and know that was wrong to do . you should probably stop too . didn t know i was wo important to you to keep on going over the same things nonstop .","375493":"ash is literally known on here for drama writing until am my time last night nonstop seems pretty dramatic . calling names . unfollowing and telling people to do the same etc how do they not comprehend that part of all this ? ? ? ? ?","375494":"they literally did last night . especially when it had nothing to do with the topic at hand . you guys were out to hurt instead of me carelessly writing a word . yes , it s still hurtful but i wasn t attacking anyone at the time . i think it depends more on the individual and the actual fat person in question instead of as a whole race .","375495":"sounds like something ben would say .","375496":"stupid fat sl t according to this and everything last night . i wonder if that s taken , actually . also far from a sl t but ok then . yet , again its not ok nor is acting like that to egg people .","375497":"the only way that i was smart in this situation is not attacking back . calling someone stupid says more about their own intelligence than mine . could have used other vocabulary , synyoms . calling insults takes away what they are trying to get across as well . it doesn t add anything to the discussion . i was looking at the view point about hating . . like why would i hug someone or help them if i truly hated them based on skin color . i would have avoided them if that were the case . yet those become excuses somehow . other layers of racism were mentioned when i wasn t even thinking of all the different types . i m wrong with whatever i do say . i get how the saying the actual word instead of writing it out could be an excuse . . still shouldn t get called names for it . everyone makes mistakes . i didn t use any stereotypical descriptions about her own people . . just because i m bigger shouldn t matter at all . imagine if i acted the same way as they did on my own page .","375498":"night sweetie","375499":"sleep calls . good night . bless you .","375500":"good night .","375501":"oh . hopefully soon then","375502":"beer bottle in the microwave . don t do , guys .","375503":"him ? ? jjd","375504":"i ll pass on that . i don t like following private accounts .","375505":"the hip abductor is one of my favorites but they don t have it at the new gym","375506":"for thanksgiving , yay . we ve had our own little birds before too . growing up it was mostly turkey and ham .","375507":"maybe the one where the number is coming from deceased people looked the number up they haven t called back","375508":"i haven t before . beautiful creatures .","375509":"i ve been doing that for an hour now .","375510":"we could discuss this over chinese food .","375511":"good","375512":"i guess they moved on from stupid to trash . enjoy","375513":"she should go into environmental researchers or something dealing with race and helping people . she cares a lot . i m not going to bad mouth her","375514":"they didn t write to you .","375515":"repeating the same thing again .","375516":"ask it again . rd times the charm or th . .","375517":"it s not though .","375518":"talk to him about it","375519":"a little","375520":"people should come off anon so i know who to unfollow otherwise you d still get questions . logic .","375521":"used wasn t thinking about others , didn t feel like writing out chinese again . i don t bring race into every single answer . i don t always view the whole picture when answering questions . just like the n word question . . i viewed it in a school setting . i didn t think of the injustice of slavery , how those kids reading would feel about it . i viewed it as a personal experience where i was in school and someone else read it , skipped over the word or used negro instead . yet eggsy was all question about race , racist , racism . yes , i added a bad part of that where she kept talking about taking back the word etc apologized for not knowing everything . my examples this time were considered as excuses again and more racist antics . it s also wrong to call people stupid . fat isn t nice either when i ve been working hard on that too . way smaller than i ve been , especially when it s more medical reasons . they were trying to hurt . i was just not thinking . they were thinking about what to write to hurt . there s a difference there . yes , stupid and fat aren t racial slurs for the millionth time but the intent that way is still there .","375522":"you haven t read anything i ve written then .","375523":"yet stupid isn t beneath your language . might want to work on that . we can both improve together","375524":"it s more complex eggsy i agree with her on that but i don t always think of all the ways either . race isn t always on my mind . i don t think that saying it once automatically makes you racist either . other factors would go into it . i wasn t being malicious about it when i wrote that . i understand how it can be wrong . that should have been the end of it instead of wasting hours writing , getting called stupid , and weight body brought into it . i wasn t trying to hurt anyone but clearly that s what they try doing .","375525":"having fun repeating yourself ?","375526":"nope , they are saints .","375527":"never said that it was . it s still rude is all i ve been saying .","375528":"haha xd puppies are adorable tho","375529":"clearly since i never once said that i was a victim . just stating how certain words can effect people too . i get it .","375530":"racial slurs p","375531":"the medical reasons and also diet wasn t the best at times . why don t you educate yourself on pcos , insulin resistance and fatty liver instead of assuming everything was my fault though ?","375532":"almost lost pounds in a year . . but ok then . pcos , insulin resistance , fatty liver . size to a now . want to keep acting like a douche ?","375533":"that s not helping at all , amanda .","375534":"i didn t mean in a racist context . . just in general . i see how it could have looked that way now though .","375535":"thank you , eggsy .","375536":"censor thought i was fat ? now i m little . aw","375537":"lol","375538":"it s not . and used once . y all need to take a chill pill with the whole slurs bit . . means plural . more than once .","375539":"what other racial slur did i use since you keep writing slurs ? it is if you are a . calling me stupid b . writing sh ! t about me on your page . there s other ways of getting the point across about how it was wrong to do so etc c . you unfollowed yet again seems like drama to me as well . telling people not to interact with me etc if that s not drama then what is ? i get the talking about racist part but you are going above and beyond that .","375540":"damn . reaching . out of context . good job !","375541":"glad to help","375542":"you are so sweet","375543":"because someone doesn t want drama victim ? alrighty then . probably the weirdest thing i heard so far . i get how it was wrong . in the moment i didn t think how anyone would feel . i don t always censorship my writing .","375544":"maybe three at most","375545":"don t really see that . just pointing out how the word could hurt others just like with what i used . yet you guys keep repeating it unlike mine . pretty much the same concept .","375546":"cool story bro","375547":"yes but not over and over again . i understand what they are trying to do but at the same time they are just acting even more foolish than i was . they talk a big game but when words that hurt others reading it , they don t care . once is better than times regardless of how someone is acting .","375548":"as are you guys for dragging this out even more and acting like children about it instead of actually having rational conversations on the subject and helping educate instead of just repeating stupid over and over again . the only stupid thing i did was write a slur and you guys keep going in a bunch of different directions with racism . . being in parts that aren t even what the original one is about .","375549":"it s a right to call someone stupid now ? lol ok ."}}
