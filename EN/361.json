lmao.\n  \n  if i get another raise within the next year, i could probably afford an apartment on my own instead of living with roommates. so that *may* happen next year after this current lease is up. at that point, i can hopefully adopt a few pets. :'))\n  ","387386":"\n  life isn't meant to be easy, and if you take the easy route, then you may not be satisfied with your life because you were

however, was a fairly productive day. i worked my regular 9-5 shift, then i hung out with my roommate and his girlfriend for a few hours before having dinner and watching a hockey game with my roommate's family. after they left, i watched a movie for a little bit and then went to bed.\n  ","387397":"\n  i haven't dated in over 10 years, so i honestly don't know. lmaoo.\n  ","387398":"\n  i feel ugly on a 24\/7 basis, so i've just learned to continue on with my life despite those feelings.\n  ","387399":"\n  i'm doing fine, although i'm a bit sad and disoriented. my friend invited me to take a road trip with her to connecticut today, but i'm not sure if i'm feeling up to it.\n  ","387400":"\n  playing video games is probably my favorite hobby rn. it's nice to just escape into a game

to navigate, and there were so many claimants who were clearly disabled and kept getting denied, especially because judges place too much significance on independent medical examinations (IMEs) and vocational experts who have only seen the claimant on one single occasion.\n  \n  even if someone meets a listing (basically it's a set of qualifications that a claimant meets to automatically be deemed disabled based on their different symptoms and doctor documentation), judges will still ignore it and deny the claim. some judges are harsher than others, and it's very subjective.\n

when i worked for the law firm, it's been three years since i've worked there (which is wild to me, wow).\n  \n  basically, it starts off at the initial application stage, where a claimant can either get approved or denied. if they get denied, then can appeal the decision and choose to go to the hearing stage and appear before a judge. this is when people tend to hire a lawyer or a disability advocate, who builds their case by obtaining medical records and doctor opinions, etc etc. the claimant appears before the judge at the hearing, and the judge issues either an approval or denial. if the claim is denied again, the claimant can appeal the decision again, which will place the case in the appellate circuit depending upon where they live. most approvals come from the appeals courts, actually, because law firms write legal arguments and other documents stating why the judge was wrong and the court of appeals will either approve or deny the claim.\n  \n  at that point, the claimant can either go back to the hearing stage or submit another initial application. it's a very long-winded process.\n  ","387493":"\n  sex trafficking sites and other things associated with the \"dark

advocacy, ideally this should be *every* day. i'm thankful that there are such strong individuals sharing their stories; however, we need to face the facts.\n  \n  -- 800,000 people die by suicide worldwide each year.\n  \n  -- suicide is the second leading cause of death for 15-24 year olds.\n  \n  -- lgbtq youth are 3x more likely to attempt, compared to youth who are straight.\n  \n  -- black, latino, native american and asian people who are lgbtq attempt at *much* higher rates.\n  \n  -- suicide is 4x higher in men than women, and this is largely due to toxic masculinity and the de-emphasis of mental health awareness in men.\n  \n  in addition, mental health advocacy and suicide prevention isn't *solely* about raising awareness of stigma and various disorders. we also need to enact affordable, accessible behavioral health care. there are so many people who struggle because they cannot get help, whether it's because they do not have access to care or they cannot financially afford care. this has to end.\n  \n  suicidal ideation does not discriminate, it holds no prejudices, and it can afflict anyone. chances are, you know someone who is either struggling, has attempted or has completed suicide. we all need to begin taking mental health more seriously, and not just when celebrities take their own lives. this needs to be constant.\n  ","387525":"\n  without a doubt,

question?\n  ","387745":"\n  it's a derogatory slur that people who aren't black still use to degrade black people even in today's times.\n  ","387746":"\n  reach out to someone you trust (such as a close friend or a family member, or even if you have a therapist), and explain your feelings. it's often better to let them out instead of keeping them within you, especially knowing that you have a support system to help you when you need it most.\n  ","387747":"\n  because they're reclaiming the word as it was used for centuries to degrade and enslave them.\n  ","387748":"\n  if you're not black, then it's never okay.\n  ","387749":"\n  i would be disgusted and explain to them that their behavior is wrong and invasive.\n  ","387750":"\n  i would say neither at this point in time. i don't believe i'm significant enough to change the entire world, but i'm also not being changed much by the world around me.\n  ","387751":"\n  probably a few days ago, here on askfm. i don't encounter rude people very often in my daily life because i seldom leave the house, LOL.\n  ","387752":"\n  one of the most important lessons i've learned is that a friendship is not worth investing in if it's one-sided. if you're putting in all of the work to keep that friendship alive and the other person doesn't reach out, doesn't make plans, etc etc., then you're not under any obligation to be their friend. friendship is a two-way street.\n  \n  at the same time, however, if you suspect your friend may be struggling with mental health issues and *that's* why they're not putting in the effort, then you should try to help them. often people who are depressed self-isolate, and it isn't anything personal because they don't want to feel like a burden to their friends.\n  ","387753":"\n  what you're doing or going through now isn't going to define the rest of your life. you may feel the pressure of being \"perfect\" and doing everything a certain way, but you're still a child and a teenager, and you deserve to have fun before you become an adult and accrue responsibilities.\n  ","387754":"\n  it depends on who the criticism is coming from. if it's coming from someone i trust and am close with, then i'll usually feel terrible as a result (especially bad criticism, not constructive criticism).\n  \n  however, if it's coming from a random stranger, then it doesn't affect me. they don't know anything about me or my life, so it ultimately doesn't matter.\n  ","387755":"\n  meatloaf. i just can't stand the taste of it.\n  ","387756":"\n  i'd tell myself not to start self-h*rming when i was 11\/12 years old because it would turn into a 10-year addiction with multiple relapses along the way. it would take over my life and i would feel horrible and paranoid as a result most of the time.\n  ","387757":"\n  i don't tend to make bad purchases because i'm very cautious (most of the time, lol) on what i spend my money on. however, the other day i ordered earbuds off of amazon ... and they sent my a face shield instead. smh.\n  ","387758":"\n  my favorite disney movie is atlantis: the lost empire. however, my favorite disney movie song is probably \"you'll be in my heart\" from tarzan or \"how far i'll go\" from moana.\n  ","387759":"\n  i'm not a therapist. therapist is a specific occupation that requires years of college and training and certifications in order to do that particular job.\n  ","387760":"\n  if you want me to describe what an upset stomach is, you've come to the wrong place. lmao.\n  ","387761":"\n  it's comforting and the broth helps ease our physical troubles, whether it's due to a sore throat or upset stomach, etc etc.\n  ","387762":"\n  i usually just make macaroni and cheese, or i'll order takeout. lmao.\n  ","387763":"\n  no,

alcohol is among those too.\n  ","387783":"\n  i don't believe in the concept of there being a life or anything tangible after death. i believe we simply just die.\n  ","387784":"\n  nah, i welcome it.\n  ","387785":"\n  i am quite aware, yes. there are also plenty of other religions that are practiced in america. that doesn't mean that i ascribe to any of them.\n  ","387786":"\n

understand completely. that's partially why i never sought help for my mental illnesses until i was in my mid-20s \u2014 alongside thinking i didn't need help much, i also wouldn't have been able to afford it when i was younger because doctors and therapists and medication is *so* much money, ugh.\n  \n  mental health care should be a right, not a privilege. and right now it's a privilege. smh.\n  ","388157":"\n  i never denied that socioeconomic circumstances were detrimental to mental health. it prevents a lot of people from seeking proper treatment. what i was dismissing was the anon's assumption that my mental illnesses would get better if i didn't choose to feel however i feel (or however they worded it).\n  \n  their words were very invalidating to people who struggle with mental illness, especially chronic disorders that are more complex than depression and anxiety. they also never took into account trauma-related disorders \u2014 it's not a choice, and people who struggle with mental illness don't voluntarily act the way they do.\n  ","388158":"\n  LOL, big mood.\n  ","388159":"\n  i understand \u2014 i never indicated that doctors don't make mistakes, and i'm sorry

that i'm a burden on my friends & they're only friends with me out of like... pity, or something. so when things like this happen, it makes me genuinely wonder if i'm even their friend to begin with.\n  \n  the only people i'm comfortable with in the knowledge that they *do* care about me are my roommate, my roommate's girlfriend, my ex, and my best friend. i have a few other close friends, but we only talk when i initiate the conversation. i've thought about closing myself off entirely, but there are also nights where i get into one of those moods where i need to chat with someone, so i always break it.\n  ","388164":"\n  i can relate to this. if i didn't reach out first, i don't think most of my friends would contact me. there have only been a few rare occasions where my friends have texted me first, and that was because they wanted to talk about something they were going through, not necessarily to check in.\n  ","388165":"\n  LOL, ugh i totally agree with you.\n  \n  i'm against self-diagnosis, especially when it comes to complex disorders like personality disorders and dissociative disorders and whatnot. you simply *don't know* what you could have, because plenty of symptoms from different illnesses overlap. it's fine to say \"i *think* i might have this, but i'm not going to say definitively,\" while it isn't okay to say \"well, i feel this way so i have x disorder.\"\n  \n  most people with mental health problems have suspicions of their disorders prior to being diagnosed. and that's normal and very valid, and it helps with the diagnostic process. but i don't believe it's right to say you definitely have a disorder when you haven't been properly diagnosed or even looked at.\n  ","388166":"\n  you can cross me off your list because it's not going to happen. i believe it's time for you to move on to someone else.\n  ","388167":"\n  ???\n  \n  this makes zero sense. there's no such thing as a \"wrong patient.\" if you're struggling with mental health issues, then you're entitled to receive any and all kinds of professional treatment you need. your views on individuals struggling with mental health issues are so skewed.\n  ","388168":"\n

because it is pedophilia, lol. the fact that i was 17 years old and he had just turned 18 years old isn't pedophilia.\n  \n  pedophilia was when i was 14 years old and dating an 18 year old. that's the difference.\n  ","388198":"\n  we did, but neither of us had the financial capabilities to afford it at the time. i was only able to afford to move out of my parents' house last year.\n

together. during the middle of our relationship, i sorta lived with him to a certain extent because of my own family issues -- i would pack a bag at home and then stay over his house for a week at a time, then go back home and do laundry and pack another bag and go back to his house for the following week.\n  ","388203":"\n  i believe that most leaders of nations are corrupt and greedy by default, as they soak in their leadership as believe themselves to be such powerful and untouchable people. if there was a world leader, i can't imagine how that would affect the world because of how corrupt with power they would become.\n  \n  it would definitely divide people, much like how leaders of specific nations divide people. look at the united states, for example -- trump's presidency has divided the nation entirely, not to mention the fact that the whole democrat vs. republican thing has already been dividing people to begin with.\n  ","388204":"\n  no, war never lends itself to

next morning, i thought it would ruin the friendship we had fostered. but we talked through it, and our night spent together hasn't affected our friendship at all.\n  \n  tl;dr -- talk to her about it and come to a mutual resolution\/agreement. communication is key.\n  ","388206":"\n  zero, haha.\n  ","388207":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree with you. which is not only wrong in itself, but also totally lends itself to the desire of men who want young adults and even children because those girls are seen as \"pure\" or \"untainted.\" it's gross.\n  ","388208":"\n  no, not really. i did hook up with

askfm, depending upon the subject matter.\n  ","388277":"\n  this goes for someone of either sex, but it's integral to have an open line of communication with your partner and be honest with them as much as possible. talk to them when you're having issues, particularly within the relationship, so that you two have the opportunity to discuss them and come to a resolution as to how to fix the problem. communication is key in any relationship.\n  ","388278":"\n  i don't give out my instagram to others unless i really know the person and have talked to them extensively.\n  ","388279":"\n  i guess both, in a way? when i'm faced with challenged in a professional environment, i take the situation head on and also use rational thinking and organizational skills to map out what i have to do over the span of time i'm allotted to do it. i usually devise a plan in my head of how i should do the task and then do it accordingly.\n  \n  in my personal life, it's a totally different story.

placed in the right loving home, they're absolutely spoiled, lmaoo. i'd love to have zero responsibilities and just sleep and play and eat all day.\n  ","388282":"\n  try to seek out professional help, if possible. it's difficult to go through depression alone, and talking to a therapist or seeing a doctor for medication is extremely helpful.\n  \n  if you can't seek professional treatment, then it also helps to talk to a trusted person(s) in your life, whether that's a friend or a family member or a coworker, etc etc.\n  \n  the bottom line is, don't hold it inside of you. don't try to hide it from the world. teach yourself to reach out to others when you need help.\n  ","388283":"\n  strangely enough, i enjoy doing the dishes. i find it to be really therapeutic, haha. i also like doing laundry because of how fresh my clothing and bedding smells when it's done.\n  ","388284":"\n  no, i don't use public wifi generally. i think i did once or twice while at the bar when they did offer public wifi, but that was at least a year ago.\n  ","388285":"\n  i've never traveled on a ferry before, but there are loads of ferries that go from long island to connecticut -- people take them with their cars so that they don't have to drive through new york city if they're going to new england, which makes complete sense.\n  ","388286":"\n  besides allowing me to work from home, it hasn't been affecting me all that much these days.\n  ","388287":"\n  somewhere in the back towards the middle. however, i haven't been to the movie theater in years, i don't really have an interest in beating out the crowds and whatnot. i'd rather just wait for the movie to come out to rent.\n  ","388288":"\n  been there, done that. lmaoo.\n  ","388289":"\n  ask me questions that i can answer

trends have and always will exist \u2014 and there's nothing wrong with enjoying what you enjoy, regardless of how trendy it is or isn't. people are allowed to enjoy things.\n  ","388302":"\n  yeah, there's more artistic freedom with tattoos & i eventually want full sleeves.\n  ","388303":"\n  no, i have no piercings anymore. i thought about getting my nose piercing redone but haven't gotten around to it.\n  ","388304":"\n  yeah, i used to have my lip and nose pierced when i was younger too.\n  ","388305":"\n  i wanted tattoos since i was like 12 years old, lol. i saw them on my favorite musicians and wanted to decorate my body with art.\n  ","388306":"\n  my first tattoo was the yin yang on my back.\n  ","388307":"\n  well, just two of them back in 2017. i got my first tattoo when i was 18 years old.\n  ","388308":"\n  !!!\n  \n  this is so true \u2014 i'm a bit of both, as much as i like venting my feelings online, i way too often keep my feelings to myself when it comes to my friends, especially if they've done something to hurt me (whether accidentally or otherwise). i bottle those emotions up and then my coping mechanisms are disastrous.\n  ","388309":"\n  they're all meaningful to me, so i can't really choose a favorite. my most recent ones are the avocado & linkin park ones \u2014 i got them done in the same day, haha.\n  ","388310":"\n  thank you ~~\n

consider that a road trip.\n  ","388313":"\n  yeah, i have seven tattoos.\n  ","388314":"\n  i mean, i watch gore movies for fun, so... lol.\n  ","388315":"\n  hello \u2014 do you have a question?\n

water signs are often very intuitive, emotional people.\n  ","388319":"\n  sometime last weekend, i think.\n  \n  i accidentally took a nap last night after work, but it was for maybe 45 minutes and i didn't even realize i fell asleep.\n  ","388320":"\n  i sorta had a stalker in high school, but i just kept ignoring him and avoiding him. i was one of the lucky ones where he eventually lost interest. that doesn't happen in most cases.\n  ","388321":"\n  nah, i didn't think you were judging. i just don't know because i've never been a comic person myself. like, i read manga when i was a teenager which i guess is similar, but not recently.\n  ","388322":"\n  LOL.\n  \n  honestly... both. mulder & scully are both hot af.\n  ","388323":"\n  maybe that's the appeal of it? idk.\n  ","388324":"\n  well, most of them aren't friends at this point. they're just people i went to high school with and old coworkers. regardless, i know plenty of people who like comics.\n

their nose in other people's business where it doesn't belong.\n  ","388329":"\n  lol, this is assuming i was ever sane to begin with.\n  \n  i've been fine \u2014 i'm somewhat of a recluse anyway, so COVID hasn't changed me at all. i've been working from home since march, which i absolutely love and i hope i have the option to continue this even after COVID.\n  \n  the only other things i've been doing have been video games and binge watching television shows. i also got back into therapy.\n  ","388330":"\n  most likely my writing ability, the stories and essays and poetry that i've written over the years.\n  ","388331":"\n  i can promise my friends that i'll support and encourage them in all of their endeavors, but i'll also be real with them and tell them when they're going down the wrong path or doing something unhealthy toward themselves or others.\n  ","388332":"\n  nah, i'm good. i've only ever posted one full body shot on askfm, and that was a long time ago.\n  ","388333":"\n  you're better off asking a doctor or a nutritionist. everyone's bodies are different, so there's a lot more involved than changing your eating habits and exercising. what you're doing may help someone lose weight, while for other people, it won't do anything. it entirely depends on your body chemistry.\n  ","388334":"\n  i wouldn't really consider it a diet, but there are times where i actively try to eat healthier than other times (such as limiting carbs, eating more lean proteins and veggies, etc etc).\n  ","388335":"\n  i experience that feeling on a regular basis, lol. although i'm comfortable in my home, i feel the need to escape from myself. i don't think i could be able to live off the grid, though. there are too many luxuries that i enjoy which make my life easier, lol.\n  ","388336":"\n  my favorite song always changes, but right now i've been listening to \"lucid dreams\" by juice WRLD on repeat.\n  \n\n

criminal minds, and the punisher.\n  ","388340":"\n  i don't think the typical love letter has lost its meaning. in fact, i think they're even more sentimental now than ever before because of the fact that they're not written as often (at least physically written). most people use social media and text messaging to express their love for a person, so that makes standard love letters even more significant.\n  ","388341":"\n  yeah, i usually watch a few episodes of a show before i fall asleep at night.\n  ","388342":"\n  the structure of our DNA.\n  ","388343":"\n  i honestly can't think of

behind me.\n  ","388344":"\n  not necessarily, no. some people simply do not face consequences for their actions, and other people face consequences for other people's actions that they had no direct involvement in. life isn't fair.\n  ","388345":"\n  i'm not really ashamed of anything that i'm interested it and\/or do.\n  ","388346":"\n  i used to attract the wrong kind of people when i was younger, but as i've gotten older, i've sorta learned which people to accept into my life and which to keep away because they won't be productive to my own self development and self esteem.\n  ","388347":"\n  because they're boys, not men. when you enter a mature and healthy relationship, your partner won't have any reservations about showing affection in public. obviously there are some men who don't use social media very often, and therefore, won't post about their partner, but if it seems as if your partner is trying to hide the fact that they're in a relationship, then that's a definite red flag.\n  ","388348":"\n  depends on the type of bug, i suppose. luckily, there haven't been any bugs in the house this summer !! however, there are a few crickets in the garage, but i leave them alone because it's not as if they're bothering anyone.\n  ","388349":"\n  that could be an explanation, sure. i honestly can't give an opinion, though, because i only know one person who's
