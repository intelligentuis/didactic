i don t understand how can your identity be something you don t identify with . what it is you identify with ? do you like both men and women ?","282614":"sorry you seem to be getting all this circular questioning from people who apparently didn t learning anything about gender after the age of .","282615":"that means absolutely nothing and everything . explain what you identify with and

simply your identity .","282650":"are you always patient ?","282651":"how big are your ego , pride and kindness ?","282652":"no lol . that is called a personality . it s not a real science because it

lately ? you re the second person claiming they re from the irs to begin using askfm . not to mention the other person who claimed they were from microsoft over the weekend . ? y all need to find a better hobby , or at least a scamming idea that s a hell of a lot more believable than what you re attempting now .","282167":"my day was a bit difficult , honestly . i had a doctor s appointment via video chat and apparently my doctor doesn t taken my insurance anymore , so i had to talk to the office as well as insurance company to settle everything . then some sh t went down between my mother and i because of a misunderstanding she got angry with me because i didn t explain myself properly . and even when i clarified , she was still angry with me so that ruined the rest of my day . afterwards , i had a mental breakdown and cried for like two hours , took a depression nap , and then ordered dinner . i feel a bit better now but i m still super emotional .","282168":"popcorn , usually . or i just don t eat anything at all .","282169":"still doesn t appeal to me , haha . i don t like frosting or anything like that . i like savory foods more than anything else .","282170":"i ve never had it before . i m not big on sweets .","282171":"no , i can t bother doing anything to my hair besides wash and dry it . i m lucky if i wake up in the morning to brush it .","282172":"everything else . lmao .","282173":"personality my passion for my interests . my hard work ethic . my loyalty to my friends . physically my eyes . my hair . my cheekbones .","282174":"no

not usually . i ve fallen asleep in the middle of texting someone , but that s the extent of it .","282177":"lol , yes . although i haven t read in quite some time and normally my reading sessions are short lived because my attention span has been sh t lately .","282178":"i actually love doing laundry and the dishes , surprisingly . there s a certain satisfaction with taking clean clothing and sheets out of the dryer and smelling the fabric , and also the hot cleanliness of the dishes after they ve been dried in the dishwasher .","282179":"no , watching television or reading makes me lose track of time keeps me awake more than anything else . i usually watch a few episodes of something before bed , but then i turn it off before i actually go to sleep .","282180":"valarian root , melatonin , or xanax .","282181":"i floss occasionally , yeah . not everyday like i know i m supposed to , but whatever .","282182":"i don t really own typical pajamas . i just sleep in sweatpants and

need them , crawl into bed , and turn off the lights .","282187":"anxiety , usually .","282188":"thank you it s something i m pretty vocal about most of the time , it s a part of my life and there s no shame in discussing it .","282189":"strengths i have a hard work ethic . i m passionate about my interests . i m very loyal to my friends . weaknesses i tense up in angry situations blame myself , so i apologize for things that aren t my fault . i can be incredibly lazy , especially if i m struggling mentally . i m self destructive at worst and have the tendency to implode under pressure .","282190":"this is going to be a depressing answer , but the ab se i endured has deeply impacted how i think and act . it happened during a critical time of my development growing up , so i unconsciously based my entire personality off of survival methods instead of finding myself for who i actually am . i still struggle with disconnecting survival mode from living my life , because the ab se has traumatized me so much . people in my life , like my friends , inspire and drive me forward . most of them have also been through a level of struggle in their lives , and their ability to push through inspires me . one life lesson i ve learned is that we need to put ourselves first not compromise our own happiness in order to make other people happy . it s fine to do sometimes , of course , but if it becomes a habit then it becomes detrimental to our own well being . we need to put ourselves first .","282191":"very stormy rainy days bring me pleasure much like the weather i m experiencing today . it s always been very relaxing to me .","282192":"i m a writer which is an art form , but i don t consider myself to be an artist or at least a consistent practicing one . i feel like that term is reserved more for people who are so passionate about their work that they like producing things on a regular basis . i enjoy all other types of art , though , especially painting , digital art , music , filmography , sculpture , etc etc .","282193":"the darkness doesn t bother me , but i also like being able to see what s in my room at night so i usually keep my string lights on

gorey movies .","282195":"published , stay at home novelist .","282196":"i m not sure , because regardless of how much i sleep i always wake up completely exhausted .","282197":"no , i don t currently share a bed with anyone . i have a giant queen sized bed all to myself .","282198":"no , i never shared a bed with anyone .","282199":"apparently i do snore . not loudly or anything , but i m not quiet when i sleep either .","282200":"apparently i have in the past , but i was also extremely intoxicated when i did it , lmaoo .","282201":"only close friends , not strangers .","282202":"no , i don t have a tik tok account .","282203":"that sounds delicious ! !","282204":"i don t believe i ve ever sleep walked , no .","282205":"i normally don t wake up throughout the night , but the past few nights i ve been waking up routinely around am for absolutely no reason at all .","282206":"sometimes it takes me an hour if i m extremely restless , other times it only takes me about minutes to fall asleep .","282207":"i honestly have no idea what i m making for dinner tonight . i ve been extremely tired lately , so i might just make some mac n cheese with some vegetables on the side . i haven t been creative with recipes at all , i ve been far too lazy to really experiment with anything plus i m a horrible cook to begin with .","282208":". my last dialogue was with my psychiatrist . . i don t remember who my first friend was . . ? ? ? . i don t have many friends i probably have a small circle of around people i speak to regularly . i m fine with it . . at the moment , it s death bed

. . no , i m a terrible dancer . . raspberries , bananas , peaches , mangoes , and blueberries .","282209":"not generally , no . sometimes if i m extremely exhausted on a weekend , i ll take a nap on a saturday afternoon . but it s pretty rare .","282210":"uh , i d prefer not to describe it in detail because to be honest , it s extremely graphic and not suitable for an askfm audience , lol .","282211":"brought home things to make me feel better when i was feeling very unwell either physically or mentally .","282212":"i m following the reports of medical professionals who have said so and who have denounced all of the conspiracy theorists .","282213":"i often experience nightmares , but i don t believe i ve ever had a night terror before .","282214":"if they re particularly wild dreams , then i do remember them but only briefly . i remember then within the first hour of waking up , and then it just disappears from memory . some nights i feel like i don t even dream at all .","282215":"that varies wildly , haha . i don t really have an exact sleep schedule , so it depends on whenever i m tired . it can be an early at pm or as late as am .","282216":"on the weekdays lately , i ve been getting up around am so that i can clock into work at am . on the weekends , it varies because i don t set an alarm . yesterday , i woke up at am , and today i woke up at am .","282217":"it depends on the night . sometimes i get around hours of sleep , while other times it can be between hours .","282218":"my video conference virtual happy hour with my coworkers on friday night made me laugh so hard . they re truly a great bunch of people and it was so nice to see everyone s faces .","282219":"i think that s one of the most ridiculous conspiracy theories ever , haha . the coronavirus is not a man made biological weapon , there was no ulterior motive , and it s simply a highly infectious and lethal disease that made its rounds faster than we could keep up with it .","282220":"a few days ago , here on askfm , someone was basically defending trump for his statement of injecting disinfectants to get rid of the coronavirus , because i had previously posted that it was ridiculous that people had to be told not to do that in the first place . i basically had to tell the anon that trump is a figure of authority and some people are going to listen to him in light of that fact , so it s super important now for other medical professionals to step in and urge everyone not to heed trump s words .","282221":"askfm is beneficial in that you have the opportunity to ask interesting and often thought provoking questions to your friends in order to get to know them better .","282222":"i ve been all right just quarantining as instructed , and i ve been working from home for hours per week as opposed to going into the office every day . i have a tele appointment with my psychiatrist this morning , and i kinda want to ask her if she can increase the dose of one of my medications because my anxiety has been super bad lately .","282223":"probably the extended edition of one of the lord of the rings films , haha . for me , it was definitely worth it because i absolutely love those movies .","282224":"my shaved parts that have been growing out are my natural color .","282225":"that s endearing and all , but you truly don t . you only love the fantasy you

have a question ?","282228":"my favorite artists really depends on the mood i m in and what i feel like listening to . lately , i ve been listening to a lot of composers like howard shore , michael

, louis capaldi , hozier , in this moment , otep , and billie eilish .","282229":"most definitely , yeah . music has greatly helped change my mood , or usually it amplifies whatever mood i m already feeling , haha .","282230":"yes , i used to write song lyrics all the time when i was a teenager .","282231":"depends on what it is i m doing . i can t listen to music with lyrics while i m writing , so i ll usually put on some classical music or a video game movie television soundtrack on in the background . for any other activity , though , i can listen to music with lyrics .","282232":"hello do you have a question ?","282233":"i still own at least a hundred cds from when i was a teenager , haha .","282234":"no , i m single .","282235":"now why would i give my secrets away like that ?","282236":"they probably don t know anything they re just making assumptions because that s what anons do to stir the pot .","282237":"i don t think that s selfish , honestly . it s what we re supposed to do . we put other people first so much that it begins to feel wrong to put ourselves first , when really we should have been putting ourselves first all along .","282238":"my work family for being so amazing and thoughtful . the house that i live in for providing shelter in these troubling times . and my friends for being such pillars of support for me while i m going through difficult situations .","282239":"i admire celinem for her hard working nature and ability to overcome every obstacle that has entered her life . i admire courtneyuwu for existing a toxic situation

.","282242":"i never said it made me special . the question was what i was complimented on the most on askfm .","282243":"my day has been uneventful , to say the least . i ve literally done nothing , lmaoo . i slept for hours last night , got up around am and made breakfast and coffee . i logged onto my laptop to answer some questions and i laid back down for like another two hours because i was so foggy . for the past two hours or so , i ve just been watching comedy specials on netflix .","282244":"i definitely have less patience now than i did in the past , but i do try to explain myself clearly and articulate my thoughts without being disrespectful assuming the anon or whoever isn t disrespecting me at all .","282245":"how clear educational my answers can be sometimes when someone asks me to give them advice or explain something .","282246":"i ve never worked in the food industry , but i did work in a retail environment at a drug store for years . i had irate customers coming in pretty much every day , complaining about things that were out of my control they wouldn t accept my explanation for an answer even if i was the manager on duty at the time . it was absolutely ridiculous and sometimes i still have nightmares about working in that store , lmaoo .","282247":"dance monkey by tones i . i just . . . ugh . it s annoying , but strangely catchy , which makes it even more annoying to me .","282248":"when i used to play music , i knew how to read music . these days , i don t .","282249":"no , i most definitely cannot sing , haha . if i could , i would have pursued a career in music .","282250":"yessss , i love musicals ! ! i ve been obsessed with les miserables lately i wish i could see it on broadway .","282251":"i can t play a musical instrument these days , but i used to kinda know how to play the guitar , ukulele , and keyboards .","282252":"i used to use my family s desktop computer when i was a teenager , and i got my first laptop when i was years old when i went to college . i prefer laptops , mainly because all i do on my laptop is go on websites and use ms office . i don t need a desktop computer tower to do anything that i d want to do . if i gamed on the computer , i d probably use a desktop but i prefer consoles .","282253":"industrial ! !","282254":"coming undone by korn . https youtu . be csjxle lp q","282255":"somewhat , yes ! ! i used to exclusively listen to hard rock , grunge , and nu metal when i was a teenager . however , now my taste in music is much more diverse . lately i ve been listening to more hip hop and pop

.","282257":"right now death bed coffee for your head by powfu . https youtu . be jjpmntxl e","282258":"it depends on my mood . it usually ranges between nu metal , alternative rock , hip hop , classical , and metal .","282259":"uh , it isn t profound but i ve re discovered my love for comedy and i ve been watching a lot of comedy shows .","282260":"idk , probably just sitting somewhere quiet like a coffee shop and talking .","282261":"i don t play sports .","282262":"perhaps if you were experienced in customer service , you d be a bit more believable .","282263":"i m planning on

be great if i wasn t in pain .","282270":"my dream vacation is taking a trip out to the mountains , renting out a small log cabin , and spending the mornings afternoons relaxing on the balcony , talking walks through the trees , visiting lakes and streams , and maybe even going fishing . in the evening , we d make food on the heat of a homemade campfire , listen to music , and have a few drinks .","282271":"i don t really know , tbh . there are some days where i don t want to be remembered at all because i feel as if i m an easy person to forget . there are also other days where i d like to be remembered for my advocacy of mental health and mental illness awareness , my writing , and my passion for the arts .","282272":"i ve always wanted to visit england , particularly the city of london ! ! there seems to be so much history there and it appeals to me .","282273":"i don t really remember having any bad ones , at least the vacations i ve taken with my ex and all of our friends since we turned years old . i didn t take any vacations during my teenage years at all . one of the most annoying trips was a trip we all took upstate . my friend brought his girlfriend now ex , and she was always a very controlling and manipulative person . she would tell him not to do certain things with us on the trip and they stayed in the hotel room for most of the weekend , so we barely even got to see him .","282274":"yeah , i believe children who have been through the foster system definitely have a bad reputation because of why they become foster kids for one reason or another the blame is almost always wrongly on the children instead of on the parents or however the children were placed in foster care to begin with . it s important to consider those children s mental health , because sometimes going through the foster system can be traumatic and contribute to things like depression and anxiety and even ptsd . there are little resources for these children and they end up growing up into teenagers and adults with no vision for their future .","282275":"most people who take in foster children are admirable , but there will always be a small percentage of people who have nefarious intentions of taking in foster children and raise them in ab sive environments .","282276":"most of the time , yes . future generations seem to be much more promising than past generations including my own generation , to a certain degree and i do have faith that they ll change the earth around to be a better , more tolerable environment .","282277":"the smaller things in life are beautiful to me waking up to the sounds of birds chirping or rain hitting the windows and roof the fresh , bold smell of brewed coffee in the morning music of all varieties , particularly

and their passion toward implementing change on social , economic , and political scales nature as a whole and people overcoming difficult personal obstacles and seeing the beauty in themselves at the other side .","282278":"during quarantine and this pandemic in general , i ve learned that people can either be much more compassionate towards others or completely irresponsible , reckless , and cruel . there s almost no in between . i m not sure how history will remember this fight , other than perhaps the emphasis on essential workers and other people working on the front lines , such as health care professionals , delivery people , retail workers , etc etc . i would love if you sent out more questions ! !","282279":"true crime , abnormal psychology , and medical anamolies

.","282281":"the scene in les miserables when the little boy gets shot and dies . it moves me so emotionally and gives me goosebumps every time .","282282":"i m more productive in the morning hours because i have fresh motivation after not working for those hours after i ve clocked out of work the previous day . i m not sure if i could get used to another schedule immediately , but i guarantee

.","282305":"the cost of living is too high for some people living in parts of the united states , so it s difficult if not impossible for some people to accrue savings .","282306":"i m a writer editor for a publishing company as my line of work , so most times people ask me what it is i write . as for where i live , i live in new york which most people confuse for manhattan , lol , so they

that love has the possibility of fading away with time .","282315":"i enjoy where i live at the moment i m very close to the pharmacy and grocery store and , and there are also plenty of bars and

seasonal allergies where i sneeze a lot , but that s the extent of my symptoms .","282317":"no , that doesn t sound right ? then again , i haven t heard of the study . i would think that smokers would

through working hours per week at home , playing video games , and watching television mainly .","282323":"i don t really believe the media is blowing it out of proportion , from what i can tell . the only thing they don t emphasize is the number of people who have successfully recovered they only report on the number of deaths , but that s journalism for you . long island was considered the epicenter of the virus at one point a few weeks ago , because we had the most number of cases and deaths compared to the rest of the country . i m not sure if that still applies though . there s an pm curfew , most non essential businesses are closed , and essential workers have to carry about a slip everywhere they go saying they re essential if they re out . you can be fined if you re not wearing a mask out in public now , from what i recall . businesses can turn you away if you re not properly equipped .","282324":"i disagree . i have always personally believed it s best to keep to yourself

five hours ago .","282347":"hello just watching netflix and drinking at the moment .","282348":"my day was fine up until my coworker pissed me off . now i m trying to keep my rage contained and not

.","282351":"ask me questions , friends i have a few spam questions from friends left in my inbox , but more are always welcome ! !","282352":"she s an asshole , lmao .","282353":"by holiday , you mean vacation , right ? sorry , i m american lol . my favorite vacation was the day cruise i took with my ex and his family to the bahamas . i probably wouldn t take another cruise on that large of a level , but it was a lot of fun and it was amazing having an experience so different from everything else i ve ever known .","282354":"traveled over miles just to be with them ? haha . there were other circumstances surrounding the decision , but that was one of the largest deciding factors .","282355":"i don t believe i ve ever eaten any exotic food , lol .","282356":"i try my best not to judge people quickly , because i know that people often are not what they seem on first impressions and it can take a while to genuinely know someone .","282357":"i just haven t been dealing with things well at all the past few days , that s all . i spent most of last night sobbing my eyes out to a movie , and prior to that i felt hypomanic . my emotions have just been all over the place .","282358":"i m familiar with ramadan . blessings to you , my friend .","282359":"my ex called me earlier today to catch up on things , and when he asked how i was doing , i told him i was doing well . in reality , that s a lie i haven t been doing too well at all , but i didn t want to worry him by telling him the truth .","282360":"i haven t found my life purpose yet . sometimes i wonder if i actually have one .","282361":"abashed the devil stood and felt how awful goodness is . he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man . if you re going through hell , keep going . i love you as certain dark things are to be loved , in secret , between the shadow and the soul . it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live .","282362":"les miserables ! ! i watched it again last night for the first time in a very long time , which only solidified my love for the movie . it s one of my all time favorite movies . the music , the messages behind the film , and the moving aspects of those motifs and symbols are all so beautiful .","282363":"no , i don t believe the government is honest or loving . the government genuinely only cares about the economy not the lives lost during this pandemic , the well being of health care workers and other people on the front lines , etc etc .","282364":"when i was in my first year of college , i took a spontaneous road trip from the berkshire mountains of massachusetts all the way up to lake champlain in vermont . my college roommate and our close friend accompanied me , and we stopped at every different rest stop we could what would have been a hour drive took us hours , and then we were smuggled into my best friend s dorm and slept there for the night . there was a lot of drugs and alcohol involved too , from

college magna cum laude with a bachelor s degree in .","282367":"i believe most skills are pretty hard to master , tbh . it takes a lot of patience and dedication to really master a skill in its entirety .","282368":"i don t necessarily believe in life after death , no . i believe that our souls are composed of energies , and our bodies are just the hosts to those energies . when our physical bodies perish , our energies get transferred to a different medium , but i don t think of that in terms of another life .","282369":"yes , most definitely . i ve become more independent and responsible , i moved out of my parents house and began living on my own , and i ve received two promotions at work which has given me more leverage and responsibility on a professional level .","282370":"self confidence , primarily . i ve always admired people who are confident in themselves because i ve always somewhat lacked self confidence , whether it was in my appearance or my personality . i find that people who are self confident are much more successful as long as their self confidence doesn t border on arrogance .","282371":"it depends on the individual and how i feel around them . some people immediately make me feel comfortable and i can be fully myself around them from the start , while for others , it may take a few tries for me to feel comfortable enough to express myself the way i want to express myself .","282372":"elizabeth bathory , for obvious reasons . i ve read countless books and watched a few movies that discussed her , and i find her story to be so incredibly interesting .","282373":"i would much rather live adventurously and die young , tbh . i understand the appeal of growing old , especially if you have loved ones , but personally i would much rather have a fulfilling , exciting life than one that s void of excitement or purpose .","282374":"i m sure i have , but i cannot remember any , tbh . i have a pretty terrible memory , and the only reason why i remember my th birthday last november is because i have picture documentation of it .","282375":"ridden a bicycle . i ve never learned how to ride a bike .","282376":"i ve actually only cursed around my parents maybe a handful of times , even as an adult . i was taught never to curse when i was a child , mainly because i was afraid to curse , and even now as an adult i don t curse in front of them . it s slipped out a few times usually just sh t or f ck , but it wasn t intentional .","282377":"i see where he s coming from , but it s generally not a bad thing if you don t care about what other people think of you . it means you have a sense of independence and self assured nature . as long as you re not arrogant about yourself , there s nothing wrong with not caring about other people s opinions .","282378":"cool with a hint of chill around degrees fahrenheit , with either sun or massive rain . i absolutely love thunderstorms .","282379":"yeah , lmaoo . well it isn t really beef , i m just a tad bit annoyed at one of my coworkers for a poorly worded email she sent me literally minutes before work ended . i m still fuming .","282380":"no , lmao . my personality is disordered and most definitely not attractive .","282381":"i answered a similar question yesterday , i believe . however , yes i do think i have an addictive personality . i have the potential to become addicted to things easily it s also in my gene pool , and i also become obsessive over things easily .","282382":"yes , i used to have a gallon fish tank when i lived at my parents house . unfortunately , my fish passed away prior to me moving out .","282383":"yeah , i used to be a pretty good artist up until i stopped drawing after high school .","282384":"these days , i d like to have a night out . it ll feel nice to go out to the bar , grab some food and drinks with friends , and listen to good music .","282385":"depends on which day i d have to relive , haha . if it was a great day , then i wouldn t mind reliving it for an entire year . if it was a bad day , then i d rather lose an entire year of my life .","282386":"anxiety by bmike . https youtu . be khneubbmwum","282387":"is it considered a strange coincidence that my roommate and i both woke up at the same time in the middle of the night then heard footsteps walking down the hallway , even though my other roommate was asleep ? the other day , all three of us were in the house my two roommates were in the kitchen and i was in my bedroom . we all heard three knocks , and i assumed it was someone at the front door . however , i walked into the kitchen and my roommates were confused af and couldn t figure out where the knocking came from .","282388":"usually , yes . i have a keen sense of intuition and i normally follow my senses if i think something is wrong or suspicious .","282389":"hypomanic episodes . lmao .","282390":"video games . ?","282391":"i ve traveled by boat miles from new york to the bahamas .","282392":"i would probably try to send her a separate email or call her on the phone and explain your preferred name . just putting it in your signature might not really click in her mind , she s probably basing it off of her notes from the school referring to your real name .","282393":"i don t think i ve read any wikipedia articles recently the last one i remember reading is about the coronavirus and how it s impacted the world , as well as how it spread so fast . that was about a month or so ago .","282394":"i honestly don t remember , haha . i think i went out to the bar with my friends , according to my snapchat memories .","282395":"apparently my student loans were halting payments until september in light of the coronavirus , so it ll be nice to save up some money and not have to make those monthly payments for the next five months .","282396":"i like salad , and i usually have ceasar dressing or ranch dressing .","282397":"english is my native language , so i ve always read in english . i enjoy reading because it usually provides inspiration for my own written works , and i also love getting lost in a story .","282398":"my birthday is on november th , and i ll be years old .","282399":"the only thing i can think of is french fries in cookies n cream ice cream , haha . i love the combination of the sweet salty .","282400":"eh , sorta ? i don t have a party or anything , but sometimes my friends and i will go to the bar and have a few drinks .","282401":"i d much rather go camping . i love being surrounded by forests and lakes and whatnot . i like the beach to a certain degree , but i ve always wanted to try out camping .","282402":"i ve never really embarrassed myself on a video call before , since i seldom do them , haha . however , i m having a virtual happy hour with some people in my department at work tomorrow evening , so we ll see what ensues . lmao .","282403":"i ve been to the united states and the bahamas .","282404":"good morning do you have a question ?","282405":"ok ? that still doesn t explain what it means , lmaoo .","282406":"no ? i m not quite sure what you mean by that .","282407":"i didn t believe in anything i never believed in god , and if anything as i grew older , i identified more with eastern religions spiritualities .","282408":"yes , i love many people in my life .","282409":"you evidently don t know how the coronavirus works .","282410":"definitely not . i wouldn t want to put someone s life and their family at risk by entering this house , nor would i want to risk someone else bringing in illness to my house .","282411":"i just started working .","282412":"no , i haven t had a swimming pool in over years .","282413":"yeah , having intelligence will definitely attract me more to someone , both in a platonic and romantic aspect .","282414":"the same one i ve been using since october ? lmao .","282415":"i never had a favorite teacher growing up , because i was never close to any of them . i had a great forensics teacher in high school , but i honestly can t remember his name .","282416":"my name is leigh , as it indicates all over my page .","282417":"yes , i use twitter . however , my account is private .","282418":"i haven t attended college since .","282419":"you d have to ask someone who s a psychologist , not some random stranger on the internet .","282420":"definitely not , no . the coronavirus , and specifically covid , is not a man made conspiracy used by the chinese government to wipe out the rest of the earth . it s simply a very lethal upper respiratory disease that is extremely contagious .","282421":"i didn t legally change my name , no . no one really refers to me by my dead name , though .","282422":"return of the pink panther is an oldie that i ve always loved .","282423":"i don t have a preference , lol . different things look good on different people . someone may look better bald than with hair , and someone else may look better with hair than bald . it all depends on the individual .","282424":"no , that doesn t bother me at all .","282425":"aw , thank you ! !","282426":"not any new shows , no . i ve been re watching old shows that i haven t seen in a while , like bones and house .","282427":"putt putt and freddi fish ! !","282428":"i m currently watching les miserables .","282429":"no , that seems a bit excessive .","282430":"nah , my job transitioned well to working remotely . it s the same as working at the office except i m sitting at my desk in my bedroom instead of the office , haha . luckily both of my roommates work most of the day , so i have the house to myself with no distractions .","282431":"i ve met the members of the band linkin park . i ve also met various cast crew members of the company rooster teeth .","282432":"yes , i ve been working from home since mid march .","282433":"my week has been going well . i haven t done much besides work yesterday i managed to do two loads of laundry after work , but nothing else substantial , unfortunately . since quarantine , i ve been mainly spending most of my time working , playing video games , watching television , and cleaning .","282434":"i don t believe in the concept of multiple lifetimes or past lives , so no .","282435":"my hair has always responded well to color treatments , yes ! ! i ve been coloring my hair at least twice per year since i was years old . i don t generally use any special products except for color enhancing shampoos conditioners , as well as argan oil after my hair has been cleaned

happy hour that my department is hosting on friday after work .","282438":"possibly . only time will tell .","282439":"i ve always wanted a pit named meatball .","282440":"my name is leigh i like it very much otherwise i wouldn t have chosen it for myself , haha . i believe it suits me quite well .","282441":"i handle physical pain quite well , considering i have a high pain tolerance . i have several tattoos and only one of them really bothered me . emotional pain , not so well . i m naturally an extremely emotional person so i feel things much more deeply than some others , and when i m feeling negative emotions , i become fairly destructive .","282442":"thrillers and dramas , mostly . i also like fantasy sometimes , but i m a bit picky as to what i ll read .","282443":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company . i spend most of my time writing magazine articles , implementing revisions from clients , maintaining spreadsheets , and proofreading various written pieces of work . i enjoy it very much .","282444":"i ve been in love once before , and i m still in love with them , unfortunately . i suppose it s all part of the healing process .","282445":"i m not much of a picky eater at all , thankfully . i enjoy trying new things and i ll try almost anything at least once .","282446":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","282447":"yes , i have a very addictive personality , unfortunately . it s easy for me to become obsessive and or addicted to certain things .","282448":"most of my time is spent alone , haha . i usually end up playing video games , writing , reading , watching television , or sleeping .","282449":"i d hate being famous , particularly because i wouldn t want to be recognized while going out or anything like that .","282450":"k thx bai .","282451":"you can t blame chinese civilians for what has happened . the government should be taking responsibility . it has nothing to do with being a snowflake jeez , haven t heard that term in years , it s simply common sense .","282452":"i find that i look much better in pictures than irl , lmaoo . but id photographs are usually pretty terrible . my photograph for my passport is absolutely horrid .","282453":"no , i m not religious by any means . i was raised catholic , but i never believed in anything i was taught .","282454":"unfortunately , there are a lot of close minded individuals who are directing their anger at chinese people in general and wrongly discriminating against them for the coronavirus . i m sorry that you feel this way , the hatred towards chinese people is completely unjustified .","282455":"i like harry potter , but definitely not as much as i used to back in the day , haha . i used to attend midnight releases and everything for both the books and the movies . my hogwarts house is slytherin , according to pottermore , but i don t remember what my patronus was .","282456":"apparently it happened last night , so i guess i missed it , haha . i ve seen one meteor shower in my life it was absolutely beautiful .","282457":"my birthday is november th .","282458":"eggs , spinach , and pasta .","282459":"i ve actually never learned how to ride a bicycle , haha .","282460":"my longest relationship was nearly years .","282461":"i was born on long island in new york state . other than one year spent in massachusetts , i still live on long island .","282462":"no , i m just unhappy with the way it is currently .","282463":"i used to be a night owl years ago , but now i m an early bird more than anything else . i feel more accomplished when i wake up early in the morning and have the time to get things done .","282464":"no worries at all ! ! i love your spam . hope you have a great day too","282465":"at the moment , i m very unhappy with my hair , lol . i desperately need a shave and i want a few inches cut off the bottom . when salons are open again , i m going to see my friend and do a dark brown red balayage .","282466":"my clothes don t warrant fixing . if something is torn up enough to where it needs to be fixed , then i ll dispose of it .","282467":"no , i don t . i don t have an interest in learning how either .","282468":"it s dropping , but i think it ll come back up once everything levels out .","282469":"we just have stairs leading up to the front door .","282470":"this is true , but it doesn t devalue the importance of having love in one s life . most people require some kind of support system to keep pushing forward .","282471":"i don t get embarrassed easily in front of other people , especially my friends , lol .","282472":"drinking , smoking , sleeping , etc etc . these days , my coping mechanisms haven t been very healthy . the healthiest thing i do in order to cope with life stressors is vent to my friends .","282473":"i m say i m intelligent but obviously there s always more room for growth .","282474":"a bunch of nonsensical , illegal sh t when i was in my early s . most of it includes stealing traffic cones barrels . for no reason other than the fact that we wanted to see if we could .","282475":"i had to pay a summons years upon years ago , but i don t remember how much it was .","282476":"i m doing all right it s storming pretty bad outside rn , and i m enjoying the sounds of the rain hitting the window and thunder crashing .","282477":"no , i ve never pulled a fire alarm before .","282478":"no , i don t .","282479":"the sexually charged answers on your page proves otherwise .","282480":"no , i m experienced . i get questions about pantyhose every week this is no different . if you want to try to fool someone , then leave my page and target someone else .","282481":"i ve been on askfm long enough to know what a fetish question is compared to a regular question . the pantyhose question is one of the hallmark ones .","282482":"what on earth makes you think that fetish questions are tolerated on this page or on askfm in general .","282483":"not as often as i would like , tbh . i have a really bad habit of picking up a book , reading halfway through it , and then putting it down because something else caught my attention .","282484":"i make amazing egg sandwiches either scrambled or over easy . i usually make them on a toasted roll or a croissant with cheese and bacon , as well as salt and pepper .","282485":"yes , that s extremely selfish and also very rude . you should ideally be happy for your friend and congratulate them , giving them the time they need to celebrate , and then when it s appropriate , you can direct the conversation to something you re going through .","282486":"love , whether it s from family , friends , or a partner . having a support system is integral to wellness . something that fulfills them , whether it s a hobby or a profession that they love . we all need something in which to divulge that gives us new hope in life . spiritual nourishment . regardless of whether or not you re spiritual or religious in the standard sense , we all need a dream or hope or role model from which we derive inspiration .","282487":"it isn t something i would personally do , but to each his own . it probably would have been more productive to just make that point directly to your boss , find another job in the meantime , and then quit once you had the second job .","282488":"i shower every other day washing my hair twice per week , and i change my clothes every day .","282489":"both ! ! mostly positive these days .","282490":"abandonment by my loved ones , as well as enclosed spaces .","282491":"depends on the individual . some people prefer to keep anonymous on while others are more uncomfortable with it . i like having anonymous questions turned on because a large majority of my questions are asked anonymously people often ask for my advice while anonymous .","282492":"oh boy , hahah . i don t think there s anything expired in my fridge rn , except maybe a package of cold cuts from last week haven t checked the date though .","282493":"i ve been obsessed with true crime documentaries and videos in general , haha . it s all i ve been watching for the past few weeks .","282494":"i m working for the next . hours , and then i m probably going to clean for a little bit , do some laundry , and relax in front of the television .","282495":"mayonnaise , considering i absolutely hate it .","282496":"hello do you have a question ?","282497":"within our minds .","282498":"yes , it s always been relaxing to me to sit outside in the sunshine and soak up some rays . preferably if i m reading a book .","282499":"i m always riding on a sense of overdrive , so my automatic reaction is panic mode . it isn t very reliable .","282500":"no , not to my knowledge . i only ask questions to people i follow excluding backup accounts and no one has ever asked me to unfollow them .","282501":"i don t follow people on request .","282502":"it s technically an almond liqueur disaronno is a brand of amaretto . people sometimes mix it with sour mix , but i like drinking it on the rocks .","282503":"i m watching a movie drinking some disaronno . y all should ask me questions","282504":"it s affecting nearly everyone staying inside the house isn t ideal for a lot of people , and the whole pandemic atmosphere is incredibly scary and uncertain for many . not everyone has the luxury of staying home either , there are so many people who are essential workers who have to leave their homes and face the unknown every day . it can be extremely damaging for mental health .","282505":"i m sorry you re going through this with your friend . quarantine is making everyone do wild things they wouldn t normally do , and if your friend is drinking it will cause him to act out even more . i hope things work out in his favor and he s able to get the help he needs .","282506":"crazy is an archaic term used to describe mentally ill people , often in a derogatory fashion . please don t use it . some people may experience cabin fever , but it isn t the same thing as a mental illness . if people are feeling elevated levels of anxiety or depression , then that s unfortunately normal and semi expected during these times . we re in the middle of a global crisis .","282507":"no , you re not a bad person for thinking that . obviously the owner wasn t such a good person if they allowed such discriminatory behavior to happen in their business without giving people the proper repurcussions .","282508":"eh , i wouldn t say it s normal as much as it isn t uncommon . however , even if you do think you re developing feelings for someone on social media , you also have to keep in mind that they re only posting parts of themselves they re willing to share not their entire being . you re attracted to a version of them , one that may not be them as a whole , and you have to be careful that you re not filling in the blanks with a fantasy of who you think they are .","282509":"it depends , but most of the time , yes .","282510":"sweeney todd mainly because i know most of the songs by heart and can sing them in my head while the movie plays on mute .","282511":"yes , i believe so . some people just aren t interested in love or relationships .","282512":"i m indifferent to it , tbh . i like discussing it , but it gets to a point where people start fabricating their own stories about my breakup that causes me to become exhausted about talking about it . a lot of people can t seem to understand that a relationship can end naturally and civil .","282513":"i m doing well , but i m honestly tired . i don t think i slept too well last night , so i m probably going to call it an early night after i eat dinner .","282514":"friendship is natural it doesn t happen by choice or through force . i m not really interested in making new friends , at any rate .","282515":"there was an article posted on facebook about old educational video games from the s making a comeback on steam it made me really nostalgic ! ! i haven t thought about those games in probably over years .","282516":"i ve only ever been to one other country , so i m not entirely sure . i think it would suit me if i lived in england or australia , though .","282517":"no , you can only talk to me on askfm . all of my social media accounts are private and reserved for friends .","282518":"my routine hasn t changed much , thankfully , other than not going to stores as often . i ve been occupying my time with work , as well as cleaning , playing video games , watching television , sleeping , and i ve also been trying to read more and write creatively .","282519":"yeah , i have a private instagram account .","282520":"yes , i m single .","282521":"i m left handed . i m a full blooded scorpio . i never drink still water , only flavored sparking water . i graduated college in december with a bachelor s degree in communications and professional writing . i live with two really old , fat black white cats .","282522":"i think it would be fun to go camping with courtneyuwu and celinem ! !","282523":"no , i wish i did . i think the painting is beautiful .","282524":"giving someone the silent treatment is to intentionally ignore someone for periods of time with no intention of discussing the issue . giving space to collect your thoughts means to sorta give a time out on the discussion so both people can cool off and return to the conversation with fresh minds .","282525":"i m the ugly one in my family as well as my friend group .","282526":"taking some time to cool down isn t the same thing as giving someone the silent treatment . i believe it s best for people to have room to collect their thoughts and then discuss the situation .","282527":"no , i don t . like i said , i never looked at my family members that way because they re obviously family .","282528":"it sounds like a backhanded compliment , tbh . you could just simply tell that person that they re attractive , regardless of whether or not they wear makeup .","282529":"i think the silent treatment is extremely immature and counterproductive . it s much better and more productive to talk things out with others in order to come to a mutual understanding .","282530":"clocking out of work taking a nap in about . hours .","282531":"? ? ? he s my brother , lmaoo . i don t exactly see my family members as being handsome or ugly .","282532":"honestly , they re incredibly ignorant and misinformed . lifting the quarantine now will only cause an even worse , second wave of the coronavirus because a lot of regions are only seeing the peak of cases right now . new york has a re opening date of may th , but i m sure that s going to be pushed further because things aren t getting much better .","282533":"i honestly have no clue . we seldom talk .","282534":"shehitsback urlsareshittbh kittiemeowsie youcuntx astoldbyjoanna asgardarts psyquietrist dieselmom trivialtrinket courtneyuwu

information for the article i m writing , and half of the conversation between them was about tiger king , lmaoo .","282536":"the last person i saw was my roommate before he headed off to work .","282537":"i have one brother he s years old .","282538":"i don t have a big ego , no . i have an intense fear of certain people being angry with me so i have a tendency to always apologize , even if i m not wrong . it s something i ve been trying to work on and i ve steadily been getting better at it .","282539":"they never said their partner was a man . but having a big ego is common unfortunately , regardless of gender , so in that vein i do agree .","282540":"chester bennington .","282541":"i haven t done many physically exhausting things besides exercising , when i went to the gym and switched between different machines and whatnot . i used to have decent stamina , but now , not so much . lmaoo .","282542":"racism , sexism , homophobia , transphobia , ableism , etc etc . i truly hope the world can become more tolerant of people in upcoming years .","282543":"no , not really . i haven t taken a philosophy class since my sophomore year of college , which was

of extraterrestrial life .","282547":"i only own two stuffed animals at this point , haha . one is a minecraft pig and the other is some weird looking rainbow creature that makes weird noises when you squeeze it .","282548":"no , i just own a bookshelf with quite a number of books on them , haha .","282549":"i don t believe you re over thinking it at all that would bother me a lot too , tbh . admitting that you re wrong and apologizing is a major part of any relationship , romantic or platonic , and it doesn t make your partner any less of a person by admitting their mistakes . even though you said you tried talking to them about it and nothing changed , perhaps you can approach it from a different angle stating that you won t think any less of them if when they do apologize , your relationship with them will remain intact , and there s nothing wrong with admitting that they re wrong in some cases . as long as they re not adamant that they re right all the time , i think it s important to try to talk to them again and work through this issue . good luck ! !","282550":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","282551":"i had a toasted , buttered english muffin for breakfast . for lunch , i m eating vegetable soup right now .","282552":"i ve been working from home for hours per week , which has taken up a lot of my time . in my spare time , i play video games and watch television . i have also been cleaning a lot more frequently out of boredom , haha .","282553":"yeah , i wasn t a fan .","282554":"i m not a vip member , so no . i bought the vip program a few months ago just to try it out , but there was too much to do to keep the program so i allowed it to expire .","282555":"depends on my mood . there are some days i like coconut , while other days i m not so keen on the taste . then again , i ve never had an actual coconut before just coconut flavored things . i also dislike regular coconut water , even though it s supposed to be really healthy for you .","282556":"no , i don t use essential oils . i just light candles every so often .","282557":"yes , usually the most random answers that aren t necessarily good answers receive a lot of reaction usually from the russian or arab communities .","282558":"i like the shredded chicken tacos and their house margarita from a local taco place near me .","282559":"depends on my mood in that particular moment . i can be optimistic sometimes , but other times i m fairly pessimistic . however , most of the time i m a realist .","282560":"eh , yes and no . i have generalized anxiety disorder so i m usually anxious of the time , but i do find ways to relax sometimes usually through video games and sleeping these days .","282561":"i honestly don t remember . my feelings haven t been hurt in a while .","282562":"if you re bothered by it , then take it up with lyndsey this honestly has nothing to do with me , and the reason why the topic was brought up to begin with was to stir up drama that s been laying dormant for months .","282563":"? ? ?","282564":"there are gangs everywhere , from my understanding . but yes there are gangs in new york .","282565":"lol , yes . i honestly thought i was a programming wizard because i would personally edit all of the html to create the perfect page . my style was colorful , yet minimalistic .","282566":"it hasn t affected me whatsoever . isole i never talk outside of askfm and we don t have each other added on other social media . this obsession you have is weird , quite frankly . so any more inquiries about isole will be deleted .","282567":"no , i ve never owned a gun .","282568":"i sometimes draw paint , but not often . askfm is being temperamental and it won t allow me to post the picture of my most recent drawing , though .","282569":"i wish i was good at singing . i love singing , but i m absolutely terrible at it , haha . i wish i could have taken voice lessons when i was younger .","282570":"in high school , i enjoyed all of my english classes . i also took a forensics class which was very interesting .","282571":"that s why i consider it to be drama which it has already evolved into what i wanted to avoid , haha . we talked about the situation when it happened , and i did my part . there s not much else to be done , in my eyes , and bringing up the past won t change what happened so it s pretty useless to continue beating a dead horse . obviously your racism was wrong , which everyone agrees with , but the fact that anons are bringing it up again after remaining quiet for so long is silly .","282572":"video games ! ! i remember loving video games from when i was a child i still love them now . i m usually in the mood to play most days out of the week .","282573":"i never indicated it was okay . it s pretty much irrelevant to the current conversation and unnecessary . there s a time a place for everything , and when the situation initially happened , i made my thoughts known . bringing it up again randomly isn t going to change what happened , and i m not going to worry myself with what someone does or doesn t do . that s on them . there are more important things to worry about than what someone said over six months ago that has already been handled .","282574":"i mean , she isn t personally responsible for the current xenophobic atmosphere , rofl . but i understand what you mean . you could have simply said that there was already a presence of xenophobia in the community instead of calling attention to an incident on askfm .","282575":"it was drama because the situation has already been said done , lol . i had already spoken to lyndsey about her behavior months ago when the situation initially happened . to bring it back up again is beating a dead horse . there s no reason for it at this point , especially considering how long ago that was .","282576":"they brought up the discriminatory comment you made regarding chinese people a while ago . i don t remember what else they said , but i ended up deleting it because it s obvious intention was to start drama . i had already talked to you regarding why your statement was wrong back then , so i didn t think responding to their recent message was warranted .","282577":"it was a statement , not a question , and its obvious intention was to start drama stir the pot instead of being informative .","282578":"i used to be skin and bones i still hated it . i look back on photos from high school and only wish i looked like that again , but even back then i hated my body and did everything i could to destroy it .","282579":"androgynous my hair would remain the same , except obviously shaved as usual and probably a bit shorter on the other side since this length is a bit wild rn . completely flat chested and skinny , small thighs , toned , covered in tattoos from head to toe , etc etc . i know when i lose weight , my face won t be as chubby and my cheekbones will be more defined , which is another thing i m aiming for . i also wish i had a more defined jawline , but that would taken surgery i think .","282580":"i m stating that i experience dysphoria because of my breasts and thighs . if i was male , i would also probably experience dysphoria due to other secondary sex characteristics . it wouldn t matter regardless of which sex i was i would still be non binary and experience discomfort with my body because i have a certain image that i have for myself that would make me feel comfortable . you re right in that there are obvious stereotypes for men women , but denying basic biology is silly . it s factual that females grow breast tissue for feeding children and wider hips for birthing children . it isn t unreasonable for me to be uncomfortable with mine .","282581":"i agree . hence why i m non binary not a woman , lol . gender is much more complex than that .","282582":"i never said that was what made me non binary . me disliking my secondary sex characteristics is part of my gender dysphoria , yes , but there are some non binary individuals who do not experience dysphoria .","282583":"some males do , but obviously not all of them . it s also scientific fact that females have wider hips in order to accomodate birth .","282584":"females naturally have wider hips than males my thighs are a result of that . i didn t say that men didn t have thighs , i said i wasn t comfortable with my thighs .","282585":"uh . . . when did i say they didn t ? lmao .","282586":"my top ones are england , spain , italy , and greece .","282587":"eventually , yeah . i think that would be a fun experience , experiencing different cultures and whatnot .","282588":"here ya go","282589":"big mood .","282590":"honestly , the way this seems to be panning out , it s going to be just like the elections where people are going to vote for trump because they don t want to vote for biden just like how people didn t want to vote for hilary .","282591":"it does ! ! i had it without even having the intention of trying it , lol . my roommate said there was pizza left in the fridge so i saw it and was like , eh , why not . turned out pretty good .","282592":"lol . i can t stand nutella . i tried pineapple on pizza the other day , though , and i actually loved it . the sweetness was a great contrast to the taste of the sauce and cheese .","282593":"not very often at all i m always around resources where i can do things , like art or writing or reading or playing video games . i have a house that i can always clean and laundry to do . i m thankful that i m still working hours per week , so that takes up a majority of my time .","282594":"i m sorry to hear that . where i live , as long as it s before pm , you can still drive around even if you don t have a destination in mind . it s nice to get out of the house and go for a drive sometimes .","282595":"some activities write or journal . exercise or take a walk around the block . play video games or a board game . do some art drawing , painting , etc etc . watch something interesting on television . take a random drive . clean your room or the house . cook or bake something .","282596":"i d be happy for him . i already know he would be a terrific father because he s always been around kids and treated them wonderfully . i would definitely sit down with him and ask him if he thinks he sees a longstanding future with this woman , though .","282597":"it s been pretty boring . i woke up around am or so which is super late for me then made coffee breakfast . i ve just been sitting around on social media and talking to friends most of the day , and i also cleaned the kitchen . earlier in the afternoon , i did a face mask , waxed tweezed my facial hair , and cut my nails . now i m probably going to start thinking about what to make for dinner and crack open a beer .","282598":"most likely not , especially if they re resistant to being educated on the topic . i wouldn t feel comfortable being around someone who essentially claims that my existence is invalid or false .","282599":"again , it really depends on my mood certain things can make me lose my patience one day , while other days it s fine . people in general , though , make me lose my patience . intolerance , racism , homophobia transphobia , ableism , etc etc . i m also really impatient when i drive , haha .","282600":"depends on my mood , lmaoo . most days , i d say around a or . however , other days it s more of a or .","282601":"aw , this is super sweet . thank you so much","282602":"ugh , i totally agree i don t use tumblr anymore , but when i did , i would always see people using trans identities or sexual orientations or even mental illnesses as a trend , which is upsetting because people struggle so much with these things in real life . i don t see it much anymore then again i stopped using tumblr like years ago . but there s definitely a small percentage of people who are faking it just for clout .","282603":"no problem ! ! i apologize if i seemed a bit brash in certain responses , normally people attack me for my gender so i always think there s an underlying tone of contempt or discrimination in other people s messages .","282604":"gender is something of exploration , and it s valid for some people to discover that they re cis after all . it isn t returning to their senses , it s a re discovery of themselves and coming to terms with who they are . i ve known i wasn t a girl woman since i was a teenager . i just wasn t educated on trans identities or the terminology until i became an adult .","282605":"it isn t very important to me . i just have it in my bio so people know what my pronouns are .","282606":"well , they re not feelings in terms of your personality . it s independent of your personality . it s how you view yourself , your body in some cases , etc etc . personally speaking , i experience dysphoria . because i don t identify as a woman , i dislike the fact that i have breasts and thighs it makes me feel uncomfortable with myself because it doesn t fit my gender expression . if i could have top surgery when i lose like pounds , i would .","282607":"it isn t a bullsh t definition , it s the standard definition that corresponds with what non binary means . you don t identify with the standard feelings of what a woman is , neither do you identify with the standard feelings of what a man is . it varies for each individual , as well . some people feel both binaries at varying degrees i . e . genderfluid and others don t feel a gender at all i . e . agender . i used to think i was genderfluid until i came across the term non binary realized it suited me better .","282608":"they were popular for a hot minute when all the things she said came out , although it was mainly out of controversy because of the girl on girl action . that was my introduction to them , and then i went deeper into their discography .","282609":"i ve always loved t . a . t . u . , haha . their music was one of the first types of music i was interested in when i was a pre teen .","282610":"they may be inquisitive to a certain extent , but they re also being degrading and close minded in that they re not allowing themselves to be educated on gender identity . there s only so much questioning until it becomes circular questioning like a previous anon pointed out . at that point , it s tiresome .","282611":"gender identity is separate from gender expression . as shown in the chart and as i ve stated earlier , non binary is sorta the in between of the man and woman binaries . i m not going to really get in depth with this again because i ve already explained this at least once in this thread .","282612":"i already explained this , and i even offered a chart explaining this as well . there s only so much i can educate people on if they re not willing to open their minds to ideas that are foreign to them . i ve given you plenty of answers , facts , resources . it s ultimately up to you if you want to listen or not .","282613":"non binary is an identity in itself , as there are more options to gender than man and woman . sexual orientation is different from your gender identity your gender is who you are inside , while your orientation is who you re sexually and or romantically attracted to .","282614":"i thought i ve been explaining it quite well , but apparently not . it goes to show how little people are educated on trans identities , unfortunately . i found this chart that may be useful for them","282615":"non binary simply means that your gender is neither man nor woman hence the prefix non referring to the binaries of gender . it s a gender identity in itself , but it can also be used an an umbrella term to also mean identities like genderfluid , agender , etc etc .","282616":"as i ve said multiple times , i m non binary .","282617":"i don t remember the majority of my childhood up until the age of or so . however , i remember watching a lot of cartoon network and toonami . i like dragonball z and thundercats .","282618":"no , i don t the only online games i ll play are destiny and any of the halo games , which aren t mmos or anything . i usually dislike large multiplayer games .","282619":"uh , this makes zero sense . like i said earlier , gender and sex are completely different . i m not female with male characteristics , because that would insinuate that i have both male female secondary sex characteristics . i m not intersex . there s no problem with people being trans or non binary . it s something personal to them and has no effect on anyone else s life . to claim it s unacceptable is transphobic , to say the least .","282620":"the

, reading , writing , video games , cooking , baking , etc etc . i don t do it myself , but i found journaling to be helpful in the past as well .","282625":"yes ! ! i used to love them , haha

different ways of describing and explaining events , emotions , etc etc . , in a way that has never been described before . writing is a work of fine art , and it can be enjoyable to read writing that explains things in a way that is appealing to the audience . however , writing can also be a destructive process because you re literally purging yourself of your feelings and your energies in order to create that piece . it s like any art form of art , where you include a piece of yourself in that writing . it makes you vulnerable .","282631":"chester bennington has been the largest influence in my life , especially during my teenage years . he inspired me to keep moving forward when i was at the point of breaking , when i felt i had nothing left . he kept me going at my lowest points with his music , the videos i watched of his conversations with his bandmates and journalists , etc etc .","282632":"the amount that someone makes isn t important to me , but what is important is how they manage their money i . e . if they re poor then they re not spending their money on stuff like drugs . i m at the point in my life where if i do start dating , i would be more comfortable dating someone who is responsible with their money . i m not going to start dating just to randomly date people . i m going to be dating for the long term .","282633":"one of my ex s .","282634":"as long as they can make enough money to stay afloat in new york s economy , then it wouldn t bother me very much . for example , if they can pay rent and groceries for themselves . it shows a level of

itself is of any importance to me , no . their work ethic tells more about the person than anything else . if they don t care about their job or they don t put into their work , then that isn t very appealing to me .","282637":"no , i ve never had a crush on nyctometanoia .","282638":"i believe it depends on the individual . everyone has their own concept of what their reputation is , and it isn

line of people behind me i have no other method of payment , haha .","282643":"anything really , as long as i m well versed in that subject . i enjoy talking about writing , literature , video games ,

boy upon birth based upon that sex . you re also excluding the existence of intersex people who don t have the same chromosomes as males or females . gender is unique and different to each person , and even though someone is assigned a girl or a boy at birth , that doesn t mean that they ll grow up to feel attached to that gender identity . there are a plethora of people whose gender does not fit into the binaries of man and woman .","282650":"no , not always . i can be pretty impatient too .","282651":"i don t have much of an ego or sense of pride , unless it s pride in my professional work . i m kind to a certain degree but i don t allow that kindness to make myself vulnerable .","282652":"gender identity isn t correlated with personality . additionally , the study of gender is a science congruent to disciplines such as sociology and cultural anthropology . genders other than man and woman have been evident for centuries . non binary is a trans identity , because i am not my assigned gender at birth . also , the idea of androgyny has nothing to do with gender either androgyny is a physical expression of oneself through things like hair , makeup , clothing , etc etc . the idea of trans identities hasn t been invented , and it certainly is not a contemporary subject . it s simply talked about more now because it s become safer and more acceptable for people to come out as trans .","282653":"not really , no . then again , i get deliveries from local food restaurants through apps like doordash grubhub , so there are a lot of drivers who are subscribed to the service

exciting and keep the person mesmerized in a marriage to avoid the spark dying out or being too boring like in everyday life . i have bpd untreated atm so i get crazily attached to people and since of marriages end in divorce , i don t think it d be able to handle starting all over because i don t do well with significant life changes . do you have any advice ? i don t wanna be stuck feeling like this for years and years . thank you . first off , i m sorry it s taken me so long to get to this . i ve been wanting to answer this on my laptop because it was in three parts , just for ease of access . i understand how you feel significant life changes frighten me to a certain degree as well , especially in terms of relationships . my breakup with my ex devastated me , and i m still recovering from it even though it s been multiple months . you re years old , so you re still incredibly young and will grow a lot throughout your s , whether you believe that or not . everything will eventually fall into place , and i find it s best to not have any expectations at all . when things should happen , they ll happen and i always just tried to roll with it and see where things go . the reason why half of marriages end in divorce these days isn t because of a lack of compatibility , but it s because people simply aren t putting up with their spouse s sh t anymore . back in the day , people especially women endured ab se from their partner , while today it s more accepted for those women to leave those relationships . if you re with the right person , that natural spark won t die out completely . you may become comfortable with each other , but you will both still have fun together , and you have to remember that your partner should also be your closest , best friend as well .

obligations .","282917":"yeah , it s always been extremely difficult for me to change up my habits and create better coping mechanisms out of destructive habits . one bad habit i ve overcome is self h

and yelling for the rangers , lol .","282933":"i admit i don t know much about hockey besides what my ex taught me , lol . he has played hockey for basically his entire life and took me to my first game , which was a rangers vs islanders game .","282934":"my ex made me one of those love books that you can customize online to make the characters look like you . you can add in pages with your own

owners , lawyers , stock brokers , and other wealthy professionals not the average man .","282968":"there are theories that the government in china released the virus as a means of population control , theories that korea actually infiltrated china and released the virus as biological warfare , theories that the east wanted to ship the virus to the united states also as a means of biological warfare . there are people who believe that this is a man made virus , even though the coronavirus itself has been around a long time , this is just a different strain hence why it s called covid . there s a long list .","282969":"no , i just think it s a global pandemic that has gotten completely out of hand because people don t want to listen to medical professionals and maintain self isolation in order to reduce the spread of the virus .","282970":"thanks , my day has been relatively uneventful . i just answered questions on askfm earlier this morning on my laptop , made breakfast

destroyed because of heroin whether they were the user or someone close to them .","282973":"i think it would be interesting to offer different reactions to answers , much like how facebook has

well . it s always fun to be outside during the spring and summer , grill some burgers , sit around a campfire , and have a few drinks .","282980":"are you talking about the character in the show or the author herself ? either way , the answer is no . the author s writing is good , but it isn t unbelievably great or anything her ability to tell a story is compelling , though and i give her credit for that . she s been recognized by stephen king for her books .","282981":"it s pretty much the story of a man living in new york city , and he becomes obsessed with a woman and devises ways to run into her , when really he s stalking her . it goes into his back story and why he perhaps feels these things , and he goes to desperate means to please this woman , including m rder . i love it because it s thrilling and suspenseful , and i love anything having to do with m rder and the complications of relationships .","282982":"i absolutely love the series , so much to the point where i bought both you and hidden bodies by the author caroline kepnes . i read halfway through you , since it s the first in the series , and it s even more compelling that the television show

reminds me of myself from perhaps years ago when i was a bit more risk taking and lively . she s impulsive , full of life and love and underlying anger with trauma from earlier in her life . she s drinks and smokes , and has a f ck it all attitude that propels her forward in life . she has issues with abandonment and goes to desperate lengths to feel wanted and needed . as a result of her trauma , she s learned not to trust in anyone and is convinced that no one truly cares about her . there have been theories that chloe has borderline personality disorder , which obviously resonates with me considering i struggle with the same diagnosis . she s obviously suffered from depression s icidal thoughts throughout her life as well .","282986":"it s funny , because i m not religious but i love any sort of literary quotes related to biblical themes or the devil . so with this in mind , i do love this sentence and find it to be quite fulfilling .","282987":"depends on who the subject in question is , lol . i would be fine with someone loving me if they were a genuinely nice , loyal , and mature person with some sort of semblance of intelligence . however , if they weren t any of those things then i would feel uncomfortable with them loving me , particularly if i didn t return the feelings . loving someone , on the other hand , may be heartbreaking if the person doesn t love you in return .","282988":"i d rather be given the chance to visit different countries . traveling extensively has always been on my bucket list , and it would be interesting to learn about all of the

temperature is degrees fahrenheit .","282992":"i ve met the members of linkin park once back when i was around years old i think it was in . i ve also met barbara dunkelman and griffin ramsey , back when griffin was a part of rooster teeth .","282993":"no , i have no interest in making new friends at the moment .","282994":"when i was in high school , my favorite subject was always english . i took ap literature , as well as ap grammar rhetoric i think those were the names of the classes . i gained college credits after passing the ap examinations . when i went to college , i first majored in creative writing and then after i transferred schools , i majored in communications and professional writing .","282995":"either or depends on what sort of inspiration hits me . i believe it would be best for me to write a fictional novel with a lot of aspects that resonate with my own life , drawing upon my own personal experiences while putting a fictional flare on them .","282996":"yes , definitely ! ! that sounds like fun . a lot of my friends on instagram do the same thing , but i never tried because i know i would forget every day , lmaoo .","282997":"nah , that is not in anyone s

.","283008":"i eat fruits vegetables often . and i drink water most of the day . tbh , it s probably all stress related .","283009":"i would have to be put in that situation in order for me to really know how i d react to it , tbh .","283010":"because i wake up exhausted regardless of how much i sleep , which probably isn t healthy . i ve felt fine in the past but as i ve gotten older , i ve experienced fatigue more more oftenc .","283011":"i only ever have energy when i drink a red bull , lmaoo .","283012":"i grew up on long island i still live here , just in a different town from where i was born .","283013":"i m fatigued , so i m sure some of that fatigue is as a result of feeling too compassionate or passionate about something in my life , lol .","283014":"my biggest strength out of those listed is compassion . i have immense compassion for others , especially those who struggle with mental health conditions and other disabilities , and i ve tried to be an advocate for those who have no voice and for illnesses that are greatly misunderstood .","283015":"i m not entirely sure , but i m assuming it s because of the lack of resources available in order to treat everyone who shows symptoms and or are formally diagnosed with the coronavirus . there are too many people not enough supplies or personnel .","283016":"anger affects me the most i get angry pretty easily at things that might even be insignificant , and it s something i m trying to continually work on , even though i m not in therapy anymore . granted the reasons why i get angry are warranted , but my immediate response to that anger is self destructive at worst .","283017":"hello do you have a question ?","283018":"thank you , i genuinely appreciate it . as you know , there are both good and bad days .","283019":"definitely . my drunken routine is to get tipsy enough to listen to music and then cry along to his songs .","283020":"it s been . . . i m not sure if it s hurting or helping me through my breakup , lmaoo . either way , i cry every time i hear it .","283021":"someone you loved by lewis capaldi always makes me cry . https youtu . be zablecsr ue","283022":"i ve read somewhere that it s actually a naturally occurring phenomenon within the brain , where our synapses fire wrongly and makes us believe things have happened already when they really haven t . in that case , then i believe it s just coincidence and a medieval anomoly .","283023":"i m free to a certain degree , but not completely . i thought that by moving out , i would be free of my toxic family but they re still contacting me every day nearly making me feel terrible .","283024":"oh . who cares , then ? there s nothing wrong with being feminine , and the assertion that men must be masculine hardened is an example of toxic hypermasculinity .","283025":"you mean you re trans ?","283026":"? ? ? hope you re doing well too , friend ! !","283027":"this makes no sense , but okay . if you like someone , just tell them flat out . there s no use in sugarcoating or stepping around your feelings . if she rejects you , then you ll at least have closure and a chance to move on .","283028":"of course it doesn t affect me by any means , so why wouldn t i be welcoming ?","283029":"it doesn t make much of a difference to me . i brush my hair every day , otherwise it ll become a tangled and knotty mess

completely separate entities .","283038":"no , bisexual is a sexual orientation , non binary is a gender .","283039":"i just said that i m non binary , lol .","283040":"basically , the binary genders are man and woman . non binary means that your gender is not man or woman . some people describe non binary as a umbrella term for other genders such as agender , genderfluid , etc etc . , but i ve simply always preferred non binary .","283041":"i m against hunting , so i would not feel comfortable or confident in doing that .","283042":"it s a long story that i ve already told so many times on askfm , lmaoo . basically , things didn t work out between us our relationship was stagnant despite trying to work on it and improve it for a long time . we weren t progressing anywhere and we sorta just grew apart from one another .","283043":"yeah , i have a bad habit of picking at my skin . i also drink alcohol and vape .","283044":"uh , i m not quite sure i understand what you mean
