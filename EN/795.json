People have their reasons why it's okay for them and others why they don't like it. Either way, it seemed to shock you, in which I recommend talking to him about. Ask questions, after all, he's not only your boyfriend, but his own separate person who thinks, behaves, etc, differently than you. If you have Q's, ask him. However, you must also accept that this might lead into other discussions about other parts of the relationship. Accept many alternate outcomes before jumping into a topic that *can* get dramatic. I don't know how long you both have been together, but what I do know is that the sooner you express your feelings the better. You don't wanna be sitting in them. Now, you might get a response back from someone accusing you of being insecure, as porn in relationships is such a personal thing. Sometimes yes, it is because the person is insecure, but other times, just like anything else, it's just because you don't like it. Your moral or values go against it and that's okay. It's all okay. But nothing will happen if you don't make things happen. Sit with how you feel before you talk to him. How important is this to me? How am I going to react if he has a bad reaction?
