affect the masses . my coworker brought it up briefly in conversation today . i ll have to look into it more .","285834":"napoleon dynamite came out when i was in high school i think , and everyone raved about how hilarious it was . when i watched it , i didn t see the big deal and thought it was an awful movie .","285835":"i prefer psychological thrillers or anything that has to do with mental health mental illness , as well as art and romance . my favorite books are girl interrupted by susanna kaysen . the gargoyle by andrew davidson . the secret history by donna tartt . the shining by stephen king . interview with a vampire by anne rice . american psycho by bret easton ellis . echo by francesca lia block .","285836":"childish gambino is the first artist who comes to mind . i love his music .","285837":"almost every morning , lol . my jaw isn t really aligned well , so i tend to sleep with my mouth open , which causes me to drool .","285838":"music is one of the strongest things that makes me feel super nostalgic for the past , especially in terms of early s emo alternative rock songs .","285839":"i was a straight a student in high school , and i took multiple ap classes which earned me college credits . in college , i obtained high marks as well , and i graduated magna cum laude second highest level of distinction with a college degree .","285840":"i honestly don t know half of these , lmaoo . zodiac sign scorpio . mbti personality type infj . hogwarts house slytherin . i mean . . . i guess they represent me , somewhat ? my personality is forever changing , but there are some key points of each thing that resonate within me .","285841":"plenty of movies have made me cry , haha . i think the most poignant one was les miserables , though . it s my go to film when i feel the need to release through crying excessively .","285842":"i like homemade vegetable soup , as well as broccoli cheddar soup , tomato basil soup , and potato soup . as for other dishes , i enjoy sushi , healthy burrito bowls , basically any kind of pasta , and any sort of breakfast food except waffles and pancakes , ugh .","285843":"i express myself much better , much more easily , online than irl . i m not good at verbally expressing my feelings or even explaining situations , which is why i m so drawn to social media and the internet in general . they provide me with an outlet where i can express myself . otherwise , i think my personality , or lack thereof , is the same . i become attached to online friends just as i become attached to irl friends all the same .","285844":"i don t see forgiveness within me for quite a long , long time .","285845":"i don t take baths . i shower every other day , though .","285846":"yes , i use twitter . my account is private

this candace ? lol . either way , you re welcome .","285850":"i wholeheartedly agree . most people , i ve learned , will refuse to understand what others have been through because it s something they cannot fathom themselves and therefore , they reject the notion completely . your feelings are totally valid , though . it s perfectly common and normal to be triggered by certain songs associated with bad memories .","285851":"i enjoy following misphire and psyquietrist ! ! they re both incredibly sweet , caring , selfless , and thoughtful individuals with their own individual senses of creativity . i ve always enjoyed reading answers to their questions , and i believe that their dedication to their sons is remarkable . i also have them both added on other social media and have loved watching their progress over the years .","285852":"nah , i don t believe you re being too sensitive . i would have reacted in the same manner . if someone isn t putting out the same effort as you are , and they re not even considering you when making plans anymore , then that s something that either needs to be addressed or cut off completely . i ve never had an issue with cutting people off , though . but that s just me , lol .","285853":"neither . music doesn t trigger me because music has always been a comfort in my life , and if anything , the music i listened to during my darkest days have become comfort songs to me in my adult life . i also don t think it s ridiculous for people to be triggered by songs , though . music conjures strong memories and it s very normal and common for others to be triggered by music .","285854":"personally , i would allow some time for your friend to cool off and go back into a steady mindset before bringing the topic up again . people need space , and sometimes that space allows for greater thoughts into the subject . at that point , i believe it s appropriate for you to reach out whether by text , or even better , in person after that waiting period to explain what you meant and that you didn t intend to upset them . you acknowledge that you upset them and you apologize for it coming to that point , but it was a misunderstanding and you want to correct the wrongs .","285855":"i think it depends on what you re buying , whether or not you re getting sale items or store brand items , etc etc . there are also discounted stores like aldi or lidl that offer healthy products for a cheaper price . i do think it says something about america that unhealthy fast food costs so much less than buying a salad for example .","285856":"i absolutely love going to concerts and other various shows . the last big concert i went to was to see ajr , mike shinoda , death cab for cutie , florence and the machine , and muse at the barclays center in brooklyn over a year ago . however , i recently saw a few friends play a local gig two weeks ago .","285857":"i agree wholeheartedly . i was raised in an environment where there wasn t much privacy at all i didn t even have a bedroom door , for gods sake . when i wrote in journals , my parents would find the journals and read them . it s the main reason why i resorted to the internet it was a way for me to document and discuss my feelings , particularly with others , without my parents finding out because the internet history had disappeared by the time they had checked the computer when i had gone to bed .","285858":"it always makes me happy when clients email me to tell me that my team did a great job with their product , whether it was the design or the writing itself . it makes all of the other angry emails seem worthless , haha . i didn t get much feedback from anyone when i worked in retail , but my boyfriend has a letter from a customer hanging on his fridge at his house . it was about two paragraphs long , explaining how thorough and helpful of a manager he is and how he has made her experience at the store worthwhile and fulfilling . it was ridiculously sweet .","285859":"my graduating class was rowdy , to say the very least . instead of pulling normal senior pranks , my graduating class well , only a select people ended up vandalizing the building , spraypainting employee cars , and slashing the security guards tires .","285860":"well , it isn t really a matter of him being allowed to or not . if he consumes sugar , he just has to maintain his insulin levels and watch them closely . regardless , he uses artificial sugar in his coffee and whatnot . it doesn t prevent him from eating junk food , though .","285861":"probably at some point or another . i took or philosophy classes , including a mandatory ethics class when i was a sophomore in college .","285862":"i don t use any of those messaging services . the only ways i message people are through facebook messenger or texting .","285863":"i ve collected some stickers over the years , which i ve placed on my laptop , haha . most of them are stickers of artwork from a close friend of mine who sells his work as a side gig .","285864":"my boyfriend has type diabetes .","285865":"haha , yeah . i never checked the history in the morning before school , but every night i would erase virtually everything . i wasn t on forbidden websites or anything , but i talked a lot to people on internet forums and art websites i . e . deviantart , and i revealed a lot of personal information on there regarding my life that would have gotten me into greater trouble with my parents .","285866":"yes , i believe that s very rude . you should be happy for your friend and their circumstances , and even if you re preoccupied by something enough to the point where you cannot feel that level of excitement for them , i think it would be rude to dismiss their feelings completely .","285867":"absolutely regular physical activity is beneficial for nearly everyone , sans those with conditions that may prevent them from exercising .","285868":"i think it depends on the child themselves , and what the level of supervision would be . every child is different , so it would be incorrect to place a universal yes or no answer to such a question . i was largely unsupervised when it came to my internet access as a teenager , but i do took great strides in erasing my browsing history and cookies every night .","285869":"i honestly don t remember most of them . however , with my current job , we had a client who we eventually dropped who told a sales representative that he wrote a book . our editorial department researched the book to get a better understanding of the client s history , and it was all about how he had a psychotic breakdown and m rdered his wife and children . . . . needless to say , my company didn t want to represent someone who k lled someone else . it was certainly strange . we ve also had clients who have claimed to have been touched by god , spoken to the angels , supercharged by the divine , etc etc .","285870":"i ve heard of the show , but i ve never watched it before .","285871":"i hope all is well with you too ! ! today was somewhat of a stressful day , but also productive . i came home from work to find out my roommate is sick with pneumonia , so i wiped down every single surface of the house and lysol d the sh t out of every room . i cannot afford to get sick right now .","285872":"i m indifferent to valentine s day . ideally , you should be valuing and appreciating your partner on a regular basis , not just on a very specific commercialized holiday that profits off of people s love or lust for one another .","285873":"i ve never had strange jobs in themselves , but i ve most definitely had strange customers and clients . back when i worked in a retail environment , i encountered unusual people every day . it got to a point where it wasn t surprising anymore .","285874":"regardless of a person s gender , i generally notice a person s height , hair , and smile first .","285875":"besides my own , the last house i went to was my parents house .","285876":"yes , baroque architecture is absolutely beautiful . i just looked up some examples online , and the attention to detail and complexities of design are astounding .","285877":"yes , i have a tendency to stress out a lot over various situations , ranging from significant issues to not so significant issues .","285878":"not only is it unprofessional , but it goes against hipaa confidential rules .","285879":"i don t really think it s a matter of luck i ve just always taken care of my hair throughout the years . i ve always gone to professional salons to get it done , i don t use heat on my hair , i condition it regularly , i use color safe shampoos and conditioners , etc etc .","285880":"i m confused as to how to navigate through a particular project at work that i encountered today . recently , i switched up how the program works to streamline it more efficiently with both the editorial department and graphic design department , so i need to really sit down and think about how to best approach the situation .","285881":"no , i don t like milky way bars . i m not a huge fan of candy or chocolate to begin with .","285882":"yes , it did ! ! comparing my current photo to the previous photo i took for my job s magazine a few months ago , it s grown at least two inches .","285883":"i have a twitch account , but i don t stream anything on there . i m only on there to watch my friends streams , haha . i don t even know what my username is at this point .","285884":"i rarely eat doritos , but i do like them . my favorite are the cool ranch doritos .","285885":"i seldom wear shorts unless i absolutely have to during the summer .","285886":"whenever my friends and i go out , we frequent one specific local bar down in town . we ve been going there ever since we turned , haha .","285887":"my instagram is private , and i only accept follow requests from people i know and have spoken to extensively .","285888":"i don t get my nails done , and i believe the last time i got a manicure was perhaps two years ago .","285889":"they haven t been right in my face , but i ve woken up plenty of times to one of the cats screaming at me , jumping up on my windowsill , trotting all over my bed , etc etc .","285890":"i much prefer autumn over the spring the chilly weather soothes me , i love the seasonal food and drinks , i love being cozy in boots and sweaters , and the colors on the trees are beautiful .","285891":"aw , this is so sweet to come home to . thank you so much","285892":"yes , i studied the bible when i was much younger . i took religion classes as a child .","285893":"i haven t been to the beach in like two years , lmaoo .","285894":"put my lunch bag away , take off my jacket , and take my medication .","285895":"i prefer the beach over the pool . i ve never been a fan of pools , especially if there are other people in them .","285896":"nah , i ve never even heard of that place before , lol .","285897":"i ve been to a bunch of different shops .","285898":"not usually , no . i tend to fall asleep between pm and am .","285899":"being paid less than other workers , and just the general atmosphere of the work environment might be more hostile for people of color , especially if it s a field dominated by white people . people of color have struggled to fit into certain workplace environments simply do to their race and feel the need to work harder just because they re not given the same respect .","285900":"hello i m all right . i m watching netflix thinking about going to bed soon .","285901":"i disagree . people of other races are discriminated against even in the workplace .","285902":"yes , white privilege is most definitely real . people from other races get k lled or imprisoned for things that would only get white people a slap on the wrist or a fine .","285903":"when you perform an activity for someone out of fear , it s because you re focusing on the possible repercussions of your actions . you re more focused on doing things correctly to that other person s standards . when you perform an activity for someone out of respect , you re focusing on how to better the activity for everyone involved , whether it s just you , you and your boss , or you and an entire team . there s a sense of comradery that exists because everyone is working towards the same goal .","285904":"i honestly can t think of a single good thing that happened in january , lmaoo . january was horrible for a lot of people , and i struggled with various things throughout the course of the month . however , february is looking much brighter . i have the cruise in a few weeks , which i m very much looking forward to . to not be at work for days in a row and not have any obligations or responsibilities is amazing .","285905":"i don t really pay much attention to celebrities , but i love helena bonham carter and johnny depp .","285906":"i disagree to an extent . i do believe that people can change in some circumstances , but it requires a lot of self actualization and a willingness to change their ways . not many people can actually do that .","285907":"i think it s alarming , but mostly for the people in china who have been struggling with the virus most of all . in other countries , however , the common flu is one of the deadliest it s been in ages , and i think that s largely due to its mutation over the years , as well as the lack of care people put in to not washing their hands , not vaccinating themselves and their children , etc etc . the coronavirus has also led to a lot of racism there are so many people who are being racist towards chinese people for absolutely no reason , and it s disgusting .","285908":"lying , manipulation , emotional or physical ab se , cheating , etc etc . i value loyalty and communication among my friends and relationships , and if you do something that goes behind my back or is incredibly dishonest to me , then that s a deal breaker and i have no issue with dropping the person completely .","285909":"my boyfriend is the most talented person i know . he s an incredibly hard worker and puts into his job every day , and as a result of that , he s become extremely knowledgeable of the work he deals with everything , as well as the industry in general . outside of that , he s a terrific writer and artist , and he is also very handy when it comes to carpentry , plumbing , and fixing machines and engines .","285910":"i don t really feel much disappointment instead , i feel anger . the last time i was angry was at one of my coworkers who undermined my authority as well as the authority of both of our superiors because of something they personally didn t want to do . it eventually went to upper management , and an email was sent out regarding a broad , overall topic related to similar events . i knew it was directed toward my dilemma in particular , but it was a generalized statement that could apply to anyone .","285911":"gang violence and the heroin epidemic are two of the biggest dilemmas that my community faces . i don t really know how to personally lesson the struggle besides raising awareness of the dangers of drug ab se in general , especially considering heroin is one of the most lethal drugs out there , as well as the cheapest .","285912":"tbh , i don t know much about s fashion and i ve never been to any events where people dressed up like they were in the s .","285913":"i love mood boards , particularly dark morbid ones .","285914":"for one , i think it s unhealthy and very unfair . standing for extremely long periods of time can cause detrimental damage to your body especially considering people whose jobs consist of standing are usually in those positions for hours . second , i think it s ableist . there are people with medical conditions who cannot stand for that long amount of time , who also cannot afford to go see a doctor to obtain a doctor s note . health care alone in this country is a privilege , not a right , and so many people go untreated for a variety of maladies because they simply cannot afford it .","285915":"i would like people to remember me as a caring advocate for mental health awareness and social justice , as well as a dependable and loyal friend . i want to be known for my writing as well , my means of self expression that also serves as a source of comfort for those who have struggled with the same things i ve struggled with .","285916":"my parents . they ve caused me long term , substantial trauma since childhood and have completely altered my way of thinking , my behavior , my mental illnesses , etc etc .","285917":"i don t rebel against authority anymore , no . i was a complete rebel back in my early s , but considering i m years old now , i ve calmed down a lot since then .","285918":"no , i m definitely not a nagger or a whiner . in general , i dislike putting my own problems on other people s minds because i feel as if my own issues are meaningless and insignificant , so i don t generally reach out unless i m at my wit s end .","285919":"the most likely scenarios are me dying in my own house or at a car wreck .","285920":"hybrid theory by linkin park . core by stone temple pilots . issues by korn . post traumatic by mike shinoda . cardboard castles by watsky .","285921":"i don t have a photo of it , but it s a long sleeved , flowy tunic with lace all across the front .","285922":"relax after work , lmaoo . i get home around pm , and then i have to prepare my medication , eat dinner , take a shower , do whatever household chores need to be done , etc etc . i would love to go home and just do whatever i want to do for a few hours , which results in me staying up super late to catch up on me time when all of my responsibilities are done .","285923":"i normally like freshly prepared pizza with fresh mozzarella , red sauce , cherry tomatoes , basil , and olive oil .","285924":"i watched sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street on netflix the other night . it s one of my all time favorite movies .","285925":"apparently , the root cause of coronavirus was the spillover of the virus from animals to humans , linked by the seafood and animal market in wuhan , china . once it spread to a few workers , the virus multiplied and is now the epidemic we know it as today .","285926":"i don t normally play pc games , but i do have goat simulator and the sims downloaded on my laptop .","285927":"i use a samsung galaxy s . i just got it in september , and it s a pretty good phone . the camera is beautiful .","285928":"peanut butter jelly sandwiches . it disgusts me .","285929":"i prefer it closed . mainly so that the cats don t crawl in there and get stuck , or if they re hiding in there unbeknownst to me and i accidentally close the door on them . lmao .","285930":"surprisingly , i ve never tried sake but i ve always been curious about it .","285931":"nah , i haven t filed my taxes yet . i only got my w last week , and i haven t been bothered to file them yet i m also terrified , because my freelance work as an independent contractor was untaxed , so no doubt i ll be paying back for it .","285932":"my weekend was super busy , actually . i went to my parents house and cleaned out the entire attic , went through at least boxes of old things , and organized threw out donated things . i think we only have maybe storage totes after we were finished . after we cleaned the attic , i cleaned my parents house . that was split up into two days saturday and sunday . when i got home sunday evening , i heated up some pizza and drank some beer , i did the dishes , i showered , and i put on fresh pajamas . then i watched criminal minds for the rest of the night , lol .","285933":"no , i don t drink decaf coffee . it doesn t serve its purpose i . e . caffeine , and it also tastes gross to me .","285934":"i would love your spam ! ! i m getting my photo taken for the new edition of my job s magazine tomorrow morning , i m nervous af . i have to wake up extra early to do makeup , lmaoo .","285935":"considering i use askfm , evidently i talk to strangers every day .","285936":"i live on long island .","285937":"i make them sunday night for monday through thursday and i usually go grocery shopping saturday or sunday evenings . the bread is fine for that long .","285938":"i was addicted to self harm for eight years . i also developed somewhat of a dependency on alcohol a few years ago , but i ve limited my intake over the past year and definitely ever since i moved into the new house . when i was in college , i also smoked marijuana every day .","285939":"yes , what i ve done to people is unforgivable .","285940":"oops , i meant to say strict skincare routine . otherwise , you re correct . it s something i try to do after every shower and i also use argan oil in my hair , but that s something totally different .","285941":"this is true perhaps something like amaretto would be good too , considering it s considered a dessert liqueur ? when you or whoever the other anon was said booze , i automatically jumped to , like . . . vodka or tequila , lmaoo .","285942":"i ve never had it before , but it looks delicious .","285943":"i didn t watch the superbowl , so i didn t see their performance .","285944":"everyone calls me by leigh .","285945":"no , i don t really have a skincare routine . i just use an exfoliating scrub in the shower and a nourishing lotion after the shower . sometimes i ll use rosewater toner , as well .","285946":"my boyfriend is friends with a few of his exes , and there s nothing wrong with that as long as no feelings exist and the feeling of friendship is mutual . my ex is currently my best friend , lol .","285947":"i don t really think that should constitute as a holiday .","285948":"uh , why would it be ? lmaoo . it s just a sporting event . there s nothing special about it .","285949":"yeah , during the weekdays i have my alarm set for am .","285950":"thanks for the follow","285951":"i don t have cable and don t generally watch the superbowl anyway , so i didn t bother watching it . i ve been watching criminal minds all night .","285952":"fun story the sewage backed up at my place of work when i worked in retail , and instead of sending everyone home , the store was kept open even though sewage was creeping up through the carpeted floor and it smelled of literal sh t . it was absolutely disgusting .","285953":"i ve never attended one before , but they look like a lot of fun ! ! i would love to take part in one and dress like a renaissance person .","285954":"to make an impact on others with my personal writing , and to eventually publish a novel or a book of poetry .","285955":"snowy owls are my favorite .","285956":"i ve never entered competitions before , but i think i would win at drinking the most amount of coffee in one consecutive sitting as well as in procrastination when it comes to my own personal writing . lmaoo .","285957":"one of my old high school teachers was very hot cold towards his students . some days , he would come in a great mood and sing to us , while other days he would yell at everyone in a frenzy and it was totally inconsistent . you never knew what you would receive in a professional setting and it was unnerving .","285958":"my roommate is sick again . if i get sick , i m gonna be so f cking angry .","285959":"misphire is another one of my greatest friends from askfm . but the question said to choose just one , and because of a recent conversation morgan and i had , she was the first to come to mind .","285960":"i prefer to blend in . i don t like attention from people i don t know , and i m more introverted than anything else .","285961":"littlesha is one of my closest friends whom i ve met on askfm .","285962":"idk , i ve never had a popeye s sandwich before .","285963":"i like moderately spicy foods , nothing too hot or anything because it has the tendency to irritate me physically . i like spicy chicken sandwiches and general tso s chicken from the chinese food place .","285964":"littlesha morgan , i admire your strength in the face of adversity and everything you ve struggled with during your life . you ve had your down periods , but you always persevere despite them and have so much determination to make life better for yourself and your family . i appreciate you reaching out to me when you ve seen that i ve been down too , and your willingness to understand me and support me through my own struggles .","285965":"depends on my mood at the moment . if i want to really sit down and have a deep conversation with someone , as well as relax , then i ll go on a coffee tea date . if i ve had a particularly stressful day , then i ll go out for alcoholic drinks with a friend or two . light hearted conversations and bonding with the bartenders .","285966":"yeah , i have a few pairs of ripped jeans .","285967":"yeah , i believe johnny depp especially considering amber actually admitted to the ab se , from what i ve heard . there s picture evidence and whatnot , as well .","285968":"my sunday has been all right . i slept in until noon , had some breakfast and a few cups of coffee , and then went to my parents house to clean out the attic . i just got home and i m sitting down for a while before showering , making dinner , and preparing lunches for the week .","285969":"not sure , i only just got home . i m thinking about making spinach raviolis later .","285970":"reading a book surrounded by nature seems most tranquil to me .","285971":"that sounds disgusting , lol .","285972":"i haven t talked to them in years , and i m not looking for forgiveness . i shouldn t be forgiven for what i ve done to people , anyway .","285973":"my parents constantly badgering me , haha . as well as being at work i ll be off from work for days straight .","285974":"yes , i do .","285975":"it wouldn t surprise me . cruises are vacations for people , and people have a tendency to indulge in things they wouldn t normally indulge in because they re on vacation .","285976":"i usually make sandwiches with different cold cuts .","285977":"there are perhaps one or two people in my office who overload on the body scents , but i would much prefer that over body odor , lmaoo .","285978":"taking on more opportunities and delving outside of my comfort zone to do things i haven t done before . i want to focus more on artistic endeavors , such as my writing and painting and drawing , as well as read more often .","285979":"i m currently listening to this harry potter music ambience video about hogwarts https www . youtube . com watch ? v aeeuvodky w","285980":"i would much , much rather move to another country permanently and not be able to return to the united states . the other option honestly sounds terrible , lol . i like being home , but to only be able to leave home for a maximum of three hours at a time sounds horrific .","285981":"sundays are normally a day of relaxation for me at home while i do whatever household chores i need to do and prepare for the start of the work week . sometimes i ll do a load or two of laundry , clean a little bit , and do some food prep for lunches for the rest of the week . other than that , i like going on my laptop and browsing the internet in the mornings while listening to calming music .","285982":"i have no real complaints , so i suppose things are going well . i slept in super late today i didn t crawl out of bed until noon , so now i feel kinda weird , as if i wasted half of my day .","285983":"i honestly don t know who what that is , lol .","285984":"well , technically today is sunday which is the start of a new week . however , the highlight of last week was going out with my coworker to a new brewery that opened up locally . their beers were delicious , and we had a very productive conversation about work related things .","285985":"no , pandemics are quite real and the medications used to treat disease , as well as the vaccines to try to prevent those diseases , are beneficial and a necessity to society .","285986":"pretty much everything there are bars and restaurants , a night club , a jazz club , pools and slides , a rock climbing wall , and i m pretty sure they have this cool thing where they put you in a plastic ball and you can walk on the ocean surface .","285987":"if i was asked to write about something as a means of discussing the topic with no bias whatsoever , then yes . however , if i was being asked to write about that subject while also agreeing with it , even though i disagree with it , then i would probably refuse the assignment .","285988":"no , that isn t how addiction is defined . addiction is when you have become so dependent on a particular substance such as drugs or alcohol that your body goes into withdrawal symptoms without that substance in you . you begin using that substance to feel normal again . what you re describing is a compulsion , if anything .","285989":"i believe that i m more of a hopeless romantic while he s more of a literal practical romantic , if that makes any sense . he shows his affection through small gifts and tokens of appreciation , while i show affection through words .","285990":"chester bennington . ?","285991":"i haven t crossed it off yet because it hasn t happened yet , but i m traveling overseas soon , which is something i ve always wanted to do .","285992":"no . i never have . i ve always wanted to try it though .","285993":"uh , well on sunday when my boyfriend s dog passed away , my mother gave me an attitude and basically told me in a passive aggressive way that i should have been over her house to clean instead of being at the vet while the dog was being put down . it was entirely insensitive , and i m still so angry about it . she s been acting as if the conversation never happened .","285994":"i performed all of my daily obligations , and i am fully deserving of this giant glass of wine rn .","285995":"my vape my keys .","285996":"sometimes , i m ashamed of my past and the things i ve done to other people in order to hurt them . however , realistically there s nothing i can do about it now and there s no use in dwelling on the past .","285997":"i ve recently been trying to sort through a lot of negative emotions , most of them stemming from grief from the loss of my boyfriend s dog earlier this week .","285998":"i just keep trudging forward regardless of whatever has tried to set me back . despite feeling hopeless at times , i ve always had an ounce of motivation and determination to make life better for myself and others . i can t do that if i wallow in self pity or don t do anything to improve my own life .","285999":"i ve climbed the empire state building before , as well as the montauk lighthouse .","286000":"i was working out routinely perhaps or so months ago , but stopped after i moved out of my parents house . the treadmill is still in the garage , haha . i also haven t weighed myself in over a year .","286001":"cont . . . he seemed disgusted that i wanted to learn it and mentioned he hated jews bc of the conflicts between them and arabs in the middle east he lives there . there s nothing i can do to change his mind or at least have him make a distinction between jews and zionists . something else he said that made me uncomfortable is he talked about coming to see me in the future and buying me gifts and going out on dates . . . i told him we re just friends , nothing else and he said he knows but still wants to do it in the future . i found that odd , am i wrong for that ? because of those reasons , i m considering telling him i d like to cease communication and wishing him luck . i don t want him to unrealistic expectations abt our relationship i dislike his mentality . would you personally cut him off ? tysm for reading this . i wouldn t tolerate antisemitism in any form , so that s an immediate turn off for me . obviously he s set in his ways and to have such a strong dislike for a group of people who are usually genuinely good is wrong in itself . jewish people are already marginalized so much in society , even in the united states . as for the whole going out on dates thing , it does seem a bit pushy and it sounds a bit like he doesn t want to respect your boundaries and just remain friends . he seems to expect more out of the relationship than what you have in mind , and that may cause conflict in the future . i don t think it s out of line for you to want to cease communication with him . the bigotry , for one , being the biggest thing of all , and then him acting like he wants to be in a relationship with you even though you clearly said no is another big indicator . personally speaking , i would feel uncomfortable and trust my own instincts .","286002":"my boyfriend and my best friend . they ve both had resounding influences on me over the past years , in positive ways as well . they ve taught me my strength over the years .","286003":"i m not the biggest fan of caramel , no . i used to eat small portions of it on ice cream , but it s been literally years since i ve done that .","286004":"sometimes , sure . other times , not so much .","286005":"i m curious about getting back into painting and drawing again . i just recently drew a charcoal piece last week , and it came out fairly good in my opinion . it made me confident that i didn t really lose my touch and i want to practice more .","286006":"i can only assume it s due to unresolved trauma , considering the fragments memories i do have are fairly bad .","286007":"homemade ! ! i mean , it s one of the easiest dishes to make , haha .","286008":"it s one of my favorite songs , and watsky is an incredible artist .","286009":"no , i ve never called or texted a s icide hotline before .","286010":"no , i have no reasons to ride a bicycle .","286011":"haha , perhaps ! ! but considering i don t know how to ride one now , it s safe to say that i never learned .","286012":"what influenza thing ? i ve known about the common flu for quite a long time , and so far there hasn t been much of a global threat about the coronavirus . i found it interesting how the documentary came out right when all of the hysteria started happening , though .","286013":"basic health care .","286014":"this is perhaps one of my favorites . i took it while vacationing in upstate new york a few years ago .","286015":"art in general , whether it s writing or photography or painting or drawing . i always fall back on artistic endeavors during hard times because it s a healthy coping mechanism for me .","286016":"leave out all the rest by linkin park . after chester s passing , it totally hit me in a different light and i can t help but tear up whenever i hear the

has changed over the past year , so it s really difficult to say if things have gotten better or worse . like much else in life , things wax and wane and fluctuate all the time , so there have been low periods as well as high periods .","286018":"i think it s admirable , and the few straight edge people i know are pretty down to earth and low key people . however , i ve also known a few people who were really snobby and holier than thou about their straight edge lifestyle , and basically looked down on people who weren t straight edge which is wrong . just like any other lifestyle or movement , there will always be people who take it to extremes and use it as a platform to spew hatred towards others .","286019":"my most paranoid fear is that the government is always listening to us , especially now with the prevalent use of social media .","286020":"all the things she said by t . a . t . u . https www . youtube . com watch ? v mgbaxplri","286021":"i think it s cowardly . if you don t have the confidence to tell me how you feel to my face , then you re not deserving of any of my attention in the first place .","286022":"i seldom have problems with my attention span , so it doesn t dwindle unless i m already distracted by something else like an emotion or event going on in my life .","286023":"and there is not a single place that i would rather be . i m fucked up just like you are , and you re fucked up just like me . sloppy seconds by watsky .","286024":"we were texting and he was telling me about his day , so the banter between us made me laugh .","286025":"i don

loved one is in pain or struggling .","286027":"my first and only , unfortunately language is english . i took french classes in high school , but i don t remember most of the language . it would be beneficial to me to learn spanish , and i would also be interested in learning more about latin and russian .","286028":"depends on the restaurant , haha . i don t know if that s something they would catch since people dine alone all the time . they would obviously ask you to leave if they re starting to close the restaurant for the night , though .","286029":"some people could be bragging , but more often than not , i don t really see that occurring very often . it s better to adopt a rescue pet than purchase one from the store .","286030":"this isn t an appropriate question to ask someone .","286031":"penne a la vodka , haha . it s one of my favorite pasta dishes .","286032":"i don t remember my childhood , so i m honestly not sure . i just remember having it by the age of around or so , because i can recall wanting to do well in school so that i can get scholarships to a good college out of state and leave home .","286033":"i suppose absinthe ? i m not entirely sure .","286034":"depends on the liquor and beer combo . the most famous one is the irish car bomb .","286035":"chloe price from the video game life is strange .","286036":"i suppose from my teenagehood i was determined to get out of my living circumstances , and that served as a catalyst for the way i applied myself in most circumstances , whether it was school or work .","286037":"s icide

just woke up from an accidental nap after loading myself into a carb coma , lmaoo . now i m watching criminal minds and checking my inbox . there isn t really much else on my mind .","286048":"not really , no . influenza already k lls tens of thousands of people in the united states alone per year . around , people have already died in the season alone . an outbreak of a new strain of virus isn t all that surprising to me .","286049":"i wear jeans most of the time , but i also wear leggings .","286050":"there are actually text hotlines .","286051":"yes , i play video games .","286052":"rent , lmaoo .","286053":"well , this is racist to say the very least .","286054":"hello do you have a question ?","286055":"? ? ? it s illogical to think that you can t have children after the age of . i believe after , the risks increase but to say you cannot have kids at all is silly .","286056":"definitely a yay ! ! i order chinese food every weeks or so , and it s such a comfort food when i m feeling down .","286057":"i ve never had one particular favorite color , i ve always just preferred earth tones over everything else though .","286058":"i went to a brewery tonight for some drinks with a coworker , and there was a giant puppy just chilling at the bar and greeting everyone who walked by . it was the greatest thing ever .","286059":"i don t generally celebrate valentine s day , but the cruise i m going on is embarking on the day after valentine s day , so that s a bit of a gift in itself . haha .","286060":"yes , minecraft is one of my favorite games . i haven t played it in a while , though .","286061":"of course any sort of thought that someone puts into my birthday is appreciated .","286062":"i m going on a cruise in february ! ! everything else is pretty meaningless , lmaoo .","286063":"no , i don t hate any coworkers . hate is a very strong word only reserved for certain people in my life , and that does not apply to my coworkers .","286064":"in theory , things are pretty terrible . but i m feeling fine right now because i just got back from the brewery and i m feeling pretty buzzed .","286065":"definitely not . i don t check social media often while i m at work unless i m on a break .","286066":"i ve never liked using backpacks , even in high school . i ve always used a messenger bag or a pocketbook .","286067":"oh right , i forgot that after the age of , your ability to have children suddenly disappears .","286068":"thankfully , no . other people in my grade had to do so , but i ended up with the teacher who didn t do that same project .","286069":"eventually , sure . like i said , though , it isn t a priority between us .","286070":"i administer to multiple programs and i have a bit of leverage in the company because i m of a higher status than the other editors in the company .","286071":"i mean . . . maybe ? lmaoo . i don t really concern myself with that . i just care about doing the job right and with the right amount of efficiency .","286072":"i don t normally nap , and i sleep between hours per night .","286073":"yes , i actually just got home from having a few drinks with a coworker at a local brewery , haha .","286074":"i never definitively said i never wanted children . i just don t believe i can confidently have kids at this point in my life . perhaps when i m older maybe . but it isn t a priority for me , and i want to work on myself first before deciding to take care of someone else .","286075":"this was my first baby betta from three years ago before he passed away . unfortunately , i don t have any tanks anymore and i don t have any full length photos of his set up .","286076":"i would most definitely accept it , and i would get jaw surgery to give myself a stronger jawline . i ve always found strong jawlines to be very attractive , and i think i would be more confident in myself if my jaw was more defined .","286077":"i was raised catholic , but i ve never actually been very religious . even when i was attending church and religion classes , i don t think i ever truly believed in god . after i went through my confirmation , i told my parents that i didn t believe in god and i stopped pursuing any sort of religious ventures .","286078":"i m not really a member of my community , so i honestly don t know . i ve never had a strong sense of community with where i live i barely know my neighbors , and all i really do is go to work , go to the store , and come home . i m a regular at a few bars and coffee shops , but that s the extent of my involvement .","286079":"my specialty is oversharing my trauma and past experiences , and then making dark and awkward jokes when the people around me become too uncomfortable . lmaoo .","286080":"if i m feeling just sad , then listening to music , venting to friends , and playing video games cheers me up or at least distracts me until the mood lifts . if i m in the middle of a depressive episode , then nothing cheers me up . it s simply a waiting game to see when the fog will lift .","286081":"my morning cup of coffee . ?","286082":"january has honestly flown by , and i feel as if new years day was only last week , lol . it was honestly a pretty terrible month , though . there have been so many personal conflicts and happenings in my life which have brought me down , both mentally and physically . all of the political and environmental issues have been weighing heavy on my heart as well .","286083":"i use just regular purell hand sanitizer , and i also have one that the representatives of my health insurance company gave my department that has a really pleasant , but light , lemon aroma to it .","286084":"yes , i am currently in love .","286085":"my day has been productive , but exhausting . i spent the majority of the day at work , where i ve been intensely training my coworker for the past two days . after work , i went straight to my parents house for a family gathering , and i was there for almost three hours . i only got home at like pm . after i got home , i immediately put my pajamas on and grabbed a beer from the fridge , lmaoo .","286086":"no , i ve never had surgery before . i ve received stitches on a few occasions , but that has been my extent of medical maladies .","286087":"i probably have at some point , but i honestly can t remember . i have tried various kinds of sushi , so i m assuming octopus or squid were in one of them . fried calamari is one of my favorite foods , though .","286088":"nah , i ve honestly never saw the point in gambling . i wouldn t want to risk losing money in the slim chance that i might win it back and then some . i ve never even played lotto .","286089":"well , it s wednesday night and the week is about halfway over . i m planning on seeing my coworker for drinks tomorrow night , and then on friday i have a few errands to run before i go home after work . i need to go shopping for a gift before saturday , and then saturday night is my aunt s retirement party .","286090":"no , i was never really close to any of my teachers or professors . i had one teacher in high school to whom i was semi close i emailed him during my freshman year of college to get his advice on something , but we haven t spoken since . i also have another teacher of mine added on my facebook , but we don t really interact at all . she was the coolest science teacher i ve ever had , though .","286091":"i ve reverted back to playing skyrim on a daily basis again , lol . it s my go to game whenever i m stressed out because it feels like home to me , and i ve essentially been playing it for six years straight at this point . i also started playing red dead redemption , which has been fun with its online capabilities . i ve played with friends a few times . i also downloaded halo reach for the master chief collection and did a few missions on that recently as well .","286092":"i work a monday through friday job , so mondays are always the hardest days of the week for me , lol . to look ahead for five days and remember that i have to wake up early , commute to work , work for . hours , and then commute home is absolutely exhausting .","286093":"i prefer cheeseburgers cooked on the barbecue , as well as hot dogs and sausages . it just tastes better over the grill as opposed to being cooked in the kitchen over the stove .","286094":"you re definitely not alone in this at all ! ! i constantly have random words , phrases , or just mash ups of different sounds get stuck in my head all the time , to the point where the words themselves become distorted and i over analyze their sounds . it begins to disintegrate and not sound like a real word anymore .","286095":"at the moment , no surprisingly . i think it s because i m hearing my roommate s video game from the other room , though , so that s currently occupying my head .","286096":"i m somewhat of an extroverted introvert , if that makes any sense . i m introverted in the way that being around a lot of people completely drains me , and i require time alone in order to recharge . however , i can act extroverted when i m with a very small group of friends and i thoroughly enjoy spending time with my close friends .","286097":"i m afraid of being abandoned by those closest to me . i have an irrational fear that all of my friends secretly hate me and only talk to me because they feel bad , for whatever reason that would be . i m terrified that everyone is going to get fed up with me and leave .","286098":"i ve visited manhattan on countless occasions for a variety of reasons , whether it s just for a random day trip or to go to museums and art galleries or to see a play or musical .","286099":"my bedroom wall , which is adorned with a beautiful tapestry and string lights which are colored blue right now .","286100":"yes , i m very much a perfectionist . i have to double check everything i do to make sure it s done correctly , and i always put in in everything i do , especially when it comes to work . i ve always relied on myself instead of other people in terms of projects because i simply cannot trust other people to do the same level of quality work that i do .","286101":"listen to music that s the first thing that comes to mind . there s nothing better and more relaxing than coming home from a hectic day at work , putting on relaxing music , and closing my eyes while listening for a few minutes . the solitude and quietness of the music calms me down a lot and brings me back to a state of peace .","286102":"at the moment , i m a senior editor and writer at a publishing company .","286103":"i m thinking about the few things i have to do before this weekend , which includes going shopping for a gift , going to the bank , paying rent , and attending my aunt s retirement party on saturday . i m also going out for drinks with one of my coworkers tomorrow night .","286104":"a woman can be whoever she wants to be . there should never be any limitations or expectations when it comes to how a woman should behave , that s a misogynistic form of thinking .","286105":"no , i wasn t popular in middle school or high school . i was known by my peers , but i didn t have a lot of friends .","286106":"my secret is camera filters . my skin is actually pretty bad right now , and i don t do anything to take care of my skin except for an exfoliating gel in the shower and a nourishing moisturizer after i get out of the shower .","286107":"yes , i vape . i quit smoking cigarettes last september .","286108":"i went hiking once when i was a freshman in college it was part of our orientation , we hiked a mountain in massachusetts as a group bonding activity , haha .","286109":"i don t believe i ve ever had deep fried mushrooms before .","286110":"if you re talking about the novel by lewis carroll , then no . i don t believe i ve ever read alice in wonderland either .","286111":"people can take whoever they want out on dates , regardless of their gender . this line of thinking insinuates that dating only happens to heterosexual couples , when obviously a multitude of genders and orientations exist .","286112":"no , i ve never been arrested before . i definitely should have at multiple moments in my life , but i walked away unscathed . lol .","286113":"thankfully , no . i was a bit on the older side when his music first started getting popular .","286114":"my relationship with ginger is a bit weird . i enjoy ginger tea , but i don t like eating actual ginger . i also don t like cold drinks with ginger in it , like moscow mules for example .","286115":"my boyfriend is definitely a much better cook than me , lol . he knows how to cook more meals than i do , and he makes the best empanadas .","286116":"no , i ve never seen the point in spending real money on social media . i have the coins that i have through asking and answering questions , as well as whatever coins people give me for my answers every day .","286117":"yes , i had work today . i spent . hours at work , and then went to my parents house for a small family gathering . i just got home perhaps minutes ago for reference , it s pm .","286118":"the last person i met for the very first time was perhaps a coworker of mine who has been working for the company for quite a few months now . i don t really have many opportunities nor the desire to meet new people .","286119":"i suppose that depends entirely on what they did to screw up the first chance they were given .","286120":"i ve had maybe different accounts , but i ve been using askfm as a whole since around . since i ve been going through my s during my entire time using askfm , i ve changed significantly . i ve gotten a college degree , a few job changes , new cars , moved into a new house , etc etc .","286121":"it depends on the restaurant . some restaurants charge for the service , while others don t . if anything , i ve only seen a charge at the very most for delivery service .","286122":"i m currently watching pandemic , which is a new documentary on netflix about epidemics across the world , like avian flu and swine flu and whatnot . it s incredibly interesting . as for true crime documentaries , making a murderer was obviously great . i also liked abducted in plain sight , don t f k with cats , the staircase , the confession tapes , and confessions with a killer the ted bundy tapes .","286123":"no , they re just unnecessarily terrible things that have no real educational value , they re just bad . between getting severely ill in the beginning of the month to having to put my boyfriend s dog down last sunday , it s just been a bad month .","286124":"my family told me i had jewish heritage .","286125":"picrew . me , i believe the site was ! !","286126":"i like unsweetened iced tea , as well as various semi sweet flavors of iced tea , like peach and raspberry . as for regular tea , i normally drink herbal teas with no sugar or milk or honey or anything else .","286127":"i prefer to call my boyfriend , but text everyone else . i m not much of a fan of video chatting .","286128":"i enjoy singing , but i m terrible at it . lmaoo .","286129":"my little succulent sanctuary on my desk .","286130":"january has honestly been a terrible month , between all of the social and political news , as well as things going on in my personal life the month isn t even over yet it feels like an entire year .","286131":"from my understanding , race and heritage are biological while culture is more of a social construct . many races have their own unique cultures , but if you re of a particular race and have been around a different culture instead of being a direct member of that culture , i don t think it s right to identify as that race or culture . you can simply say you re close with that culture and understand it , not that it s your culture .","286132":"i actually took a dna test last year and it showed that i was a significant amount of ashkenazi jewish , as well as ukrainian , german , austrian , italian , etc etc . even though i knew i had jewish in me as a heritage , the percentage was around which was a lot more than expected . however , i was raised catholic and no one ever spoke about the jewish traditions in my earlier family ancestry . i m comfortable stating that i have jewish ancestry , but i wouldn t feel comfortable reclaiming slurs or anything of the sort because i wasn t raised with that cultural significance .","286133":"i like questions related to my personal interests , i . e . hobbies such as writing , reading , and video games , mental health , documentaries and true crime shows , politics to an extent , animals , and nature .","286134":"rest in paradise , my baby . knowing you for over years was such a privilege . you re not suffering anymore now you re with your brother , it s difficult to accept but knowing you re not in pain at least gives me solace .","286135":"nah , i used a website for it . that isn t my drawing style , haha .","286136":"i normally use doordash or grubhub . i ve never had anything wild happen to me , and my orders have always been accurate .","286137":"definitely not . i hate pedicures to begin with .","286138":"no , shehitsback and i are not related .","286139":"spicy chicken nuggets , french fries , and dr . pepper .","286140":"no , i ve only ever followed it within the past few years .","286141":"it s extremely toxic to hold grudges , and holding a grudge ultimately hurts you more than it hurts anyone else . even if you cannot forgive someone , holding a grudge against that person is unhealthy . certain things you just have to accept and allow them to be .","286142":"if a friendship or relationship does not ultimately serve you or make you a better version of yourself , then it isn t worth having around in your life . you may have fun with certain people , but it doesn t necessarily mean that they re healthy for you to be around , and if the relationship is unevenly balanced , then it s time to readjust your priorities and make a decision .","286143":"i usually get a small refund . i ve never owed more than i received .","286144":"the issue with this is that you cannot forget the past you have to learn how to accept the past for what it is , and then you can truly move forward . if you simply try to forget or suppress the past , then yeah , it s going to affect you in the long run .","286145":"me and my father . he gets discounts on h r block programs every year , so we usually do ours at the same time .","286146":"i used to like the cookies and creme hershey bars .","286147":"i guess ordering wendy s through doordash instead of actually driving there , because i didn t want to deal with people and waiting in lines and cashiers . there s literally a wendy s on the road that i take to get home , but i just went straight home and ordered online instead . lmaoo .","286148":"i don t know enough about horse racing to have an opinion on it . i ve heard that it s ab sive , but i ve also heard the complete opposite so i m torn on the issue .","286149":"i ve always believed that strong people were those who have endured in the face of struggle and trauma , and came out from the other side .","286150":"everyone has a different reason to be happy . but sometimes people cannot find reasons to be happy due to mental illness and other life situations .","286151":"i ve always wanted to , but never had the opportunity , haha . i m sure i will eventually .","286152":"surprisingly , i ve never seen monty python . i m sure i would find it hilarious though .","286153":"spicy chicken nuggets , a dr . pepper , and french fries .","286154":"i like classic comedies , like airplane , space balls , and robin hood men in tights .","286155":"well , i just doordashed some wendy s because it s one of my comfort foods . i m going to take a nap later . and i m probably going to spend the night distracting myself with some video games , even though i m supposed to go to my parents house to clean . i just can t bring myself to do it , though . i m still an emotional wreck .","286156":"the deaths of chris cornell and chester bennington shocked and upset me the most , mainly because i felt so connected to them and their music . people who claim that mourning about a celebrity death is unnecessary obviously don t understand that you can wholeheartedly be influenced by and understand the significance of that celebrity . you don t have to know them on a personal level in order to mourn their loss , and mourning isn t just reserved for the person who passed away either . you can mourn for their friends and families .","286157":"perhaps a . there are a lot of benefits to askfm , such as getting to know your friends better and learning about new ideas and cultures . but there are an abundance of trolls and bigotry .","286158":"it s distracting , that s for certain .","286159":"i m not really sure jokes about things that are morbid or things about death are amusing and relatable to me .","286160":"not well at all . i only made it . hours at work before i started breaking down and sobbing at my desk . i asked my supervisor if i could leave , and she was very supportive .","286161":"i m not entirely sure . i just never believed in the concept of a god .","286162":"my supervisor told me today that i must take care of myself and my own health before committing myself to my work , otherwise the work will reflect my state of mind and won t be at its best . i have to be in a healthy mindset , and missing one half day of work isn t going to affect anything in the long run .","286163":"no , i seldom get sick . however , when i do get sick , it s pretty bad , lmaoo .","286164":"english , considering that s my specialty and what i attended college for .","286165":"if i told you , then it wouldn t be a secret anymore .","286166":"this is a question for my followers , not necessarily for me . haha . i know my age , and my age is clearly listed in my bio .","286167":"technically the last time i ve been to a church was for my cousin s wedding back in july . however , i haven t attended a regular mass since i was a child . i stopped believing in god and told my parents i didn t want to attend church anymore .","286168":"dark is the first word that comes to mind . i have a dark sense of humor .","286169":"somewhat , they believe in god . they don t attend church though .","286170":"thank you ! !","286171":"repost my first drawing in a while . i just added the banner .","286172":"art was my biggest hobby . i drew , painted , did charcoal drawings , etc etc . i fell out of the hobby but i want to get back into it .","286173":"wolves are my favorite animals .","286174":"unfortunately , i don t own a grill . we ve been making everything in the kitchen these days , haha .","286175":"i went to church and got confirmed as a child . i don t identify as any religion these days , though .","286176":"yeah , i save and budget and plan accordingly . i have some money in my savings account as well as money saved up for rent and other necessities in my checking account . christmas has set me back a lot which really sucks , but i m surviving .","286177":"the death of chester bennington hit me extremely hard . he was my idol growing up , and i m still upset about his passing tbh . i think about it nearly every day and i can t listen to certain linkin park songs without crying .","286178":"no , i don t watch the olympics .","286179":"i wake up around am every day for work . on the weekends , i usually wake up between and am .","286180":"yes , i have one brother .","286181":"no , basically everyone calls me leigh .","286182":"i don t eat cereal .","286183":"i did laundry yesterday , but that was the extent of it . i ve been in bed all afternoon .","286184":"yeah both him and his daughter years old passed away . on top of everything else going on , this makes my heart so heavy . it s not even one month into and it already has been terrible , between pandemic crises , the wildfires in australia , the threat of world war iii , etc etc . absolutely ridiculous .","286185":"i feel like i m drowning by two feet . best friends by grandson . my demons by starset . welcome to the family by watsky . therapy session by nf .","286186":"i usually say pocketbook or hangbag , depending on the type of bag it is . some people i know also use messenger bags and backpacks .","286187":"i interchange the two sometimes , but i mostly say couch .","286188":"i don t have children , but i would definitely gear their diets toward healthy eating .","286189":"no , i have other people in my life who provide the same love and support these days .","286190":"yes , those are common grounding techniques to control anger and other negative emotions . my therapist specialized in mindfulness therapy , which is basically being cognizant of the present moment , where you are at that moment , and grounding yourself . it helped me a lot with dissociation .","286191":"no , i haven t heard about him until this very moment .","286192":"i ve never made them myself , but i usually order fried pickles as an appetizer when i m out somewhere .","286193":"thank you so much , livi . i know that s the only solace i have in this . he was in so much pain , and he took his last painkiller from me the night before , so at least he had that in his system before he had to be put down this morning .","286194":"thank you so much .","286195":"i ve been an emotional , crying , sobbing wreck all morning . my boyfriend s dog got put down about minutes ago and i can t handle it right now . i ve known this and dog and have loved him for over years . i know he s in a better place now , where he isn t struggling with cancer and isn t in pain , but it s so difficult . i was going to be there at the vet clinic when they put him down . but i woke up from constant nightmares all night . i woke up crying and haven t stopped for the past three hours . i can t imagine how horrible i would have been had i went there . everyone else in the family went and stayed with him , which is good , and that was one of the things i was worried about because i didn t want him to die alone .","286196":"i prefer local ipas from breweries in the area , so places like the great south bay brewery , mustache brewery , montauk brewing company , and crooked ladder brewery are among my favorites .","286197":"it s a beer bottle .","286198":"picrew . me ! ! i saw someone i follow on twitter post their avatar the link , so i made my own .","286199":"every months or so , depending on whenever i color my hair .","286200":"i m not sure i would take up that opportunity . although terrible things have happened in my life that i ve overcome , everything occurs within the domino effect , meaning that if one thing is changed , then everything subsequent to that situation will also change . if i do over one thing in my life , then i would be a completely different person than who i am today .","286201":"as you know , i ve always been an advocate for mental health awareness and decreasing the stigma around mental illness based on discussion of various topics both online and in person . my own personal life has also been improved , because it has showed me that there s a greater sum of people who struggle with mental health regardless of its severity than meets the eye , and not only does it open the eyes of other people struggling , but it also helps me understand my own struggles with my own mental health journey .","286202":"there s a higher rate of s icide affiliated with the more highly stigmatized disorders , including the ones you listed above . any more severe sort of mood disorders , nearly all personality disorders , psychotic disorders , and dissociative disorders have a high rate of misunderstanding and stigma surrounding them . it also doesn t help that they re stigmatized by mental health professionals themselves . some psychiatrists psychologists are hesitant to diagnose someone with certain disorders because they re judgmental towards it themselves , especially with respect to bpd . people with bpd are often seen as manipulative , attention seeking , and ab sive , which couldn t be further from the truth .","286203":"it s a physical journal . it s called mindful journaling by tara ward .","286204":"i ve been interested in buying the dialectical behavioral therapy handbook , which is geared towards people struggling with borderline personality disorder . other than that , i haven t tried any self guided or otherwise guided workbooks . my former therapist combined cbt and dbt in her sessions , with focuses on past trauma as well as current mindfulness , and occasionally she suggested in meditation and we implemented deep breathing exercises in our sessions if i was feeling particularly anxious that day .","286205":"i ve never read any self help books , but i do have a mindfulness journal that i occasionally write in that allows you to live in the current moment and urges you to describe the things going on in that present time so that you gain a sense of grounded ness . it s really interesting and it helps me on occasion . it s mostly writing they give you prompts , such as describe where you re situated right now . what do you hear ? what do you smell ? how do you feel ? and things of that nature .","286206":"my normal routine is beneficial to my mental health because it provides me with a sense of stability getting up and going to work everyday , doing household chores when i get home , making or ordering dinner , cleaning , and then settling down to relax at the end of the day .","286207":"i m not a member of any online support groups . however , when i was a teenager , i found that my time spent on active forums unrelated to mental health actually helped distract me from my life and provided me with a place to vent and a sense of comfort , knowing that there were other people on there who felt the same way . i ve grown close to a lot of those people , even though we ve never met irl .","286208":"i think of narcissists , who are generally people who only think about themselves and how situations can affect themselves solely . people who put down others if it means enhancing their own lives . people who won t admit that they re wrong even when presented with evidence proving the contrary . people who are all around selfish too confident in themselves to the point where it becomes detrimental to those around them .","286209":"i don t recognize her . but perhaps i ll check her music out in the future , considering she s a cuban american . she s also extremely young , haha . i didn t expect that .","286210":"i m not doing well today at all . i said goodbye to my boyfriend s dog last night , which put me into a sobbing frenzy . i had nightmares all night and could barely sleep , and i was supposed to go to the vet clinic to support him when they put him down , but i woke up sobbing and i haven t stopped . i don t think i m in the right mindset to be there , which upsets me even more .","286211":"coping with difficulties in my life in a healthy manner .","286212":"a person in my life whose reaction was inappropriate when i told them that my boyfriend s dog was being put down today . it exemplified the fact that there are perhaps a lot of people who simply don t care about animals , and it s so upsetting and disturbing .","286213":"i still don t know who they are , nor do i know who shawn mendez is or left fifth harmony . lmaoo . i don t really listen to contemporary pop radio stations , and on the rare occasions that i do , they seldom tell you who the artist or song name is .","286214":"worth of medication , because at least that will keep me set for quite a number of months or perhaps a year or longer .","286215":"yeah , there are a few people who i talk to on a daily basis .","286216":"no , i don t use adderall .","286217":"i don t know who the first person is , so i ll choose ariana grande . i like a few of her songs , actually .","286218":"shehitsback urlsareshittbh

, especially fried pickles with chipotle ranch dip .","286221":"i dislike olives . which is amusing because olives are a main ingredient of picadillo , but i always eat around them , haha .","286222":"beer , usually . whatever the local ipa on tap is .","286223":"my boyfriend s dog is being put down tomorrow . my heart is completely broken .","286224":"sometimes , if it s earl gray or regular black tea . i ll put a splash of milk in with a little bit of sugar . green , white , and herbal teas are drank straight .","286225":"i would be quite , quite sad . lmaoo . coffee is my life fuel . to be fair , i would simply switch to black tea to drink in the morning .","286226":"yeah , but if they have reasonable suspicion that you ve committed a crime or something similar , they can force to take your fingerprints from my brief understanding of it .","286227":"this has really only happened to me on askfm , but it s amusing as hell .","286228":"on occasion , yes . i usually visit once per week or once every two weeks if the house needs to be cleaned .","286229":"they re doing well . obviously they re still haunted by the memory because you never truly get over losing a parent , but they re surviving .","286230":"it s super expensive to live on long island , and more and more people are moving either to new england or down south because the cost of living is cheaper there .","286231":"i have no clue , lmaoo . it s pretty expected at this point . i always make it a point to text them thank you and whatnot and wish them a happy holidays , but they never respond .","286232":"we don t talk unless it s around the holidays , and sometimes he ll tag me in things on facebook and whatnot , but we don t talk often at all . we ve never talked about the past and i have no intentions on having that conversation .","286233":"it happened when i was living with my parents . even though i was clearly an adult , i felt judged and even got harassed whenever i wanted to do certain things .","286234":"i used to block ben s accounts before i realized it was a waste of time and energy , considering he makes like new accounts per day .","286235":"yeah , but he s a loveable idiot . lmaoo .","286236":"my roommates would notice first , considering i always come home at the same time every day . if i didn t answer any calls or texts , they would probably resort to contacting my partner and other friends before going to law enforcement .","286237":"i don t believe in the idea of hell being a physical place , if that s what you mean . in a metaphorical context , however , i agree with the quote that someone s own personal hell may be their greatest struggles where they re at their darkest point .","286238":"i work better on my own . i don t like group projects or doing anything that involves someone else sharing the same responsibilities as me . it mainly only happened during high school and college , but group projects really annoyed because no one else would do their part well enough and i ended up taking the reins for the sake of my own grade .","286239":"yes , i did ! ! i watched it when it first came out however many years ago that was . i thought it was very interesting and compelling .","286240":"in the context of that quote , hell is referring to any sort of struggle that s significantly damaging you . the quote is encouraging in that it reassures you that things will eventually get better and you shouldn t give up in the face of struggle .","286241":"i always suspect that a job wants to get rid of me , lol . rationally , i know that i m a great team member but there will always be that paranoia that they ll abruptly change their mind .","286242":"i honestly don t remember . that was over years ago .","286243":"no , it s the same thing regardless of whether someone is overweight or underweight . it simply isn t your position to judge .","286244":"earlier would have been better , but i m not overly concerned since it s the weekend . i woke up at am .","286245":"it s a television series called cold case files , and it s basically law enforcement s investigations into cases that have gone cold but re emerged due to new evidence .","286246":"i m in a decent place right now , mood wise . the fact that i got up at a reasonable hour and started being productive right away has put me in a good mood , and i ve been relaxing and listening to music all morning afternoon .","286247":"garlic , onion powder , oregano , crushed red pepper , and cinnamon .","286248":"from my understanding , my ancestry is my family lineage . grandparents , great grandparents , distant relatives and cousins , etc etc . i already know that i have direct family who come from italy who still live in italy , but going further back , apparently i also have ancestry in austria , the ukraine , and germany , among other places .","286249":"it s felt like home since the very beginning .","286250":"i believe in ufos and aliens and extraterrestrial life in general . i m not as obsessive as the people on the show ancient aliens , but i align more with fox mulder s perspective on aliens .","286251":"it s a three bedroom house , with a living room , bathroom , and kitchen .","286252":"i look at the situation in parts , and i analyze each part to see what the best course of action would be .","286253":"no , he was a man .","286254":"no , i park in the street . we have a garage , but we don t use it for a car . it s mainly used for storage right now , along with our garbage bins and recycling and whatnot .","286255":"much better , thank you ! ! i got two tires replaced , front brake pads replaced , and an oil change . it s driving like brand new again .","286256":"i m indifferent . i ve never played the doom games before .","286257":"last winter . it hasn t snowed much at all this year .","286258":"i m doing well . it s been quite a productive day so far i ve done three loads of laundry , i went out to fill my car with gas , and then i treated myself to dunkin donuts using a gift card i forgot that i had . right now , i m just drinking an iced coffee and listening to music while waiting for the dryer to finish . after that s all done , i m probably going to take a shower and see where the rest of the day takes me .","286259":"i don t wear noise cancelling headphones . when i m at work , i just have regular ear buds because i also need to listen to whenever my work phone could ring . at home , i just listen to music through the speakers on my laptop or on my television .","286260":"everyone s bodies are structured differently , so there are a lot of people who aren t capable of having a thigh gap regardless of how thin they are . it s an aspect of human anatomy , and it only encourages people to refrain from healthy eating and behaviors in order to obtain an unattainable body image .","286261":"my friends and i had our friends mas celebration last wednesday ! ! it was an evening full of gift giving , music , drinks , and laughter . i had a blast , and every gift was so thoughtful and my friends loved their gifts too .","286262":"laugh at fart and poop jokes . lmaoo .","286263":"i suppose it must have been back in the feminist askfm days , when there were a lot more people active from this side of askfm and offered sound advice and education about a variety of different social and political issues . i don t recall any examples in particular , but they definitely helped me understand a lot of the injustice in american society .","286264":"my boyfriend inspires me the most , as well as my best friend . they re both the strongest people i know emotionally speaking because they re persevered through such hardship but have found the motivation and will to continue pushing themselves forward despite everything they ve been through .","286265":"i always roll my sleeves up halfway to my elbows , with flannels and basically any other long sleeved shirt .","286266":"i try not to be jealous of anything or anyone , because jealousy is a toxic emotion and only leads to greater harm to yourself than anything else .","286267":"children rarely ever get sent to jail because they re minors , and if anything , they ll be sent to juvenile centers as a punishment for their crimes .","286268":"like i said earlier , i believe in open communication with children . this would mean that if i felt that my child shouldn t go on a specific field trip , i would explain in depth why i believed so , in order for the child to have a better understanding of my opinion and possibly come to terms with it or learn from the experience .","286269":"well , the law is the law and it exists for a reason . if a child broke the law and got caught , they should learn from the experience and deal with the repercussions of their actions . whether or not a parent wants to deal with it themselves doesn t negate the fact that the law was broken in the first place .","286270":"i m not really sure how i feel about this type of situation because , to my knowledge , it never happened when i was in school . teachers would give students permission slips to bring home for their parents to sign allowing them to go on field trips .","286271":"i wouldn t be embarrassed or anything , but i believe that i would be concerned more than anything else . obviously there s something going on in my child s life that they re not discussing with me , and because i ve always envisioned myself having a communicable and open relationship with my children , i would feel as if i ve done something wrong in helping in their upbringing in order for them to feel as if they need to bully other kids .","286272":"i believe that could be a component of it , yes . however , i also believe that there s something deeper going on , such as having troubles at home where they re being scolded and or not giving the attention they need .","286273":"personal growth , including now that i ve been given the opportunity to learn from , grow , and heal from my past trauma now that i m not in that toxic environment anymore .","286274":"no , definitely quite the opposite . teachers have difficult jobs , but from what i ve heard , they re also quite rewarding in the right circumstances . however , teachers definitely don t get paid enough for what they do .","286275":"yes , usually specific examples come to mind but i don t always go into detail regarding those experiences and , instead , i base my answers on my feelings at the time or what i ve learned from the experience .","286276":"i m largely self motivated , and i ve always been dedicated to my writing , as well as my job and my relationships with my partner and close friends . i m not quite sure where the motivation comes from exactly , but i ve always been very motivated to make a better life for myself and life easier for other people .","286277":"i find nature to be beautiful , as well as my partner , my friends , and the shared bond i have with certain animals in my life . i find music and the arts to be beautiful , and witnessing the creation of a work of art to be ultimately inspiring .","286278":"yes , i took the andme test a few years ago to find out what my heritage is . the results were very interesting .","286279":"my love language is words of affirmation , followed closely by quality time . i just took the quiz now , ahah .","286280":"say yes to more opportunities instead of hiding away like a hermit in my house . i ve become quite the homebody ever since i moved into this house because it s become my safe place .","286281":"i believe our physical bodies perish , but our souls or energies or whatever you want to call them get transferred to different mediums , mostly in nature or out into the universe somewhere . energy cannot be destroyed , only transferred , and while i don t believe in an afterlife or reincarnation or anything , i do believe that the essence of our beings does go somewhere .","286282":"i ve always wanted to visit iceland because it looks so interesting and a very unique holiday destination . i had an old high school friend who went there for her honeymoon after she got married , and it was absolutely beautiful . i think i would try to spend each day being immersed in nature , experiencing the culture , and going on various tours to learn more about the country .","286283":"the little things in life keep me going . having a cup of coffee in the morning , spending quality time with friends , playing video games on nights where i know i have no responsibilities , experiencing a chilly yet sunny day , lighting a candle and listening to calming music , being surrounded by animals , etc etc .","286284":"in order for me to actually think about doing that at all , they must have done something absolutely terrible and unforgivable . i wouldn t put it past myself to hurt someone intentionally if given the appropriate circumstances .","286285":"good morning ! ! it s am , and i wish i could have woken up a little earlier to get laundry started , but it is what it is . i woke up minutes ago , and i just finished brewing some coffee while i wait for my laundry to be finished .","286286":"switch the laundry at am . go get gas at some point this weekend because i m almost on e . go grocery shopping tonight or tomorrow . go to my parents house to clean tomorrow afternoon . withdraw rent money before the end of the week .","286287":"uh , i m not . and god forbid i have a few drinks with my friends during a holiday celebration , lmaoo . if you think i was bad , you should have seen my other friend . he drank . bottles of wine by himself and was hungover until pm the following day . he was vomiting all night long .","286288":"i like starbucks , but i have to be in the mood for it . i prefer their hot drinks over their cold drinks , so whenever i go , i ll just get a venti pike place with vanilla syrup and cream .","286289":"you re welcome , obviously .","286290":"the last movie i watched was sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street . it s honestly one of my favorite movies , i ve re watched it at least times once i found out it was initially on netflix , haha .","286291":"the last risk i took was deciding to get drunk on friendsmas last wednesday , knowing that i had to wake up at am for work the following morning . lmaoo . nevertheless , it worked out well . i had a great time and even showed up to work early , even though i had a terrible hangover . the day was hell but i got through it .","286292":"physically , getting my ribcage tattooed . emotionally , witnessing the reaction of someone close to me when their parent died and they felt they had nothing left to live for .","286293":"if you ve tried talking to her about this and she can t see your progress , then perhaps you re better off discontinuing your sessions with her . ideally , a therapist is supposed to analyze and compare your emotions and behavior in the now to how it used to be , and if she isn t focused on you right now , then there s no way to progress forward . i would talk to her about this if you haven t done so already , and if she isn t receptive , then yeah i would find a new therapist .","286294":"also the fatty areas tend to hurt more , for whatever reason , especially areas that aren t exposed as often like the calves or inner thighs . i . e . , my half sleeve was tolerable except for the areas that were leading into the inside of the upper arm , like near the armpit . omg , that killed me , lmaoo . but yes , they re totally addictive . it s been like . . . two years since my last one , i think ? ugh , i need more but the ideas i have are super big and expensive .","286295":"it would be cool to sit down and have a cup of coffee with gillian anderson .","286296":"ah , okay . yeah that area doesn t generally hurt many people . my coffee cup is on my forearm and that didn t hurt at all , except for the bits closest to the inner area where my elbow bends , lol .","286297":"where on your body is it ? it depends really on the area of the body , as well as your own pain tolerance . some places hurt more for people than others . the only tattoos of mine that really killed me were my ribcage tattoo and the one i got on the back of my calf .","286298":"it ll be the only constant on this hellsite . lmaoo . i need a new tattoo so badly , omg .","286299":"my little succulent sanctuary in my room is pretty cool .","286300":"yeah , white privilege is definitely real .","286301":"i think it s cute ! ! cc isolelemuria","286302":"nah , it just helps me live more in the moment and have good times with friends .","286303":"i haven t heard about it until this very moment , but i think that s despicable . she shouldn t have gotten released early at all , she s a threat and a danger to others .","286304":"i only smoke weed on the rare occasion , but it has no affect on my mental health . it just makes me silly .","286305":"it isn t really important , but it s something my roommates and i enjoy . we don t always buy alcohol while grocery shopping , but if someone independently wants to buy something in particular , we ll just go out and get it ourselves whenever .","286306":"no ? i know it s going to come from the fridge . lmao .","286307":"in light of what i ve experienced , i ve become passionate about awareness for mental illness and try to speak on the subject whenever possible and appropriate . i empathize with others who have struggled with the same things that i have , so i try to use my experiences to reach out to others .","286308":"yes , actually . lmaoo . i just finished a blueberry beer .","286309":"i wouldn t know what i would do unless it actually happened to me . i can t predict my own behavior , it entirely depends on my mood in that moment , how i was feeling in general , how my life was going , etc etc .","286310":"not really , no . i m just on my laptop answering questions and listening to music . i wouldn t consider that multi tasking .","286311":"yes , i would absolutely relocate for love . i m not exactly the biggest fan of the area i live in anyway , i would for sure move out of new york or perhaps even out of the country with my boyfriend if the opportunity presented itself .","286312":"people s opinions on me , particular the opinions of my friends . i m always paranoid that my friends secretly hate me or feel bad for me , and then feel obligated to stay friends with me because they re afraid of what i would do to myself if they left .","286313":"i don t think you re understanding the fact that i ve said that i stopped questioning why a very , very long time ago . it isn t productive to question why it happened . what happened has happened , and questioning why has only made me more hateful , angry , and self destructive . they re not positive emotions , and there s nothing i can do about it now . the only thing i can do is move forward .","286314":"i can t imagine myself one year from now , let alone years from now .","286315":"it wasn t really a good school , but we had the capabilities to take out a loan for me to briefly attend the school i had wanted to go to at the time . after some events went down during my second semester , however , i returned home and attended a local college for the remaining . years .","286316":"i suppose a combination of both ? i ve been privileged to have had a good education growing up and the loans to attend college to obtain a degree , but a lot of my studies were independently done . even when i was home from school , i did a lot of reading and researching online about random things .","286317":"i had a few friends , but i felt disconnected from them for the most part . i dated my best friend when we were in middle school , but after we broke up , i felt like i had no one for quite a while until we made amends and became friends again . everything else felt meaningless and superficial .","286318":"nobody knew about the ab se , and the only people who know now are my best friend and my boyfriend aside from my former therapist psychiatrist , obviously .","286319":"i seldom talk to my grandparents to begin with except to thank them for gifts on holidays texts that they never respond to , lol . i ve never been close to them at all .","286320":"my grandparents on my father s side , yes .","286321":"no . i said earlier that i have no intentions of discussing it with my family . it isn t something that i have a desire to do , and i m focused more on my healing as opposed to dwelling on the past .","286322":"who knows , to be honest . like i said earlier , i stopped questioning why a very long time ago .","286323":"abandonment by my loved ones .","286324":"i ve never discussed it with him because he s also been an inflicter of ab se in the past , and i really have no desire to talk about it to any of my family members at all . this is my chance to heal . i can t keep dwelling on it because then i won t get the opportunity to heal , grow , and overcome it .","286325":"no , i actually don t think i m friends with anyone who also has the same name as any of my family members , haha .","286326":"they would never confess to it there s too much arrogance , pride , narcissism there . they would continue to gaslight me and claim that i made everything up for one reason or another , and it isn t a conversation worth having at this point . my parents are the type of people who don t believe they ve ever done anything wrong , even when presented with evidence , and they don t know where all of my mental health issues came from because apparently i had a perfectly normal upbringing .","286327":"i m not entirely sure , because he s significantly older than me and wasn t really around when most of the ab se happened .","286328":"i never thought you were being mean , just a bit naive to be perfectly honest . i hope i don t give off the impression that i somehow think i ve had a much worse life than other people , because obviously there are a plethora of people who are in worse positions than i ve been in . however , i m also not going to discredit what i ve been through because my voice deserves to be heard too .","286329":"yes , i have one brother .","286330":"my parents judged me a lot , and honestly they still do even though i don t live with them anymore . the lack of control they have over me now has only caused them to try to control me more even though i m out of their reach , and now i have the freedom to ignore it instead of being caged inside with it .","286331":"yes . i ve been thriving ever since i started living on my own , especially considering my past history with living at my parents house . i finally feel free and able to do as i please without judgment , anger , or fear .","286332":"it s constantly changing it s a symptom of bpd , having general crises and disturbances in identity understanding . most people who live with bpd don t have a defined understanding of who they are because their personalities themselves are disordered .","286333":"i ve only been able to move out in the final quarter of because of a pay increase , thus enabling me to make enough money to pay towards rent . i wasn t able to afford that prior to my pay raise when i was promoted months ago , and i definitely was not able to afford that going back three years ago , lol .","286334":"at this stage in my life , yeah . we re all in our late s leading up to mid s , so in general my friends have a significant understanding of their own personalities and traits .","286335":"yeah , i ve been working hard at bettering myself and my life ever since i first pursued mental health treatment a little over three years ago . my life has significantly improved since that time , especially now that i m living independently and living my life according to my own terms .","286336":"there isn t really much else i rely upon besides scientific , unbiased evidence . i have no spiritual or religious beliefs , and my understanding of the world and society is based upon the studies i ve done personally and read in my own free time .","286337":"to my knowledge , no . they re simply things that have happened to me , and i stopped questioning why a very long time ago because it leads you nowhere . the only thing you can do when you ve been dealt a bad set of cards is learn how to deal with them appropriately , adapt to changes , and work towards bettering yourself and your life .","286338":"the correct answer is that humans have negatively contributed to climate change . that s scientific and not up for debate .","286339":"sometimes , yeah . there are certain instances where people s mistakes catch up to them and they have to pay the penalties , but life is mostly a game of chance and unfairness .","286340":"it doesn t exist for them , no . it may exist for others if those people believe in them , but if you don t personally believe in something , then it is false . these concepts usually happen when people are discussing spiritual or religious beliefs . everyone has their own idea of what or how life is , and everyone is entitled to their opinion .","286341":"cheating , lying , manipulation , ab se , etc etc . in addition , having bigoted viewpoints or oppressive opinions towards other groups of people is a clear turn off and i would have no qualms with breaking up with someone if they were racist , for example .","286342":"someone s personality and intelligence is much more attractive to me than how someone physically looks . obviously physical attraction matters to a degree , but if you don t have emotional chemistry with a person , then the relationship won t last .","286343":"they re not true to me , no . i don t believe they exist .","286344":"everyone is dealt a different set of cards when it comes to life events , obstacles , personal matters , responsibilities , job prospects , etc etc . some people are happy with their lives , while other people aren t . it s simply a fact that we must come to accept .","286345":"i seldom ask for advice , and i prefer to navigate myself through various obstacles and difficulties because it gives me a better chance of learning from the experience , even if i make a mistake .","286346":"you evidently don t understand the fact that i don t believe in the concept of past lives , lol . it s fine that you do i have no qualms with people having their own opinions on life and whatnot . but you should understand that i don t believe past lives exist .","286347":"i don t know who i am , so no . we ve gone through this already .","286348":"that isn t what a past life is , lol . a past life suggests the possibility that you have lived a life prior to the life you re currently living now , prior to your birth . for example , if you were a different individual living in a different era earlier than this current existence . it generally goes hand in hand with reincarnation .","286349":"a very common double standard relates to s xual activities surrounding the men and women population . when a woman sleeps with more than one or two people , she s considered promiscuous or a wh re . however , if a man sleeps with multiple partners , then he s generally praised .","286350":"i don t believe in past lives . . . therefore , there would be no existence of trauma associated with past lives .","286351":"create and append a certain spreadsheet with various information at my job , which i had to obtain from a variety of other spreadsheets and compile into one master spreadsheet , haha . it spanned over the course of the past year or two , so there was a lot of information and it took me a bit of time to grasp the concept and make it .","286352":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","286353":"i don t believe in past lives , so i don t believe in the whole notion of having past life trauma or whatever the term for it is these days .","286354":"i already explained how my day was a few answers ago .","286355":"cope with the prospect that after training my coworker next week , i ll have less job security if my job ever decides they want to fire me . i like the idea of knowing the ins and outs of my particular project with no one else having the same knowledge because there s job security there . but once i train my coworker on how to do the project , my bosses can decide they want to get rid of me whenever they want .","286356":"quite poorly , lmaoo . i have a tendency to suppress my rage until something small sends me over the edge , and then i horribly cope with my anger in self destructive means . it s something that has always happened to me , and although it s lessened in severity since going to therapy , it still happens on occasion . i m definitely not as angry and intense as i used to be compared to when i was in my early s .","286357":"when i was in high school , i scored in the th percentile for the writing english language section of the sats .","286358":"hello do you have a question ?","286359":"i don t watch much youtube except for rooster teeth achievement hunter videos , so i don t know of any youtube couples .","286360":"i m doing fine today much better than i have been compared to the rest of the week , haha . it s friday and i have the weekend to rest and prepare for next week s activities , and i m looking forward to getting some small chores done tomorrow morning while my roommates are asleep and at work .","286361":"eh , it s a very thin line . i believe that one of the few ways it s appropriate to advise someone on how to lose weight if they approach you with the issue first . to outright tell someone they need to lose weight , especially if you don t know them very well , is very rude and uncalled for .","286362":"i haven t had a milkshake in literally years , mainly because too much milk upsets my stomach and they re way too heavy for me . i don t remember what kind it would have been , but i m assuming oreo .","286363":"i value my sleep too much to wait for the sunrise , lmaoo . i personally find sunsets to be more beautiful anyway .","286364":"we met through a mutual friend when we were years old . our mutual friend was someone i went to middle school with , but then she attended high school with him and they became friends . one evening , we all went out together and him and i became acquainted for the very first time .","286365":"the alarmingly high levels of bigotry and intolerance that exists in our society .","286366":"waking up semi early and brewing a big pot of coffee while everyone else is asleep , browsing the internet social media on my laptop while drinking coffee and listening to music for a few hours , going out and getting brunch with a few friends or my boyfriend , and taking a nap in the afternoon . when dusk arrives , i would have a nutritious , fulfilling dinner and then spend the rest of the night at home , drinking a glass of wine while catching up on my favorite shows .","286367":"happiness isn t something that s automatic for the most part , unless you re one of those rare individuals who are always happy for whatever reason . i believe that people should try to find their own happiness in the little things that bring them joy , whether it s through work , relationships , family , hobbies , religion , etc etc .","286368":"my biggest passion is expressing myself and relating to others through writing . it s been the greatest strength , and i find fulfillment in writing things that other people can relate to and find comfort in .","286369":"no , i m actually very stubborn unless someone who opposes my views gives me concrete , unbiased evidence that contradicts my views and makes me think twice about my opinions .","286370":"i don t believe i would want to be born in a different era . sure , things are terrible in current times but they re much more tolerable than in previous eras . considering who i am female , non binary , mentally ill , bisexual , etc etc , there would be a lot more discrimination that i would face .","286371":"i would purchase a new house in full , pay off my remaining debt , go on an extended vacation , purchase a new wardrobe , and then probably donate the rest to charities and other organizations that i support .","286372":"no , i ve never been in a confrontation like that before . i never had visitors when i was living at my parents house anyway , and so far only close friends have visited me my roommates at the new house .","286373":"my bedroom tapestry behind my bed string lights .","286374":"any sort of haunted house , haha . i m terrified of being scared in general , and haunted houses are a big no no for me .","286375":"thankfully , no ! ! it was a relatively quiet day at work . i treated myself to breakfast this morning , i had a quiet and productive work day , and now i m relaxing with some coffee in front of my laptop .","286376":"eh , both depending entirely on my mood and the mindset i m in at that current moment . i either react badly or overreact to situations , or i m extremely methodical and rational towards whatever situation is before me .","286377":"i dislike most drivers when i m driving , especially if they cut others off , switch back and forth between lanes especially if they re not passing on the left , brake abruptly for no reason , don t use blinkers , don t acknowledge right of way rules , and drive slowly in the left lane .","286378":"freedom of speech and or self expression .","286379":"what i ve done by linkin park . https www . youtube . com watch ? v sgycukafqq","286380":"i ve never liked referring to myself as a victim .","286381":"sushi , most definitely . i always say yes to sushi .","286382":"no , i actually enjoy the winter season the cold , the snow , etc etc . i feel more like myself during the fall and winter seasons , and i ve never been a big fan of the spring or summer .","286383":"no , i ve never been arrested before .","286384":"the only reward i take advantage of is amazon prime s reward system if i use one of my credit cards on amazon purchases , it racks up points and i can trade them in for money to reduce the cost of amazon purchases .","286385":"yeah , it s the perfect size . i also obviously like the message .","286386":"make a giant pot of coffee and drink it while perusing the internet social media in the morning . maybe watching television or playing video games . doing some easy household chores to feel productive , then taking a nap in the mid afternoon . end off the night with a glass of wine .","286387":"it went well ! ! it was a lot of fun .","286388":"i prefer to answer questions . my inbox is usually filled and i like lowering the numbers in my inbox , as well as provide good answers to whichever questions pop out at me .","286389":"writing , reading , drawing , painting , playing video games , watching television , sleeping , and hanging out with friends .","286390":"i m honestly not doing so well , but it will eventually come to pass . i ve been an anxious wreck the past few days .","286391":"i like pen and ink drawings , watercolor painting , and charcoal drawings .","286392":"mystic fire topaz and opal are my favorites .","286393":"i don t remember if i got sunburn last summer or not , but definitely the summer prior to that . i ve never gotten horrible sunburn though , even though i use tanning oil instead of sunscreen , lmaoo .","286394":"i m going to my parents house to clean on saturday , then i m coming home to do laundry . on sunday , i m planning on going grocery shopping .","286395":"i go grocery shopping every week or two weeks , but if you re talking about other types of shopping , then not regularly at all . i only ever really shop when i need to buy something for someone as a birthday or holiday gift . sometimes i ll splurge on myself with some clothing , but it s rare .","286396":"i don t like pineapples , so i probably wouldn t like it on pizza . i don t care about what other people do , though .","286397":"port wine cheese spread will always be my favorite .","286398":"how to adequately train my coworker on how to manage the magazine program while i m on vacation next month . there are so many different components to it , and i made a page training guide to accompany the actual training , so at least she has something to reference to if she forgets or has a question when i m gone .","286399":"hello do you have a question ?","286400":"depends on your tolerance and how sensitive you are to horrifying stimuli right before bed . some people can play horror games with no issue , while for others , it can be detrimental to their sleep heath .","286401":"pepperoni , meatballs , and spinach not all on the same pie , though .","286402":"i think cancel culture can be justified in some cases , but also unjustified in other cases . people have the capabilities of realizing their wrongdoings , apologizing , and working to improve themselves . if that person is working to improve themselves based on being called out for something they did wrong , i don t really think that warrants them being canceled . in other cases , i do believe it s right to stop supporting a person , especially in cases of ab se or discriminatory oppressive behavior that is repeated with no apology whatsoever .","286403":"all i need is coffee wine .","286404":"hello do you have a question ?","286405":"my first weekend in the house alone .","286406":"no , i haven t been paying attention to gaming news . i haven t really paid much attention in quite a number of months over a year .","286407":"one of my coworkers , lmaoo . he gave me sorta a back handed compliment the other day regarding my writing , and it put me off in a certain way .","286408":"apparently the human body can go three weeks without food .","286409":"put them on a healthier diet , get rid of the junk food in the house , and suggest that they take up a sport or some other sort of extracurricular activity that will help them remain active .","286410":"they re all from within the past few months . some of them have snapchat filters on them , other ones i m wearing makeup , others i m not wearing makeup at all , etc etc .","286411":"right now , i m particularly stressed out and my mood swings have been coming back somewhat even though i ve been taking my medication regularly . my life could be better , but it also could be a hell of a lot worse . i m thankful for the opportunities and support system that i have . but i have to admit sucks so far .","286412":"i don t generally tell lies because it s more productive and less worrisome to be honest , but i suppose the biggest ones were the ones i told my parents about where i was when i was much , much younger .","286413":"i just googled it , and apparently the answer is yes . lmaoo .","286414":"i suppose halo , considering those are the games i die the most in , lmaoo . i don t really play challenging games , though . i prefer open world , singer player rpgs and a few first person shooters .","286415":"i don t know very much about him because i m only about halfway through the first season . however , it s entirely common for people to have two lives , meaning they live one life as a certain individual with particular meaning and then another life where they re totally different from who they appear as in public .","286416":"i only like posts that i genuinely enjoy , whether it s something i agree with , something i respect , or something that i find to be interesting or creative .","286417":"away from askfm , obviously . lol . i ve just been dealing with some personal things , and then i had a few friends over last night .","286418":"yes , i have some small amounts of credit card debt .","286419":"yes , i m overweight .","286420":"i haven t been online in two days , so you re asking the wrong person .","286421":"you d have to ask shehitsback . i went to her shop , added the items to my cart , and paid , lol . i m not sure how the internal process is .","286422":"yeah , i waited until the one of the site s off deals .","286423":"it s really cozy i bought both him and myself the lightweight hoodies , and i got mine a size larger than what i normally would have ordered because i like hoodies a bit bigger on me . it s pretty soft , but you have to wash it before wearing because redbubble seems like one of those companies that has that weird smell to their clothing when they send it to you .","286424":"that s pretty racist , but mmkay .","286425":"lol , honestly things have been so busy and ridiculous that the time flew by and i completely forgot about christmas . i don t remember everything , but i got him a journal that says memento mori on it he has a tattoo of that saying , a mug , a tee shirt with a bunch of reptiles on it , and a hoodie from shehitsback s store .","286426":"aw , thank you ! !","286427":"no , i ve never surgically altered any parts of my body .","286428":"no , haha . his came in the mail late and we figured it would be easier to just exchange with all of our friends , like a joyous celebration .","286429":"yeah , i used overtone . it s a color depositing conditioner .","286430":"i m normally the passenger during long car rides because i have driving anxiety , and i keep myself entertained through listening to music and simply talking to the other person people in the car .","286431":"made my hair a tad bit darker . i m beginning to hate any sort of blonde on myself these days .","286432":"music , writing , art , literature , nature , my relationships , and being self sufficient .","286433":"i never understood the obsession with the show friends . i ve watched all of it over the years , but i never got the hype .","286434":"yeah , athletes in general get paid way too much money for what they do .","286435":"the games i play usually have large , expansive maps so it s very easy to get lost , haha .","286436":"just sexual nonsense that i always delete . it s despicable how often people inquire about my sex life or strangers sex lives in general .","286437":"as long as the couple isn t being weird about public displays of affection with their friend there , i don t see the big deal with being a third wheel . i ve been the third wheel with a few of my friends and i ve had friends be the third wheel around myself and my boyfriend , so as long as you respect boundaries , it isn t really a big deal .","286438":"my supervisor complimented the training manual i created because i ll be training my coworker on how to take care of the magazine program for when i go on vacation next month . i ended up writing a page guide , lmaoo .","286439":"my eyes , i suppose .","286440":"freshly cleaned after a shower , fuzzy socks , sweatpants and a hoodie , a candle lit , and a good television show on or relaxing music playing in the background .","286441":"depends on the night . some nights , i ve gone to bed as early as pm while other nights it isn t until am .","286442":"my boyfriend and some friends are coming over tomorrow for our very late christmas celebration ! ! we ll be ordering pizza and exchanging gifts .","286443":"i m doing well exhausted , but well . i m currently waiting for the color to set into my hair it needs another minutes so i m going through my inbox in the meantime .","286444":"spinach , egg whites , red peppers , and cheese .","286445":"i m not quite sure what you mean by orientation in a gaming context .","286446":"i m sure some people try to be , but it doesn t go very far .","286447":"what does dignity have anything to do with being sick ?","286448":"the sun set around pm .","286449":"not usually , no . sometimes , i do but most of the time the pain is in my back .","286450":"if they re demanding respect , then that makes me respect them less . lol .","286451":"i ve been trying by drinking flavored seltzer every night , haha .","286452":"nope . i don t drink enough water period .","286453":"if you re talking about new york city , then i would recommend all of the various museums there museum of modern art , museum of natural history , etc etc . i also really want to see the museum of sex since it looks hella interesting , and the comedy cellar is a great place to go for comedy shows .","286454":"i d cash out my bank account and travel cross country with my boyfriend .","286455":"i don t think they re harmful in theory , but i understand why people are so apt to use filters like myself because it presents them in a way that they perceive to be more beautiful by conventional standards .","286456":"i wouldn t be able to put a number to it because i m intelligent in some areas , while extremely lacking in other areas .","286457":"there s one bar that i go to regularly well used to , i haven t been there in over a month . i also frequent the same starbucks and bagel shop every so often in the morning .","286458":"i haven t , but i heard good things about that movie ! !","286459":"lol , yes . i used to alter the coding html for myspace and tumblr layouts when i actively used those websites .","286460":"my day was good productive . i got home from work about an hour ago , and i just finished wrapping some christmas gifts for friends mas and sorted through more of my belongings mainly art supplies that i accidentally left at my parents house .","286461":"no , there isn t anything interesting where i live so there would be no reason for tourists to visit . unless you mean new york city , the hamptons , or montauk then yeah , there are plenty of tourists there .","286462":"yeah , i ve texted and talked on the phone while driving before .","286463":"i did already this morning .","286464":"i m not comfortable discussing finances like that on askfm .","286465":"it was degrees fahrenheit this morning , lol .","286466":"hey everyone , go buy some merch from shehitsback ! ! the lightweight hoodies are super comfy her art is fantastic .","286467":"there was no way they would sell the car again , haha . if anything , they would have broken it down for parts .","286468":"i d rather not discuss it .","286469":"don t stop believing by journey or living on a prayer by bon jovi .","286470":"yes , which is why i m so cautious about what i post online and why most of my accounts are private .","286471":"i m not the biggest fan of his , but the actor owen wilson shares a birthday with me .","286472":"yes , tomorrow is a regular work day .","286473":"no , i have no interest in the oscars .","286474":"no , i didn t dress up for halloween last year .","286475":"i ve never been interested in world of warcraft .","286476":"i read up on wikipedia about various criminal cases , but that s pretty much it these days . i used to use wikipedia a lot more often when i worked in the law office to gain a better understanding of some medical disabilities .","286477":"whenever someone has asked why or how i m non binary , i simply explain to them that i don t identify as either of the binaries of gender which are man and woman . my gender is largely undefined and fluid , but i ve never identified solely as a man or solely as a woman .","286478":"i would much rather have one best friend as opposed to several good friends who may not know me as well or relate to me as well as that single best friend . quality over quantity , that s what is important .","286479":"i wouldn t know , i m not around children ever and i have no idea what s trending in terms of children s toys .","286480":"male and female are sexes . they aren t genders . man and woman , however , are genders . most people who are trans don t feel right with their assigned gender from an early age , and over time , they come to realize that they re simply in the wrong type of body .","286481":"everyone defines their gender in their own way , and gender exists in a spectrum in my eyes . you can identify as a man or a woman , or you can be genderfluid or non binary or anywhere in between .","286482":"the best phase of my life is quite possibly my present reality . i have a strong support system , my depression and anxiety are mostly managed , i have a stable job and a house of my own , and i m away from the toxic environment that plagued me as a child . i finally feel free .","286483":"my teenage years were the worst phases of my life . i was extremely depressed , anxious , s icidal , and paranoid . i didn t see the purpose of living and had no support system . my only solace was in writing and in my schoolwork in the hopes that i could escape from where i was and start life over .","286484":"i d like to be remembered for my writing , as well as for my advocacy for mental health awareness and rights for those who are disabled both physically and mentally .","286485":"i m most thankful for the love and support i ve been given throughout recent years of my life when i ve been struggling . without the encouragement of my close friends and boyfriend , i wouldn t have had the strength to continue seeking mental health treatment and i probably would have entered into a much , much darker place and possibly died .","286486":"financial stability , emotional stability , and for my loved ones not to experience hardship anymore .","286487":"staying inside , sharing a good meal together , getting tipsy and or high , and spending the night watching a silly movie or videos on youtube and talking about anything that comes to mind .","286488":"honestly , my home or my boyfriend s home . they re both sources of comfort for me , and i feel most at home and relaxed there .","286489":"drinking alcohol on work nights with the knowledge that i m going to inevitably wake up feeling absolutely terrible .","286490":"i haven t gotten a manicure done in at least two years .","286491":"i believe the truth is more important . it s no use lying to someone to save their feelings because they re ultimately going to find out the truth eventually , and then it will land on you for being not truthful towards them from the very beginning . i would much rather be told the truth and be hurt by it than to live in a lie because someone was afraid to hurt my feelings .","286492":"last year well , i guess two years ago considering it s now , my boyfriend surprised me with tickets to a wine and beer tasting event after hours at a local aquarium . we drove out there earlier in the day and stopped at a restaurant and a new brewery that had opened , and then we went to the event afterwards . it was a lot of fun , and a complete surprise because he never spoke a word of it which is unusual because he can never keep things like that a secret , lol . we spent the night in a hotel in the same area and got high and watched ancient aliens for the rest of the night .","286493":"if they re important to my friend , then it s important to me that i come off as a good friend . so in a way , yes . not so much pleasing them personally as much as it is looking out for my own friend and also me gauging the other person to make sure they re a good person too .","286494":"perhaps that i m a better , funnier , wittier , more attractive person than i actually am .","286495":"i ve seen , lol . that s why i said it wasn t funny that they ve been sending it to multiple people . they re obviously looking for some sort of attention or validation .","286496":"no , i ve learned to accept my mistakes and misguided thoughts . to be stubborn in the face of your own faults isn t healthy , and there s no excuse in defending yourself and digging yourself a deeper hole when others point out that you re wrong . it s easier to accept your wrongdoings , learn from them , and move on .","286497":"i get very scared and anxious . i don t like meeting new people , i feel like there s some sort of expectation there that i won t be able to live up to .","286498":"i d like to live as passionately as possible , with no regrets or qualms about my actions and also accepting my mistakes . i d like to live more in the moment while simultaneously acknowledging the past and future , whatever that may be . as for death , i think about it often and i believe it s more suitable for me to die in a blaze of glory as opposed to passing silently .","286499":"not really , no . i m just pointing out your own behavior and telling you it s wrong in case you didn t know already .","286500":"this actually made me laugh out loud today .","286501":"towards my own sentiment , yeah . it s stupid for you to be sending out the same comment to several people in an attempt to be funny but just coming off as rude . it s very immature .","286502":"? ? ? you ve sent this to multiple people obviously it isn t funny , lol .","286503":"anxiety ridden thoughts filled with nonsensical scenarios and irrationality .","286504":"my roommate and i were discussing what to get our friends for our very late christmas party , lmaoo .","286505":"i ve only ever gone to one gym in my area , and it was semi crowded but nothing overwhelming . there are gyms everywhere around here , though , so i never thought over crowding would be an issue . it ultimately depends on where you live and the access people have to specific gyms . in areas where there aren t many gyms , then yeah they ll be more crowded .","286506":"yes , i get both good and bad vibes from various people upon meeting them for a first few times .","286507":"i ve replied to certain people on social media , like the members from rooster teeth or achievement hunter . i never expect a reply , but it happens on occasion .","286508":"there are gas stations all over the place , lol . i just go to the closest gas station to wherever i am .","286509":"thank you","286510":"i like multigrain .","286511":"a loaf of bread , depending on what kind you buy , is around or so . i buy bread every week because i make sandwiches for lunch at work .","286512":"my week was stressful , but overall fine . i was a nervous wreck due to my car but now that everything is fixed , i feel much better . i m going to the mall with my roommate today to pick up some last minute gifts for a very late friends mas that we re hosting later this week .","286513":"thank you by led zeppelin is perhaps my favorite .","286514":"why did you censor the word fat ? lmaoo . i m fat due to a combination of my medication as well as living a sedentary lifestyle .","286515":"not very well , haha . i have a tendency to drink alcohol when i m stressed , which works in the moment but then i feel terrible the next day .","286516":"i only use uber if i m going out drinking , which is rare these days . i use my car to drive to work every day , to go to the grocery store , to go to the pharmacy , etc etc . it s integral to drive where i live .","286517":"i ve never lived on my own before , so idk . the setup i have now works out well living with my good friend and his brother .","286518":"i don t give out coins , especially upon request from total strangers .","286519":"the car i had prior to my current car was just worn down , it had a lot of miles on it , and it wasn t worth it to fix it based on the value on the car . i traded it in to buy my current car .","286520":"fixing my car would be the utmost priority . it s my livelihood , i can t do much without my car .","286521":"i got two new tires .","286522":"of course . if i wasn t then i would change them , haha . it took me about a year to find the right cocktail of meds .","286523":"yeah , i got it fixed yesterday . it set me back a few hundred dollars .","286524":"not anymore , no . i ve been taking them for almost three years .","286525":"well , i only woke up minutes ago so it s been fine thus far . the only things i ve done are make breakfast , have a cup of coffee , and take my medication .","286526":"i ve never lived in a big city before but then again , the closest big city to me is new york city , lol . i ve always lived in smaller towns , but they re also never been rural towns . they re simply suburban areas . i would hate to live in a big city , due to the congestion and population and noise and busy ness of everyday life . i prefer a quieter , simpler existence .","286527":"apparently compression shorts are made for workout sessions , so it s appropriate and normal for people to wear them to the gym . it doesn t matter to me what other people wear while they work out , though .","286528":"i don t really understand what you mean by this ? could you elaborate ?","286529":"beer or wine . lately , i ve been drinking cabernet sauvignon wine or various forms of ipas beer .","286530":"i m not a fan of sports , so neither .","286531":"whether or not they re wanted or loved in the household , haha . it s easy to tell when people have pet rats because they have their own living space within the house .","286532":"no , definitely not . i have social anxiety and prefer to be unknown to most people , and fame would not suit me . i would absolutely hate to be recognized on the streets by random passerbys and be interrupted all the time .","286533":"according to google , this is a county in england . i ve never left the united states before .","286534":"i don t really go shopping anywhere , except to the grocery store and the pharmacy , lmaoo . when i buy clothing and whatnot , i normally buy them online . the last places i bought clothing from were torrid and blackcraft cult .","286535":"if i m looking for a good time , i usually text a friend or two and they ll either come over my house or we ll go out to the bar and drink together .","286536":"milk , flavored seltzer , coffee creamer , cold cuts , cheese , eggs , butter , chicken , leftover alfredo noodles from dinner the other night , a variety of salad dressings and condiments , beer , and iced tea .","286537":"thank you","286538":"no , i was indifferent to most of my teachers and professors .","286539":"use ketchup on fries i used to hate ketchup with a burning passion . quit smoking . exist in a long term relationship .","286540":"not really , i don t know how to cook many things besides the basics .","286541":"of course not . name calling and insults are not to be tolerated in an argument .","286542":"unfortunately , it has become normalized in society which is bad because it only increases the stigma around mental illness , making people out to be crazy if they display any sort of different personality traits than what s considered normal . mentally ill people have been chastised for being crazy for so long , and in the long term , it s damaging . just for some context , fyi . i m not personally bothered if someone uses the word crazy or calls me crazy , but i do understand the implications of such a word and some people do consider it an ableist slur .","286543":"askfm is for asking questions , not necessarily for conversations .","286544":"common sense would be to see a picture on the internet , shrug it off , and move on with your day . evidently , you cannot do that because you re so bothered by unconventional standards of beauty and will resort to personal attacks simply because you disagree with something . cc shehitsback","286545":"no , you re totally justified in being upset if your boyfriend is calling you crazy . that isn t a word to be taken lightly , and it s completely wrong of him to accuse you of that regardless of the rationality of your behavior . he s acting extremely toxic and unhealthy .","286546":"no , i seldom experience mania . i just have the house to myself tonight , so i enjoy the silence and lack of company .","286547":"show them love and compassionate whenever possible , especially if you know they re going through a difficult time but are too afraid to speak up about it . be there for them if they do reach out , don t disregard or invalidate their concerns , and make time for them whenever possible .","286548":"depends on how i m feeling that day . tonight , i m content with staying in , watching television or playing video games , lighting a candle , and drinking some wine .","286549":"i m not vegan , but i try to have plant based alternatives whenever possible . i ate a veggie burger for dinner tonight .","286550":"just try to remain cognizant of how you re behaving towards them , and fix yourself accordingly .","286551":"no . i don t vote on polls or follow people upon request . i understand your need for recognition and validation , but you won t find it here .","286552":"if they haven t given you a reason to not trust their authority or judgment , but you re being cautious and questioning them anyway , then i do find that to be a bit disrespectful . i understand having bad experiences from past jobs , but you simply have to learn how to compartmentalize and start fresh with each new job . every job has different staff and a different atmosphere .","286553":". . . dipping pizza in hummus . . . ? what the hell . i was talking to my coworker about the purple mattress it s a brand , supposed to give quality sleep and then i started seeing ads for it all over facebook and instagram .","286554":"if it was in self defense , then i wouldn t really consider that to be bad . you were sticking up for yourself , i m assuming .","286555":"i want to have a cheeseburger for dinner , but we have no buns . we have hot dog buns , so i m debating on just cutting the burgers in half and putting them on the hot dog buns , lmaoo .","286556":"i don t have children . i would want them to be compassionate towards others , though , and treat others how they would like to be treated in return . you simply don t know what someone could be going through , so it s best to treat everyone with caution and kindness unless shown otherwise .","286557":"lol . i figured that s what they meant , but i wanted to make a joke out of it . in all seriousness who the f ck cares . i don t shave my armpits , i have friends who don t shave their armpits , and it s literally no one s business what someone else does with their own body hair . it s just hair .","286558":"because they re too afraid , insecure , or threatened by the truth .","286559":"i was walking to a comedy show in manhattan last month , and i ended up stumbling i didn t fall because my shoe caught the edge of something . i was almost embarrassed , but the woman walking behind me said something along the lines of , don t worry about that , that happens to me all the time ! these damn streets . it made me feel instantly better , haha .","286560":"eh , i agree with it in some cases , but disagree in other cases . in a work related context , i believe that you shouldn t fake anything or pretend to know something that you don t know because that gives greater chance of mistakes happening .","286561":"i just woke up from a hour nap , and i couldn t believe that i slept for that long .","286562":"definitely keanu reeves and that s not a bad thing at all .","286563":"i can t imagine any scenario where someone would not have armpits unless their arms were amputated .","286564":"one day the earth will open wide and i ll follow you inside , cause the only hell i know is without you . some day when galaxies collide , we ll be lost on different skies . i will send my rocket ship to find you . die for you by starset .","286565":"life simply isn t fair it s as easy as that . i don t believe in karma , and i don t believe that bad people eventually get what s coming to them . i also don t believe that if a person is a good person , then they re bound to stumble upon great news or events .","286566":"these days , not very often . i used to judge others harshly when i was much younger , more stubborn , and more naive . but as an adult now , i m much more contemplative of people s backgrounds and motives and compassionate towards what a person has gone through in order for them to behave in the way they re behaving .","286567":"you can simultaneously love a person freely and also have personal boundaries they re not mutually exclusive . it s healthy to have some personal boundaries , and what matters most is whether or not your friend and or partner respects them .","286568":"essentially everything i dwell on the past , present , and future , i rehearse events in my mind and contemplate things i could have done differently , and sometimes my thoughts turn dark and lead down a destructive path .","286569":"i don t usually hide things from people , and i m very transparent in my thoughts and feelings .","286570":"unconditional love and support .","286571":"i don t know if i ve ever taught anyone lessons about anything . if i have , i m certainly unaware of them .","286572":"sometimes , life is meaningless to me . other times , life is full of meaning and passion and adventure . it all depends on how i m feeling that day .","286573":"most of my friends have different personalities from me , and they re usually extremely bold , outspoken , unique individuals who have no qualms or social anxieties when it comes to speaking their mind . i speak my mind when it s appropriate , but certainly not to the extent that they do .","286574":"in years , my life will be completely different from how it is today . i ll be years old , and approaching life from a different perspective compared to me in my late s . i ll be older , wiser , and probably more responsible .","286575":"i don t believe i ve ever cried over a character before , but i ve certainly been shocked and upset .","286576":"personally , being ignored is a worse feeling for me because it shows me that those people truly do not care . if i go to someone and they flat out ignore me or my feelings , then it taints the friendship and i won t be able to trust them .","286577":"no , i don t agree with that at all . jealousy is a toxic emotion and if you re jealous of your partner , you have to look within yourself and realize why you re feeling that emotion in the first place . it usually comes from a place of insecurity .","286578":"i wouldn t be able to put a percentage on it because it likely changes all the time . people also have the capability of change and can go from being an untrustworthy person to being a better person based on self improvement .","286579":"in a healthy relationship , some pros would be having someone to talk to about your issues and struggles with no judgment , being comfortable enough to be silly with your partner , having fun with your partner , considering your partner your best friend as well as your lover , and being motivated by your partner to be the best version of yourself you can possibly be . there really shouldn t be any cons to being in a relationship . sure , arguments do happen occasionally but you both should be working towards the same goals . if your partner is making you feel bad , if they re controlling you , or downright being ab sive and manipulative , then that isn t healthy .","286580":"self motivation is essential for people who want to be somewhere else , whether in a physical or metaphorical sense . you need to truly want it for yourself and be motivated enough to pursue whatever it is you want , which also includes creating the resources you need . it does happen to people , quite often actually . if you have a goal that you re seeking and have the strength and capability to pursue and accomplish it , then nothing can stand in your way .","286581":"in order to properly answer this question , i would require an understanding of what life was like when i was growing up . i don t remember my own childhood , so it s difficult to really say how growing up in the s would compare to children who are growing up now .","286582":"arrogance . nothing turns me off more from a person than if they re displaying signs of being arrogant , or believing that they re superior to others in some form or another .","286583":"we are not composed of things on the contrary , our personas are entirely unique in that these things become relevant to us based upon our own interpretation of the world and society . our things , such as our belongings or our interests or our passions , are only a small fragment of who we are as a whole , and we should treat them as such in order to preserve our own integrity and realize our true positions in the world .","286584":"progress further with mental health treatment . take more time out for self care . travel more often . say yes to more opportunities for growth and adventure . be more compassionate towards myself .","286585":"writing is my thing . writing has remained with me for decades , even from a young age , and it s been my most productive and healthy means of self expression . i also enjoy it greatly putting into words my own experiences and feelings , mostly using metaphors .","286586":"i ve never had an issue with throwing away old belongings . items aren t very sentimental to me , and when i moved out of my parents house , i got rid of basically of my own belongings because i didn t really use or need them .","286587":"no , i don t care for them very much . i haven t watched an award show in general in many years .","286588":"open minded , patient , compassionate , selfless , helpful , pragmatic , and responsible .","286589":"i suppose it depends on the sibling dynamic and how much older the older sibling is compared to the younger sibling . i agree with you , though . parents should be the ones enforcing discipline .","286590":"i m not entirely sure , tbh . certainly not in new york , that s for certain ! !","286591":"living in a cottage somewhere in nature , having a giant fireplace and hardwood floors and ornate rugs , and my own study with my laptop , books , and reading nook where i can write and draw inspiration .","286592":"the internet is a conglomeration of happy , devastating , intriguing , and downright frustrating people and events , but combined together , has revolutionized how we see technology as a whole .","286593":"creative writing , probably . that s my strong suit .","286594":"raspberries , blueberries , peaches , apples , and bananas . we also buy spinach , broccoli , cauliflower , carrots , and corn .","286595":"well , i just spent a pretty penny on getting my tires replaced , an oil change , and my brake pads and rotors replaced . it was necessary , but super expensive . then it started snowing super hard , and i passed by two accidents on the way home . people are ridiculous when it comes to driving in the snow , even though it happens all the time .","286596":"music , whether it s singing or playing an instrument ! ! i absolutely love all different kinds of music and it s something i m very passionate about .","286597":"i walk around until it feels better .","286598":"there are so many people on my friends list on facebook who advertise different products for those pyramid marketing schemes . it s super annoying .","286599":"my boyfriend and close friends are the biggest influences on me .","286600":"personally , i have a tendency to obsess over the things i like but it s normal for people to be fans of things without becoming obsessed .","286601":"i have a book or two of poetry from lang leav , so yeah .","286602":"i ve been on boats before , just not a cruise line .","286603":"i haven t been to the mall in years , haha . i don t remember if i bought anything or not .","286604":"i would certainly hope that it would help solve heinous crimes , but there s always the chance that it would be used to frame the innocent .","286605":"most of my tattoos are hidden , so obviously yeah .","286606":"dogs are more apt to eat their owners if they pass away in the house rather than cats , and hamsters have been known to use the deceased s body as a home .","286607":"yes , definitely . i have plans for two more at the moment , and i eventually want to cover most of my body .","286608":"i don t really pay attention to trends , so i m not sure what s trending these days . i have my own sense of style , but even that changes , lol .","286609":"it depends on my mood . sometimes , i prefer the silence while other times i like having music play in the background .","286610":"is garlic an herb ? haha . i like ranch dressing as well .","286611":"my back , my forearm , my upper arm , my ribs , my upper thigh , the back of my calf , and my ankle .","286612":"thank you very much ! !","286613":"i have seven tattoos .","286614":"over , always .","286615":"automatic rifles and other various types of firearms that can hurt a lot of people in a very short period of time . they re completely unnecessary .","286616":"i ve never been on a haunted house tour , mainly because i find them terrifying and i don t like being scared due to my anxiety , haha .","286617":"depends on the individual some people find benefit in therapy , while others don t . personally , therapy has helped me a lot over the years .","286618":"i honestly can t remember the last time i had sprinkles on something , haha . but i ll usually grab a frosted donut with sprinkles if they re brought in at work or something .","286619":"all of my friends make me laugh .","286620":"surprisingly , i ve never watched the simpsons before .","286621":"i haven t gone yet , the cruise is next month . we re going down to florida first and then the bahamas ! !","286622":"having the chance to go out to local nature preserves and see all of the trees and foliage blooming again .","286623":"not really , no . i love the winter time with the exception of the blizzards we sometimes get in my region , haha . i like the cold weather .","286624":"i would rather drive a more practical vehicle that works well and isn t just for show . functionality is much more reliable than aesthetic appearance .","286625":"honestly , i can t even remember the last time i went to the movie theater . i really want to see underwater with kristin stewart , though . it looks intense .","286626":"does my portion of money towards the cruise count ? haha . it was around . i don t regret buying it whatsoever . i know it s going to be a really fun time .","286627":"i don t normally forget things because i only bring with me my wallet , keys , cell phone , and vape when i go out . in some cases , i ll bring a phone charger too .","286628":"my dream job is to be a freelance stay at home writer who publishes books and poetry for a living .","286629":"indifferent . it s just something that occurs when sunlight hits droplets of water , there s no meaning behind it .","286630":"i m currently in a relationship .","286631":"not so much a headache , just a sluggish feeling and a bit nauseous .","286632":"during the weekdays , i wake up for work around am . i don t have an alarm set on the weekends .","286633":"food doesn t change my mood usually , unless i haven t eaten in multiple hours to the point where i become irritable , lmaoo .","286634":"hungover and frustrated , but otherwise fine .","286635":"he does at times , and i never indicated otherwise . if he has work in the morning , though , i either visit him at his house or i don t see him because his house is closer to his job than my house is .","286636":"i like creativity , in terms of writing style . i also like floral descriptions , haha . i value a book that s well written and also has an interesting story line .","286637":"yes , i would take his name if i were to get married .","286638":"i know absolutely nothing about the prison system , so i don t have an answer to this question .","286639":"nope , i never tried either .","286640":"on instagram , i share posts related to current events or mental health awareness on my story . i also post a lot of music . on snapchat , i seldom post stories but they re usually related to the cats i live with , lmaoo .","286641":"i first drank a four loko spiked seltzer , but now i m drinking an ipa .","286642":"i m well . drunk , but well .","286643":"my phone automatically goes to a lower setting after pm , if that counts for anything .","286644":"i m five

prefer coffee for myself . i can drink a pot a day .","286655":"i m not around children , so i don t know how much time they spend inside on electronics versus how much time they spend outside . it s partially the parents responsibility to enforce certain rules in the household , though .","286656":"i don t watch regular television . when i did , though , i liked sy fy and the history channel .","286657":"you have the freedom of choice , my dude .","286658":"somewhere in between , but more leaning on the thin side . the walls keep in the warmth , but you can hear everything going on inside the house .","286659":"over years , probably . i never liked peanut butter and jelly sandwiches .","286660":"never . i dislike milk , and i rarely even take it in my coffee anymore these days . i

, alternative , hip hop , classical , and pop .","286663":"i m exhausted , but otherwise fine . i ve been driving on a tire that s bordering on being flat for the past two weeks , so i ve been filling

.","286669":"for the most part , yeah . most of my meals are a combination of protein , carbs , and vegetables .","286670":"no , i m not tan .","286671":"neither , i only ever have it if it s fried or baked into some other sort of dish . my pizza and burger orders are very simple .","286672":"rainbow cookies and mini chocolate chip cannolis .","286673":"you can t tell whether or not someone is trans based on their appearance , so the idea that you re not attracted to someone because you find out that they re trans is inherently transphobic .","286674":"fried . i like raw peppers too ,

.","286684":"somewhere surrounded by nature .","286685":"writing is my passion . i m also passionate about advocacy for mental health awareness .","286686":"of course . even if the bodies aren t found , it s right to lay them to rest in a metaphorical sense so that the family gets a sense of closure .","286687":"no , there is no such thing as love at first sight . it s simply lust , and you re

.","286690":"they re art pieces by shehitsback .","286691":"someone who truly loves you wouldn t want you to change unless you re exhibiting toxic behavior . if your behavior is otherwise healthy ,

them less .","286703":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","286704":"i try to get things done early . if there s one thing that college has taught me , it s that it s best to get things done early so that you re not extremely anxious and rushed towards the end . work is done better when you re not posed with an irrational deadline .","286705":"definitely not . based on personal experience , i ve learned that life is ultimately worth experiencing regardless of what trauma you ve endured . you should be willing to give yourself a second chance at living because life is wholly unpredictable and you simply don t know when things will turn out for the better .","286706":"i found out that there are at least people sick with the flu in my office , which is making me extremely nervous . the last thing i want to do is get sick again .","286707":"i m more of a minimalist these days . when i moved out of my parents house , i got rid of perhaps of my things and only kept a few

to one of my favorite coffees after work .","286711":"years ago , eight years old wouldn t know , i can t remember that long ago . years ago , years old depressed , s icidal , self destructive , and creative . years ago , years old still depressed , s icidal , but also motivated and learning my passions . five years ago , years old still depressed , but very determined to begin my life after earning a college degree and establishing a career for myself . one year ago , years old in recovery from mental illness , holding a good job , and living on my own away from my parents .","286712":"depends on my mood that day . sometimes , they weigh heavy on my mind while other times , i can compartmentalize and store them away until another time .","286713":"i like boneless wings , and i usually order garlic parmesan or buffalo wings .","286714":"my boyfriend , my best friend , and one of my close friends .","286715":"true , to a certain extent . i do believe experience is a

super stressed and i need to decompress .","286719":"i honestly don t know very much about the logistics behind it . i haven t looked into politics in quite a while .","286720":"it could be a red flag , sure . name calling in general is just immature , and it s very disrespectful to your partner if you re calling them names during an argument . relationships should ideally be about open communication , and if you resort to calling your partner names as a defense mechanism , then that s very unhealthy .","286721":"shehitsback urlsareshittbh celinem misphire littlesha","286722":"i have one alarm set for am , but if i don t dismiss it , then it repeats itself every minutes until i turn it off .","286723":"if it s possible for colleges to be tuition free , then yes completely . or , at the very least , a hell of a lot less expensive than they are now . even community colleges are expensive af , and it s a privilege these days to even attend college university because of the cost of tuition .","286724":"i honestly can t remember . not so much because it was a long time ago or anything , but things like that just slip my mind because it s not such a big deal to me .","286725":"they re a few years old , so i m not sure if that s new or old at this point . i buy new jeans every now and again based on weight fluctuations , but that s all . i also bought two

morning . i drank my coffee too fast , lol .","286738":"that was the first and only time amazon has screwed up my order , thankfully . i ve heard it happening to other people , though .","286739":"it s unfortunate that i give off that impression , but i suppose it s based on my syntax and verbiage . i mostly get serious questions , so i answer in a serious manner .","286740":"i mean on askfm . i ve discussed it in depth with my boyfriend , close friends , and therapist .","286741":"she s my roommate s cat .","286742":"i like them soft , not harder . the rice i usually buy are flavored , like

my appearance or personality .","286744":"there was an ableist anon who was conversing with me about a week or so ago , and it was frustrating to try to explain to them how they were being ableist .","286745":"i can t remember the last time something on askfm upset me , lol .","286746":"i d rather not . we discussed a lot of various things , and it was more of a compilation of my progress since i first started seeing her until the present day .","286747":"compliments don t bother or sway me one way or another , they only really mean something when it s coming from someone i care about .","286748":"i use microwavable rice . lmaoo .","286749":"the cat isn t one of the most precious things to me . i value the importance of my bed , laptop , and television ."}}
