then he wouldn t have spent eight years of his life with me . lmao .","304350":"contrary to popular belief , men can be faithful . if he was unhappy with our relationship , then he would have ended it ages ago .","304351":"i ve trained a few people so far , and i ve always been patient and willing when it comes to my job . it also helped that the people i trained knew what they were doing already , i just had to inform them of things to look out for especially and different aspects of microsoft office .","304352":"i either go during the weekdays after work or super early in the morning on the

consider myself to be beautiful , so the idea makes me uncomfortable .","304359":"he s never been offended he requires alone time when he s upset too , so he completely understands .","304360":"i ve not responded to texts before they weren t urgent or anything , but i always answer his phone calls just in case something bad happened and he needed to speak with me . in those cases , then i ll talk to him but only for maybe five minutes before telling him what s going on and i need some quiet time .","304361":"i honestly don t know of any real celebrity who has an account on askfm , and the fact that so many random people make fake accounts trying to prove its them especially the ariana grande ones , lol is pathetic .","304362":"depends on what s upsetting me . sometimes i need time left alone while other times i need my boyfriend to calm me down by talking to me .","304363":"you have a valid point , but sometimes it s nice to sit down and do nothing for a change . everyone needs time to recoop .","304364":"good morning , friends ask me questions ! ! i have a full day ahead of me with nothing to really do .","304365":"i don t remember most of my dreams , but i doubt there s any significant meaning behind them .","304366":"i woke up early because i went to bed super early last night , i think i was asleep around pm . also , my body s natural clock always wakes me up early

and dogs , but i ve only ever had a dog out of those two because my family doesn t like cats very much . i do reckon that my boyfriend and i will have both cats and dogs when we move in together , though . rofl .","304371":"i think it entirely depends on the couple . your friend s relationship may seem fast to an outsider , but perhaps they do have a wild chemistry that makes their progression make sense to them because they connect on such an intimate level . i ve also known some people who moved fast in relationships , but again , it all depends on the relationship itself as there s no universal way of determining milestones in relationships . some people take longer than others , but as long as both people are comfortable with their progression and it feels right to them , then that s all that really matters .","304372":"they don t usually get the death penalty , although i wouldn t be opposed to a vigilante doing the world a favor .","304373":"i throw them in the garbage

no .","304376":"i m against the death penalty . i think it s barbaric and an outdated means of punishment . plus , it s more of a punishment to let those criminals rot in jail in solitary anyway .","304377":"because some anons think they re entitled to information about strangers sex lives . i ve consistently stated that i don t talk about my sex life on askfm , so that s why i figured the anon was new to my page .","304378":"are you saying yes to the fact that you re new to my page , or are you answering the anonymous question on my behalf ? ? rofl .","304379":"you must be new to my page if you think i would answer this question .","304380":"my day has been fine . i got woken up by my boyfriend bringing me breakfast and coffee in bed , and then we hung out until he had to go to work . since i got home , i ve been browsing websites and shopping online for xmas gifts . i also just woke up from a nap so i ll probably make another cup of coffee before having dinner .","304381":"sure , but it doesn t mean i ll answer it . lol .","304382":"probably at some point in the past , but it isn t something i explicitly remember .","304383":"you d be surprised at how helpful doctors and therapists can be , as long as you allow yourself open to the idea that you need to share your feelings in order to begin healing .","304384":"i m sorry that you don t have the option to see a doctor right now . however , there are online resources that can help with depression as well as talk and crisis hotlines . i m also pretty sure there s a texting service you can use depending on where you live if you re not comfortable talking on the phone . try to keep in mind that the opportunity will present itself for you to receive help , though . it may not be right now but you will get there in time , and you deserve to see the day where you can finally get professional help for your mental illness .","304385":"no , i don t think they did . then again , it s different because there s a large age gap between me and my brother so it s not as if we were raised at the same time .","304386":"depends on what you need help with .","304387":"sure , that seems totally possible . if one parent favors one child over the other , it could lead to feelings of jealousy and resentment between the two siblings because one feels appreciated while the other does not .","304388":"technically , at least eight hours per day my job entails reading , proofreading , and writing so i m constantly reading documents critically .","304389":"pto paid time off .","304390":"not that i can recall , actually . i know people who have ruined movies , songs , etc etc . , for me but i don t think it was as if they were intentionally out to ruin that particular item . it just ended up being a byproduct of their behavior and my association of that item with that person .","304391":"i might go on a small weekend trip with my boyfriend his family within the next month or so , depending on how much pto i still have available come january . if that happens , then that would be exciting .","304392":"i do most of my shopping online these days , especially when it comes to holiday shopping . i shop in stores for small things i need , i . e . toothpaste and deodorant , as well as food shopping , but everything else is bought online . i don t think i ve bought a single xmas gift in store yet , rofl .","304393":"no , i absolutely hate the sound of my own voice . i was cringing last night because i was singing so loudly at the concert could hear myself , lol . i felt terrible for the people sitting next to me .","304394":"i ve always liked the name louis ! ! it s a generic name that s quite common , but for some reason it has always appealed to me . i think it also partly has to do with the fact that it was the name of one of my boyfriend s uncles who was an admirable man .","304395":"ideally , humans should be well informed about a lot of things . it wouldn t hurt for people in general to be more informed about sex and sexuality because it can only lead to more inclusivity regarding lgbt communities .","304396":"oh , lol . sorry , i m still hungover from last night . i think hehe is more juvenile with a hint of mischievous intent , while haha is more neutral .","304397":"yes , i believe in the concept of free will .","304398":"president

always identified more with the villains of stories , lol .","304403":"lust and love are two different entities . lust can be described as a strong s xual desire for someone , while love doesn t necessarily have any connection with sex at all . most of the time , love occurs without interference from lust .","304404":"probably some drunken shenanigan that has slipped my memory .","304405":"just because you ve been lucky with the pull out method doesn t mean it works . people can still get pregnant from pre c m so there s just as much of a risk there than if someone didn t pull out . the pill is around effective , while pulling out definitely is not . there s a reason no doctors recommend it as an effective means of birth control .","304406":"i ve always wanted to travel , so yes . it would be interesting to travel the world and gain new experiences .","304407":"i think companies should hire based on skill and experience , not how attractive someone may be . if you want your company to function effectively , you need good workers , and that has nothing to do with how a person looks .","304408":"the pull out method is ineffective , and those who actually use it as their only means of birth control don t have a genuine understanding of sex and pregnancy . you can still get pregnant by pulling out . you can get pregnant even if the male doesn t finish . there s still viable sperm in pre c m and i ve known people who got pregnant off of it .","304409":"misphire sends out great spam questions ! ! i also love the questions you send out too .","304410":"depends on what i eat . sometimes i have dairy sensitivities , so my stomach gets upset if i have too much dairy . it s been happening to me a lot lately .","304411":"hello i m doing well , albeit a bit hungover ! ! lmao . i went to a concert in brooklyn last night and didn t get home until early in the morning . luckily i took today off from work to recover .","304412":"i honestly only use body sprays , haha . lately i ve been using rose quartz and moonstone by bath and body works .","304413":"i don t have much of a view , lol . it s just other people s houses and the street .","304414":"of course not . if he lost his job , he would be actively seeking a new one .","304415":"it was so good ! ! omg , i nearly cried when mike shinoda came on , lol . the bands were all amazing and it was a really good time .","304416":"ugh same . although i also love geoff jeremy . and barbara is legit the nicest person i ve ever met , she s a literal doll .","304417":"it would totally be about video games , and i would invite geoff ramsey , markiplier , and seananners .","304418":"i seldom remember my dreams , and my most bizarre dream is too grotesque to describe on askfm .","304419":"pretty much any song by my chemical romance , taking back sunday , brand new , and hawthorne heights .","304420":"lmfao , what . it s literally an avatar .","304421":"how do i act ? ?","304422":"i have seven tattoos , and my first tattoo was a yin yang on my shoulder blades .","304423":"i m not really big into sports , but i saw a hockey game at madison square garden and it was a lot of fun . i like the new york rangers .","304424":"i wear a fitbit everyday and it has the time on it , so technically yes ? ?","304425":"i don t think so , but apparently i ve been talking in my sleep lately , lmao .","304426":"i drink coffee with one stevia and a little bit of cream .","304427":"i honestly don t remember what i did last weekend , lmao .","304428":"i was sleeping when you sent me this message .","304429":"i think some do , but most of them don t . it just comes out of your paycheck every week .","304430":"i already have a boyfriend , and money doesn t mean much to me in terms of our relationship because i m not materialistic like that . granted , if he was doing nothing but sitting on his as all day and not looking for a job , then there would probably be some issues . but my boyfriend has always been the opposite of that .","304431":"we ve been saving , but it isn t an overnight thing unfortunately . while my new job came with a pay raise , it pretty much equals out to the same thing my old job paid me because of all of the insurance that gets taken out of my paycheck each week which i didn t have with my previous job since i was under . my boyfriend got a promotion recently but the actual monetary value was sh tty . granted , we re both in better positions than we used to be a year ago but it s still an ongoing process .","304432":"i will eventually , just not now . we can t even afford to move in together , let alone get married at the moment .","304433":"wolves travel in packs , so the idea that wolves are solitary creatures is largely false .","304434":"my boyfriend makes me happy .","304435":"i never had an idea of a perfect wedding because i never thought i would ever be in a position to get married . either way , currently i would prefer something down to earth , whimsical , and low key . perhaps somewhere outdoors during the autumn or winter months . i like a lot of the diy things you can find online that make weddings feel more cozy .","304436":"uh , what . . . i ve always felt some sort of intimate connection with wolves ever since i was young , not because i can relate to them or anything , but because they re such powerful and mysterious creatures and are often underestimated by humans . i ve always wanted to visit a wolf sanctuary .","304437":"it s not as if it s a rule or anything , but we do say we love each other every day .","304438":"there aren t many people who have significantly wronged me , and those who have , they haven t had anything really bad happen to them . that s why i don t exactly believe in karma . someone could do the worst possible thing in the world and get away with it , and there will be absolutely no cosmic force punishing them for their actions .","304439":"ask me questions , friends","304440":"the sims is basically where you make your own characters , or a family if you want to make a family of characters , and you can also build houses for them to live in . they live their daily lives sleeping , eating , bathroom , work , school , etc etc . , and as you make more money , you can upgrade your home . it s really fun and versatile , and your characters age over time so you can watch them age from a baby all the way to elderly and they eventually die .","304441":"i like the sims , but i haven t played it in a really long time . i watch my boyfriend play occasionally , though ! ! he s much more into the game than i am .","304442":"i love lemons , haha . i love putting lemons in my water and iced tea .","304443":"i respect him , but i wouldn t go so far as to say i love him . the only person i can say for certain that i love is my boyfriend .","304444":"i think it depends on the couple and how strongly they feel about their beliefs ! ! there are undoubtedly some people who probably wouldn t be able to date outside of their religion , but i also think that relationships can work regardless of religious beliefs i . e . if someone believes in god and the other person doesn t . i think it also comes down to a matter of respecting each other s beliefs even if they differ from yours , as long as their beliefs aren t hurting anyone .","304445":"i used to be really good at drawing and painting , but i haven t done it in ages besides random paint nights i attend rarely with my friends . i could probably draw something like my profile picture if i wanted to , haha .","304446":"it needs to be done regardless , and i d rather not have my father get stuck with doing everything for her either .","304447":"i ve been helping my mother do things around the house since she can t do them by herself , so since the second i got home , i ve been cleaning and vacuuming and rearranging furniture and compiling garbage to take to the street . if this was my own place , it would be fine because obviously these things need to get done . but there s a time and a place for everything , and for some reason she put off asking me until the very last minute instead of asking me earlier in the week to do things in increments . plus , her and i don t get along so anything i have to do for her grates on my nerves .","304448":"tired and frustrated . i haven t gotten a chance to sit down since i got home from work until just now , and all i want to do is crack open a beer and relax . other than that , i m fine . work was productive today so at least i have that to keep in mind . i also have a concert to go to tomorrow , so i m excited for that .","304449":"this sounds like a troll question . nevertheless , if you don t love your girlfriend anymore then you should tell her . she s obviously going to be extremely upset , but no one should be forced to stay in a relationship especially if it s one sided . she may be better off without you .","304450":"i don t really think following a holiday tradition is the same thing as lying to someone with cruel intention . i can totally understand why people would want to not lie to their children and tell them straight away that santa isn t real for the reason you just described above , though . at the same time , it might ruin the holidays for their friends , especially if they re incredibly young .","304451":"no , it s actually from the xbox avatar maker for the xbox one ! !","304452":"lmao , no . i m not musically inclined in any sense of the word .","304453":"nah , i ve never had a reason to forge a signature before .","304454":"i ve never hired anyone to clean the house , no . we have landscapers who clean up the lawn every two weeks or so , but that s it .","304455":"no , of course not . you re not given a pass on your behavior because youre mentally ill . if you know the difference between what s acceptable and unacceptable behavior then you should be held accountable for your actions .","304456":"i was in the legal industry with my last job i worked for a law firm specializing in disability cases . now i m in the publishing industry .","304457":"maybe it s a new york thing ? ? you can get them at any bakery .","304458":"taking on my current job . it was a risk because it was in an entirely different field than what i was previously working , and i wasn t sure if it was going to be right for me , but i m glad i quit my old job to start this one because i m much happier here .","304459":"i m not a big dessert person , but i do like rainbow cookies .","304460":"haha , i agree . i can only imagine how young that anon could have been .","304461":"i m overweight , so no .","304462":"lol , no . i ve never worn a crop top and i would feel too uncomfortable wearing one . i prefer loose clothing .","304463":"no , i don t have any kids .","304464":"i like twix bars the most .","304465":"no , i ve never taken a cpr class or anything .","304466":"there s no age limit on askfm , and there are dozens of people who are older than me on here , lol . i m not old at all .","304467":"this is so cute , aw ! !","304468":"french fries will be the bane of my existence .","304469":"i was never interested in their music .","304470":"yes , i have multiple people in my life who listen to my concerns , worries , struggles , etc etc . it helps to have a good support system .","304471":"depends on what kind of job you re looking for . most retail places are easy to get into because there are so many around , but i initially found it difficult to find an office job post graduation .","304472":"yeah , i work hours per week .","304473":"my cigarette , a bonfire , my boyfriend , a cup of coffee , and my phone .","304474":"i ve always been curious about using menstrual cups , because i know quite a few people who use them love them . i think any option is fine , though as long as you re using something sanitary to look after yourself , and that you re comfortable using it , that s all that should matter . i don t like the concept of free bleeding because that s a serious health hazard .","304475":"i ve never been to one , so i don t really have any thoughts on the matter . i don t know anything about the dynamics .","304476":"happier marshmello bastille https youtu . be m bc plyij","304477":"i m sure i did when i was younger , but never while i ve been an adult .","304478":"it depends on the individual . it wouldn t make sense to make a blanket statement that covers only two genders .","304479":"abandonment by my loved ones .","304480":"i only ever dissected a cow s eye , and it was in college . we didn t dissect any animals in high school .","304481":"i prefer winter over the summer . i absolutely can t stand the heat .","304482":"i want to visit australia to see my friends","304483":"people should be nice regardless of their physical appearance .","304484":"i like halloween the most . i enjoy the spooky decorations , the horror movies on tv , and general vibe of the holiday .","304485":"lmao , definitely not . i have social anxiety and try to avoid crowds of people , and i never really know what to say in social situations unless i m already close with a person .","304486":"i feel fine . i just want to go home and see my boyfriend , i miss him .","304487":"i actually wake up covered in drool , but nice try , creepy anon .","304488":"i ll try my best to answer it .","304489":"no , it usually ranges between pm and am .","304490":"hello , i m up . do you have a question ? ?","304491":"this isn t what i was asking for when i asked for questions , fam .","304492":"i tried one of those vr headsets a few years ago , and tbh it made me feel sick lol . i was extremely disoriented and dizzy .","304493":"there s no such thing as fake news . if you look at multiple sources when it comes to the news , you ll be able to get a full scope of what s going on and make an opinion accordingly .","304494":"no , i don t personally think so . what s real that s happening in the world is easy for me , i ve never really had any issues with reality vs fantasy except when it comes to dreams lol .","304495":"damn , askfm is dead tonight . does anyone have any questions ? ? i ll be awake for a few hours","304496":"what do you mean by shut out ? ? like , ignoring each other ? ? if so , then that s not healthy imo . you should be able to talk to your partner about your disagreements and come to solutions so that it doesn t happen again . brushing off the issues doesn t really solve anything and it can only lead to worse problems down the line .","304497":"my boyfriend s big , important xmas gift came today i m so excited . as well as a few other little things . as much as i hate the holidays , i love when people open gifts that i bought them .","304498":"no , i ve never gone through his phone before without his knowledge . i think that s an invasion of privacy .","304499":"i used to have people like that in my life , but they re not in my life anymore partially for that reason . the way i see it , if you re asking me for advice then you know i m going to tell you the brutal truth . people don t ask me advice anymore because they want to feel better about themselves , but because they need a true opinion that will help them .","304500":"nah , none of my hobbies are really unusual . i don t have time for most of my hobbies , but it usually consists of excessive coffee drinking and video game playing .","304501":"i don t like picking favorites . i follow everyone i follow for a reason it s because i enjoy their answers .","304502":"he always knows what to buy me to surprise me and make me happy , lol . meanwhile i m absolutely clueless when it comes to buying gifts for him . idk what love languages are really .","304503":"home is wherever my boyfriend is whether he s at my house , i m at his house , we re out somewhere or we re on vacation , etc etc . i always feel safest when i m with him .","304504":"it was overwhelming , i was already anxious about the entire event , and i couldn t imagine driving two hours every day to go to the court room because it was so far away from my house . i have driving anxiety to begin with , and i nearly cried the first time i drove there by myself . to do so for a month straight would have been hell . all of those things were going through my mind and i ended up panicking hardcore . they had to escort me out .","304505":"jaigermeister is absolutely disgusting .","304506":"it s mainly for children . you re supposed to place it in different positions throughout the house at night to make the children think that its moving on its own , and its supposed to watch them . i m pretty sure that s the reason behind it , lol .","304507":"i was summoned for jury duty and got chosen to be on the jury a few years ago . i ended up having a panic attack in court and they let me go .","304508":"there isn t really much you can do considering she doesn t want to do anything about it . i would ask her if there s anything you can do for her , and if not , then just leave it as it is .","304509":"aw , thank you ! !","304510":"oh hell no . those things are creepy af .","304511":"blanket burrito .","304512":"not anymore . it did the first washes , but after that , it stopped .","304513":"i would change my name to leigh since it isn t my legal name . also , idk . the amount of questions in my inbox that i had to delete just now is absurd lol .","304514":"i honestly can t remember what the worst things were , because i simply delete and forget about the things trolls send me , but the stuff ben sends is always pathetic .","304515":"i guess there s no convincing you . brb while i go legally change my name","304516":"this is what color my hair was when i first dyed it in september ! ! it s faded out for the most part , though .","304517":"no , that isn t my name . nice guess , though .","304518":"am i supposed to know who that is ? ?","304519":"we re in a monogamous relationship , so no .","304520":"we don t go on dates very often . we both work a lot , so we usually spend our time together just relaxing at home .","304521":"it s on the first page of the app all the way to the left ! ! there should be options to take pictures with one friend , multiple friends , or by yourself .","304522":"why are we so fuckin cute ? !","304523":"yeah , but i don t give it out publicly .","304524":"this sort of question makes me dissociate , so pls don t ask these sorts of things .","304525":"no , and it isn t something i m interested in .","304526":"i would easily be dead .","304527":"oh yeah , absolutely . he s my fp so i would be worse than heartbroken , regardless of the reason .","304528":"yeah , exactly . on countless occasions , i ve asked my boyfriend if he s satisfied and assured him that if he wanted to see someone else , then he has the freedom to do that . i understand that sex is a large component of our relationship and if it s something he isn t happy with , he s under no obligation to stay .","304529":"i definitely think so . granted , i would be poor af because i can t afford a one bedroom apartment on my own , but emotionally i would be just fine .","304530":"it s a hypothetical situation , lol . the original anon also didn t say how long they were dating their partner . my boyfriend and i have made a compromise regarding our sex life that works for us , so we wouldn t break up over that .","304531":"i wouldn t date myself regardless of my gender . i don t think highly of myself at all and i honestly don t know why my boyfriend tolerates me .","304532":"it depends entirely on the relationship . some people break up over that while others stay in the relationship but work out some sort of compromise . personally speaking , if my boyfriend wasn t satisfied with our sex life and wanted to break up , i wouldn t necessarily be mad if he starts dating someone else . i personally don t think i would enter a new relationship anytime soon , though .","304533":"i would be upset , but also understanding if sex is a component of your relationship and you two can t compromise on something that works in the bedroom , then i think it would be valid to split with your partner in an effort to find someone with which you re more compatible . sex isn t everything in a relationship , but it is important to some , if not most , people . and if sex is important to you then you need a partner who s on the same page as you .","304534":"i honestly hate most pranks , especially pranks like that . it s cruel , especially if it s somewhere in public .","304535":"i just bought an x files christmas sweater , i can t waaaaait ! !","304536":"she isn t rejecting you her intentions aren t selfish by any means . you shouldn t feel obligated to have sex if you re not in the mood , and considering her low sex drive , it s difficult to really get in the mood to have sex . to have sex when you don t want to is practically rxpe . i understand the situation is frustrating , but she isn t doing this purposely and i can guarantee that she wishes her sex drive was higher . talk to her about this if it s upsetting you , and maybe you two can find a solution .","304537":"my eyes .","304538":"i don t think i ve ever had eastern food .","304539":"getting to sleep in until am was a nice feeling , lmao . also , i made a huge cup of french vanilla coffee this morning , which was super nice and relaxing . and then i lit a candle , so now my room smells super good .","304540":"no , i ve been happy with all of the phones i purchased .","304541":"i appreciate that he works hard and is always looking to progress forward at his job . that he takes care of his family and is loyal to them and his friends and myself . that he s incredibly open minded and understanding . that he takes the time to understand my mental illnesses and does what he can to help .","304542":"i have twitter , but no one famous follows me to my knowledge .","304543":"hello i just got back from the store , so now i m thinking about making something to eat for lunch and playing some video games .","304544":"i just said why it was gross for me i have pimples and my skin gets oily .","304545":"no , but i do get pimples occasionally and my skin is very oily .","304546":"ask me questions , friends ! ! i just got back from the store bought some necessary skincare items since my skin has been gross lately . i got black charcoal facial wash and moisturizer , as well as rose water toner . ya boi is going to have the best damn skin ever","304547":"depends on what you mean by being held responsible i don t personally know if it would be appropriate to take legal action , but i also think it makes sense if someone wanted to . i m undecided on the matter . however , i do strongly believe that you should tell your partner if you re hiv positive , as it can be easily transferred through bodily fluids .","304548":"i think it s lovebooksonline . com , or something . if you google love book then it might show up .","304549":"for my birthday , my boyfriend bought me a personalized love book it s a customized book you can make online that tell the story of your love journey , what you love about your partner , what you appreciate about them , etc etc . his ended up being like pages long , and at the end , he wrote a sentimental and amazing letter which brought me to happy tears . it was the best thing he s ever bought me as a gift , i love it so much .","304550":"i m most proud of my boyfriend and best friend they ve both overcome significant struggles in their lives and are hard working individuals . they ve never let anything get in the way of making progress both personally and professionally . i think they re also the ones who are the most proud of me because they know the most about me , my struggles , and my past .","304551":"i m not interested in cars at all .","304552":"i must have typed this wrong because it s definitely pronounced like arrbeez lol , you re the second person i accidentally confused with this . i just didn t realize that it stood for roast beef , rofl .","304553":"i m not sensitive to smells at all , and i love things that smell good . i always wear body spray and burn candles . i was just burning a pine candle earlier this afternoon .","304554":"i don t really know i m basically an open book when it comes to most things about my life .","304555":"i can be . i m sentimental when it comes to my boyfriend friends , but not so much my family . i m extremely closed off when it comes to my family .","304556":"yeah ! ! you can ask lillehjort , iluvkorn , and outofthewhoredinary .","304557":"i m so calm rn i have my pink string lights on , a candle burning , beautiful skyrim music playing , and i m sitting in front of my window looking out into the fog . ask me questions y all , i ll answer anything as long as it s appropriate","304558":"they re currently thrown into a corner of my room i really don t feel like organizing them just to take a photo for an anon who clearly has a boot fetish .","304559":"contrary to what family means to me , friends mean the world to me . they ve been more of a family to me than my family itself , and i m so grateful for the friendships i ve developed over the years . ideally , friends should be loyal to you and vice versa , be willing to help you when you re struggling , and be a source of comfort and escape when too much is going on . your friends shouldn t sugarcoat things to make you happy be real with you , and you don t need to talk every day to maintain a friendship . you also have to understand that everyone is living their own life and it doesn t mean the friendship is weak at all .","304560":"at this point , nothing . i ve never developed a strong sense of family because my family has been dysfunctional from when i was a child . i don t have a close relationship with anyone from my family , and once i move away , i doubt i ll be in contact with anyone often .","304561":"pajamas , lmao . i have sweatpants a hoodie on .","304562":"when putting their happiness before yours becomes toxic and detrimental to your well being you can successfully put your loved ones happiness before your own without causing harm to yourself , but it becomes a problem when it starts to negatively affect you . also , it becomes problematic when your loved one s begin to take advantage of your selfless efforts .","304563":"nah , not really . once i m done dealing with whatever color mess is going on now , i might color it blue green ,","304564":"i like both have both short boots and tall boots . lately i ve been wearing short boots more often because i like the way they look with skinny jeans .","304565":"taken just now . ignore the mess of my hair rofl .","304566":"how does that make no sense ? ? i don t believe i m important .","304567":"my weekend has been good , thank you for asking i was v productive yesterday i did loads of laundry before pm , i cleaned up a little bit , and i spent the rest of the afternoon watching the x files playing fallout . i woke up around am this morning , fell back asleep until am , and now i m on my laptop just answering questions since my feed is active rn .","304568":"society doesn t need me i don t contribute to the betterment of society in any way . i m just a passerby .","304569":"boots ! ! i wear boots almost every day during the autumn winter months .","304570":"aahh , thank you ! ! it s probably the makeup tbh , lmao . i m a hot mess when i m bare faced .","304571":"i found out about it through some askfm friends . they posted their friend codes online i thought their avatars were cute af , so i downloaded the app .","304572":"i m patient when it comes to ordering things online . . . there s really nothing that happens that would cause me to lose my patience , lol . most of the things i buy arrive in a timely manner , and i ve never had a package get lost in the mail .","304573":"you can customize your own character to look like you ! !","304574":"eh , somewhat . it depends entirely on my mood that day as well as what s testing my patience . there are some things that truly get under my skin , while other things don t bother me at all .","304575":"you can find someone attractive without having a crush on them . i think plenty of my friends are attractive , it doesn t mean that i have crushes on them either .","304576":"i ve always pronounced arby s as rb s . i just never realized that it was shorthand for roast beef , haha .","304577":"you guys are taking that picture way too seriously , lmao . i don t have a crush on anyone except my boyfriend . misphire is a beautiful human being with a kind soul , and she s intelligent af and i m glad to call her my friend .","304578":"gasoline , strangely enough . i ve always loved the smell of gasoline since even before i had my own car .","304579":"i was today years old when i realized that arby s was pronounced as rb s , which is short for roast beef .","304580":"i m middle class i m not exactly poor but i m not wealthy either . i can afford to pay my bills , medication , doctor visits , etc etc . , but that doesn t leave much room for anything else .","304581":"i don t text anyone from askfm on a daily basis . i talk to courrtana the most often , though ! ! we talk a few times per week .","304582":"i could , but i wouldn t want to .","304583":"this is from a few weeks ago , but it will suffice .","304584":"silence , a window slightly open , and either pitch darkness or something on low , like my string lights .","304585":". . . it s literally a cartoon .","304586":"because misphire is hot af .","304587":"uh , my hair has been short for the majority of my life , and i have half of my head shaved . lmao .","304588":"no , not everyone . there are some people who are inherently worthless .","304589":"is what still the same ? ?","304590":"i just followed you back ! !","304591":"lol , yes absolutely . i think that also goes for most of us , though when we re being sarcastic or anything , there will always be those anons picking apart everything we say and freaking out over them .","304592":"i don t believe you ve ever offended me ! ! i ve always looked up to you because of how educated you are on trans issues , mental health , veganism , and relationships . i love following you both on here on instagram .","304593":"a real man is someone who calls themselves a man and feels comfortable in that gender . it s not anything complex .","304594":"whuddup babycadiex","304595":"can i say all of the above ? ? rofl . askfm is the social media platform i use the most aside from maybe instagram , so most of my posts are a combination of venting about my day , educating others or being educated , and simply a way to kill time . i like learning about the people i follow , and i wouldn t be as informed about social issues and mental health issues if it wasn t for some of the people i follow on askfm .","304596":"we cute lillehjort","304597":"it s this app where you can make an avatar of yourself take photos with friends ! ! it s honestly super cute . here s me misphire ! !","304598":"add me on zepeto","304599":"ibuprofen or naproxen , and massages . i always get stiff necks , but i only really take ibuprofen for them since they only last for a few days at most .","304600":"i usually mean it . i rarely ask for alone time anyway because i only see my boyfriend times per week at most , and i see my friends less than that .","304601":"no , i m not into sports .","304602":"i generally don t argue with people online or irl . my swearing is mostly casual , though . i m less apt to swear when i m debating with someone because there s really no reason for me to swear in those scenarios .","304603":"i don t remember . i m sure it has happened multiple times in the past , but not for a very long time . i generally think before i even type out a message so it never gets to the point where i have to delete the message entirely .","304604":"i was being born , rofl . that s my birthday .","304605":"uh . . . idk what it is you re trying to ask .","304606":"i would teach them to stand up for themselves and to not put up with anyone s sh t . if you re not an easy target , then the bullies will leave you alone .","304607":"yeah , i usually do . unless they re all the way across the office , lol .","304608":"haha , thank you ! ! it s basically what my hair looks like rn considering the purple dye faded to blue at the tips .","304609":"i used to be , but college changed that for me . i realized i was less stressed when i started assignments early , so i learned not to procrastinate .","304610":"ask me something","304611":"there s a surplus of wrapping paper at my house , so we always have paper appropriate for whatever celebration there is xmas , birthday , etc etc . i don t wrap specific for each person , but i do make sure it s in accordance with whatever we re celebrating . i also use gift bags a lot because i m terrible at wrapping gifts , rofl .","304612":"i stopped relying on other people to make me happy because i realized happiness comes from within . self care is important and you have to be able to take time for yourself and feel compassion for yourself in order to grow .","304613":"i used to love them both , lol .","304614":"yo , ask me questions while i wait for my laundry to finish while i play some fallout","304615":"aaahh , two more of my xmas gifts came today ! ! i bought my boyfriend s father one of those wood cases that you can use to save wine bottle corks , and it has a sentimental saying etched into the glass , and it came out so beautiful . i hope he likes it .","304616":"then go complain about it on your own page , lmao .","304617":"don t take the internet so seriously . who gives a sh t , they mean the same thing .","304618":"i love my passion for things that are meaningful to me , and my loyalty and dedication to my friends .","304619":"i know it s early for some people it s only am on the east coast of the us , but does anyone have any questions ? ?","304620":"my day has been fine so far . i woke up around pm at my boyfriend s house , went to starbucks , and came home and chilled out for a little while . i just put in a load of laundry , and i m in the process of tidying up my clothing and room .","304621":"no , it doesn t bother me . at the same time , it isn t something that happens to me because most people don t care about grammar on social media .","304622":"i honestly don t remember anything that my parents taught me when i was younger . . . the only thing i can think of is that my father told me to let the car idle for minutes when it s cold outside to warm it up , but that s largely false with newer cars .","304623":"depends on the context . if it s uncalled for on somewhere like social media where grammar doesn t really matter , it might be construed as rude especially if it s out of the blue . however , i think in some cases it s okay , especially if someone is looking for constructive criticism .","304624":"i miss when mariah was active on askfm because she was the person who introduced social reform to me as well as the fundamentals of intersectional feminism , which included my current passion for mental health awareness . her page was always educational and i learned a lot from her . at the same time , i m glad she stopped using askfm because it s certainly a time waster , and i admit that my time could probably be better spent on other things instead of being on askfm all the time .","304625":"i was really interested in it , actually . i love the chemistry between scully and mulder . i just got distracted by life in general and stopped watching shows for a while , and then i found other shows to watch when i started watching them again .","304626":"i never meditate because i can seldom put myself into a position where i can relax enough to follow through with it . i reflect on my life often though , usually when i m in bed and about to fall asleep .","304627":"i haven t really added it all up in total . quite a few hundred dollars , though . thankfully , i got most of it on sale due to black friday and cyber monday sales .","304628":"i don t really watch current television shows that air every week , i only watch shows that are on netflix and hulu . i finished watching all the seasons of criminal minds that are on netflix last week , and i finished up all the seasons of wentworth a few months ago . the only show i haven t finished is the x files , lol . i stopped watching it for a while , but i might begin watching it again .","304629":"my boyfriend a personalized lovebook , four candles , and three boxes of tea . my mother lemon scented hand soap and one box of tea . my father an alexa echo device . my brother a tee shirt . my aunt bath and body works body spray and lotion . my boyfriend s father step mother a personalized wine cork holder . my boyfriend s step sisters cat coloring books , a cat poem book , and cat butt magnets for the fridge . my boyfriend s best friends beard maintenance kits . my best friend a spa pampering box . my other close friend a stemless wine glass .","304630":"nothing out of the ordinary i ve been doing a lot of online xmas shopping the past week i think i m about three quarters of the way finished with my shopping overall ! ! other than that , i ve just been working every day and seeing my boyfriend whenever possible . i saw him last night , and we had a great time just catching up on what s been going on with work and sharing xmas ideas with each other .","304631":"uh , i go to bars when no one else is there . lmao . i avoid crowds of people , so when i go to the bar , it s when it s virtually empty early on the weekdays . idk why you re so adamant to make me out to seem as if i m lying to be cool , but it isn t edgy to have social anxiety . i wish i could go out in public during normal hours and be a functional human being , but sometimes it leads to panic attacks which is why i hold off on doing my public errands until there s virtually no one else on the road or in the store .","304632":"? ? ? i wasn t aware that you knew my habits better than i knew myself . socializing takes a lot out of me , which is why when i go out , it s only with people at the most and during less active times .","304633":"yeah , i do . i m introverted by nature so i do constantly need alone time to recharge , calm myself down , and prepare myself for the next day .","304634":"i don t necessarily believe it s childish in nature although it is geared toward children , but a lot of families use them as a tradition despite how old the children are getting .","304635":"not generally , no . i only socialize with a few people , and i m never out in large groups of people ever . i ll see maybe people at the most . anything more than that is overwhelming .","304636":"you can ask me if i ve ever done certain things , which is a lot easier than playing never have i ever . i ll delete any inappropriate questions , though .","304637":"i don t have much recollection of my childhood at all , so i have no idea . i know that i ve always wanted to be a writer though for as far back as i can remember .","304638":"my job might be having one this year ! ! i d have to find an ugly sweater , or at least make one .","304639":"no , i haven t had one of those since i was a child .","304640":"i honestly don t remember my first day at my job , lmao . i think i attended a few training sessions and then they had me work on some assignments while another coworker oversaw me .","304641":"lillehjort because doe is intelligent and funny af . i ve followed them for a long time now .","304642":"no , i definitely don t think it s ok for a year old to be with , let alone married to , a year old . regardless of how mature the teenager thinks they are , they re still a child . they re not emotionally or physically mature enough to be with an adult , and its a classic case of emotional manipulation on the adult s part . those children are being groomed . i don t have to go into the reasons why a year old shouldn t be with a child , that explains itself . that s pxdophilia and anyone who is attracted to a child should be in prison indefinitely .","304643":"my eyes , hair , and left leg because it s the one with the linkin park tattoo .","304644":"i have a fish ! !","304645":"yeah , definitely ! ! it probably won t be in new york state though .","304646":"i don t remember where i saw it , but the earth isn t deteriorating fast enough for there to be a global crisis within the next years .","304647":"lol , it s only pm where i live . i got some xmas gifts for my boyfriend s sisters , my boyfriend , and one of our friends though ! ! they came in the mail today and i m happy with what they look like . now i m just waiting on more packages within the next week .","304648":"the apocalypse won t happen in our lifetime , at least that much is certain .","304649":"yeah most recently , it was leaving my previous job . it was a difficult decision to make because i didn t want to leave , but i was forced to make a decision within a short period of time , but my new job ended up being so much better .","304650":"no , compliments usually make me uncomfortable unless they re from my boyfriend or a close friend .","304651":"i don t really care . it isn t my business what other people do in public .","304652":"no , my maturity levels are where they should be for someone my age .","304653":"when i m high , i m usually content and playful , and i m less anxious than usual . i can also talk about things easier and its easier for me to verbally express myself .","304654":"i think so , but i m not entirely sure .","304655":"it s an app where you can make avatars like the one in my profile picture ! !","304656":"i m in a relationship .","304657":"we went to texas in .","304658":"traveling with my boyfriend whether it was to upstate new york or texas . he was with my the first time i ever took a plane and we spent a week in an unfamiliar location , but it was the most interesting and fun experience i ever had .","304659":"i usually stay away from things that worsen my self esteem , because then it just starts this vicious cycle of self hatred . most of the time , it has to do with video games i m bad at , so i only really play games that i m good at or that are easy for me .","304660":"i wasn t enrolled in any sports or anything , but i was part of the art club and literary magazine when i was in high school .","304661":"getting help for my mental health , graduating from college , and landing my first job post graduation .","304662":"contact the shop you bought it from and explain it was ripped when it arrived . they should be able to send you a new dress or refund your money .","304663":"me too ! ! thank youuu . i saw florence once like years ago and they were amazing . i don t know any of their new music , but i m sure it s just as good . i m kinda hoping bastille chvrches are opening acts , since i don t listen to them , that way if my boyfriend and i are a bit late it won t matter , lmao .","304664":"florence and the machine , muse , mike shinoda , death cab for cutie , ajr , bastille , and chvrches .","304665":"brunch .","304666":"whatever helps you sleep at night , my dude .","304667":"you re reading way too much into this .","304668":"i ve only played monopoly once in my life .","304669":"yes , it is . lmao .","304670":"yeah , i have one brother .","304671":"? ? ? i wasn t . that s why i said the answer was obvious .","304672":"i have no idea what you re talking about .","304673":"i didn t answer your initial question for a reason . the answer should be obvious .","304674":". . . well what .","304675":"uh , what lol . that s so dumb .","304676":"having the capability to do what s best for yourself and for the people around you without being tied down by restrictions .","304677":"absolutely . i don t have much of a sex drive anyway .","304678":"i get shortness of breath , but that s basically it .","304679":"my boyfriend , lol .","304680":"i m five feet tall .","304681":"i m not familiar with the whole womxn thing , so i don t really see the issue here . if you re referring to someone who s biologically female , then why wouldn t you specify that ? ?","304682":"well you re on the right site to ask a question .","304683":"they ask me if i have any spare money to give them . i don t carry cash , so i ve never been able to help anyone .","304684":"no . i ve been confronted by people but never followed . also , calling them beggars is a bit rude . they re usually homeless people who are in need of food water .","304685":"is this in regards to smoking ? ? if so , then no . occasionally i ll cough , but it s very seldom and if i m already somewhat sick .","304686":"my hair is a mess , lmao . it s super windy outside .","304687":"is this in terms of trans women ? ? if so , i don t really see the point because trans women are women and should be referred to as such .","304688":"my first job was a cashier at a drug store . i don t remember what i first bought , it was too long ago .","304689":"i don t remember , i started smoking when i was years old .","304690":"the lord of the rings movies used to inspire me due to the settings within the movies . the places were all very whimsical , beautiful , and made for good inspiration for my writing .","304691":"i ve never been to chicago before , so i honestly have no clue . ny pizza is the only pizza i ve ever had .","304692":"stevia is already pretty sweet for me , i can t imagine how sweet the chocolate one would be , haha . i m not really a big fan of chocolate anyway .","304693":"i agree . thankfully stuff like this doesn t trigger me very much , but i d be lying if i said that this topic isn t always constantly on my mind .","304694":"probably , rofl . i haven t had the courage to weigh myself since then .","304695":"i only sometimes use sugar in my coffee . when i do , i use stevia sweetener .","304696":"yeah , i saw that after i answered it . lmao .","304697":"i m overweight due to the medication i take and living a sedentary lifestyle . i was actively trying to lose weight a few months ago , but i lost the motivation to go to the gym . i ended up losing ten pounds in one month , which should have motivated me more , but then my depression kicked in . i should really get back to the gym one of these days , but i m also terrified to go alone .","304698":"menthol . i think i mentioned which cigarettes i smoke a few answers down .","304699":"uh , do you mean cigarettes or weed ? ? i smoke cigarettes every day , but i smoke weed maybe once per week or less .","304700":"my inbox is empty so y all should send me questions","304701":"my favorite thing about my boyfriend is how hard working and dedicated he is to his job , as well as to the people in his life . he s an incredibly loyal person and will walk to the end of the earth for you if he cares deeply about you . my favorite thing about our relationship is that we re always communicating and we re not afraid to discuss difficult things or feelings . in order for a relationship to work , you need to be able to talk genuinely to your partner and i m grateful that i can tell him anything .","304702":"i wouldn t know the first thing about having high self esteem , my dude .","304703":"instead of not responding at all , let them know that you need a little bit of space . preface it by saying they didn t do anything wrong , you just need to be alone from time to time and you ll talk to them when you re feeling better .","304704":"if i had forgotten it , then why would i remember for the purpose of this question ? ?","304705":"we re both intelligent in our own ways . he knows more about history , engineering , trades , animals , and random facts while i know more about writing , literature , and current events .","304706":"marlboro smooths .","304707":"iced coffee ! !","304708":"yeah , i m actually about to go have one now .","304709":"it s a bunch of different artists it s . s not so silent night concert . muse , florence and the machine , mike shinoda , death cab for cutie , foster the people , ajr , bastille , and chvrches .","304710":"i m never around children , so i have no idea .","304711":"he can be sometimes , although i m usually a bite more talkative than him .","304712":"yeah , the only person who knows how much money i have is my boyfriend .","304713":"we seldom run out of things to talk about and our silences are never awkward . sometimes it feels good to sit in silence with him because of how comfortable we are with each other .","304714":"nobody . you don t have to pretend to be someone else just because you re wearing a wig .","304715":"money is the one thing i m not terribly impulsive with , actually . i have too many bills so i m always paranoid that i ll run out of money , so i usually only spend it on necessary items and occasionally i ll treat myself at the bar . the only exception is the holidays , lol . i tend to spend a lot of money during the holidays .","304716":"no . in my opinion , children should be raised in accordance with their biological sex . if they come out as transgender afterwards , then they should be referred to as their actual gender and treated as such .","304717":"my friends and i don t experience awkward silences . sometimes we ll run out of things to talk about with respect to updating each other on our lives , but then we just usually bring up another topic unrelated to our lives .","304718":"no , i could never be a teacher . i don t do well talking to crowds of people and i m pretty impatient .","304719":"yeah , plenty of people actually . that s what happens when you get older .","304720":"picked up coffee on the way to work , went to work , ate lunch , ran to the bathroom a hundred times , came home , and made myself a cup of ginger tea .","304721":"i m sorta looking forward to a concert that i m supposed to go to next week , but i m not percent certain that my boyfriend and i will be able to make it , so i m a bit nervous . he can t request any days off and he ended up being scheduled to a closing shift that night , so he s going to have to try to switch shifts with the opening manager . and even then , he won t get out until pm and we would still have to commute to brooklyn before pm . it would be cutting it close .","304722":"no , that would be a waste of money and a doctor visit because i think i know what it s from , and it s going to go away in hours probably anyway . if it was something that lasted for multiple days in a row nonstop , then i would definitely go , though .","304723":"no , i m not pregnant .","304724":"guess who came home from work early due to having major stomach issues after lunch to the point where i almost vomited ! ! i m so tired of this . this happened to me on sunday too , i have no idea what s going on anymore .","304725":"what are you even talking about ? ? are you trying to say that drama on askfm is the same thing as cyber bullying ? ? i think that s a thin line to tread . there might be some cases that could fall under bullying , but there are also other cases that aren t .","304726":"i m pretty sure i saw this on twitter .","304727":"i only watch the true crime episodes put out by buzzfeed unsolved , but i think they re incredibly informative .","304728":"obviously it s terrible . i don t know what other opinion there is to have , lmao . it s not like people are walking around saying that cyber bullying is a wonderful thing .","304729":"uh , throw them out ? ?","304730":"marijuana and cocaine .","304731":"different groups of people . i got bullied in middle school , lol .","304732":"i was sleeping when you sent me this message .","304733":"they re not used by medical professionals anymore . the only context narcissism is used is in describing those with narcissistic personality disorder .","304734":"? ? ?","304735":"yes , i have . most of those labels are outdated at this point .","304736":"probably , it a trademark symptom of bpd . i don t remember much of my childhood though .","304737":"i wouldn t consider myself to be better fully , but i m much better mentally than i was back then .","304738":"lmao . for as long as i could remember , yes . i ve always been the type to do things on a whim , whether it s something as simple as cutting my hair or something more severe . even though i m medicated now , i still have episodes of erratic impulsivity when it comes to drinking .","304739":"when i was years old ? ? for the most part , yeah . those were the partying stages of my life and everyone knew not to fuck with me .","304740":"usually my impulsive episodes mean i m cutting myself , threatening to kill myself , drinking to the point where i m blacking or putting myself in danger , or getting so high that i don t know where i am or who i m with .","304741":"probably years old i had a liver of steel , i was absolutely fearless , and everyone either respected or feared me .","304742":"if i m experiencing severe depressive episodes or episodes of impulsivity , then my medication isn t strong enough .","304743":"it did for a really long time , but i ve been consistently on the same medication for about a year now .","304744":"i either drink alcohol or i sleep , lol . i don t recommend the former , but the latter is good for readjusting your perspectives on events going on in your life .","304745":"if i had any more to spare , i would ! ! i drank the two drinks i bought , so i have nothing left unfortunately .","304746":"askfm is fucking dead tonight . ask me questions while i drink","304747":"enough to keep me afloat for the time being . my manager is looking into giving me more responsibilities so that i have a better chance of getting a raise soon .","304748":"i think it s gradual , personally . you have to put the time in to get to truly know someone , otherwise you re falling in love with the idea of them and not who they actually are .","304749":"a lot of long islanders love the summer time i have no idea why . it s always so difficult to breathe , it s disgustingly hot outside , and everywhere is packed with people because of the nice weather . i prefer autumn and winter over everything else .","304750":"i m not crafty or artistic anymore , so i honestly have no clue . one of my friends runs a small business selling all different sorts of candles , body scrubs , lotions , bath bombs , and soaps , so perhaps i would try to get into that .","304751":"idk how it works exactly , but if it works for them , then all the more power to them .","304752":"nah , i can t drink beer and coffee at the same time rofl .","304753":"beer my boyfriend friends music backyard bonfire .","304754":"lol . hell no , and you re stupid for even thinking i would abide by that . video doesn t even work on my phone anyway , it always crashes the app .","304755":"when it s miserable outside i m assuming torrential rain or snow i prefer staying inside with the blinds open so i can see outdoors , with a candle lit , and being snuggled up in a blanket with a hot drink in my hand .","304756":"i ve tried but i have no idea how , lmao . my body doesn t move that way .","304757":"no , i need money to pay my bills and afford my doctor visits and medication .","304758":"i m more of a listener than a talker . i like being alone , but i also enjoy being around small groups of friends , i . e . people at most .","304759":"i m do sorry you re feeling this way . i hope things work out ! !","304760":"lol , yes . i have a decent amount of debt , unfortunately .","304761":"my parents and brother , my aunt and cousin , my boyfriend , my boyfriend s father and his girlfriend , his girlfriend s two daughters , and five of my friends . it sounds like a lot but they re all getting small things .","304762":"it s an app called zepeto ! !","304763":"no , my family doesn t usually put up decorations until the first or second week of december .","304764":"no , considering idk who that is .","304765":"nah , i have hair on one half of my head . the other side is usually shaved but i haven t shaved it in about a month .","304766":"i haven t worn it since halloween . it was part of my halloween costume , lmao .","304767":"lmao , no . i wore it to work on halloween , but that was the extent of it .","304768":"i buy from small businesses , so i suppose so .","304769":"no , i don t support that . people who are svicidal aren t terminally ill and there are treatment modalities to dramatically increase the value of life for people who are contemplating svicide . i think assisted svicide should only be used in cases of severe terminal illness , where a person has a determinable amount of time to live .","304770":"anyway , questions would be appreciated","304771":"lol horribly . i gave up within the first week . i was so motivated at first , and then life happened and i lost all motivation . i might pick it up again when i feel like it , but i m not going to force myself to write . i ll just be unhappy with how it turns out .","304772":"idk if these are considered traditional , but i value honesty and loyalty above all else . if you have a problem with me or are upset with me , then tell me straight out . we can communicate and work through those issues . i don t tolerate dishonesty or disloyalty in relationships , whether friendship or romantic , and i prefer to be transparent in all of my relationships , whether it s good or bad .","304773":"i would rather get the actual product as a gift , mostly because i absolutely hate going to stores and shopping around . lmao . that goes for most things , actually . the only gift cards i like are for starbucks or those prepaid visa cards that you can use anywhere .","304774":"no , i didn t get any makeup for my birthday . the only thing i asked for my birthday , cosmetic wise , was the too faced pumpkin spice palette . however , i don t think it exists anymore ? ? i couldn t find it on their website the last time i checked .","304775":"i think it depends on the question , whatever makes more sense or flows better . i would have to see some examples though .","304776":"no , i don t believe in soul mates at least not in the traditional sense . i believe that there are dozens of people with which someone can be compatible completely , not just one person . i also believe that it isn t always in a romantic context either .","304777":"and i m sure such a script would be expensive af besides .","304778":"thank you ! ! i personally didn t know that .","304779":"skip out on work when my boyfriend has a day off , go with him to the park and have a picnic , take lots of photographs of wildlife and nature , and come home to bbq . in the night , we would have a big bonfire with friends and drink and have a good time . i know it isn t the most wild day , but it s something that makes me incredibly happy .","304780":"because i benefit from antidepressants , which target serotonin dopamine levels and even them out so to speak . therapy alone wouldn t help me , i need psychiatric medication .","304781":"i m sorry that you guys are going through this . that sounds like a difficult situation , especially if he s constantly blocking you out and isolating himself . that isn t healthy either . if i was in that position , i would honestly keep trying . don t bother him every day because that can be overwhelming and don t suffocate him , but send him messages telling him that you support him and that you re always there for him . he can talk to you when he s ready and you re not going to leave , that sort of thing . hopefully he ll come around .","304782":"freeze black coffee into ice cubes so when you make iced coffee , it doesn t get diluted ! !","304783":"this isn t a question . unless you have a question to ask , please leave my page .","304784":"not really mainly because i don t like gatherings with my family . if it s just me and my boyfriend or a few friends , i would probably enjoy it more .","304785":"i love garlic , so the more the merrier .","304786":"it s raining torrentially right now , which made me commute home a living hell . i could barely see the lines in the road and i was skidding because the streets are flooded .","304787":". . . is this a serious question lmao . no , i m pretty sure there s no way a doctor can do that , especially a psychiatrist .","304788":"no , i m almost never in the xmas spirit . i like buying gifts for people , but that s the extent of it . lol .","304789":"i mainly do overtime at work which isn t exactly overtime , it s just me doing work for the company at home on weekends , but my prime motivation behind that is to make money . i always feel guilty about taking sick days , though . even though i have a doctor s note excusing absences due to mental illness , i m still terrified they re going to fire me one day even though i only take off perhaps one day per month for legitimate reasons .","304790":"it depends entirely on the day at this point . yesterday , i felt terrible , and today , i feel a bit better but my anxiety has been skyrocketing . the weather doesn t help at all in this case either .","304791":"no , i wouldn t cheat on him if he ended up cheating on me . it doesn t help the situation at all , and if such an event were to happen , i would just leave . revenge in such a manner only hurts everyone involved even more and further complicates things .","304792":"i m unhappy because i have a serotonin deficiency . lmao .","304793":"no , it isn t something i ve ever looked into .","304794":"no , it isn t something i ve ever been interested in learning about .","304795":"no , i never have . people have hacked my accounts but i ve never been scammed before . i generally have a good sense of what s legit and not .","304796":"i eat healthy most of the time , and my diet mainly consists of lean meats for protein , a lot of vegetables , and a small serving of carbs with dinner meals . i also drink water and green tea often . idk what sort of food is good for the heart you would have to google that or consult a nutritionist .","304797":"ah , i m glad you re feeling much better ! ! i was wondering where you went , lol . i ve done it on occasion i took a year long hiatus from askfm years ago because i couldn t handle it on top of going to college and maintaining a job . it was the best thing i could do for myself .","304798":"i worked in retail in various customer service positions for many years when i was younger , and every day a customer would basically treat me as if i wasn t a human being with feelings and a life . i ve been brought to tears and had panic attacks due to those experiences . management mostly abided by the worker , although we did try the whole customer is always right thing as much as we could via legalities and policies . i was cynical about the human race before working in retail , but those experiences probably made it much worse , lol .","304799":"i don t eat cupcakes , lol .","304800":"no , my family never did the whole elf on a shelf thing . which is fine by me , because i think it s creepy af .","304801":"i think it was around on amazon .","304802":"uh , existing . just my existence makes my anxiety worse .","304803":"they only have certain shows . it s best to use the search option .","304804":"i m great at saving money except around the holidays , lmao .","304805":"i ve honestly never watched doctor who before , rofl .","304806":"i usually take my medication and get ready for work .","304807":"yeah , i use it regularly .","304808":"no , he wasn t .","304809":"i ve never been interested in owning an iphone . my family has always had androids too .","304810":"i don t believe i ve ever heard their music before .","304811":"i m not a confident person myself , so i don t have much advice for you .","304812":"i would choose a phoenix . they re known for rising out of the ashes and starting anew , and i ve always considered myself capable of doing the same thing in times of struggle .","304813":"i don t experience any of those , but my boyfriend has night terrors on a regular basis due to his ptsd .","304814":"have you tried explaining these feelings to him ? ? depression can be difficult to deal with but there needs to be communication between you two in order for things to work and also for you to help him .","304815":"i use an android . i ve never owned an iphone , so i ll have to go with androids .","304816":"both , depending on which facets of the world you re looking at . politically , i think we re declining . but in terms of scientific progress , we re advancing .","304817":"i don t generally argue with people either online or irl , so i have no idea .","304818":"my name is clearly leigh , lol .","304819":"it probably does , sure . i m always sober by the time i wake up though .","304820":"i don t get buzzed off of one drink . it usually takes me drinks to really feel something , and i usually stop drinking at drinks .","304821":"depends on how long i m drinking , lol . if i go out at pm , i ll stay buzzed until i go to bed , which would normally be around am at that point .","304822":"alcohol is one of the most addictive substances out there .","304823":"i like the feeling of being buzzed tipsy .","304824":"no , not until just now . apparently it s more well known as a metal band . unless you mean semblance , if so then yes .","304825":"it doesn t really affect my sleep . like i said , i fall asleep fairly easily so adding alcohol to the mix doesn t make it easier or harder .","304826":"my sleep isn t hindered by thoughts . i can usually fall asleep easily .","304827":"much appreciated","304828":"depends on my mood lately i ve bren listening to hard rock , nu metal , hip hop , and alternative rock .","304829":"not really . i ll listen to them on the radio , but i never went out of my way to listen to their music .","304830":"hello do you have a question ? ?","304831":"it s an app called zepeto ! !","304832":"no , i m an athiest .","304833":"it doesn t make a difference in how i feel the next day , most of the time . occasionally i ll get a hangover if i drank too much but i can t remember the last time i drank to that extent .","304834":"i went out last night .","304835":"no , i haven t drank tonight .","304836":"i don t talk about my sex life on askfm .","304837":"no , i ve never been attracted to someone while dating my boyfriend .","304838":"if i had stayed at the same school , i would have had to retake the class . however , i transferred to another school after that semester .","304839":"well you have the option of breaking up with your partner to pursue the other person or ignoring your feelings of attraction because you want to be faithful to your partner .","304840":"yeah , i failed a class due to depression before . i m sorry you re going through this , it s so difficult to get through .","304841":"i honestly don t remember , it was so long ago .","304842":"not necessarily , the word interesting was attached to it so it could have also meant that my answers were interesting . nevertheless , thank you for your input ! !","304843":"i can t tell if this is an insult or a compliment , lmao .","304844":"i m not entirely sure yet because i m still exploring it , but it s basically another create your own character app where you can add friends and take photos together ! !","304845":"add me on zepeto , guys ! ! code hr j","304846":"uh , i don t think that anyone thinks i m famous , lol .","304847":"i guess my senses . my instincts can be irrational and i recognize that , so i prefer relying on what i can see and hear .","304848":"it s been pretty active for me . i suppose it all depends on who you follow .","304849":"this isn t a question . questions would be appreciated .","304850":"he was happy for me . he knew that courrtana and i wanted to meet for a long time , so when we did , he was fully supportive .","304851":"i did ! ! we all drove around and grabbed something to eat the time we saw each other .","304852":"courrtana is the only person i ve hung out with on askfm , lol . but that s because we became really close prior to seeing each other and i trust her and her husband . she lives all the way in florida now , which makes me sad . we still text regularly though ! !","304853":"if you want to get to know me , then ask my questions on askfm .","304854":"uh , i don t hang out with people on askfm .","304855":"i enjoy my job , but it isn t really what i always wanted . granted , it s within my profession of choice but i don t see myself staying there for a really long time .","304856":"thanks , my dude","304857":"ask them why they feel the need to resort to personal insults when the conversation clearly wasn t about that . i would assume that they re insecure with themselves , otherwise they wouldn t feel the need to lash out in such a way .","304858":"yeah , i work monday through friday .","304859":"i don t condone violence in any relationship . if your automatic reaction to being yelled at is to hit a person , then you need to re evaluate yourself .","304860":"it depends on what the question is .","304861":"i ve had congestion , but i attributed that to the change of seasons . so i might actually have a cold , who knows .","304862":"sometimes . small things can aggravate me , but it really depends on my mood already . some days i have more patience than others .","304863":"it s been all right . i feel incredibly sick to my stomach and i can t get rid of it , so i ve been trying to take it easy . i just made a cup of ginger tea and i ll probably make soup later .","304864":"what do you want me to post an opinion on ? ?","304865":"? ? ? i have no idea what this is supposed to mean .","304866":"hello do you have a question ? ?","304867":"nothing new has really happened i ve just been working a lot , seeing friends , etc etc . my birthday just passed on the th , so i celebrated with my boyfriend and some friends , and i spent thanksgiving at my boyfriend s house with his family , which was really fun . i ve been feeling more motivated too , which is a nice change . the past year has been difficult in regards to my mental health , but i m steadily stabilizing myself as long as i remember to take my medication every day .","304868":"i mainly watch achievement hunter , rooster teeth , markiplier , chilledchaos , videogamedunkey , and seananners when he was still active .","304869":"you can t love someone else if you don t love yourself first . i used to believe in it , sadly enough . i didn t think i was capable of truly loving another human being because i didn t love myself . over time , i realized that it was mainly a power trip for the person who told this to me , and i learned that people are fully capable of loving another person even if they still have issues within themselves . in addition , the idea of a person not being able to love someone else if they don t love themselves is harmful to people who struggle with self worth because it makes them further believe that they re not worthy of love either .","304870":"i would say that i m fairly adventurous . i m not afraid to take risks , and occasionally i ll dive out of my comfort zone , especially if i know something is only temporary . in addition , i like garnering new experiences because i believe life should be composed of great experiences .","304871":"tbh i work best with a routine , so my daily weekly routine seldom changes . my days consist of coffee , work , checking up on social media , video games , and occasionally reading and writing . here and there , my routine is punctuated with events , such as going out with friends , but i generally stick to the same things .","304872":"i believe that people can change , yes however , they have to recognize that their behavior was hurtful and problematic , and genuinely want to make a difference within themselves . unfortunately , a lot of people can t change because they re too stubborn or proud to admit that they were wrong . nevertheless , there are definitely people out there who have the capacity to change .","304873":"well that s what askfm is for . what s your question ? ?","304874":"i don t give my tumblr out publicly , sorry .","304875":"i don t have one . i don t know her well enough to have an opinion .","304876":"no , i don t .","304877":"perhaps . i don t think that deeply into it anymore .","304878":"yes , they are .","304879":"pablo neruda is my favorite poet ! !","304880":"i always want to be drunk . lmaoo .","304881":"pretty much , yeah . anyway , y all should send me more questions . i m drinking and i m planning on getting drunk af tonight","304882":"sometimes i do , although it s been a long time since i ve been out in nature in full force like that .","304883":"it makes me feel more like myself , if that makes sense . i feel most at peace when i m surrounded by nature .","304884":"sometimes , sure . nature is so much more powerful than humans can comprehend and it s humbling .","304885":"i have ! ! i love seeing the full moon .","304886":"move into a big house with my boyfriend , adopt a lot of dogs , and become a freelance novelist .","304887":"religion , spirituality , etc etc . it all falls under the same idea .","304888":"i don t answer them because i don t want to answer questions like that . hence why i keep deleting them , lol .","304889":"mental health advocacy .","304890":"he raps about abvsing women , specifically his ex wife , and he s incredibly misogynistic .","304891":"eminem is a disgusting human being .","304892":"i m really tired of these pseudo intellectual questions . not to mention the fact that you repeat the same questions week after week .","304893":"buddhism is a religion . it isn t factual evidence .","304894":"it doesn t scare me because i don t believe that s true . it s all hypothetical in my eyes .","304895":"human life is too painful and complicated . i wouldn t want to live through this again .","304896":"i suppose so . i don t try to be someone i m not , my social media is just an extension of who i am .","304897":"yeah , it goes both ways . you should be looking for a partner , not someone to fulfill a void in you .","304898":"i m doing well . it s raining outside so i m really calm right now , haha . i m also waiting for my friend to text me when he gets out of work so we can go out later tonight .","304899":"no , i have no reason to .","304900":"no , love isn t enough . you also need to have a foundation of trust and stable communication between you both in order for things to work properly .","304901":"i did ! ! some etsy shops were percent off , and i saved on an electronic i purchased for my father .","304902":"why are you so salty over this , lmao . literally who cares ? ? people have casual sxx , it isn t uncommon nor is it a big deal . it should be normalized imo .","304903":"this isn t a complete question . . . are you asking if i cry when i confront someone ? ? if so , then no . i either cry over really small insignificant things , or bigger events but usually days after the fact .","304904":"i ve never lied to that capacity before . that s a hell of a lot of trouble to go through for absolutely no reason .","304905":"no , that isn t always the case . it could also be for privacy reasons .","304906":"i don t really see the point in you sending this considering i m lgbt myself . obviously i m going to disagree with you . now run along and whine about gay people elsewhere .","304907":"it doesn t bother me . people have different comfort zone levels when it comes to social media , and as long as their behavior isn t hurting anyone , then it isn t a big deal imo .","304908":"i m a worrier , but i don t do that specific thing . i think it roots back to my anxiety issues i . e . if my boyfriend doesn t text or call me when i know he s been out of work for a while , then i ll get really worried .","304909":"people get so twisted over the most obscure shit , rofl .","304910":"fire has always been beautiful to me .","304911":"bro , i ve been doing this for years . god forbid people reference the same memes in conversation , lol .","304912":"that s right . i don t remember how long ago that was , though . either way , it s one of my favorite memes .","304913":"i don t know what you re referring to you ll have to be more specific .","304914":"it s been a trend on the internet in general for years now . idk where it originated from , but it s intention is generally to mock someone else .","304915":"you what panties do you wear me i don t answer questions like these you youre so rude lmaoo . sorry if i don t entertain blatant fetishes . this isn t the site for that sort of behavior .","304916":"with my boyfriend , sure . but not with anyone else . quit playing dumb , i m not entertaining this any longer . any further messages will be deleted .","304917":"i think it s an invasive question with obvious intentions behind it , and i don t partake in that sort of conversation on the internet .","304918":"very rarely . i can t remember the last time i sat down with someone and watched a movie tbh . my boyfriend and i want to watch the stanford prison experiment movie that s on netflix , though .","304919":"i m quite aware . obviously i didn t want to answer your question .","304920":"i usually don t feed into drama in general .","304921":"if there s any word i hate , it s probably panty or panties . to describe something as simple as an undergarment like that sounds so crude to me .","304922":"i m not feeding into the drama today . if i answer this question , then i ll get more questions about them , and i ain t about that life .","304923":"i suppose it would all depend upon the situation . not every case will be the same , so the punishment would be tailored to the severity of the crime .","304924":"thank you ! ! i appreciate it","304925":"oh . sorry , i must have misread your last message . my previous answer still stands . people who falsely accuse others of rxpe should be met with some form of punishment . rxpe is a serious offense and requires intense investigation .","304926":"no , i don t show affection in public toward my friends . . . i don t really show affection to them in private , either . i ll tell my friends that i m thankful for their friendship , but that s the extent of it . i feel uncomfortable showing physical affection .","304927":"people who make false accusations should be met with discipline perhaps not as severely as people who actually do the offense , but there should be some form of punishment involved . however , i don t believe dr . ford was lying about kavanaugh .","304928":"there s nothing in a man that will complete a woman , so the answer is nothing . women are whole human beings and don t need the validation of men to survive thrive .","304929":"i have tendencies to be pretty romantic , yes ! ! i prefer staying inside , having deep conversations , and connecting intimately with my partner as opposed to going out somewhere . i really value sentimental thoughts and gifts more than anything else .","304930":"i m purposely staying out of it because it s a sensitive topic for me . i don t like discussing abxse on my page , it can be triggering at times .","304931":"i think it s absolutely disgusting . rxpe is a serious offense and is incredibly traumatic for survivors , and to lie and make false claims of rxpe is so demeaning and a spit in the face to those who have actually endured that trauma .","304932":"welcome to my page , which is hella gay .","304933":"i feel things too deeply , so i feel as if breaking someone else s heart would personally be easier for me . i have a tendency to ruminate on things for a long time , and normally if i m breaking a person s heart , i ve already disconnected from them emotionally so it wouldn t hurt me as much as if i got my heart broken .","304934":"it depends on their personality . i have a friend who s pretty talkative , but she s also fun to talk to so it doesn t bother me at all . other people , however , are irritating when they speak too much .","304935":"i wasn t aware that humans had a choice in choosing one or the other , lol . we all fart and burp , some more than others , and it s nothing unusual .","304936":"sometimes , i do . other times , i feel better with the company of others . however , i don t like crowds of people and i prefer one on one conversation instead .","304937":"i went to bed around am and woke up at am . waking up at am is technically sleeping in for me , but considering it s the weekend and i could have slept for as much as i wanted , it was a tad early .","304938":"my day has been fine so far . i woke up semi early even though i went to bed pretty late , but i felt fine . i m on my third cup of coffee . i ve also been listening to music and browsing stores online for xmas ideas , it s been a pretty relaxing day .","304939":"no , i haven t purchased it yet . i want to read more reviews and watch more streams of people playing it to determine if it s a good investment . it s on sale for on amazon rn , but i also don t know if someone already bought it for me as an xmas gift , so i might hold off until after the holidays .","304940":"i haven t checked my blood pressure in a few months my psychiatrist checked it for me at one of my appointments . it was within normal range .","304941":"one of those alexa electronics ! ! it s the stand up echo device that has the display screen . he s into all sorts of gadgets and he doesn t own one , so i think he would really like it . best buy has a sale rn , it was originally priced but marked down to so i took advantage of the deal .","304942":"i got my father the best xmas gift and i m so excited for him to see it . can i wait an entire month ? ? let s find out .","304943":"i don t know much about clinton to really give an opinion on that matter . however , she does try way too hard to appeal to younger voters which is so cringey imo .","304944":"that s highly debatable , lol . even though i don t like clinton , i feel as if she would have done a slightly better job than what trump is doing rn .","304945":"i couldn t care any less about sports .","304946":"i play mostly rpg and fps , depending on the individual game . i don t like big multiplayer fps games , but i do enjoy fps s that have a solo or co op storyline , like destiny and halo . my favorite rpg games are the fallout series , skyrim , and the bioshock series . though they can kinda be classified as fps too , lol .","304947":"i have no idea what this is referring to . can you be more specific ? ?","304948":"i ve actually never watched it before . from the screenshots i ve seen , though , it looks like something i would be into .","304949":"no , i don t believe in destiny . i don t believe that everything happens for a reason because unfair things happen to good people and unjust people often get away with their problematic behavior .","304950":"i can t really give you an answer because i don t know your specific situation nor the relationship you had with your ex . however , i will say this in a general sense you have to remember that you did break up for a reason , and unless you have reasonable cause to believe that the relationship will be different now , the turnout may end up being the same . most of the time , it isn t worth it to return to your exes because you both might be hurt again in the long run . but like i said , i don t know your exact situation . use your best judgment .","304951":"i m debating on it ! ! i need to look into it more and watch more streams of the game . i m generally not a big fan of multiplayer games like that , but i m really interested in exploring the terrain .","304952":"no , i m in a relationship .","304953":"lol , no . i m playing fallout .","304954":"my bedroom is so cozy .","304955":"thank you ! ! i ll definitely look into it . i ve been having so much neck and back pain from working in an office , staring at a monitor for eight hours a day is definitely not healthy .","304956":"thank you i hope so too . i know it s muscle pain because it goes away mostly when i take ibuprofen , and it s the worst in the morning , so idk if i need a new pillow or something .","304957":"this is day three of me waking up in immense pain to the point where i m in tears . i have no idea how this happened , but i m getting really tired of it . ask me questions , y all","304958":"happiness is a state of contentment and joy that an individual feels , whether it s temporarily or on a long term basis . happiness is also subjective , meaning that its meaning depends entirely on the individual , and different things make different people happy .","304959":"i don t ask questions anymore , so never .","304960":"because of the annoying anons who either enforce their fetish onto people , ridicule people , or otherwise ask inappropriate questions . other than that , i think this is a great app .","304961":"it s a tie between instagram askfm , sadly enough . as aggravating as this app is , it s horribly addictive .","304962":"i wholeheartedly agree . that doesn t really change how i view a person who has significantly wronged me , however . if someone does something terribly wrong to myself or someone else , then i don t see anything redeeming about them anymore .","304963":"no , quite the opposite . ever since he took office , more and more racist , sexist , homophobic , transphobic , etc etc . people are coming out and being more open with their hatred because trump has , whether knowingly or not , made it a safer place for these ignorant people to exist and express their hatred .","304964":"it depends on the circumstance . some people have easy lives while other people have harder lives . it isn t really a universal thing .","304965":"in a way , yeah although when i say that they ve done something wrong , it isn t usually something as easy as a silly mistake . it usually happens when they ve made a big mistake or have wronged someone whether it s myself or someone i know , and then all i can see in them are their flaws , which are unforgiving .","304966":"idk i d rather come back as something simple and peaceful , like a tree in the woods or a flake of snow .","304967":"i see the best in people up until they do something wrong , and then i end up seeing the worst in them .","304968":"i d rather not answer questions about my own impending death , thanks .","304969":"i m years old .","304970":"inconsistent .","304971":"honestly , i just can t see myself living for another nearly three decades . i ve barely made it through the first three decades , and who knows what sort of health issues i ll develop before i turn .","304972":"no , i don t currently live with my boyfriend . i spend a lot of time at his house , but we don t live together yet .","304973":"november th .","304974":"if i was double my current age , i would be years old . i don t really see myself living that long .","304975":"partnered ? ? do you mean was i in a relationship ? ? lmao . at the time , my boyfriend and i weren t exactly dating .","304976":"it was a complicated situation i wasn t exactly homeless but i couldn t go anywhere for the night unless i wanted to spend on a hotel room , which i didn t have .","304977":"i didn t have anywhere else to go . sleeping in a car is uncomfortable , especially if you have a small car like i always had .","304978":"you re never too old for a disney or pixar movie . i ll watch them if i see they re on tv or netflix .","304979":"that s awesome . lmaoo . their burgers always look and sound so good . like . . . how . it s a fucking cartoon . hahah .","304980":"i ve always enjoyed bob s burgers ! ! it s one of the few adult cartoons that actually makes me laugh .","304981":"it s a disney animated film about a young chinese woman who impersonates a man in order to serve in the chinese military to take her father s place . i haven t watched it in years , but i just remember enjoying the general premise of the movie , the culture , and the music .","304982":"i can never choose a single favorite of virtually anything .","304983":"inside out , brave , tangled , the emperor s new groove , atlantis the lost empire , treasure planet , and mulan .","304984":"y all should ask me questions while i browse online stores for xmas gifts","304985":"no , i don t play fortnite .","304986":"there s a certain etiquette you need to follow when you re working with the general public , particularly in retail or food service positions , and unfortunately saying that s just me in response to something you might have done that offends a customer won t fly with management and may risk your job . personally speaking , if a customer is acting irrationally and heated and making personal offenses toward the workers , then it s forgiveable to defend yourself against the customer . you have to remind others that you re human too . but that doesn t give anyone permission to personally criticize a customer because then you re acting just as poorly as the customer is .","304987":"i think about this all the time lol . especially considering my background in retail . i worked in retail for four years , and i dealt with hundreds of customers per week and i strangely never lost my cool . however , i m actually pretty quick to anger and things irritate me easily , so whenever someone saw me deal with an irate customer , they would be confused as to how i was still so nice to them . same thing with my boyfriend . he s a very blunt , honest , no bullshit sort of person but he s been working in retail for years now , particularly in positions where he needs to put the customers priorities first . it always amazes me that he hasn t snapped yet .","304988":"being mentally ill isn t exactly a competition , although a lot of ignorant people on the internet seem to like to treat it as it is .","304989":"tribulation matt maeson https youtu . be v d dyrzz","304990":"i only make promises i know i can keep . i place great value in promises and i always hate being on the opposite end of a promise when it isn t fulfilled , so i make sure to never do that to anyone .","304991":"lol . after a few drinks , you won t even feel it . trust me on that . usually when i have muscle pain like that , i take a few ibuprofen . it goes away after a few days .","304992":"i was voted most artistic .","304993":"depends on the situation , but i ll try .","304994":"neither . both are nice , but they don t automatically make me happy . i prefer spending time with my boyfriend and our friends .","304995":"i m doing well . i just got home from work they let us out mins early so i m happy about that ! !","304996":"lmao . no , i m not circumcised .","304997":"uh , yeah they do . a lot of people take off black friday because it s the day after thanksgiving .","304998":"i m not a sweetheart , so don t call me pet names . and if you read my bio , you would see that i m from new york .","304999":"well you asked this yesterday so something good that happened yesterday is that i got the chance to hang out with my boyfriend s bearded dragon and we took a small snooze together . today , it s only am but a good thing that happened is that i got to work on record time because no one is on the road this morning since it s black friday .","305000":"you re better off asking someone who s been hospitalized before . i ve never had to go to the hospital for myself , let alone get general anesthesia .","305001":"i can sing , but that doesn t mean i sing well , lol . my singing voice is atrocious .","305002":"i drive a hyundai accent .","305003":"if you re asking what phone i have , then i have a samsung galaxy s .","305004":"yeah , i ve slept in a car on numerous occasions .","305005":"my day yesterday was pretty good ! ! i spent the day with my boyfriend and his family , and we had thanksgiving dinner and dessert with some extended family who came over later in the afternoon . i ended up getting fairly drunk , so i passed out super early .","305006":"depends on what you mean by much . it depends entirely on the week , though . some weeks i ll go to the bar x while other weeks i won t go at all .","305007":"yeah , i save most of my money and only spend it on necessary items . the only items i splurge on are coffee cigarettes .","305008":"this is a question of much debate and i m not in an unbiased enough position to answer it .","305009":"my day is going

that i shy away from , but it s something that i ve been trying to make better in my life because the truth has been hurting me and my loved ones in some way . i recently had a reality check regarding this issue , which was hard and painful , and since then i ve been trying to make better of the situation .","305025":"i believe that your children should come first above all else it s your job to provide an amazing life for your children and their well being should come before anyone else s , including your significant other . you have to do what s best for your children when you become a parent . those who choose partners over their child are selfish in most cases in that sense , they re basically disregarding what would be best for their child in favor of their own personal wants .","305026":"i ve never cosplayed before , but i ve always wanted to ! ! i think i could really pull off chloe price from life is strange .","305027":"yes , i wholeheartedly believe that true love exists . sometimes it may be hard to find , but i think that everyone has at least one person with whom they re extremely compatible . it all depends on if you find someone and if it s at the right moment of your life .","305028":"today , love is spending time with my boyfriend and his family , sharing good food and conversation , and drinking merrily in the enjoyment of each other s company .","305029":"i assume you meant think outside of the box ? ? if so , then yeah i have my moments where i think of things in an unconventional way that nevertheless gets the job done .","305030":"i use vsco for my mobile photo editing , and sometimes afterlight for a few overlays . i really recommend vsco because you can edit basically anything in regards to light , shadow , saturation , hue , tone , grain , and anything else with color . i ve really enhanced a few of my photos with that app .","305031":"if i m feeling poor mentally , then i usually need my boyfriend , a big mug of coffee , and

i ve developed some street smarts over the years as well .","305065":"i m the youngest child my brother is years older than me . it s never caused any issues because there s such a large age gap

human names to pets , lmao . he has named all of his fish and he had different fish and they re all human or mythological names . he has two oscars named ra and osiris , which i think are really great

know i have the extra cash to spend , and i ve never dangerously dipped below a certain number in my account . i also have a savings account that i transfer money into each month .","305076":"in that case , then yeah , that s not a bad idea at all . i really have to look into this sort of thing with my job , i haven t set anything up yet .","305077":"do school photos count ? ? lol , everyone had professional photos taken during their senior year in high school for the yearbook , and some of them were more creative than others . other than that , no . i have a few friends who are photographers and have asked me to model for them , but i was always too self conscious to say yes .","305078":"whenever i go through my closet and belongings , i always donate my old things if they re in good condition to local thrift shops and the salvation army . i don t give monetary donations to any charities , though . i can t afford to do that , unfortunately .","305079":"first off , that s such a good thing that you re this responsible with your money ! ! it ll pay off in the long run . i don t think that s a bad idea at all , as long as you allocate your money responsibly and still give yourself a liveable wage each week .","305080":"assassin s creed origins . my coworker advocated for this game strongly and said it was the best out of all the other ac games , so i ended up buying it when it was on sale a few months ago . i only played a few hours of it before i got bored and frustrated . half of the game is you running around on a camel , and i hate that .","305081":"hello nothing much . i m waiting for my coworker to get out of work so we can grab dinner together .","305082":"pros i m open and willing to communicate regardless of what the issue is . i enjoy washing dishes and doing laundry . i m always down for nights in and i won t invade your space . cons sometimes my depression causes me to be messy especially in regards to my clothing . at the same time , i like things being neat and organized when i feel better so i can be meticulous when it comes to other people not doing their part in terms of cleanliness . i like candles and smelly stuff so it might bother other people if they re sensitive to scents .","305083":"i avoid some things , but not others . for instance , i experience social anxiety so i avoid crowds and the general public as much as i can . however , i try not to avoid problems because that only makes them worse in the long run .","305084":"probably , but i can t remember specifics . i ve only ever really drifted away from people , and i wouldn t be surprised if it was my fault .","305085":"yeah , unfortunately that s very common when people move in together for the first time . it can either make or break a relationship

buy new clothing that doesnt smell , haha .","305088":"most consecutive cups of coffee drank in a single day .","305089":"no , i don t believe in an afterlife .","305090":"hello","305091":"i like rainy days , but they make me want to stay home and cuddle up with a warm blanket and hot cup of coffee all day , lol .","305092":"i don t even know what this is .","305093":"no , but to be fair , the only person i talk to on a daily basis is my boyfriend . i probably talk to courrtana the most out of everyone listed though .","305094":"apparently even hearing two notes of a song or instrumental that means a lot to me makes me cry , lmao . there was a commercial for imogen heap s music from harry potter the cursed child on spotify , and i immediately began tearing up . smh .","305095":"i put my friends happiness before my own , and sometimes it does exhaust me , but only when i don t take time out for myself to do self care . my friends are generally good at recognizing when i m doing it , though , and they show their appreciation accordingly .","305096":"they re extremely stubborn to the point where they won t acknowledge if they re wrong about something . they re manipulative at times and put on a false front .","305097":"they re one of the most intelligent people i know , even if they don t see it themselves . they ve overcome great adversity to get to where they are today and they ve proven themselves to be a beautiful , selfless human being on a daily basis .","305098":"it depends entirely on the mistake they made and if the apology was sincere . i m more likely to forgive minor transgressions , but big mistakes are pretty much deal breakers for me .","305099":"shehitsback courrtana dovbts urlsareshittbh country peach although i have all of them added on other social media , so i would still be able to talk to them ! !","305100":"i m sorry you don t have access to treatment i ve been there in the past it s rough . however , if you have a support system friends or family or anything then it can be easier . confide in someone you trust regarding your feelings and you ll feel a bit better knowing that someone has your back . there are also online resources and workbooks you can utilize to help with symptoms , and you can find them on amazon ! ! i haven t bought any yet but they seem good .","305101":"no , i don t have any games on my phone . i also never played pubg before , but i watch my boyfriend play it all the time .","305102":"ask me questions , y all i ll answer anything as long as the questions are appropriate ! ! ask me about ? relationships my relationship ? my career education ? my hobbies video games , writing , painting , photography ? controversial opinions ? mental health","305103":"yeah , definitely although i believe most countries could be considered that as well , as wealth defines success and power in most countries .","305104":"i always feel a deep yearning or emptiness when i have to clean the mug cabinet and get rid of mugs that i haven t used in a while . i always regret getting rid of them because i have a really bad mug obsession , and i want to keep every one i see .","305105":"pretty much anything having to do with driving and dealing with other drivers on the road . i don t get road rage per say , but it really bothers me when people are in such a rush that they don t pay attention to what s around them , or they simply don t care . cutting others off , not using blinkers , passing in the right lane , honking obnoxiously , etc etc .","305106":"i m not afraid of attachment , and i actually become attached to people incredibly easy sometimes to the point where it s unhealthy . i ll develop an irrational adoration for them , up until they do something that i think is wrong . when that happens , i can detach myself from people incredibly easily , but it often turns into some form of distaste or dislike for them .","305107":"my day has been fine . two of my coworkers surprised me with gifts for my birthday a mug and a starbucks gift card ! ! i thought that was so sweet of them . other than that , it was a normal day . i just got home from work so i m probably going to play video games for a little bit .","305108":"i love video games try to play as often as i can ! ! lately i ve been replaying fallout , but i also love destiny , skyrim , assassin s creed , tomb raider , bioshock , and red dead redemption .","305109":"i used to enjoy reading a lot , but lately i haven t had the time to read . my favorite authors are stephen king , anne rice , francesca lia block , susanna kaysen , franz kafka , and george orwell . i recommend anything from them .","305110":"i d rather not have internet for six months . i m terrified to go sky diving .","305111":"i ve never been to a chinese buffet before .","305112":"the one who doesn t know when to stop , lol . i have little self control when i drink , and i ll just keep going until you drag me away from the bar .","305113":"i ve been having acid reflux all day , so that s been hurting me . it s making me feel like i m going to vomit .","305114":"i wouldn t exactly call myself an intellectual as a noun , but i can be intelligent about certain things .","305115":"not at all . i always take extremely hot showers .","305116":"the one i identify with most is probably gluttony i don t have much self control , especially when it comes to drinking . the one i identify with least would be greed . i m not greedy by any means and i would rather give my money away in terms of gift giving because it makes people having since money can always be made again .","305117":"regardless of what you say , they re going to feel hurt and pain either way . therefore , it s best to just be honest with them so they get the closure they need . they deserve to know the truth as much as it might hurt .","305118":"fallout for the xbox one ! ! i might buy it this weekend .","305119":"chloe price from life is strange ! !","305120":"rofl . i can guarantee that shehitsback has never sent me an anonymous question besides on accident .","305121":"i ve never heard of them before .","305122":"i wear my clothes on the larger side anyway , so i d rather them be x too big . i m overweight , so wearing clothes that are too small would make me extremely self conscious .","305123":"in most cases , it isn t medically necessary . it s essentially genital mutilation , and it has become so normalized in society that people are under the false impression that it s safer than to not be circumcised . there s also the idea that infants cannot give consent , and to medically alter someone s body in most cases for aesthetic appeal without consent is wrong .","305124":"lol . don t worry , i figured it was you .","305125":"rofl , maybe . some people are so salty over the most random things , so it wouldn t surprise me .","305126":"we ll text , but normally our schedules were so conflicting that we were hardly able to see each other . when i get into bad moods , i also don t tend to use my phone very much so i ll wind up talking to her about it when i feel better .","305127":"it was definitely one of the good ones ! ! i m so grateful for everything , including the people who wished me a happy birthday today , and i m fortunate in that i didn t end up falling into a bad mood . sometimes my birthday makes me depressed , but this weekend was actually great .","305128":"when they don t want to wear makeup anymore . sometimes people wear makeup their entire life , sometimes people never wear makeup , and sometimes people stop wearing makeup because they don t want to wear it anymore . it s circumstantial .","305129":"i only prefer the company of my boyfriend when i m in a bad mood because he s the only person who can really comfort me . if he s not around , then i prefer to be left alone .","305130":"my birthday was good ! ! i got a few gift cards from my brother and cousin , but my main birthday gift was tickets to see harry potter the cursed child , which i saw last weekend . my boyfriend also took me out to a wine tasting event friday night as his gift to me , which was a lot of fun .","305131":"no , i m not putting myself in a position to get potentially hacked , lol .","305132":"i only have the sweet peach one which has some amazing colors . but i really want the pumpkin spice one i love neutrals , especially when they have hints of red and orange .","305133":"i don t generally go to the movies as it is , so i never have . plus the movie theaters around me are super expensive , i d rather just wait for them to appear on demand . however , i do want to watch the new fantastic beasts movie . i just have to see the first one , lol . i heard it might be on netflix .","305134":"high end too faced . their foundation cover up work really well for me , and their eyeshadow palettes are beautiful . drug store elf . they re super cheap and work really well .","305135":"i ve never even heard of that until just now .","305136":"i d prefer if you didn t do that . you should be just fine , just focus on the movie and having fun . remember , people do it all the time .","305137":"people go to the movies alone all the time , it isn t weird or unusual . if you want to see the movie , then go see the movie . the people who work at the theater are probably used to customers going alone , and other people don t care enough to notice .","305138":"idk what you re talking about .","305139":"yeah , i have work tomorrow so i usually wake up around am .","305140":"i don t really remember when the last time was specifically . however , it happens pretty often to me , where i ll get an upset stomach or diarrhea even though nothing i ate was unusual .","305141":"ugh , yes . thankfully it hasn t happened a lot , perhaps only one or two times , but it s absolutely dreadful .","305142":"i m so exhausted that i might just go to bed at pm because i have nothing else to do , lmao . y all should send me questions to keep me awake","305143":"sometimes i ll take it personally if i know the reason why they need space is directly because of me . otherwise it doesn t bother me . everyone needs space , including myself , and it s normal to distance yourself from people temporarily .","305144":"it s actually both . advanced as an adjective means ahead in progression , while advanced as a verb means to move ahead .","305145":"where have i complained about my anons ? ? i generally get good anons with a few select exceptions .","305146":"they both have wonderful characters .","305147":"i would tell them , no one wants to have bad hygiene and as long as you re not mean about it , it s fine to tell a friend that they should be more aware of it . i would still be friends with them regardless .","305148":"better at what ? ? you ll have to be more specific .","305149":"no , i ve never had baby fever before .","305150":"i try not to because it s a harmful emotion and hurts you more than it hurts the other person . i ve learned to move on .","305151":"no , that s shallow . i could never date someone solely because of what they looked like . personality is what keeps a couple together .","305152":"not really , no . occasionally i ll get something in the wrong size on accident , but it hasn t been a big deal because it still fit me .","305153":"yeah , i volunteered in the past . my boyfriend and i used to volunteer for a local children s basketball tournament held at his church . we would sell different drinks and candy for the kids and parents , and the proceeds would go towards a scholarship .","305154":"lol , no . i ve actually never dyed my hair green before .","305155":"no , i haven t done that in years because i can t handle the crowds of people . i might check out some online deals on cyber monday , though .","305156":"i usually wait until the last minute , lol . i have the horrible tendency to do my xmas shopping within the three weeks before xmas .","305157":"no , i m bisexual .","305158":"i m proud of my cv because i spent a lot of time on it when i was updating it one year ago , lol . i don t have much experience , so i focused more on my skills and job responsibilities as opposed to the few jobs themselves . i never add things that aren t true , though . that s setting yourself up for disappointment because you may be hired based on an untrue skill , and then you pretty much have no idea what you re doing and may put your job at risk .","305159":"it s always good to follow up with the company a few days to a week after submitting your application . it shows them that you care about getting the job and that you re responsible enough to follow up . don t get discouraged if a job never calls you back . there are always other places you can apply to , and sometimes it works out for the better because you may find an even better opportunity .","305160":"my family does , but i personally don t . i can t really be around real flowers because i have allergies and they make me congested .","305161":"no , i ve never done that before . i ve gotten angry , yeah , but i generally kept it to myself .","305162":"both sound pretty terrible because i hate being around people when i m sick , but i suppose i would rather be sick on xmas because that means i probably wouldn t have to go out for xmas dinner and i could stay home instead .","305163":"i don t know if they prefer mother or parent , but either way , i know this is something they ve wanted for a long time and they re going to be terrific at parenting ! ! cc manicmartyrdom","305164":"i don t really understand this question . halloween was a month ago .","305165":"no , but i m currently listening to her song i m in love . she s definitely different ! ! very interesting style .","305166":"aw , thank you ! !","305167":"i don t have any photos of my handwriting .","305168":"well it s only pm , but my day has been fine so far . i went out last night , so i didn t get to bed until late and woke up around am . i had breakfast and i ve just been laying in bed and watching television all afternoon .","305169":"i ve been drinking coffee and watching harry potter the half blood prince .","305170":"probably , there are a lot of silly things that are technically illegal that most people don t realize are illegal . some places have some ridiculous laws .","305171":"that doesn t matter . you made the promise to keep their secrets while you were friends , that doesn t automatically go away when you re not friends anymore . think of it this way if you confided in someone with some of your most personal information , how would you feel if they told other people upon having a falling out with them ? ? it s disrespectful .","305172":"no , not at all . just because you re not friends with a person anymore doesn t mean that it s okay to reveal their secrets that they confided in you . to tell other people their secrets would be a significant betrayal .","305173":"my boyfriend is one of the most selfless people i know . he always sacrifices his own comfort and happiness to ensure that others are happy , and he ll gladly give you his jacket if you need it , even if he needs it too .","305174":"in all seriousness you need to stop harassing people on this website . obviously you ve been banned for your antics once before , and you ll continue to be banned the more you bother others with your lackluster inquiries and blatant disregard for people s feelings . idk if this will be understood by you at all considering how you ve already responded to me in the past , but in the off chance you do understand , this is your final warning .","305175":"there s only one neighbor that i sorta know , but it s unfortunately because he s an as hole and yells at everyone , lol . my family and him have had problems in the past because he frequently yelled at our landscapers , and they were literally just doing their job . that infuriated me .","305176":"one of my friends that i see often is probably the most chatty , lol . i saw her last night however , it s a good thing because she always has interesting stories to tell and i m more of a listener anyway . usually they re about her boy problems , things happening at work , and her drunken escapades .","305177":"i m becoming increasingly concerned for you . i clearly said i was playing video games , not having sex . your reading comprehension skills need serious improvement .","305178":"strangely enough , this is not the first time someone has compared me to a unicorn , lol .","305179":"my boyfriend gives me the most support and encouragement . he always tells me his perspective on things and tells me when i m getting bad again , because often he realizes it before i realize it myself . he s also incredibly heartfelt and sentimental so he ll go out of his way to make me comfortable and happy .","305180":"hello i m doing well , just playing video games at the moment .","305181":"that s okay ! ! this one will probably get banned soon enough , he seems to be bothering a few people in my feed lately .","305182":"are you okay ? ? at this point , i m becoming concerned for your health .","305183":"smoking cigarettes .","305184":"lol , i figured as much . usually i just ignore people like that , but i m bored and felt like entertaining the notion . perhaps he ll soon realize how silly he s acting .","305185":"i m years old .","305186":"these are just words . . . this isn t even a full sentence . congratulations on knowing how to spell , but you re never going to find a partner if all you do is spat out the names of body parts like diarrhea from the mouth .","305187":"you really can t take a hint , can you ? ?","305188":"i want a cup of coffee and a cigarette .","305189":"nah , not really . we just do the regular gift giving and we have dinner together with relatives on both xmas eve and xmas day . i m still debating on whether or not i should go into work on xmas eve since the office will be open .","305190":"if i had a dollar for every time i ve said hello to inanimate objects , then i would be fairly wealthy . my coworker has this habit of going hello ? when things aren t working , like her computer , and i picked up on it and now i ve been saying it to everything , lmaoo .","305191":"i m not really looking forward to xmas at all , lol . i do enjoy buying people gifts , though . it makes me happy to see people enjoying what i ve gotten them .","305192":"no , not at all . crying is a natural human response to stimuli and it isn t any indication of weakness .","305193":"i think it s pathetic , but they don t scare me . ben is just laughable at this point .","305194":"i m not the oldest person on askfm at all , lol . but yes , i did update my bio .","305195":"thank you so much ! !","305196":"thank you ! ! ?","305197":"i like autumn the most . i love the chilly weather , getting to bundle up in hoodies , and the seasonal drinks like pumpkin coffee .","305198":"it s pretty much my go to drink when i can t figure out what i want , lol .","305199":"i m drunk . i can t explain shit rn , lmaooo .","305200":"i don t like xmas , so i don t really admire any trees . however , my family puts up our own tree every year .","305201":"unfortunately , no ! ! i ve always

.","305204":"if you don t believe in god , then this statement is invalid . just saying .","305205":"like i said , research laveyan satanism for a better understanding of it all . i m not really in a position to explain its principles right now .","305206":"y all are reading into this way too much .","305207":"yourself if you research into it , then you ll get a better understanding of the religion .","305208":"no , i m not religious or spiritual . however , if i had to pick one , it would be laveyan satanism .","305209":"i m fairly certain black craft cult follows laveyan satanism , and the beliefs behind that religion isn t devil worshipping or anything of that nature . their main ideologies follow the guidelines that we are our own gods and to believe in ourselves , which is something i m percent behind . i also really love dark aesthetics .","305210":"i can t tell if you re offended or amazed , but either way , you re not wrong .","305211":"literally obsessed with this new cardigan from black craft cult . ?","305212":"a boat , matches , and water .","305213":"depends on what you prefer playing and if a newer console is important to you when it comes to gaming . some people will purchase the newest models right away , while other people don t care as much . i ve had my xbox one for perhaps two years now , and i have no desire to buy the xbox one x . my console works perfectly fine the way it is .","305214":"i dislike the concept of using animals as clothing . i own a leather jacket , but it s fake leather .","305215":"a few years ago , i played on a catholic youth organization s adult volleyball team for one summer with my boyfriend a few of our friends .","305216":"i wholeheartedly agree . that sort of behavior is cruel and unwarranted , no one deserves to be lied to and strung along like that .","305217":"i dislike grapes and celery .","305218":"i prefer rainy weather over most other kinds of weather , actually . i find rain to be relaxing , especially when i have a candle lit and a cup of coffee or tea in my hands .","305219":"make a cup of coffee have a cigarette outside . my life wouldn t be much different than how it currently is .","305220":"i honestly don t remember the names of any of the positions . it s been years since i practiced yoga .","305221":"i think i answered this question yesterday , but i can t fully remember . i like snow because it s beautiful , but driving in snow is terrifying to me . i try to avoid it at all costs .","305222":"not anymore . i used to practice yoga years ago with my best friend , but i stopped because we simply didn t have the time to do it together anymore .","305223":"no , i don t like fireworks at all . they re unsettling to me and the noise is way too much for me to handle

homophobia , etc etc . chamomile tea . mayonnaise .","305226":"i usually don t deal with stupid people , so it isn t something that s an issue for me . if someone is bothering me , then i ll just walk away from them .","305227":"not really , no . i like having money , but i use it to purchase experiences , not items . with the exception of some clothing , lmao . i just bought a new hoodie from black craft cult this past weekend i m in love with it .","305228":"no , i don t see myself dating anyone else . we ve been together for nine years i used to think it was eight , until i realized we started dating in , lol . we ve been through hell back together , and i can t really see a reason why we would break up at this point in our relationship unless one of us did something unforgivable that would completely shatter our trust in each other . but the chances of that happening are slim to none anyway .","305229":"i thought lying was the correct term in that scenario .","305230":"not at my current job , no . i only really know a few people at my job and they re all within my department , and they re all really nice and interesting people . idk anyone from the other departments , though .","305231":"this is , like . . . the fifth time you asked me this question in the past hours . i m fine . stop asking me this question . i deleted the rest of them , just like the rest of your questions that you ve repeated times .","305232":"it depends entirely on the individual and circumstance . it s difficult to give a universal answer to this kind of question because everyone s situations are different and what will help one person may not help another .","305233":"i prefer replying to questions . i seldom ask questions anymore , i only do it on rare or special occasions when my feed is particularly dead .","305234":"a good person is someone who wants the best for themselves and those around them , who will do morally good things to further the well being of

ve never been afraid of mirrors before .","305237":"this month alone has been a definite highlight last weekend , i saw the play harry potter the cursed child , which was brilliant and beautiful and amazing and made me cry tears of joy . last night was also a highlight , i haven t had that much fun in such a long time , and it also felt nice to be away from family and responsibilities for a change , even if it was only for one night .","305238":"no , not at all . there are a lot of shows that have a lot of hype around them that i ve never watched before .","305239":"uh , sorry if i wouldn t want to be in a relationship with a person who can easily m rder another living human being with no thought or remorse ? ? that s generally what happens when there s no justifiable reason behind a m rder .","305240":"thank you for the suggestion ! ! i just checked out two of his songs , and tbh , it isn t really my style . i can definitely see the appeal , though . he kinda sounds like twenty one pilots .","305241":"i honestly have no idea . i woke up to new questions this morning although a lot of them were exact repeats of each other , so i ended up deleting around of them or so . i still have left in my inbox after this question . i get bothered when i spam my friends feeds with my answers , but i also don t like when my inbox is overflowing .","305242":"my boyfriend makes me happier than anything else in my life . video games , alcohol , and coffee also make me really happy .","305243":"no , i don t really like cooking . i don t have much experience cooking at all , and

adventures , ghost hunters , paranormal lockdown , ancient aliens , orange is the new black , game of thrones , american horror story , and supernatural .","305245":"to me personally , honesty means that a person holds virtues that include sincerity , trustworthiness , loyalty , and fairness . to be honest means to be without moral corruption , such as lying or cheating , and it also means to be straight forward without being fake or sugar coating the truth .","305246":"respect is a noun which means a feeling of admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities , qualities , or achievements .","305247":"contentment is a noun that means a state of happiness or satisfaction .","305248":"yeah , i used to regularly play poker with my boyfriend and his friends . we still do whenever we have the chance to all see each other , we ll have poker nights .","305249":"i prefer nu metal , but i sometimes listen to regular metal . i think the only bands that fall under the metal category that i listen to are metallica , avenged sevenfold , and in this moment ."}}
