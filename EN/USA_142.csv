   Clearly I have facts. I've already provided them on Tori's page (Which you've clearly seen). All you have to do, is say you're willing to say she's racist when provided with the facts on your page. You will be flooded with facts afterwards. Not difficult at all. Say it and facts will flood your page
  ","
  what facts?? like i’ve said before i’ve been on her page and don’t see anything she has said racist .
  
  so how about you provide another fact instead of the one you kept repeatedly saying for the last hr. if it’s on her page & i don’t see them how about you provide those facts instead of talking out your ass
  "
761754,"
   Why won't you say you're willing to say she's racist when provided with the facts? It's like someone saying to you, I'll prove to you water is clear, but you must admit you're willing to say water is clear, if I provide you with facts to back it up. Proceeded by you ranting on how you have no facts.
  ","
  and you’re just literally like copying and pasting what you said and rewording it differently lmao .
  
  i cant debate or listen to someone with an opinion with zero facts
  "
761755,"
   I don’t even know what this anon is on about anymore 🤦🏼‍♀️ 
Who do they think they are? God? ‘ do what I want and you’ll get your facts.’  Lorddddddd
  ","
  lmfaooo ; exactly they only keep repeating themselves to make them self seem smart
  
  i don’t get how they get through life or a debate . or have an opinion without facts lmao
  "
761756,"
   You know it's actually me that sent you that.. The same person who specifically said, this is exactly what I DON'T want you to do. So pretending this is what I want you to do, is very cute and all. But it just proves my point.  And now, you and I both know the truth ;)
  ","
  lmfaooo ; you’re still here trying to prove someone is racist without facts 😂.
  
  i don’t even know even know how you get through life or a debate with someone when u can’t provide simple facts 😂

  thank you.
  
  i’m not just gonna call someone racist without facts
  
  and plus i know Tori isn’t racist
  "
761759,"
   Do you consider yourself to be 'woke'?
  ","
  for certain things yeah
  "
761760,"
   If this person was so sure someone is raciest why aren’t they quick to prove it? If I had the facts that someone was being raciest or anything like that you bet your ass I’d be backing it up with facts to make everyone knows about it, I’m confused ???
  ","
  exactly what i’m saying .
  
  they keep going around in circles saying the same shxt. like as if they copied and paste what they said .
  
  they have zero facts .
  "
761761,"
   Damn! lol
  ","
  ?????
  "
761762,"
   Yes I can.. Do you even know what the ""something"" I need you to do before I provide the facts is? This is very standard. Go back and read what the ""something"" is. It is extremely reasonable.
  ","
  if u can’t give me facts get off my page until u find them
  
  any further questions from u will be deleted .
  
  i’m tired of going around in circles with a dumbass
  "
761763,"
   But what does anon want you to do to get the facts? Anon said  they'll give facts if you do something. What something?
  ","
  if i say my friend is racist lmao
  
  even tho they provided me with no facts .
  
  like i said i can’t do / say something with no facts to backup their claim
  "
761764,"
   I've said this a vast amount of times now. In order for me to provide the facts on your page, you will need to do the ""something"" I've already specified. Do this ""something"" and you will be flooded with facts. You have currently failed to do this ""something"" so facts wont be provided on your page.
  ","
  because you have Z E R O
  
  you can’t expect me to do something / say something when u haven’t provided me with FACT(S)
  "
761765,"
   What's the thing anon wants you to do?
  ","
  i want facts but see zero from that anon .
  
  you can’t expect me to do something with zero facts to backup your claim

761766,"
   *he

  *you
  "
761767,"
   Did you read the last question I sent? I clearly stated you've got to do something first before I provide them on your page. Do you understand? Do that ""something"" and you'll be flooded with fact on your page.
  ","
  i guess you don’t know what facts are.

  "
761772,"
   Why do you keep saying ""Where are my facts"" I've already told you they are on her page. Also said I am very willing to provide them on your page too. All you need to do is say you're willing to call her out on her racism when I provide you with the fact. Absolutely nothing unreasonable about that.
  ","
  but u haven’t provided shxt for me besides saying “their on her psge” like bxtch where???
  
  i’m always on her page .

  "
761776,"
   I said I'm willing to give you the facts. But if you're going to cry about the facts, there is no point in me giving you the facts. So are you willing to admit she's racist, if I present the facts again. Don't avoid the question.
  ","
  lmfaooooo ; you’re going around in circles here anon .
  
  where are my facts???
  
  oh yeah, that’s right . you don’t have any 😂.
  
  you’ll most likely twist her twist around her words or make up some bullshxt like u already are 🤷🏻‍♀️
  "
761777,"
   I literally never mention race on my page, unless someone asks me about it or when I want to learn something new. I keep out of politics too. Bc everyone wants to be right and no one is willing to be like "" nah sorry I got it wrong, my bad"" like ???

   Oh, so you haven't been scrolling down her page. Okay, So when I provide you with the fact on your page, will you be willing to admit she's racist or will you be stubborn about it?
  ","
  i didn’t ask for a statement with a question
  
  i asked for facts lmao

   So annoying. If my kid is female. I'd probably raise them as a girl. Not gender neutral. If they say they are a boy then I'll make the correct changes (new clothing, etc) and support them. Until then they'll always be my daughter not my theyby 🤷‍♀️
  ","
  thank you!!! say it louder for this anon who won’t come back 🗣🗣🗣.
  
  if my son comes up to me telling me he’s pansexual or something & he has educated himself then cool .
  
  but if i know he hasn’t educated himself then i’ll just feel like he’s following a trend bc that’s what this world wants 🤷🏻‍♀️
  "
761850,"
   i'm gonna sound like an asxhole here but the whole “my child is male/female until THEY DECIDE otherwise” sounds delusional to me 😂 to me you don't decide that, it is what it is, biological. just like race. an inconsequential factor of your birth. just accept that fact and stop lying to yourself 🤷
  ","
  i just want my child to be able to educate themself on these terms before they decide any path .
  
  just my opinion lol

761852,"
   Ok but ....Does the baby specifically say what gender they are in the womb? No? Then it's up to the parents to decide and when the child is old enough can then explain how they feel.

   YouTubers who make videos on true crime cases, Do you think they're doing good or doing wrong? Many think that they're doing good due to spreading awareness and many think they're doing wrong due to it 'being disrespectful'. What do you think and why? Do you think it differs case to case?

   I remember people frequently asking them if they'd ever have kids and they always replied with a ""no"", then, surprisingly, after a few weeks they announced their pregnancy. They're clearly treating Rowan as a burden, not as a baby with needs to be fulfilled on a daily basis.

  exactly!!! like they went 8 months with a big ass belly , feeling movement but didn’t know they were pregnant. i think bc their herbal abortion didn’t work they were drinking heavily knowing they were pregnant to try and have an abortion that way

   by that logic you don't come out thinking you're straight so how does that happen? most ppl had their first crush in early elementary so if you can know you like girls or boys, you can know you're different from early on/was born that way dummy. logic.
