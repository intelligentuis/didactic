especially during this pandemic .","272951":"i m not sure where you re getting the impression that i don t prioritize my money or save money , but i can assure you that your assumption is wrong . i m actually excellent at saving money , and just because i can afford my appointments and medication doesn t mean that i can t believe that health care should be more affordable . not everyone has the privilege that i have of having insurance and being able to afford things , even with the insurance .","272952":"they aren t tools , but i have a favorite spatula and a favorite ice cube tray .","272953":"it s pretty easy for me to cut others out of my life , to be honest . especially if they ve done something to hurt me , i have no issues with ghosting people or removing them .","272954":"where did i say that ? rofl . god forbid i wish i didn t have to pay extraordinary amounts of money for things that are keeping me alive .","272955":"my medication , honestly . i would be dreadfully , severely depressed without my meds and i don t know how i would act if i wasn t on any of them at all .","272956":"at this point in my life , i wouldn t forgive them or take them back . i m not here to play games with people , and just because it was a one night stand doesn t lessen the hurt and lack of trust that comes as a result of the affair .","272957":"i have health insurance , but that doesn t mean that my appointments or my medications are free . lol . welcome to america .","272958":"personally , i believe so but i don t think they understand what it means to be a gender , they re just having the knowledge of the stereotypes associated with assigned genders at birth and realizing that they like the opposite of what is assigned to them i . e . boys liking trucks and sports and girls liking dolls and dresses . i have a friend who has a daughter who is around . . . i think like , or ? and her daughter came out as trans two years ago or so . so i think kids definitely have some understanding of what they are versus what society expects them to be .","272959":"doctor appointments and medication .","272960":"cont . . . summer , haha . tbh , i absolutely hate summer weather , lol . it gets very hot and humid where i live , so i love the autumn so much more . i like the chilly weather and wearing hoodies , the cool air makes me feel so much more alive .","272961":"the meaning of life is to find a life of meaning significance . or to develop your life and giving it a true purpose .","272962":"no , there isn t . the people who aren t in my life anymore aren t there for a valid reason , and i have no regrets with cutting people out of my life .","272963":"i would rather paint a pumpkin . i love painting and should do it more often , tbh .","272964":"i believe that dreams are insight into your unconscious thoughts that you perhaps can t acknowledge in your waking hours , but there are a lot of things that can be insignificant that people think are important .","272965":"yeah ! ! i mean , right now it s degrees fahrenheit which isn t terribly cold , but last night when i was outside having a campfire , it was fairly chilly . i think it was in the high s last night .","272966":"i know a few people who have gotten married during the pandemic , but they were very small ceremonies mostly courtroom things and a small reception afterwards . but i think if people are having elaborate weddings and parties , then that s very irresponsible .","272967":"yes , i do","272968":"i haven t even thought about christmas , tbh . i don t usually do my shopping until mid to late november .","272969":"pretty much anything else .","272970":"iced pumpkin coffee from dunkin ! !","272971":"yeah , i ve only been on one trip that involved a plane , but i ended up taking four different flights during that trip , haha .","272972":"i hate having my photo taken by someone else , ugh . i just prefer selfies and to be behind the camera when taking photos of other people .","272973":"i m more of a realist than anything else , but i can also be a bit pessimistic at times .","272974":"i find it difficult to focus a lot on the lyrics when i m listening to a song because i need time to process it while also listening to the melody . i like reading the lyrics as i listen to the song .","272975":"i cannot cook very well at all , haha . i m just good at making breakfast meals .","272976":"i normally play video games with friends to distract me and cheer myself up , or i ll put on a comedy show that s on netflix or youtube .","272977":"playing video games , most definitely . i can be playing a game for hours and not even realize how much time has passed .","272978":"adorable ! ! i think they re really cute .","272979":"there are dozens of autumn inspired festivals in eastern long island , like where the vineyards and breweries are and whatnot . i ve never been to any of them , though .","272980":"scrambled eggs .","272981":"absolutely . better to be safe than sorry .","272982":"i don t cook , i don t clean , but let me tell you how i got this ring","272983":"on several occasions , yes . for some reason , they all happened when i was walking in new york city , where there were dozens of people around me , lol .","272984":"take a shower , put on cozy clothing , turn on the television or listen to music , and crack open a beer or a bottle of wine .","272985":"i used to like years ago , but it was pretty short lived .","272986":"you have a higher risk of contracting covid or any illness in general at this point or passing on that risk to someone else .","272987":"sitting cross legged on my bed with my vape in one hand a glass of wine in the other .","272988":"i can only speak english .","272989":"yeah , that s extremely common .","272990":"sleeping is one of my favorite hobbies .","272991":"it depends , because i m either very proactive and keep on top of things easily , or i m the complete opposite and lose all motivation to do even the simplest of tasks .","272992":"hello i m doing all right , just exhausted . it was a productive day overall , and now i m in a state of shock regarding the recent news about rooster teeth achievement hunter . i m searching reddit and twitter regarding more information , but i can t find much .","272993":"i ve definitely done that before , rofl . i always get such a rush of adrenaline when i find out that i m the imposter .","272994":"i honestly have no idea . i think i want to keep it the same length , but also do a dark brown red balayage .","272995":"twix bars or reese s cups ! !","272996":"there are only a select few people to whom i would do that , but yes .","272997":"i ve faced discrimination toward being non binary , bisexual , and mentally ill .","272998":"i don t get violent towards people in confrontations , so no . whether or not a person is disabled doesn t change my stance on that .","272999":"the saw series is my favorite horror thriller series . unfortunately , i haven t watched all of them , but they re so f cking good .","273000":"rainbow cookies and or cheesecake .","273001":"i like pumpkin iced coffee apple cider donuts . lmaoo .","273002":"omg . the best bread ever .","273003":"no . that s an ableist way of thinking .","273004":"i usually smoke weed at night to help myself fall asleep .","273005":"interesting ! ! i ll keep that in mind .","273006":"i was at earlier this evening , and the cashier saw my birthday when he asked for me id and said , oh , that s a bad day for me . that s the date that my dad died . like . . . what . why would you tell a total stranger that , lmaoo .","273007":"i personally love the potatoe bread hot dog buns , but that s just my opinion . lmaoo .","273008":"i ve been drinking what i ve been drinking has a lot of sugar in it , so i m probably going to wake up with a hangover tomorrow .","273009":"i don t know if i want children , so i m going out on a limb here and saying no .","273010":"i support anyone who wants plastic surgery because this is their own body , and they have the bodily autonomy to do as they please . i would perhaps get plastic surgery one day to give myself a more defined jawline .","273011":"it could just be empathy towards another person . if that anxiety is preventing you from doing regular tasks , whether personally or professionally , then i advise you to see a doctor about your symptoms .","273012":"waking up , having some caffeine and breakfast , then doing laundry and or cleaning parts of the house . i also tend to peruse social media on my laptop or play video games .","273013":"i absolutely fucking love that game . lmao . i play it every once in a while with friends , and it s the funniest game ever .","273014":"probably askfm , tbh . other than that , i ve been using facebook , instagram , and tik tok a lot .","273015":"my friend just went home , and we spent a good hours just chatting and sitting around a campfire in my backyard tonight . it made me very happy .","273016":"i ve never watched that show before , actually .","273017":"probably cat toys , lmfao .","273018":"i wasn t too familiar with shawnie , so i didnt cry . however , i do feel extremely terrible for her family and children and friends , and i believe she fought until the very last minute .","273019":"i mean , it depends on the exact situation , but normally cheating is frowned down upon in most circumstances . if you feel the need to cheat on your partner , then simply talk to them about how you feel and come to a resolution that s the mature thing to do .","273020":"i take my medication around the same time every day , but it isn t exact . i normally take my morning medication around am , my afternoon meds at around pm , and my evening meds between pm .","273021":"my roommate showed me a tik tok where someone put a hot dog in a folded slice of white bread . white . bread . what even . . .","273022":"well yeah , that means that you have low self esteem that s something you need to improve upon as you get older .","273023":"yes , i ve been handcuffed before .","273024":"playing video games , journaling , listening to music , and watching television .","273025":"i change my hair whenever i get bored , which is usually once every few months .","273026":"i seldom remember my dreams .","273027":"i ve had both manicures and pedicures , and i don t like them much tbh . i can tolerate manicures more than pedicures , but i always feel self conscious when they re rubbing the lotion on your arm because of my scars .","273028":"i usually love reading , but i haven t actually finished a book in a very long time .","273029":"no , my handwriting is absolutely atrocious .","273030":"hoodies leggings .","273031":"i bought mcdonalds breakfast this morning , rofl . i feel guilty a lot of times , which is why i try to limit my spending to things i might need , not want .","273032":"i saw you play it briefly on twitch the other night ! ! it sounds like a lot of fun .","273033":"my best friend .","273034":"you don t really have anything to do with the information , but it s simply interesting , at least to me it was . i never knew my ancestry before this , so it was intriguing to me personally .","273035":"when it comes to situations like these , i always trust my gut feeling bring it up afterwards . i don t see why your partner wouldn t want you to meet their friends unless they were afraid of cautious of something .","273036":"i was listening to a phone call between a client and a sales presentative today , and most of the information was pretty useless and not relevant to what i was writing , so i kept skipping ahead . i randomly landed on a certain time the client was in the middle of singing frere jacques to the sales rep , lmaoo .","273037":"no , i ve never cheated on a partner before .","273038":"perhaps not to you , but i found my ancestry to be incredibly interesting .","273039":"i found out that there were more european counties a lot of eastern europe , actually in my genetics than i thought . i don t have the results in front of me rn , though .","273040":"i haven t dressed up for halloween in years , but i would love to do something sweeney todd mrs . lovett sort of thing .","273041":"i used andme years ago , and it was interesting to see what my ancestry was made of . there were a lot of european countries that i didn t know i had in me . i would recommend it , but only if it s on sale . it s pretty expensive .","273042":"outlast , resident evil biohazard , and layers of fear .","273043":"no , you guys probably just have allergies because the seasons are changing .","273044":"i saw a post on facebook of this could not believe it wasn t satire , so i went on his page . . . and it s all true . and there . like . . . what .","273045":"? ? ? i don t even know which question was yours , lol .","273046":"i have unanswered questions in my inbox . chill .","273047":"uh . . . is trump ok .","273048":"even though this was a mass message , thank you","273049":"absolutely nothing .","273050":"hello do you have a question ?","273051":"i prefer white wine .","273052":"i don t have any plans for most of the week . however , on friday i m going to go camping with a few of my friends .","273053":"i wash dry my own clothes .","273054":"whoa , i like this demo version better than the released version ? calling all lp fans . https www . youtube . com watch ? v ahqeezagolk","273055":"mint ! !","273056":"whichever you prefer .","273057":"yeah , i d say about half of the questions i get are from anons .","273058":"yeah , at least when i have the spare time to keep up with the activity , lol .","273059":"never , which i know is terrible . the last time i went to an internist or family physician was , like . . . years ago when i was s icidal , and they did a general workup on me while they were evaluating me .","273060":"it s been relaxing , thankfully . i m listening to an indie music playlist on spotify and drinking wine while just scrolling through social media .","273061":"i d ask them their reasons behind it first , it isn t really something i would do automatically without questioning their morals and what they value .","273062":"people are much more complex than others give them credit for . like , i don t really care at the end of the day what other people s opinions are , unless they re a close personal friend of mine . i don t see why that isn t hard to understand , lol .","273063":"it would depend on the individual person . regardless , i m not interested in making new friends so this wouldn t happen anyway .","273064":"no . the only people i care about are my friends . i don t have the mental energy to actually hate people .","273065":"i can say people are racist without having personal feelings towards them . i don t care about what most people think .","273066":"i ll say it again i don t really care about what other people think about trump .","273067":"i don t really care about what other people think about trump .","273068":"i wouldn t be rude to someone , no . i know a few people who have voted for trump , but that doesn t give me permission to be rude to them .","273069":"i don t answer sexual questions .","273070":"how so ?","273071":"marijuana has obvious medical benefits , which is why it is legalized in particular areas for medicinal purposes . i think it should be legalized so more people can reap the benefits of that , and also taxed sold in the same regard that alcohol and cigarettes are sold .","273072":"i retract my previous statement actually apparently according to a harvard article based on the journal of the american medical association , marijuana may have withdrawal symptoms if you use it heavily for a long time . the last time i looked this up , i didn t see these results .","273073":"yes , you re indeed correct .","273074":"this is a pretty controversial question from my understanding , because people argue for both sides of the coin . i don t believe you can be addicted to marijuana in itself , but you can most definitely be reliant on the feelings marijuana brings on . the main thing about addiction is that withdrawal has to happen , i believe . you don t withdraw from marijuana if you stop using it .","273075":"i don t know very much about marxism .","273076":"no , although admittedly i probably do have a dependency on alcohol .","273077":"somehow , no . lol . it s good to pass the time , especially on nights like tonight when i have nothing else to do .","273078":"doing drugs and being addicted to drugs are two different things . regardless , there are usually underlying mental health conditions that accompany drug addiction , which is why appropriate rehabilitation and follow up is integral to recovery .","273079":"i haven t kept up on the george floyd case in at least two weeks , so i honestly don t know . i ll go out on a limb say they haven t been charged if they were arrested , though .","273080":"yes , drug addiction is listed as substance use disorder in the dsm v and icd . it is wholeheartedly a mental health issue .","273081":"i never stated they couldn t . i said it was in rare circumstances , my dude .","273082":"i mean , if someone is an addict then they require the help they deserve to overcome their addiction . being a drug addict isn t a flaw , it s a mental health medical issue that requires support . that s different from being racist , obviously . if a celebrity is racist then i won t support them .","273083":"i believe all people should be equal , which unfortunately is not reality .","273084":"quite the opposite of how i behave , but whatever floats your boat helps you sleep at night .","273085":"yes , that does .","273086":"it doesn t affect me , and i honestly don t care when it comes down to it . however , i was asked my opinion therefore , i provided my opinion .","273087":"it does happen , but in extremely rare instances .","273088":"that s very rarely the case because by making a r pe allegation , you re putting your entire reputation career on the line , among the other triggers and traumas that come as a result of it and also the r pe itself . point blank i believe survivors . everyone should .","273089":"perhaps islam is just confusing to me in general , but i don t really understand how you can personally not support gay marriage but still believe that gay marriage should be legal . this is different than abortion because that has to do with your own body , meanwhile if you re not even gay then it doesn t affect you .","273090":"i don t answer sexual questions .","273091":"anons are stirring up drama , as always . lmfao .","273092":"look at the statistics of people who have been ab sed but their ab se was never brought to justice because of a lack of evidence . the system itself isn t designed to support survivors , and if there are several different people coming forward with their stories , then that should be taken seriously .","273093":"i suppose this ties into my belief that organized religion is bad , then . i believe that you can be religious yet still understand that people should have equal rights outside of your religion .","273094":"sounds like you re defending trump for being a r pist because you don t want to deal with the reality of him being a very disgusting person .","273095":"please see my previous answer .","273096":"i would still consider that homophobic . just because you re muslim doesn t mean you have to believe everything that the quran says .","273097":"yes , i quite understand that these are your views . perhaps you ll get better feedback if you wrote about this on your own askfm page instead of on someone s page who obviously disagrees with you , lol .","273098":"this sounds a lot like a blame the victim mentality , which is disheartening . i ain t here for people who don t believe survivors of ab se .","273099":"i m not sure how you can support lgbtq rights while not supporting gay marriage .","273100":"even though i dislike organized religion , i wouldn t hold that against a person who is religious because someone can be devoted to their religion while still understanding that everyone is deserving of equality and their own rights .","273101":"yeah , there are several cases against him in terms of assault ab se .","273102":"several of my friends are christian catholic , so yeah .","273103":"like i stated earlier . . . they haven t used askfm for months , or even a year or more . i don t see why this is even a topic of discussion ? who cares , lmao .","273104":"eh , i wouldn t necessarily classify that as a mental health issue personally , but to each their own . i believe that people who aren t white and do support trump probably have ancestral racism that s been passed down through generations .","273105":"no , that seems unnecessary and silly .","273106":"thank you i appreciate your honesty and sincerity . and not to mention , like . . . this is askfm . do these people really think i m going to get all bent out of shape simply because they re making a huge deal out of my own opinions ? rofl .","273107":"i agree with you . it s also obvious that these anons watch most of them be the same person , lol are simply trolling because they do disagree with me , and they re just spouting nonsense to try to get a rise out of me .","273108":"half of it depends on her individual views , like i stated earlier . however , i vehemently dislike trump because he is a known racist , among other terrible things , and if someone pretty much forgives trump for what he s said and done because they simply identify more with the republican party , then that s doing this country a disservice .","273109":"people are are anti fascist don t use violence to show that they believe fascism is bad which it is . fascism is obviously very bad .","273110":"people who are anti fascist aren t oppressive towards others , and if they are , then they re obviously working toward their own personal vendetta under the guise of anti fascism to give the idea a bad name .","273111":"this makes zero sense , but whatever makes you feel better , dude .","273112":"that may be a standard definition in terms of a dictionary , but that does not take into account historical , sociological , or psychological contexts .","273113":"people can come together in a protest under the shared idea of being anti fascist , but that doesn t mean antifa is a group in itself . the commonality is that people who are anti fascist don t want someone like trump to be the leader of the united states because he himself is pretty much fascist .","273114":"probably at some point .","273115":"if that person who was m rdered is white , that isn t racism . white people experience discrimination , but racism is a system of oppression which has been acted upon by white people toward other races . it s historically accurate .","273116":"what else is new ? rofl .","273117":"antifa isn t a group . it s a term that means anti fascist . that s a common misconception among trump supporters because trump himself doesn t understand the difference .","273118":"i don t disagree . racism is particularly instilled in white people from a young age , and it s something that people should unlearn as they get older .","273119":"okay ? you re talking about something that occurred over a year ago . lmaoo . cc svspicion","273120":"they haven t even been on askfm in months , if not a year ? at least not that i ve seen . this is old drama .","273121":"his statements about antifa are completely false , lol . antifa means anti fascist , and if he s against antifa , then that means he s pro fascism .","273122":"black people can be racist toward their own race and other races excluding white people , because white people do not experience racism .","273123":"i mean , i could be . lol . either way , the anon chose their words purposely to try to troll me , which is silly . i obviously know what i look like , and someone being overweight doesn t exclude them from being in a relationship with someone else .","273124":"trump racist . if you re still supporting someone who s a blatant and unapologetic racist , then you re racist too . if you don t denounce trump for his racism and support of white supremacy , then i can only acknowledge that you are racist as well .","273125":"okay ? we liked each others posts from time to time when we agreed upon something , that doesn t automatically mean we were friends .","273126":"i already answered this .","273127":"? ? ? when did i ever imply that black people were white people s pets ? lmfao . jesus , y all anons are jumping to such wild conclusions lately .","273128":"lol . i don t particularly care , obviously . just because i m overweight doesn t mean i m unworthy or love or that people automatically won t like me . also i have four cats already , soooo .","273129":"i don t really know what the difference between being a leftist and a liberal is , so i have zero clue . i just have my own beliefs and i don t really put a label on them .","273130":"yeah , black people aren t exempt from being racist just because they re black , lol . they can be racist towards their own race or other races except white people , obviously .","273131":"this is indeed true .","273132":"yes , i m pretty overweight , lol .","273133":"yeah , i m left handed .","273134":"yeah , like if someone is conservative but doesn t support trump especially after all of the sh t that has been happening recently , i m more likely to get along with them . if that person does support trump and basically forgives trump for everything he s said and done , then i wouldn t be friends with them . that s basically saying that racism and other problematic things aren t a big deal .","273135":"i didn t see anything . i just said i had tactile hallucinations , which are hallucinations that involve touch on the body i . e . feeling bugs crawling on your skin . what you re referring to are visual hallucinations .","273136":"i have a few friends who are conservative , but it all depends on what their individual views are .","273137":"well considering i ve been extra sad and anxious lately , i probably shouldn t be listening to sad music because that just makes me sadder , lol . especially if i ve been drinking wine .","273138":"yeah , i have . only tactile hallucinations though .","273139":"apparently my new favorite type of music is sad indie according to spotify . lmaoo .","273140":"mental illness , probably .","273141":"i don t really see the big deal . congratulations , you introduced me to new knowledge . looks like i m the winner here .","273142":"i know i acknowledged that , lmao . i m not sure if you re the initial person who asked the question or not , but regardless , if you re so keen on answering the question yourself , have it asked on your own askfm page .","273143":"you re reading way too much into my answers , rofl . i said that the only ethical thing i could think of would be if they donated to charities and actually used their wealth for something good that contributes to the betterment of underprivileged groups and other initiatives .","273144":"take a shower with yummy smelling shampoo , conditioner , and body wash . my hair stylist recommended a shampoo and conditioner to me a while ago when she did my hair , and it smells like birthday cake .","273145":"most people i personally know despise capitalism and how wealthy people get away with things that the common person can t get away with . then again , it just depends on whom you surround yourself with . i can see how most people will be like that .","273146":"i agree with you to an extent , and it s terrible that most wealthy people like that often pay less taxes than the working class and those below working class . smh . look at the whole taxes thing that was recently revealed about trump , i think he only paid like in taxes allegedly .","273147":"idk why you thought i was defending billionaires . i said that the only ethical thing i can think of would be if they donated their money to charity . although you re right , they probably would be considered a billionaire anymore , depending on how much they donate . lol .","273148":"thank you you as well ! ! i haven t done much of anything today , sigh . i woke up at pm and now i feel like i wasted half of my day . the only things i ve done are play video games , take a shower , feed the cats , take out the garbage , and eat dinner .","273149":"thank you","273150":"not so much anymore , no . i used to years ago , but these days i ve been mostly writing non fictional creative essays .","273151":"i wholeheartedly agree with you , the younger person probably looks up to the older adult like described in the last anon response , idk if that was you or not , and they feel empowered by dating someone much older because it makes them feel cool . they definitely won t recognize signs of ab se as quickly , and usually their friends are the first ones to point out the wrongs .","273152":"this is exactly what i personally went through when i was years old . i dated an year old when i was in high school he was a senior , and he definitely exhibited signs of psychological manipulation and control and grooming .","273153":"i don t really see how that would be funny , to purposely be irritable or mean to a child . but i m not around children most of the time anyway , so .","273154":"i mean , billionaires are still proponents of capitalism . however , the only way i can see a billionaire being ethical is if they donate a large percentage of their money to various charities to aid in the betterment of other groups of people , or to things like combatting against climate change , helping education , giving underprivileged people resources to improve their lives , etc .","273155":"as my bio indicates , i live in new york .","273156":"yeah , i agree . when i read that part of the last anon s message , that was a bit . . . jarring , to say the least . i understand that a year old is technically of legal age , but it s still eyebrow raising . makes me wonder why these types of men go for younger adults , especially considering this last anon said he was years old . they ve probably raised red flags with people their own age .","273157":"i don t really think she was being disrespectful , because at least she told you instead of ghosting you . however , you still need to respect her decision . you two being together is probably not for the best anyway .","273158":"for the most part , yes . i m assuming by share you mean share secrets , needing advice , etc etc .","273159":"cont . . . and she s been coming and going since then , she s going thru a lot in life rn . i still told her all the time i love her and insisted we be more than friends but she wouldn t accept it . i want to do sxxual things over the phone like we used to but she kept saying no and it angered me . this kept happening , several times . idk why she wanted to be just friends and kept saying we should stop talking if we won t be something serious because she doesn t know the future . i told her i will never stop with the romantic and sxxual talk because i love her . and that was a couple days ago . today she ended things with me because she said she wasn t getting anything beneficial from the relationship anymore and we want two different things . i feel like she played with my head and i m angry and annoyed about it . any advice ? do you think she was wrong ? i don t believe she was wrong , and honestly , you insisting that you want to keep talking dirty to her despite her telling you not to is extremely selfish and disrespectful . you should not have done that . people are allowed to change their feelings towards others , and i understand that it hurt you , but you have to respect her feelings and what she says .","273160":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","273161":"yeah , but i honestly have no idea what the websites are , rofl . whenever i m making a purchase online , i usually just search x coupons and see what pops up . sometimes the promo codes work , sometimes they don t .","273162":"only when i m alone in the car i m listening to music .","273163":"i can t really think of anything because i ve barely been eating these days .","273164":"yeah , i m claustrophobic enclosed spaces freak me out a lot . especially if it s in a public place , i get very panicked .","273165":"i m not superstituous at all .","273166":"nah , clowns don t scare me .","273167":"there was one time i woke up from a sound sleep at around am , and i heard footsteps walking down the hallway . it creeped me out so much . a week or so later , i was talking to my roommate and apparently he woke up at the same time heard the same exact thing as i did . lmao .","273168":"i d notice it initially , but i wouldn t remember it .","273169":"i ve never paid much attention .","273170":"no , i prefer rural environments .","273171":"i don t give out my instagram .","273172":"probably skyrim , as usual . lol . i was thinking either that or continuing fallout new vegas , since i haven t touched that in ages .","273173":"just making some gfuel and i m probably going to play some video games .","273174":"definitely not , rofl .","273175":"on alcohol . lmao .","273176":"this is difficult because i ve had so many bad jobs , but money is of the utmost importance at this stage of my life rn . lmao . i suppose i d rather temporarily work a bad job and save up the money before i can quit and obtain a better job even if the second job is with less pay .","273177":"yeah , that sounds inconsiderate especially considering that you ve said multiple times for them not to do that .","273178":"i was raised in a religious household , but i simply never believed in god .","273179":"no , i m not really interested in returning to college .","273180":"if i was interested in him , then sure . that s pretty irrelevant to this question though .","273181":"no , i don t believe he s faking having covid .","273182":"i m extremely foggy and tired , and also surprised that i slept in until pm because i haven t done that in years .","273183":"i ve only ever used tinder , which was pretty short lived . i don t really recommend it .","273184":"obviously . the whole stereotype that men should be the ones asking women out is silly and archaic .","273185":"good afternoon . i fell back asleep this morning around am and i just woke up now at pm .","273186":"no , i m single .","273187":"no , i don t believe in god .","273188":"np ! ! sorry i couldn t be more helpful .","273189":"summer , ugh . i dislike the summer because it s always really humid and hot where i live i can t handle the heat well .","273190":"rofl . maybe take a leave of absence , at least that way your job is protected if you still want this job , of course . you probably would need medical documentation for that , though . i understand the frustration you re feeling . even though my job knows about my mental health problems , i do often lie and say things like i have a family emergency instead of telling them that i m too depressed to function .","273191":"i only slept for like hours but for some reason i m wide awake rn .","273192":"ugh . can you ask for time off without specifying what it s for ? idk what kind of laws surround this sort of thing , i know most places you re not obligated to tell your job why you want to take off , but there are some places that are really stingy about that type of thing .","273193":"i understand this all too well . unfortunately it s a thin line to tread because a lot of jobs don t understand mental health needs . my job knows about my depression anxiety , but that s only because i have a doctor s note on file saying that because of my illnesses i need to be excused for absences and whatnot .","273194":"uh , how was i supposed to call him ? the order was completed and the driver s information was gone . from my understanding , you can only contact the driver when they re assigned to your order , and that information disappears when the order is completed .","273195":"in an ideal world , it would be perfectly okay and encouraged to be truthful about mental illnesses . i advocate for erasing the stigma against mental illness , because there s so much that exists that it s sometimes unsafe for people to reveal their illness . so it s obviously okay to tell someone you re mentally ill , as long as it doesn t put you in a position of harm .","273196":"favorite cookie dough . least favorite strawberry or chocolate .","273197":"writing .","273198":"i mean , that seems like an awful lot of work to do in order to get a partner who doesn t even like the genuine you . you can t keep up the facade forever , which is why it s most important to simply be yourself .","273199":"the driver should have called doordash said that he accidentally gave the order to someone else so that the restaurant can remake it . that way he would have picked it up fresh and delivered it to the other house faster instead of circling back around to me and asking me for the food back .","273200":"hello do you have a question ?","273201":"perhaps it would be the most decent thing a person can do , but i guarantee you that most people would not do that and would have just kept the food like i did . either way , him saying he should charge me for the food was wrong . that isn t even his decision to make .","273202":"he was going to take the bag back that would have cost him his job because of cross contamination .","273203":"uh , one of those is a gender and the other is a sexual orientation . i m non binary and bisexual .","273204":"exactly . like listen dude it isn t my fault you gave me both bags , i didn t know any better i thought my order was in two bags . get the fuck outta here .","273205":"i just ordered taco bell off of doordash . the dude gave me bags and i didn t think anyone of it . after i went inside i realized he gave me not only my bag but someone else s bag . i shrugged and gave the second bag to my roommate . minutes later , the doordash driver rings me doorbell again . he asked if i had any food that wasn t ours and i said there was some stuff we didn t order but my roommate ate it and the rest is in the fridge . and the doordash driver goes well i mma have to charge you for that . so i say listen it wasn t my fault you brought both bags to my front door . and he immediately leaves . like . . . wtf . lmao .","273206":"just be yourself .","273207":"l lost . e enthusiastic . i irritable . g gluttonous . h haphazard .","273208":"idk about the whole loser part , but sometimes the best option is just to go for it . the worst that can happen is that they reject you , and then you can move on with that closure .","273209":"i mean , i haven t been in school in seven years . so idk .","273210":"i used to do that obsessively .","273211":"it isn t cold . sorry if i don t support p dophiles , r pists , racists , etc etc .","273212":"i want two mikes harder lemonades , but that requires me to walk across four lanes of traffic that probably wouldn t work out well for me rn .","273213":"a person simply being friends with someone else indicating that they just want to be friends isn t a bad thing and isn t oppressive towards people usually men who want something more . the friendzone is a joke . just get over it .","273214":"i honestly don t remember , i ve had so many accounts .","273215":"how can i love a god if i don t believe in a god ?","273216":"i ve never gone far enough with someone to be friendzoned , lmao not like that even exists anyway .","273217":"my mental illnesses are chronic , they re just managed for the most part by medication therapy .","273218":"it was twice today , i m aware of that , rofl .","273219":"well yeah , idk what the zodiac signs even mean so .","273220":"lol . i don t think it s weird or flirting . god forbid someone compliments someone else .","273221":"perhaps . not everyone is the same , though .","273222":"and this matters to me . . . why ?","273223":"aw ! ! thank you so much . i follow you i love your answers , i hope you have a nice rest of your evening as well .","273224":"thank you","273225":"it s been a relaxing day . i slept in until like am , went on my computer for a few hours , had some caffeine and watched youtube , did laundry , and now i m watching movies and answering questions .","273226":"wut . this has nothing to do with the current conversation ? much confusion .","273227":"she s definitely not shy , lol . i don t remember who made the first move , but i was the one who invited her to my house and she agreed . and then it just sorta happened .","273228":"lol . yes , of course . i don t even remember how my ex and i initially started dating . like , we d flirt obviously and then it got into something more serious . but that was years ago .","273229":"like i said . i m new at this . help .","273230":"i said that years ago when i was still in a relationship , rofl . god forbid people change their minds as they get older .","273231":"? ? ? isn t a part of dating someone initially is flirting ? rofl . right now , i m not interested in any men . if anything , her and i would hook up again nothing else .","273232":"how do people flirt , i commented on my friend s status the friend i hooked up with where she said she didn t have halloween plans so i said it s on a saturday so you can come over if you want and she said perhaps ! how . i m so new to this . help .","273233":"i m not glad but i m amused because it s so f cking ironic how he made fun of biden for wearing a mask and trump is notorious for not wearing a mask , and now he has covid . and now he s calling it a plague , meanwhile in the past he downplayed it so much . it s irony at its finest . whether he d es or not doesn t make much of a difference to me , but i just find the entire ordeal amusing .","273234":"late november early december .","273235":"this filter on instagram is so cool .","273236":"no , just with my friends . i ve never played it with randoms before .","273237":"thank you","273238":"because it makes them feel better about themselves .","273239":"it s really in depth hard to explain , and i also don t want to give anything away if you ve never seen it before . but the movie is based on a video game series it s f cking intense . one of my favorite movies .","273240":"watching resident evil day drinking , send me some questions","273241":"i mean , i don t wear weaves but all right .","273242":"well , at least you admit that you re selfish and privileged . thanks for the convo","273243":"my point has been proven .","273244":"because you technically are being a troll , especially since you ve sent this to multiple people knowing they were going to disagree with you , lol .","273245":"that simply means you don t care about underprivileged or minority groups who are affected by politics , which is selfish . but you do you makes no difference to me .","273246":"i don t have work today , no .","273247":"i was busy , now i m just waiting on laundry and also a phone call .","273248":"god forbid i have a life . lmao .","273249":"first off , please stop calling me a girl . i m non binary , and if i was cis , i would be a woman not a girl . second , years with one person isn t a big deal especially if you re faithful . that s what a mature relationship is .","273250":"like i said earlier , i don t discuss my sex life on the internet .","273251":"i was in a relationship with the same person for like years , lol . i never cheated on him , so no .","273252":"i was in a relationship during that time period , so it was only with one person .","273253":"i m not denouncing sex entirely , lol . i m saying it isn t a necessity for life . you don t need it to survive .","273254":"i m almost years old , lmaoo . perhaps if i was like , years old , then sex would be more important to me . but right now , i m more focused on my career , my mental health , my finances , my friends , etc etc . sex isn t a necessity .","273255":"? ? ? the only physical needs i have are food and water . nobody needs sex .","273256":"i don t discuss finances on the internet .","273257":"it isn t

lmao . i don t mind most insects , but spiders bother me a bit .","273269":"thank you .","273270":"probably if i feel like it . i thought it was going to happen two weeks ago again because she was sending me suggestive pictures , but then i fell asleep . lmaoo .","273271":"going out somewhere that has outdoor seating , grabbing food and a few drinks , and listening to live music .","273272":"not at all , i didn t even tell him about it until a few weeks later . lmaoo . i did it because her and i went out to grab some drinks , we went back to my house to drink more because with the whole covid environment it was really freaking me out , and then it just sorta happened .","273273":"the only thing that really triggers me is when people are yelling .","273274":"communication and trust are the foundations of any relationship .","273275":"i hooked up with my friend after my ex and i broke up , lol . that isn t a date .","273276":"when i was manic a few weeks ago , i bought worth of vapes . worth of alcohol . worth of gfuel and other caffeinated beverages . a vape pen so i can buy weed cartridges and smoke weed . earphones . an led light strip for my television . and some other things that i can t remember rn .","273277":"vape juice for my vape , because i m running extremely low and new york doesn t sell the flavored vape juices anymore . so i d probably have to go somewhere like pennsylvania to do it .","273278":"depends on where you re going , i assume . i haven t been on a first date in a decade , so you re asking the totally wrong person . lmaoo .","273279":"no , i don t think i have , especially not in college . i always valued my education and tried my best to be mentally present for my classes .","273280":"both ? rofl . i

don t believe i have , no .","273282":"mayonnaise .","273283":"i honestly have no clue , rofl . people have said that i look like lady gaga , but i really don t see it at all .","273284":"my roommate , my best friend , and my ex .","273285":"i don t remember my childhood , so i don t really have any nostalgic smells .","273286":"i m a patient person when it comes to my job , but my patience has more to do with proofreading other people s writing as opposed to writing my own . rofl .","273287":"it s currently a beautiful degrees fahrenheit with sunny skies , and i might go outside in the backyard and day drink later .","273288":"i was on my backup account answering questions scrolling through tiktok , if you must know . lmaoo .","273289":"i already informed you or whoever else was on this thread that i m already in treatment , and i have been for three years now . so , i appreciate the concern but it isn t really any of your business , nor are you in a position to help me .","273290":"i prefer listening to music through the speakers , but i ll listen to it through earphones if i need to .","273291":"i don t really care for children , nor do i think i want children in the future .","273292":"i might mop the kitchen and bathroom floors later if i feel up to it , and i i might do some laundry . other than that , i m probably going to just play video games .","273293":"he s a mechanic .","273294":"i don t obsess over it , although i used to research into things like the spanish inquisition often when i was much younger . i simply find these things to be intriguing . it doesn t scare me at all .","273295":"no , i just have seasonal allergies .","273296":"definitely not , haha . i would not be able to handle the spotlight and being chased by cameras and paparazzi everywhere .","273297":"i don t ask questions on askfm , so this doesn t really apply to me , lol .","273298":"hello do you have a question ?","273299":"apparently most people do dream every night , it s just a matter of whether or not we remember them when we wake up . i seldom remember my dreams .","273300":"happy saturday to you ! ! i just woke up not too long ago , and i just made my morning gfuel and some breakfast .","273301":"i guess ? haha .","273302":"atmospheric ambient mixes of songs from video games , movies , and television shows .","273303":"facebook , most of

including courtneyuwu .","273340":"you don t . respect their decision and move on with your life .","273341":"i love the enthusiasm that other people have for halloween , especially in terms of

editor for a publishing company .","273367":"worked , laid in bed and cried , spent time with my roommate s family , and then made a tiktok account . lmaoo .","273368":"i m doing a bit better now , i

pumpkin beer , yay .","273369":"i prefer black ink .","273370":"not really , to be honest . i m grateful that i have a job that keeps me in a routine , but also my days vary widely and i m not doing

person s quirks until you get to know them on a deeper level . honestly , i thought he was one of those typical bad boy types , but as i got to know him better , i realized that we were both

published author .","273378":"friends should be there to support you when you need help , but also have the communication with you to tell you if you re doing something wrong without needing to

like they re still bitter about the exchange even though it s been presumably years ago . that reminds me a lot of my cousin and a close friend of mine , they were best friends for a few years until something happened between them that was a misunderstanding . my close friend got over it ages ago and doesn t care anymore , meanwhile if i bring her name up to my cousin , my cousin gets irrationally angry still .","273384":"the plot lines and the fantasy elements involved .","273385":"no , i haven t really been doing much of anything besides working . in the beginning of quarantine ,

tomorrow , so the weekend is really up in the air right now regarding how i ll be feeling . i touched upon this briefly on askfm last week , but my job decided to make their employees return to the office , even though covid cases are rising again in new york and schools keep opening and closing because people are catching covid so quickly . my job is confident that the work place will be safe , but literally everyone in my department disagrees with that , including my supervisor . upper management sent out an email stating we had four options to choose from , which i don t want to get into the details of particularly . but i m excluded from two of the options because of the nature of my position , and the other two options are return to the office or continue working from home with a camera on you during the work day and a reduction in salary . our initial deadline to respond was this past monday , but because upper management received so many emails and questions from people in my department myself included , they extended the deadline to tomorrow . they had a big meeting about everyone s concerns on tuesday , but we ve received radio silence since then . so how are we supposed to make a decision when none of our questions have been answered ? it makes zero sense . i feel so unsafe and it s just wrong to make people choose between their health or their salary

jumped from person to person when i was younger if someone wasn t interested in me , i moved on to someone else . however , the best answer to this question would be to simply focus on yourself , your friends , your career or education , your hobbies , etc etc . you don t need someone else to complete you you re whole entirely on your own . having a partner might be a benefit for most , but it isn t a necessity .","273449":"i believe it definitely reveals how a person would genuinely act if given the opportunity to do so which is why they feel comfortable on anon . it s sickening how

recall any specific moments .","273459":"i ve been able to walk away from situations that don t serve me anymore moreso now than ever in the past . as the years have come and gone , i ve learned how to distinguished when i should stay versus when i need to walk away , and do things that will preserve my own health and wellness .","273460":"no , one of my old coworkers .","273461":"work related things regarding hr s email about returning to the office and the four bullsh t options they gave us regarding returning . it essentially comes down to returning to work and risking our safety or

selfish and manipulative .","273463":"not really , no .","273464":"i believe that if the people in the marriage are unhappy and they cannot resolve their differences or grievances , then they should

.","273468":"there s a local bar restaurant that serves ridiculously good tacos and margaritas , so it would likely be that place . they re also decently priced as well .","273469":"thank you , i need the support and encouragement right now . i haven t been in a good mood at all today . i woke up exhausted despite sleeping for hours , work was mentally and physically exhausting , and i laid in bed for two hours after work just because i couldn t handle any form of reality . i m just so out of touch and everything is in limbo , and i m honestly terrified of everything . i don t want to be here .","273470":"i usually do , but not so much lately . i went out to brunch with a friend and my roommate yesterday morning , and that alone was enough to exhaust me , haha .","273471":"no , most cops

them . they re a quick and easy lunch if i m feeling lazy .","273483":"yeah , but i don t like it overly toasted or too burnt crunchy .","273484":"i m not comfortable with public speaking at all . it gives me anxiety and panic attacks when i have to confront a group of people and give a speech or any type of presentation .","273485":"i d love to go camping eventually . it s something i ve never really done before besides setting up a tent in the backyard and sleeping outside , haha .","273486":"i certainly hope so . i did message my supervisor something amusing that i came across while proofreading a press release , so i hope that made her smile or chuckle .","273487":"yes , i believe most of everyone continues to learn about life as they get older . there s no age limit on life experience , and we continue to learn about life the more that we live it .","273488":"i try to listen to music and distract myself through social media , but most of the time , i just drink and or smoke .","273489":"yeah , the weekend went by extremely fast . i don t even remember what i did on saturday , and yesterday was a blur because i was drunk high most of the day .","273490":"i dislike shopping , and i try to get it over with as quickly as possible .","273491":"i try to shower every day , but most of the time it s every other day . i only wash my hair once or twice per week , though

.","273493":"i normally don t have a problem with mondays , but today absolutely exhausted me . i m going to have a liquid dinner and call it an early night .","273494":"no . i m physically , mentally , and emotionally exhausted . i slept for a solid hours straight last night , and could have slept longer if i didn t have to log into work .","273495":"i m a decent liar , yes .","273496":"consecutively ? likely hours straight . when i m exhausted , i can sleep without waking up easily , although most of the time , i do have to wake up halfway through to use the bathroom .","273497":"gasoline , burning wood , fresh pine , jasmine , and coffee .","273498":"yeah , i ve made plenty of food for people .","273499":"yes , i do . i m not going to elaborate on it because there are tons of anons who will ask me invasive questions about it .","273500":"i ll be fine , it isn t even pm .","273501":"i m trying to think of a clever answer for this , but i can t . lmao

are fun ! ! i ve only ever been to a few weddings , though .","273506":"i like outdoor weddings better . they re much more informal and relaxing and freeing .","273507":"i play it on the phone , and my friends and i are always in an xbox live party with each other so we can talk to each other instead of typing . the game is pretty much . . . you re either a crewmate or an imposter . you re set on some sort of space ship , and the crewmates have to complete tasks and the imposter has to try to k ll the crewmates one by one you cannot talk during this time period . if a body is discovered , then the discussion panel opens up and you can talk to your friends about where you were , who you were with , who you think is the imposter , etc etc . then it pretty much continues going until the imposter k lls mostly everyone on the ship or if everyone completes their tasks . it s ridiculously fun , especially with friends instead of random people . the other night , we had a group of about people , so we could have two imposters .","273508":"yes , i do . omg , i absolutely love that game . i play with my friends every few nights or so .","273509":"i really want to purchase the extended editions of all of the lord of the rings and the hobbit movies , but i can t justify spending that kind of money rn .","273510":"i understand that , sometimes i m the same way in certain circumstances . you should stick up for yourself though , ideally your concerns and boundaries are just as valid as theirs , and you shouldn t feel obligated to do something if you re not comfortable doing it . and if your friend s don t like that , then well they re not as good of friends as they appear to be .","273511":"ack , that s one of my pet peeves tbh . if you re not comfortable doing something , then they should be understanding of that and not try to push the subject .","273512":"i think that s perfectly fine then again , that s what i ve always done with no remorse , so that s my own personal opinion .","273513":"perhaps investing in the stock market ? idk , you d have to ask someone who has a lot of money .","273514":"i think i only know like one song from them , lol .","273515":"no , i

, my only options would be . return the office . . work from home with a salary reduction and a camera on me during working hours . i can t afford the salary reduction , and the whole camera thing makes me uneasy . so i would be forced to go into the office even though i think it s unsafe .","273579":"things being illegal has never stopped me from doing them . lmao .","273580":"most definitely , especially if it s in the oil in the cartridges that you put on nicotine pens . it s the same as a cocaine charge .","273581":"marijuana in itself isn t an addictive drug , meaning if you smoke enough you wouldn t get withdrawal symptoms if you stopped . but people can definitely become reliant on the feelings it brings them .","273582":"unfortunately , it isn t .","273583":"no , it isn t bad . considering i m a person who smokes weed a lot , rofl .","273584":"yeah , i m keeping tabs on them . i think they re under the impression that they have a chance with me , but they just sound

.","273586":"yeah , that s what i m suspicious of . one of my other friends admitted herself voluntarily to the hospital two weeks ago and was there for days , for example . so i can t really see how someone can involuntarily go to the hospital for s icidal thoughts , see a doctor , and have that doctor tell them , nah you re good and let them go after only hours . this person i m talking to is an adult , and we both live in new york state . i m also suspicious because this person has been giving off woe is me vibes by talking all the time about how they have treatment resistant depression and mentioned like three times how many medications they re on , and how they were diagnosed as passively s icidal which doesn t sound like a diagnosis to me . . . s icidal thoughts are a symptom .","273587":"i m doing a bit better than i have been over the past two days , but still not well . my anxiety is still through the roof and i ve been taking so much xanax to try to calm myself down ,

myself .","273606":"helena bonham carter .","273607":"we ve all been doing our jobs , so that wouldn t be a possibility . we have to document each day what we ve done , and there is a program

younger and it didn t work for me .","273609":"ugh , yes . i just don t want to be sad anymore .","273610":"honestly ? i have no idea anymore . my new therapist seems as if she thinks i have bipolar

sales went down , but my department has nothing to do with sales . and we weren t getting paid more or less when working from home , and they re actually saying that if we want to continue working from home , they re reducing our salary by and we have to have a camera on us at all times .","273612":"i thought i was pretty clear does anyone who experience depression mania want to sometimes

have never known .","273619":"uh , i wouldn t fall in love with a person who hurts and kills multiple people . lmao . this romantizing of terrible people should end .","273620":". . . why would i date a serial killer .","273621":"uh , no ? rofl .","273622":"i cannot pinpoint one out exactly , but i thoroughly enjoy documentaries regarding true crime and serial killers .","273623":"my ex telling me , i think you love me more than i love you when we were in the midst of breaking up . that hurt me to my very core .","273624":"damsels in distress , i suppose . i can t really think of a more complex answer right now other than that . i dislike the idea of female characters being all woe is me and relying upon male characters to save them or relieve them of their struggles or worries .","273625":"i think humanity is disgusting , so there isn t anything i love about people in general .","273626":"absolutely . if there s an imbalance in love , then that s going to cause problems in the relationship .","273627":"i suppose i m liberal because i m left leaning , but i haven t put a direct label on myself in a long time .","273628":"the way i view it , police show up after crime happens not while it s occurring . the police have taken advantage of their positions for far too long , and there has been little justice served to them when they do do things wrong . it s an unfair system , and the u . s . government places too much emphasis on the police and military when it can be spent on more innovative projects .","273629":"absolutely wild . myself , with the aid of a few coworkers , sent out emails to more than clients asking them for edits and approvals for their magazine articles so that we can begin laying them out in the magazine . i spent the entire morning sifting through emails , doing edits , forwarding them to other departments including customer service , etc etc . i wrote a very long email to my hr manager about her proposal to us returning to the office , because nearly everyone in my department is against the idea . i was shaken up and anxious about the entire ordeal , which resulted in me not eating at all today . i haven t eaten much of anything since yesterday afternoon because of my anxiety . i clocked out of work at pm , accidentally fell asleep , and then began drinking . so now i m on my fourth drink three glasses of wine and now a beer and listening to music . i just want to be f cked up tonight . i m so done with everything .","273630":"i don t know what they re planning , but their initial email was extremely vague and has been met with hostility with nearly everyone i ve spoken to about it . pre covid , if someone got sick , then there were at least people who came down with the same illness a few days later . for example , strep throat was going around my office back in february . i haven t had strep throat since i was a young child , under the age of , but i somehow got strep because of the fact that one person had it in my office , spread it to others , and then spread it to me . it s absolutely ridiculous . i wrote a very long , paragraph long , email to my hr manager addressing my concerns and questions regarding the entire ordeal . she never responded to me . but i hope she heeds my words and takes my suggestions into consideration .","273631":"you can be selfish without malice , but i don t believe you can be malicious without some hint of selfishness involved .","273632":"right now , i m afraid for the future . for the future of my own safety and wellness , and for my job as a whole .","273633":"yeah , they basically gave us four options one of them including going back to the office , and the other three are literally ridiculous , and said that if we don t choose an option , we ll have to resign . my department has around people in a very small space . there s no air flow , the air quality is awful , there are no windows , and the space is very cramped . i can literally reach out my arm and touch my coworker on the shoulder . what they re proposing is absolutely inappropriate .","273634":"i ll take your statement into consideration if there are sources involved . i did a quick google search and couldn t find much .","273635":"i don t think anything can make me instantly happy . i m normally in a neutral or sad mood unless i m in the midst of a manic episode .","273636":"you re going to suffer for a while , but everything will turn out for the better . keeping holding on and keep moving forward .","273637":"no , i don t currently have any collections of anything . i used to have an accidental collection of mugs when i lived with my parents , but i got rid of most of those mugs when i moved .","273638":"this is a photo my ex took of me back in when we went to upstate new york with a few friends . it s one of my favorite photographs of myself .","273639":"at least years old , ahah . i have a pair of sweatpants from my ex that i cannot bring myself to throw away because they re the most comfortable sweatpants i ve ever owned .","273640":"it s been quite a while meaning a few years , back from perhaps or . whenever i ve gone to upstate new york on vacation , i find it s best to leave my phone in the hotel room while i go travel with whoever i m with , and it brings a certain sense of adventure wherever i go . i live more in the moment than anything else , and i don t have the compulsion to check my phone every minutes .","273641":"i ve always been under the impression that love finds you randomly , not that you re obsessively searching out for it or anthing . it s best to just live your life to the best of your ability , and if something happens , then to just roll with it .","273642":"yes , i believe that the funds that go towards the police system in general are too much , and those resources are better allocated towards other systems , such as education , the sciences , the arts , etc etc .","273643":"my best traits my compassion for my friends . my talent in writing . my appreciation of music . my worst traits my selfishness . my manipulative behavior . my inclination toward self destruction .","273644":"honestly , i haven t been well at all over the past two days . my job has pretty much given my department an ultimatum regarding returning to the office even though we re in the midst of a pandemic , and i ve been having anxiety attacks and haven t eaten in two days .","273645":"does impulsivity count as being a risk taker ? lol . i m an extremely spontaneous and impulsive person .","273646":"i enjoy traveling , but unfortunately i seldom have the chance to do so . the last time i traveled somewhere new was perhaps when i went to austin , texas , for a video game convention .","273647":"i enjoy walking around parks and other nature reserves forests and taking photos of my surroundings .","273648":"yellow roses are my favorite flowers .","273649":"no , i don t believe so . if i do , then it s never been brought to my attention before .","273650":"i like them separately , but not together as the rock band suggests .","273651":"no , i don t have a good relationship with my parents at all . my family has always been extremely dysfunctional , and ever since i moved out of my parents house , i ve been slowly distancing myself .","273652":"i ve never worn braces , but i ve been wearing glasses since i was a toddler .","273653":"uh , perhaps the toaster ? lol . i like having bagels in the morning for breakfast , so i ll toast the bagels before adding cream cheese or butter to it .","273654":"no , my natural hair color is dark blonde . i absolutely hate that color on myself , so i ve been coloring my hair since i was around years old .","273655":"i used to enjoy baking , but i haven t done it in a really long time . i believe the last things i baked were blueberry muffins .","273656":"i told my friend when i actually wasn t , which honestly is something that i do often because i don t like people worrying about me .","273657":"it depends on the person . if it s a work related call , then i try to call them back as soon as possible . however , if it s a personal call from my parents or my pharmacy or anything similar , i ll usually wait a few hours until i have some free time .","273658":"partially , yes . it s also because i m lazy , and i don t feel comfortable going to a gym .","273659":"i didn t eat dinner tonight because i wasn t hungry . i guess you could say i m having a liquid dinner because i m already on my third glass of wine i m planning on drinking beer after this .","273660":"yes , i ve been registered to vote since i turned years old .","273661":"no , i have no interest in dating .","273662":"no , i don t get excited easily . i m in a fairly neutral mood most of the time .","273663":"i enjoy all four , but it ultimately depends on my mood . i haven t really eaten much at all in the past two days , so nothing is appealing to me .","273664":"i would like to say i m creative , yes . i enjoy writing poetry and prose , i enjoy painting , and i also enjoy photography . those are probably my top three creative arts that i like doing .","273665":"sometimes , being alive . i wouldn t necessarily say i m s icidal right now , but i really don t see the point in being alive a lot of the time . there s too much stress and pointlessness of everything .","273666":"i ve tried reading books on a tablet , and it isn t the same thing as reading a book in my actual hands . not only does reading a book on a tablet hurt my eyes a lot because of the brightness of the screen , but i also enjoy the aesthetic of reading a paperback or hardcover book that i can hold in my hand and flip the pages . there s something strangely comforting about it .","273667":"raspberry jam or butter ! !","273668":"to be totally honest , it s because the real world is too overwhelming to deal with especially these days . there is so much uncertainty and chaos going on in the world right now , it s only natural for people to distract themselves in whatever way suits them best .","273669":"i m not sure , to be honest with you . i have very strong emotions and i tend to get irrationally upset over small things , including stuff like my roommates getting angry over things out of my control that has absolutely nothing to do with me , and it causes me to become incredibly anxious and afraid . i often lock myself inside of my bedroom when that happens .","273670":"pouring myself three glasses of well deserved wine after enduring the hell of a day that was my work day . i m so happy it s the weekend . i ve been a ball of anxiety and depression for the past two days , and i m grateful to have saturday and sunday to try to relax and forget about work for a little while .","273671":"honestly , i don t even know . lol . i don t know much about what s trending nowadays . i ve been focusing on my own life , my own friends , and my own mental health moreso than anything else these days .","273672":"i m the type of friend who will be there for you and lend you a shoulder to cry on when you need it , but i also do not sugarcoat things . if you re doing something wrong or problematic , then i have no issue with telling you how i feel .","273673":"i love my writing abilities the most . i wrote a strongly worded email to my hr manager today about some not so great things going on within my job recently , and i passed it by my supervisor prior to sending the email and she said it was a terrific email .","273674":"conversing with my roommate and his father about random things this evening . i was in a pretty terrible mood , but being social and talking and drinking with them distracted me a lot and made me feel better .","273675":"eh , it depends on how badly i dislike them and for what reasons i dislike them . normally , i d keep the peace and act cordially , but there have often been times i ve blatantly ignored people as well .","273676":"happy friday ! ! i m currently listening to the les miserables soundtrack , answering questions on askfm , and drinking wine .","273677":"no , i have no desire to really talk to most of my old high school friends . we re not friends anymore , and there are only a select few people from high school with whom i associate these days .","273678":"i love applebee s because they have pretty good margaritas and cheese quesadillas . i used to go there every now and again with my roommate for a happy hour lunch in between running errands .","273679":"the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell . lol . that has not been useful to me at all .","273680":"yeah , i ve taken road trips from new york to massachusetts , as well as from massachusetts to northern vermont . they were incredibly fun .","273681":"i honestly don t remember . it s been an extremely long time because things have honestly been sh t lately .","273682":"i think it s important to celebrate the small things alongside the big things as well . normally , the smaller things are what are more important , and they give us a sense of pride and fulfillment when we celebrate them .","273683":"i don t confide in any of my family members . i m not close to my family at all .","273684":"my roommate and i turned on public access television and we were watching old school inspector gadget cartoons , haha .","273685":"i was exhausted , both physically and mentally . i had a meltdown yesterday afternoon , so i was pretty much done .","273686":"i don t remember . it was pm at the latest .","273687":"that isn t far off much from my age , so yeah .","273688":"no , i woke up at am this morning .","273689":"hello do you have a question ?","273690":"no , i believe in science .","273691":"mental illness","273692":"music has always been inspirational to me ! ! it definitely can calm my nerves or motivate me , and lately i ve been re listening to the les miserables soundtrack because it s so moving .","273693":"definitely not , haha . that would not only be a boring movie , but also nowhere near fairytale either .","273694":"i ve had several anonymous questions asked to me about private information i . e . sexual questions , as well as statements indicating that i ll be r ped , k lled , etc etc .","273695":"drinking , smoking , talking to friends , and listening to music .","273696":"i prefer to listen rather than speak .","273697":"you re asking the totally wrong person for this , because i self implode when situations like this happen . lmao .","273698":"twice , i believe .","273699":"no , i don t even know anything about clothing lines .","273700":"even though it s a little old , it was a book my ex customized for me when we were still dating . it was a picture book , and he created the characters inside of it to look like us , and it described what he loved the most about me and had a lot of our inside jokes within it .","273701":"my heart controls me , ugh . i m always following my heart s desires and whims .","273702":"uh , i ordered a pair of earphones from amazon last month they sent me a super duty face shield instead , lol . i haven t returned it yet actually , i ve been asking my friends if they need it , but i finally got my earphones last week .","273703":"zero . although i have been drinking a serving of gfuel in the morning which is around mg of caffeine , and a bang in the afternoon , which is mg of caffeine .","273704":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","273705":"the netherlands , italy , greece , croatia , spain , and england .","273706":"no , i was manic and writing feverishly during that time . i distinctly remember seeing bugs crawling up the curtains behind the computer screen and feeling them crawling all over me .","273707":"definitely not , lmao . i wouldn t buy them to begin with .","273708":"apart from where i live in the united states , i ve also visited the bahamas .","273709":"probably about hours . i started hallucinating towards the end , haha .","273710":"i like joking about mental illness because it helps me cope , lmaoo .","273711":"i haven t been given a reason yet not to .","273712":"do you hear the people sing ? from the les miserables soundtrack .","273713":"i don t even use tiktok , lol .","273714":"wut .","273715":"it s an energy drink vitamin supplement that gives you various vitamins , antioxidants , and caffeine . it s usually used by gamers to increase their focus on video games , but i ve supplemented it for my morning drink instead of coffee because it s healthier and has less sugar carbs than how i would drink coffee .","273716":"lol . yeah , it s almost am and i start work at am . it s going to be a long day .","273717":"eh , not really . i ve been getting more anon questions and just an equal number of spam questions from various people . idk if it s because i recently purchased the vip program , though .","273718":"no , i rarely drink coffee nowadays actually . i ve switched over to gfuel . honestly , i m on my second glass of wine . lmao . i thought maybe if i drank then i d get sleepy , but nope , here i am listening to the les miserables soundtrack and perusing social media obsessively .","273719":"interesting , i ve never heard of that before . that certainly makes sense because i m wide f cking awake right now . and i don t even clock unto work for another hours , ugh .","273720":"i ve been awake for the past two hours because i fell asleep at pm and woke up at am it s currently am . i guess my body decided that six hours of sleep was enough , smh .","273721":"oh , lmfao . i mean . . . the world is sexist , so you re totally right in that regard . whether or not you want to ascribe by the label of feminist is up to you . i believe in women s equality but i haven t gone by the label of feminist in a number of years .","273722":"music , writing , and mental health advocacy .","273723":"i ve always enjoyed the depth behind the character of draco malfoy from the harry potter series . although , now jk rowling is complete trash and i feel terrible that those books were so pivotal for me growing up .","273724":"yes , i m still friends with a few people i know from high school and college . my best friend and i met in middle school , actually so we re going on years of friendship now .","273725":"i ve always absolutely hated anything with mayonnaise in it , ugh .","273726":"i ve never really heard of anyone thinking that the word feminism is sexist . the term originated in the late th century , so it isn t really a new age thing that has happened . but , you do you if you believe in women s empowerment and equity between the sexes , then there s nothing wrong with that obviously . that s the way it should be , regardless of whether or not you want to label yourself .","273727":"i ve been really digging all of the among us memes these days . also , this . . . lmfao .","273728":"usually when i m laying in bed at night and about to fall asleep , lol .","273729":"i have a bottle of hand sanitizer in my bag for when i go out , but that s pretty much

texting and snapchat .","273731":"yes , i enjoy my job a lot ! ! i m so grateful to have a job in the field i studied towards .","273732":"during my therapy appointment this week , my therapist asked me if i had ever done any inner child healing exercises . i didn t even know what that was , so she asked me if i would be willing to try it , so i said yes . basically , she had me do deep breathing exercises while my eyes were closed and she spoke to me , guiding me through a scenario where i was in a park and i found a bench with a person sitting on it . she then said it was me as a child , and she asked me how old my child version was who was sitting on the bench . i said they were years old . my therapist guided me through sitting down next to the child version of myself and told me to think about how the conversation would go , and that i could stand up and walk away when i was ready . in my mind , i had asked the child version of myself how they got there and how they were feeling . but the child didn t respond or even make eye contact with me . after i came out of the exercise , i told that to my therapist and she said that it would make sense that as a child , knowing what ab se i went through , i wouldn t want to make eye contact with people . and i informed her that i still don t even do that now . it was weird , but interesting . apparently we re going to revisit it every once in a while and see what happens . i m not necessarily sure i believe in it exactly , but i m open minded to it .","273733":"i guess work ? idk , nothing really seems to hold my attention anymore on a recreational level .","273734":"i used to love reading , but my attention span has been sh t the past few years , so i haven t read as often . my favorite authors are stephen king and anne rice .","273735":"i usually just relax i work monday through friday , and on my breaks and after work is when i ll also get the household chores finished . that way by the time the weekend comes , i don t have any pressing responsibilities . on the weekends , i ll wake up at whatever time i get up naturally , have breakfast , drink some coffee or gfuel , and usually i ll log into social media on my laptop and catch up on things while listening to music . sometimes i ll play video games in the afternoon as well .","273736":"idk , probably when i was a small child . i ve definitely never had that done as an adult .","273737":"i ll think of an answer to this later .","273738":"i learned some french when i was in high school , but it was a mandatory part of the curriculum .","273739":"oh goodness , i m sorry you re dealing with that . she might not even realize she s being hard on you like that , which is concerning in itself . have you tried to simply talk to her about it in a mature , conversational manner ? if she s aware of what she s doing now , she might be apt to re think her words and not say those things anymore .","273740":"my addiction to self h rm when i was a teenager . i wouldn t have started in the first place .","273741":"that doesn t necessarily mean that she isn t over him . it could just simply mean that she has moved on from that part of her life and wants to keep it in the past .","273742":"no , i never hid money from any of my exes . i never saw a reason behind it i trusted them and they trusted me , and if they needed financial help , i was more than happy to give it to them .","273743":"i love photography i mainly take photos of things in nature , but i ve also recently discovered that i m pretty good at portraits too . here s a photo i took a

disorder .","273749":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","273750":"yeah , that seems unnecessarily rude .","273751":"reach out to trusted friends or family if you have that option , engage yourself in a hobby you enjoy , distract yourself with a television show or a movie , connect with others through social media , etc etc .","273752":"i m all right , although i m a bit sad for no apparent reason . i m currently trying to relax myself by watching a good movie and drinking a beer . i spent the day working , and then after work , i did the dishes and pretty much scrolled through

.","273756":"it wouldn t hurt , but you should be open minded to the potential that your doctor may not agree that it s the best thing for you . you also have to consider if you re on any other medications because there s the possibility of there being an adverse reaction when combining certain meds .","273757":"kittiemeowsie , asgardarts , astoldbyjoanna , courtneyuwu , pookeo , anancitae ,

for a few years now that have mostly stabilized me .","273764":"i ve been following mariah on askfm and other social media for a few years . we ve never spoken extensively , though . however , back in like the era of askfm , she taught me a lot about feminism .","273765":"i have like two or three plushies , haha . i got rid of the rest of them when i moved .","273766":"my only talent is writing mostly personal essays and poetry , but i haven t written poetry in a long time .","273767":"i m drinking watching one flew over the cuckoo s nest","273768":"i ve been taking lamictal for two years it
