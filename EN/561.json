Kids are super resilient and can endure quite a lot of pain. Once you become an adult you start to feel more of the pain and you become afraid of all it. Afraid of death, losing someone, & the pain that might come from right before you die. The difference with adults is they just become more cautious - its not because they lost their fear of death. Especially the elders, why do you think majority of people that fill up a church are our older generation? Because they are afraid of death and want comfort about what comes after. Its the same reason why parents have become bubble wrapping sheltering helicopters.. they are afraid of losing anything. We live in a society that created a fear of death.

We all got our own monsters lingering inside us, the heart beat is the evil knocking asking to be let out and be free. They say that the world is evil and full of sin, and we were born innocent, but the world\u2019s air is what we breath to keep us alive, water makes us healthy, and land that keeps us dry. The only reason we have destruction, is because we\u2019re all dark. The world is saving us, we\u2019re not close to saving Earth. To keep us sane, our mind tells us to do selfless acts towards everything and everyone, but we feed off pain and struggles. Some have hungry eyes and starving souls, chose to hurt others to make them full. As others, hurt themselves to hurt others around them. When the rest lie to themselves to the point they believe they are okay. When in the end, they need to stop trying to save others and the world, and save them from themselves. The world is easy, simple, and full of life. Human nature is complex, complicated, and unexplained. Nothing is explained, nothing is understood, everything is still put in question, no matter how much faith you have in it. The voice in your head, isn\u2019t a conscious- it\u2019s a monster. The subconscious dreams are the truth behind what is masked over when your awake. The daily image of being perfect and angel-like, is just part of the imagination. A strive, the motivation to keep hell locked up. Prisoner of our own imagination, creation of heaven keeps people hopeful. We\u2019re just ghosts playing our role again in a reality that we perceive to be real, but the demon already made the thoughts, actions, and reasons before, that\u2019s why everything happens for a reason. The people who don\u2019t believe that, and believe that they have control are unleashed demons making their first rounds before they create a new image and perceive a reality. There\u2019s never good or bad, angel or demon. Just bad and bad, demon and demon. You can\u2019t run and hide. You have no where to go. Our lives revolve in going in circles, you will end right where you started. Let out the monster once in awhile, realize they are there, because that\u2019s the only friend you will have in the very end.\n  \n  - Lady Boometh\n  ","602055":"\n  Can you spot ash looking like tweaker? \ud83d\ude02\n  ","602056":"\n  Hey! \ud83d\udc96\n  \n  I am doing great!
