to question life when there s living it to be doing","101731":"why is it so hard for you to take the hint that i don t enjoy these big stinker questions about metaphysical shit ? like i am a genius but i dumb down so hard to try to shake you loose and you persist ! you are depressing and i m almost sure you talk over people in real life with downer shit too . no one cares . well , that s not
