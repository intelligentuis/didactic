she's essentially couch-bound. she can't move from the couch except to use the bathroom and go into the kitchen, and she stays on the couch all day watching television. all of the cleaning used to be

help her anymore either, my cousin claims that she can't see my mother in the state she's in because it aggravates her anxiety, but honestly i think she's lying because she's fed up with helping my mother as well.\n  \n  i've only spoken to my mother on a handful of occasions since our initial blowout a few weeks ago, and i've only been over there once in the past month. which honestly ... feels

somewhat agree with you, but it isn't only in big cities -- it's pretty much everywhere (at least in the united states). most people live paycheck-to-paycheck, saving up enough money to pay for

house with two roommates because it was the cheapest option available for us all, and single bedroom apartments on long island in particular are upwards of $1200+ per month. it's even more expensive in manhattan.\n  \n  most people work 2 jobs or more to sustain themselves, so if you really want to live in new york, you're going to need a definitive plan and crunch a tight budget.\n

relationship, he was very aware of how devoted i was to him.\n  \n  it's silly to try to judge a relationship based on the little knowledge you have of it. we were together for nearly 10 years ; if he had doubts, we wouldn't have lasted as long as we did.\n  ","389656":"\n  no, i never had a crush on her. we've always just been close friends. he's always been good at guessing certain things, it's just part of who he is.\n  ","389657":"\n  no, i've never cheated in a relationship before. i dated a girl before when i was younger, and pretty much all of my crushes prior to dating my ex were on girls, lol.\n  ","389658":"\n  i literally just said i had no desire to try harder drugs, lol.\n  ","389659":"\n  okay, so i took one of those astrology tests (not sure how reliable it is).\n  \n

(besides the few times i've tried cocaine when i was much younger).\n  ","389661":"\n  yup, exactly. salvia, for example, is a hallucinogenic type of strain of weed. i've only ever smoked it once when i was a teenager, and it was absolutely horrible for me.\n  \n  i like \"body highs\" as opposed to \"head highs,\" because when i get a head high, i tend to get more anxiety and get tunnel vision and i feel like i'm spiraling. the second i get one of those highs, all i want to do is be sober again.\n  ","389662":"\n  it's all right, i'm comfortable answering it.\n  \n  she's never sought treatment or been professionally diagnosed, and she doesn't believe she's mentally ill either. however, i do think she *is* mentally ill to some capacity -- i just don't know to what extent, or what she could have. she would never admit to anything and even goes so far as to call me and my father crazy because we both take medication for mental illness.\n  ","389663":"\n  depends on the strain. i prefer indica strains because that does reduce my anxiety, but sativa does the complete opposite.\n  ","389664":"\n  yeah, i have facebook, instagram, twitter, and snapchat.\n  ","389665":"\n  i feel as if i have no other choice, so probably. even though i'm not the biggest fan of biden, he's the only logical choice because i do want trump out of office. voting third party is useless and will only divide the democratic vote.\n  ","389666":"\n  uh, yeah. lmaoo.\n  \n  unless you're talking about \"the 27 club,\" which refers to the musicians who have passed away at the age of 27. in that case, my answer would be janis joplin.\n  ","389667":"\n  i've never heard of that group before.\n  ","389668":"\n  very rarely. i'll smoke maybe once every month or two months or so. i'm a light weight, so

occasions than i can count. lmao.\n  ","389671":"\n  my roommate is the same way, he just has short hair all over. he put the clippers on like a 3 or a 4 (i think?), and shaved all the way around. i had to help him do the back of his head\/neck, and i was *so* afraid to screw it up, even though the clippers were set on that specific length, LOL.\n  ","389672":"\n  my thing is, not all of my hair is shaved -- only half of my hair is shaved on the one side, and then i have an undercut on the other side and also hair shaved in the back up to a certain point.\n  \n  it would be easier if my entire head was shaved, but it isn't. that's why i'm so nervous to do it myself, haha.\n  ","389673":"\n  i used regular scissors once to cut my own hair when i was a teenager, LOL. otherwise, no. i've never cut my own hair before.\n  ","389674":"\n  definitely not, lol. i would be way too anxious to try to shave my own head, especially considering i can't see the back or anything. i've always

LMAO. all of my previous crushes were on girls when i was in high school. i had dated one man during high school, but he groomed me so it was different.\n  ","389713":"\n  no, lol. i know she doesn't

friendship than the other person, and that they're only putting up with me because they feel sorry for me or something.\n  ","389723":"\n  LOL, NO WE DIDN'T HOOK UP. i was just saying that the only people i've ever met from online have been online friends.\n  ","389724":"\n  i agree with you !! i think a lot of companies are probably re-evaluating their remote work policies and crunching the numbers to see if it's better for employees to work from home versus working in the office.\n  \n  it's been virtually the same with my job, even the meetings we have are over zoom instead of emailing

","389726":"\n  to be totally honest with you, i really hope we don't return to the office. i've become so comfortable working from home and i feel 100x more productive doing so, and the thought of returning to the office gives me major anxiety.\n  ","389727":"\n  i joined tinder a while ago, but i feel apprehensive about actually meeting up with people and going out on dates.\n  \n  granted -- i did hook up with someone last weekend, but it was a very unexpected and spontaneous decision, lmaoo.\n  ","389728":"\n  they're equally important to me, it would be impossible to pit them against each other because i consider both of them my closest friends.\n  ","389729":"\n  LOL. i can definitely understand that. everyone in my company works their own projects, we don't really have any team building activities. the majority of our communication has always been through email anyway, so working from home isn't much different at all than working in the office.\n  ","389730":"\n  it probably has something to do with the lack of control the company has over the employee working from home, and concern about productivity.\n  \n  which i somewhat understand, but i also agree with you that working from home should be more socially accepted and practiced. in the case of my job, people are actually being *more* productive because they can just easily log on and check their emails even outside of work hours just to keep up with things. i'm actually thinking about logging in for about 30 minutes later, just to check my email and flag things accordingly.\n  ","389731":"\n  i honestly have no clue, haha. he's just been such an important and central figure in my life from the time i was 17 years old. he's helped me survive through all of the hardships i've faced, and i've done the same for him regarding his own hardships and pitfalls.\n  ","389732":"\n  hi friends, i'm home alone for the rest of the night, so ask me some questions ~~\n  ","389733":"\n  working from home has been amazing, tbh. i love the fact that i don't have to rush in the morning, i don't have to deal with the daily hour-long commute going there and back home, and i enjoy being able to do household chores and errands here and there while i'm on my breaks.\n  \n  i don't miss the social aspect of work at all, because i remain in contact with the coworkers who i did talk to on a daily basis. obviously we haven't seen each other since quarantine started, but we do have loose plans to eventually see each other soon.\n  ","389734":"\n  honestly, probably not. it will hurt a bit, of course, but i can't imagine him *not* in my life in some capacity. if it were to come to that, i would be forthcoming about my feelings about it and make sure he knows how much it hurt me. i wouldn't ignore my feelings like i have in the past just to keep the relationship going.\n  ","389735":"\n  haha, thank you. i've definitely learned a lot about myself since we broke up, especially regarding my own resilience. although it does help a lot that him and i are still good friends.\n  ","389736":"\n  if he did, that's just a further motive for me to tell him no if he ends up breaking up with his girlfriend and desires to get back together with me. he needs to learn how to be alone.\n  ","389737":"\n  i don't believe i'm *in* love with him like i was, but i still do love him. there will probably always be a part of me who loves him.\n  ","389738":"\n  i don't know if he actually cheated on me -- he just liked her. it wouldn't surprise me if he did, though. he never admitted to it, so it might be a conversation we should have in the future.\n  \n  i think he jumps from one person to another because it's all he's ever known, and i think it does stem from his own past and his addiction to s*x due to his own trauma. he's very hypers*xual and always has been for as long as i've known him.\n  ","389739":"\n  i'm usually open to talk about anything, depending on how well i know that person. however, if it's someone i'm meeting for the first time, i generally don't talk about political views with them first. those conversations can wait until we're better acquainted.\n  ","389740":"\n  he was, but he obviously had faults of his own that he needed to work on that i either ignored or was in denial of until the past few months after talking it through with friends. i did find out that he had liked his current girlfriend while him and i were still dating, which explains why him and i were so distant towards the end of the relationship. i had known who she was at that time, but i didn't think anything of it.\n  \n  he's always jumped from one person to another, and i think he needs some time to be single (if his current relationship doesn't work out) to sort through his own feelings, and also focus on himself. i think he would benefit from therapy too.\n  ","389741":"\n  no, probably not. i used to want with every ounce of my being to get back together with him, but over the course of the past few months, i've realized that even if he and his girlfriend broke up and he asked me out again, i would say no.\n  \n  he has a lot of self-realization to do, a lot of things to work on himself, and he would need some time for himself and be single before he jumps into another relationship. he's never been *out* of a relationship for very long, which means he has had little time being single for pretty much since he was a young teenager. i think he would need time like that to collect himself and find what he truly values in a relationship and in life.\n  ","389742":"\n  illuminating. i went to my ex's apartment and we talked about a lot of different things, and it felt nice to catch up and also get some things off my chest that i had been holding in for a while.\n  ","389743":"\n  fact ; my laptop lock & home screens are prettier than most.\n  ","389744":"\n  myself, LOL. i don't remember a large portion of my life, so i would want to glimpse into my own past and see what had happened.\n  ","389745":"\n  i wish i was skilled at singing. had i been a good singer, i would have entered the music industry a long time ago.\n  ","389746":"\n  forensic files, criminal minds, or pretty much any show that's a true crime documentary.\n  ","389747":"\n  i don't really have any plans or goals, no. i've been trying to take each day as it comes since quarantine started because if i think too far ahead, then i get overwhelmed and\/or disappointed.\n  ","389748":"\n  i used to call out of work a lot when i had to commute to the office, but ever since i've been working from home, i haven't been out as often. i clocked out early from work two-ish weeks ago because i wasn't mentally feeling well, but prior to that, it was at least one or two months since i had either clocked out early or called out completely.\n  ","389749":"\n  (cont) ... it\u2019s things like this that makes me regret and wish I never got help because if I never got diagnosed probably I would still seem \u201cnormal\u201d and wouldn\u2019t have to declare shit even if I was mentally ill. The processes would be so much easier and I don\u2019t have to worry if I\u2019m going to get turned away. I could not even muster the courage to ask the person \u201cuh, I actually also have BPD. Would I still be able to donate blood?\u201d Because I was afraid of the answer and I was afraid I would get blacklisted. Sigh I might be overthinking :(\n  \n  --\n  \n  i don't believe you're overthinking at all, tbh i would probably wonder the same thing myself if i were to ever donate blood or anything (which honestly, i've never done before). i haven't even been to a regular doctor in 3+ years, lol.\n  \n  i think if you're able to show that you're mentally okay enough to consent (like if you're in treatment or anything) then it shouldn't be a problem. i'm beginning to wonder if it's also relevant to a survey as well -- like they want to know how many people diagnosed with depression\/anxiety donate blood compared to people without mental illnesses.\n  ","389750":"\n  that doesn't sound... legal? i'm really unfamiliar with the entire process of donating blood, though, so i'm not entirely sure. that definitely doesn't sound right to me, though.\n  \n  i'm so sorry you're going through this. jobs and schools shouldn't be discriminating against you for having mental illnesses either. like, my job knows i have depression and anxiety because i have a doctor's note on file excusing me from absences in light of my illnesses, but thankfully they've never held it against me before.\n  ","389751":"\n  i haven't painted in a while, but yes i do enjoy painting.\n  ","389752":"\n  i was a bit irritated the other day when my roommate's family came over and they were talking really loudly in the living room while i was trying to work.\n  \n  it wasn't necessarily their fault, it's not as if they were purposely being loud (it's just who they are).  i also didn't want to close my bedroom door because then i wouldn't have had the air conditioning coming into the room. it was just a mild annoyance.\n  ","389753":"\n  i've never even heard of that before, tbh. that's really shocking and surprising to me -- why would they turn you away for having a mental illness? how would they even be able to tell if you're mentally ill to begin with?\n  ","389754":"\n  i've always been pretty good at spelling, yes.\n  ","389755":"\n  i only have two stuffed animals, haha. i keep them on my bed (they're not big or anything).\n  ","389756":"\n  i always enjoyed my english classes, which is why i majored in english and writing when i was in college.\n  ","389757":"\n  i just get lethargic in the hot, humid weather. i don't want to do anything that exerts energy.\n  ","389758":"\n  i saw it last week, i think !! it looks super intense.\n  ","389759":"\n  facebook !! i uploaded a video of me wearing a skyrim mask that my friend mailed to me. :'))\n  ","389760":"\n  yes, i use paypal.\n  ","389761":"\n  i use askfm, twitter, instagram, snapchat, and facebook.\n  ","389762":"\n  i'm currently drinking an espresso martini and watching the television series \"the punisher\" on netflix.\n  ","389763":"\n  yes, i have notifications turned on for all social media apps on my phone.\n  ","389764":"\n  my inbox is nearly empty & the rest of the questions in my inbox are simple spam questions from friends.\n  \n  y'all, send me some interesting questions for the rest of the night ~~\n  ","389765":"\n  cheeseburgers, but not just any cheeseburger -- one from a local diner, where it's freshly made on a huge bun with fresh lettuce and tomatoes. cheeseburgers from fast food restaurants are an insult to actual cheeseburgers.\n  ","389766":"\n  i would choose to have the ability to sing well. if i wasn't a writer or creative person in general, then i would have gone into the music industry if i had a terrific singing voice.\n  ","389767":"\n  there have been so many strange things said to me on the internet over the years, that i wouldn't honestly know where to begin, LOL. it's mostly been on askfm, not surprisingly.\n  ","389768":"\n  my ex, lmaoo. i don't know if he's changed ever since we broke up in regards to his cleanliness (i.e. he used to leave plates and cups everywhere), but i'm sorta happy we didn't get a chance to move in together during the latter stages of our relationship. i've realized i'm somewhat of a clean freak ever since i moved into my own house, and his lack of attention to keeping things tidy would drive me wild.\n  ","389769":"\n  i'm so sorry that has happened to you -- and that other people feel the need to judge you for how you're coping with the aftermath of it. they have no say in how you should think, act, or feel, and you're doing the best you can do while overcoming the years of ab*se you've endured.\n  \n  it's never easy, and no one knows the situation better than yourself. i'm glad you've recognized that you didn't deserve to be treated in that manner.\n  ","389770":"\n  criminal minds, NCIS, bones, it's always sunny in philadelphia, how i met your mother, parks and recreation, house MD, wentworth, bob's burgers, the x-files, the punisher, etc etc.\n  ","389771":"\n  having a good support system, having a place to live where i don't feel caged or restricted, and having an amazing job.\n  ","389772":"\n  falling in love with someone who feels the same way towards you, and you have a mutual feeling of commitment and desire to walk to the end of the earth just to make your partner feel special and loved.\n  ","389773":"\n  any time a person compliments my writing, it fills me with a lot of pride and joy.\n  ","389774":"\n  having extensive knowledge in any area of interest, especially when that person is obviously passionate about that interest.\n  ","389775":"\n  a person is a bad person, in my opinion, if they have ill intentions -- whether it's through hurting someone else or an animal or something. and when they do go through with their intentions, they don't feel guilty or bad about it in any capacity.\n  ","389776":"\n  \"destroy and conquer.\"\n  ","389777":"\n  i would probably get back into painting again, because i do enjoy painting a lot. it just sucks how expensive paints and canvases are today, and normally by the end of the work day, i have zero motivation to do anything.\n  ","389778":"\n  all of my candles would finally be put to good use !! haha.\n  \n  otherwise, i don't even know what i would do. obviously i wouldn't have a job anymore unless we somehow adapted to using typewriters and kept paper logs of everything we do instead of having our files saved on a cloud within my job's database.\n  ","389779":"\n  this is very true, haha. i've never exactly been a history buff. i took advanced placement history courses in high school, but i can't remember anything from them because that was over 10 years ago.\n  ","389780":"\n  i just want to be happy and content with who i am, where i am in life, etc etc. i also want to eventually write a book, or at least a book of poetry or short stories.\n  ","389781":"\n  nah, not really. i don't have much of a culture and american food is just pretty much a conglomeration of food from other various cultures. the most american food i eat are cheeseburgers, which isn't really something that requires an explanation, lol.\n  ","389782":"\n  i know absolutely nothing about the 1800s, so i can't really give an opinion.\n  ","389783":"\n  having the freedom and independence to do what you want to do at any given moment, instead of answering to someone else.\n  ","389784":"\n  you would probably have to ask the people who know me, lmao. i have no clue what others think of me.\n  ","389785":"\n  i wouldn't want to be famous. i wouldn't be able to handle the constant paparazzi and attention that comes alongside fame.\n  ","389786":"\n  i've only ever followed my friends' partners on social media if i have met them extensively and we get along well. i don't really believe it's odd unless you have some sort of ulterior motive behind it.\n  ","389787":"\n  i don't believe my life has been interesting enough to warrant writing a book about it, haha. i have written a lot of short stories and personal essays that reflected some of my experiences, but they weren't directly an indication that it was about me.\n  \n  i've always been horrible with titles too, so i honestly don't know what i would name the book should i ever write an autobiography.\n  ","389788":"\n  yeah, i've used doordash and grubhub. i've had good experiences with them nearly every single time, and i have zero complaints.\n  ","389789":"\n  i honestly can't remember. i don't usually cry in front of other people at all. it's difficult for me to express those sorts of emotions when other people are around.\n  ","389790":"\n  my day has been rather productive, which i'm happy about. i got a lot of work done at my job today, and then i felt like i deserved a nap so i slept for about 1.5 hours after i clocked out, lmaoo.\n  \n  afterwards, i fed the cats, made something small for dinner, and now i'm just going through my inbox and listening to music.\n  ","389791":"\n  almost nine seasons in just one month ?! you're a trooper, lol.\n  \n  i love criminal minds so much, it's one of my go-tos and comfort shows when i don't really want to watch anything else.\n  ","389792":"\n  to an extent, yeah. i feel as if i need validation for my accomplishments, i.e. someone congratulating me on doing a certain task or reassuring their faith in me, so i'll sometimes talk about things i've done that i think would warrant praise -- that way, i end up feeling much more secure in myself.\n  ","389793":"\n  aw, thank you, kittie !! ?\n  \n  i've definitely had a trying week, and i'm happy to relax for the next two days. there are a few household things i want to do this weekend, but they're not anything major.\n  ","389794":"\n  probably \"7 rings\" or \"break up with your girlfriend.\"\n  ","389795":"\n  sorta, yeah. i won't jump up and scream if i see one, but i definitely get nervous trying to catch it and\/or kill it, lmaoo.\n  ","389796":"\n  yeah, we have one air conditioner in the house.\n  ","389797":"\n  today, i compiled all of the tasks i completed at work throughout the course of the week (we're supposed to keep a log of the work we've done and email it to our supervisors at the end of the week since we've been working from home). i impressed myself with how much work i got done this week, so that brought me a bit of joy.\n  ","389798":"\n  yeah, i haven't seen a few of my friends in a very long time and i miss hanging out with them.\n  ","389799":"\n  i'd much rather take a shower. i don't like baths at all, haha. i've tried it a few times and it was just boring to me.\n  ","389800":"\n  it's currently 81 degrees fahrenheit, which is much more bearable than it has been this past week. :\/ there's not much humidity at the moment because it rained this morning.\n  ","389801":"\n  i don't really have any short-term goals for the rest of 2020 except to pretty much survive it, haha. i do want to get another raise at work, which i *think* is in the process. i emailed my supervisor today regarding an update on whether or not HR contacted her for an employee evaluation, and she told me that she was discussing my review with HR this afternoon. :'))\n  ","389802":"\n  favorite movies ;\n

super close to each other like they are in new york city or anything, but they're not far apart at all either. there are stores on every corner, and nearly anything you need is usually only a 5 minute drive away.\n  \n  there aren't any unique plants or wildlife, haha. just regular trees on people's front lawns and backyards, the occasional rabbit, squirrels, birds, and on the eastern long island, there are deer.\n  ","389804":"\n  i absolutely hate the warm\/hot weather during the summer. :\/ it's been between the 80s and 90s lately (fahrenheit), and thankfully today it's been much cooler outside since it rained all morning.\n  ","389805":"\n  the ending of \"how i met your mother\" caused a lot of grief among fans, and even though the ending was face-palm worthy, i still do enjoy the series a lot.\n  \n  that definitely doesn't answer your question, but it was the only thing i could think of, lmao.\n  ","389806":"\n  i remember that being a thing when i was like... 13. i don't

things like tips and whatnot, that way i know the person isn't getting ripped off by their employer by taking a percentage out of their tip.\n  ","389863":"\n  lil peep !! also, wasn't xxxtentacion an ab*ser anyway?\n  ","389864":"\n  i agree with you, but aren't there other factors that come into play when someone decides to adopt a child, like medical records or something? i'm not familiar with the process at all.\n  ","389865":"\n  slippers !!\n  ","389866":"\n  i've bathed in the blood of virgins to retain my youth.\n  ","389867":"\n  none of them were my fault thankfully, and someone was hurt on one occasion (i don't think it was badly). i also got bad whiplash when i was rear ended a few years ago, but i never sought medical treatment.\n  ","389868":"\n  yes, i've been in multiple accidents unfortunately.\n  ","389869":"\n  that's not weird, that's pretty smart that you're being so cautious about that sort of thing.\n  ","389870":"\n  tripping over my phone's charging wire

in installments, but it's the biggest investment i've ever made.\n  ","389873":"\n  i wasn't even aware that she was holding a podcast.\n  ","389874":"\n  i wouldn't necessarily call it scared, it's just unnecessary and personal information that most people would rather not disclose to a stranger.\n  \n  i know about the whole \"never ask a woman her age\" thing too, but i've never understood that either, lmao.\n  ","389875":"\n  i wouldn't, lol. every time i've been to a karaoke event, i've supported my singing friends instead of singing myself.\n  ","389876":"\n  yes, that's correct. i'm sure in all cultures, though, it's inappropriate to inquire about a stranger's sex life.\n  ","389877":"\n  this is true, you're right about that. however, that's entirely different from what you were asking before, lol.\n  ","389878":"\n  i sleep with my string lights on, usually on a low blue or red setting.\n  ","389879":"\n  smoothie !! milkshakes usually have too much dairy for me, so it makes my stomach hurt.\n  ","389880":"\n  thank you !!\n  \n  i feel rather okay today, just frustrated at work because it's been super busy and the remote system keeps crashing. :\/ however, i only have a

lol.\n  ","389883":"\n  i think pranks are juvenile and stupid, so i wouldn't prank anyone.\n  ","389884":"\n  i've never learned how to ride a bicycle, so i would have to choose swimming. i've always enjoyed swimming anyway.\n  ","389885":"\n  i'd rather go to the gym, it's a mental thing where once i know i'm in a place meant for exercise, i remain motivated to get the job done.\n  ","389886":"\n  eventually, sure. i'm in no major rush, though.\n  ","389887":"\n  i think that's the opposite of a red flag, lol. that's a green flag more than anything else. if you've been with your partner for a while and they still give you butterflies, i think that's a really cute thing. it means you're still enamored with them after all this time.\n  ","389888":"\n  this is something i've struggled with for the majority of my life. i find it difficult to really find meaning in most things, and it's the little things in life that keep me somewhat motivated.\n  ","389889":"\n  i'd rather not get into that.\n  ","389890":"\n  marijuana, mainly. anything else, i think is dangerous.\n  ","389891":"\n  occasionally, i have in the past. it was mainly out of boredom to do questions like \"winter or

books, so i wouldn't be able to do so, haha.\n  ","389908":"\n  they were fundraising for friends, so i trust my friends. i've only done it maybe twice in my life.\n  ","389909":"\n  i have before, yeah.\n  ","389910":"\n  i do now, yes.\n  ","389911":"\n  ask me questions, friends ~~\n  ","389912":"\n  oh goodness.\n  \n  pretend you're confronting a total stranger on the street. would you ask them this same question? the answer is no. it isn't an acceptable or appropriate question to ask a person.\n  ","389913":"\n  hypotheticals are pointless.\n  ","389914":"\n  no, that isn't the only thing that matters. if you cheat on your partner, you clearly have zero respect for them or their feelings, because you know they're going to feel hurt and heartbroken over it.\n  \n  if you're interesting in pursuing someone else, the right thing to do would be to end the relationship and start the new fling (or whatever it is) as a single person.\n  ","389915":"\n  definitely not, lmaoo. it's one of my closest friends whom i've known for 10 years and his brother.\n  ","389916":"\n  yeah, that's what i'm thinking too. it's a small increase that doesn't really mean much, but it was still a really random number so he's going to call tomorrow regardless.\n  ","389917":"\n  believe it or not, people of different sexes and genders can live with each other if they have a mutual respect for one another and are adults with responsible attitudes.\n  ","389918":"\n  ???\n  \n  well yeah, if you don't have a uterus then you obviously can't carry a pregnancy. but in the case of trans women dating cis women or trans men dating cis men (or anything other person who has male genitalia), they can most certainly get pregnant.\n  \n  to assume that you automatically can't reproduce if you're a trans person is just silly. there are plenty of trans and non-binary people who become pregnant and bring a term to labor.\n  ","389919":"\n  i agree with you. some people simply cannot respect others though, which is fine if people don't respect me \u2014 i'm not here for respect or validation, and i don't expect it from everyone obviously either, that would just be unrealistic.\n  ","389920":"\n  you're referring to sex then, not gender. even still, sex is based on chromosomes and that can vary wildly as well.\n  \n  gender isn't the same as sex, so if you're AFAB but your gender is a man, then you're a man. there's no disputing that, regardless of how you want to spin it.\n  \n  also... trans people can most absolutely reproduce, lmfao what.\n  ","389921":"\n  it's an inconvenience, but nothing any of us can't handle. it just seems so random & i honestly think the house is overpriced to begin with.\n  \n  but my roommate was comparing the new rent we'd be paying come october with other places in the area & what we pay is still cheaper than most other houses for rent, so we think the increase is due to the market itself.\n  ","389922":"\n  i already told you my gender.\n  ","389923":"\n  i beg to differ. i'm not really in the mood to have a discussion regarding gender right now, though. if you're curious about non-binary identities, you can easily google it.\n  ","389924":"\n  i'm non-binary.\n  ","389925":"\n  yes, they're two men.\n  ","389926":"\n  that's precisely why i distanced myself from the feminist community, lol. if i still believe in the fight for equality and taking back empowerment, then i really don't see the issue here.\n  ","389927":"\n  if you don't have anything productive to add to this discussion, i'm just going to delete any further inquiries.\n  ","389928":"\n  thanks for using my pronouns. :'))\n  ","389929":"\n  i have two roommates.\n  ","389930":"\n  no, i'm single.\n  ","389931":"\n  as my bio indicates, i'm 28 years old.\n  ","389932":"\n  hello \u2014 do you have a question?\n  ","389933":"\n  i'm listening to music & drinking at the moment. i'm a bit angry because the property manager increased our rent for when we renew the lease, and they didn't explain why. so my roommate is going to call their office tomorrow and see what's going on.\n  ","389934":"\n  be unapologetically yourself, regardless of the hard time people give you for simply expressing yourself. you know yourself better than anyone else, and if someone doesn't accept you for who you are, they're not worth having around in your life.\n  ","389935":"\n  this is going to sound weird, but my ex. even though we broke up almost a year ago, i can't deny the fact that he's helped me through some of the most difficult moments of my life.\n  ","389936":"\n  yes, although i probably shouldn't hold those moments dear to me anymore.\n  ","389937":"\n  sounds like you have some unresolved issues you need to work through if you're that offended by the fact that i don't want to put myself under a label.\n  \n  i still have the same beliefs, so it really doesn't make a difference whether or not i ascribe to the feminist label. i obviously still believe that we have a patriarchal society that caters to cishet white men.\n  ","389938":"\n  those were storm clouds, but i guess they passed us, ugh. i was really hoping for a thunderstorm tonight to get rid of this damn humidity.\n  ","389939":"\n  any risk where the pros of taking on the risk outweigh the cons.\n  ","389940":"\n  when my internet decides to cut down in the middle of the work day, sigh. it hasn't happened in a few days, but it used to happen frequently in the past.\n  ","389941":"\n  i've considered changing my dead name into the name i go by now, but it seems like an awful lot of effort for me because hardly anyone calls me by my dead name anymore. it's only on legal documents, which doesn't really bother me.\n  ","389942":"\n  it hasn't personally affected me because i haven't done anything different since the lockdown began, lol. i've only gone out to eat once and it was outdoor dining with tables several feet apart, and there were two other couples there, so i felt comfortable.\n  \n  last friday, i actually did try to go to the bar since they've been doing outdoor seating with table service for a few weeks now, and it was an interesting experience. i don't think i'd go back though, there were more people there and i was incredibly paranoid.\n  ","389943":"\n  i'm all for it \u2014 just because you don't know someone well doesn't mean they don't deserve or need words of encouragement. if someone came to me asking for advice or comfort, i'd try my best to help.\n  ","389944":"\n  i've always thought the legends were really interesting, and there's definitely gotta be some sort of magnetic field disruption there (or something).\n  ","389945":"\n  nothing. it's always disgustingly hot and humid, which takes the fun out of any summer activity.\n  ","389946":"\n  i said i was unaware of the circumstance, not that i refused to look into it (my answer is only a few answers down). thereafter, i suggested that you can raise awareness yourself of this dilemma, considering you also have a social media platform.\n  \n  this doesn't mean that i don't care about issues outside of my own country. i merely stated that i was unaware of the situation.\n  ","389947":"\n  ???\n  \n  where have i ever said that i don't want to support movements in other countries? lol.\n  ","389948":"\n  usually when i'm under the influence of some sort of substance.\n  ","389949":"\n  i don't know anything about that. you can raise awareness yourself, though.\n  ","389950":"\n  some may consider me to be so, yes.\n  ","389951":"\n  i can't guarantee that i can help you, but i'll hear you out.\n  ","389952":"\n  one of the cats crawling on top of my bed to lay down next to me.\n  ","389953":"\n  the connections you make with other people in order to cultivate a strong support system for yourself and others.\n  ","389954":"\n  i used to be deeply involved in feminism years ago (intersectional at least), and that's where i realized that a lot of feminists were actually white feminists and derivatives of that.\n  \n  if i were to get back into feminism, i would be more apt to look into radical feminism, i.e. from the 1960s to 1970s when a lot of actual progress was made.\n  ","389955":"\n  thanks, i try my best. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  ","389956":"\n  i wish the united states had the same policy for people like delivery drivers and waiters, sigh.\n  ","389957":"\n  if you don't want to tip waiters or waitresses, then you shouldn't order food or go out to eat. they primarily live off of their tips because they make less than minimum wage.\n  ","389958":"\n  ...why *wouldn't* you tip delivery drivers?\n  ","389959":"\n  i used to use pinterest years ago, but not recently.\n  ","389960":"\n  i use debit more than anything else. i have cash on me usually, but i try to reserve that for tipping delivery drivers or paying my roommate back if we order food some days.\n  ","389961":"\n  apparently everyone dreams, it's all a matter of whether or not we remember those dreams. i don't remember my dreams most of the time.\n  ","389962":"\n  a lot of pictures of cats, lmaoo.\n  ","389963":"\n  i've been using askfm since around 2011\/2012.\n  ","389964":"\n  i think that would be pretty interesting.\n  ","389965":"\n  it's basically a special badge added to your profile that highlights some of your answers and brings greater attention to your profile compared to people who aren't VIP.\n  \n  there's also VIP+ but i'm not entirely sure what the difference is.\n  ","389966":"\n  you're too busy to check your phone for 16 hours straight? lol. if you care about someone, you'd make time to send them a quick text. it isn't about demanding attention, it's about being considerate to your partner.\n  ","389967":"\n  the main reason i get out of bed in the morning is to have coffee and my morning dose of nicotine.\n  ","389968":"\n  nah, i can always catch up later. as long as my partner doesn't insist on picking up where they left off instead of where we both left off, otherwise i'd be losing part of the storyline and that can get confusing.\n  ","389969":"\n  i'm tired of interesting things happening, lmao. i'd much rather have good things happen to me for a change.\n  ","389970":"\n  i would prefer it, and in most cases there's really no excuse to not check in with your partner at least once per day \u2014 even if it is a really brief text message. sending a text takes only a few seconds out of your day, and it could mean the world to your partner.\n  ","389971":"\n  i used to go by the label of intersectional feminist, and while i do hold similar opinions to those i had in the past, i don't align myself with other feminists because i think the majority of the modern movement is a joke and most feminists focus on superficial things instead of focusing their attention on serious matters.\n  ","389972":"\n  i feel like \"typical\" americans, or at least the stereotype of them, are white cishet men, gun-toting, bible-quoting, anti-mask wearing, MAGA idiots which gives america a bad name.\n  \n  i'm anything but, lol. i'm left leaning, and although i support gun rights, i believe that there should be stricter regulations on guns. i support abortion regardless of the reason, i'm a nonbinary bisexual person, and i'm an atheist.\n  ","389973":"\n  i don't follow people on request.\n  \n  however, you should cover \"bruises\" by lewis capaldi.\n  ","389974":"\n  throw it in the damn trash (cow's milk, at least).\n  ","389975":"\n  usually scrambled eggs and buttered toast. yesterday, i had two slices of avocado toast with a fried egg on top.\n  \n  and, of course, lots of coffee.\n

yes.\n  ","389979":"\n  my second and fourth profile pictures show how long my hair is right now.\n  ","389980":"\n  i don't believe so, no. at least judging by my abundance of roots atm.\n

interviewing people and writing articles for things like magazines and newspapers. it's a much different field.\n  ","389984":"\n  that isn't a publishing company, and i said i wasn't a journalist, so no.\n  ","389985":"\n  no, i'm a writer and editor for a publishing company.\n  ","389986":"\n  i live in new york, so i wouldn't be surprised.\n  ","389987":"\n  i'm five feet tall.\n  ","389988":"\n

with a person that wasn't attractive? the fact that their face is covered doesn't make them any more or less attractive, lmao. they're still who they are.\n  ","390003":"\n  i fell in love fairly quickly with my ex, haha. however, i haven't had much experience outside of that.\n  ","390004":"\n  if you're questioning it in the first place, then that might be an indication that you don't love someone as much as you thought you did, or that the feelings you used to hold are slowly dwindling away.\n  ","390005":"\n  i'm pretty sure most everyone is of the general consensus that they wouldn't

the sexism and misogyny is still very evident.\n  ","390049":"\n  i took a few taekwondo classes as a kid, but i only advanced a few belts.\n  ","390050":"\n  i don't have games on my phone.\n

for some reason, even though it was from last year.\n  ","390062":"\n  probably the future, just so the world could be past the chaos it's currently in. although tbh, i wouldn't want to be reborn into

death for something good that i've done.\n  ","390069":"\n  no, i have absolutely zero august plans thanks to COVID. otherwise, i would be getting a tattoo and getting my hair trimmed, shaved, and colored.\n  ","390070":"\n  i usually use netflix and hulu to watch movies, depending on which streaming service has the movie (or a similar movie) that i'm looking for. i also have amazon prime, but a lot of their movies don't stream for free, unfortunately.\n  ","390071":"\n  i honestly don't remember. i don't dance very often at all, unless i'm alone in my room grooving to music late at night, lol. i've only ever gone to a club once in my life where there was dancing, and i hated it.\n  ","390072":"\n  yes, i vote in every presidential election. i'm not sure who exactly i'm voting for yet because i don't support trump or biden, so i'll have to do more research.\n  ","390073":"\n  i love looking at snow and find watching snowfall to be incredibly peaceful. however, it gives me horrible anxiety when i have to drive in it.\n  ","390074":"\n  i usually save more than i spend, especially now during COVID while i've been working from home. i don't feel the need to spend money on energy drinks or breakfast outside of the house, for example, and i've been cooking more.\n  ","390075":"\n  i support onlyfans, although i've never subscribed to any of my friends' pages before. if it's something that works for them, they consent to everything, and it makes them happy, then there's no reason for me to pass judgment.\n  ","390076":"\n  not exactly, no. i believe people become more mature as they gather experiences throughout their lives, and that is somewhat relative to age but not necessarily.\n  ","390077":"\n  definitely not, LOL. my singing voice is absolutely horrible.\n

spontaneous, we're still just friends and nothing more will come of it because we both know it was just a casual fling. if it happens again, i'd be willing to do so, but if it was just a one-time thing, i'm happy with that too.\n  ","390085":"\n  yeah, she always has been unfortunately. she's the source of most of my trauma, and i thought that i would be escaping it by moving out, but her need

hour hang-outs with my coworkers.\n  ","390087":"\n  i'm doing fine at the moment. i woke up early this morning for some reason, so i decided to make avocado toast with fried eggs and coffee for breakfast. :'))\n  \n  now i'm just hanging out on askfm and answering questions in my inbox before i have to clock into work.\n  ","390088":"\n  yes, i've felt left out because of friends and family alike. it hasn't happened to me in a while with respect to my friends because i've closed my inner circle, and i have a small group of trusted friends now. however, my family leaves me out and treats me so much differently on a regular basis.\n  ","390089":"\n  abandonment by loved ones.\n  ","390090":"\n  there's so much left to explore here on earth, especially with respect to the oceans. from my understanding, we only have the technology to really discover a small percentage of what the world's oceans entail, and it would be interesting to see what else is living here with us.\n

have a photo, but i just ate a part of a chicken parm hero & it was delicious. that can probably be considered one of my comfort foods.\n  ","390099":"\n  i was angry with my parents over a long-winded, disparaging text that my mother sent to me on friday. i'm not willing to go into the details of the text message, but we went back and forth for a little while until i completely stopped answering her. she was essentially still treating me as if i was a child, degrading me, and trying to exert control over my life.\n  ","390100":"\n  i don't have an iphone.\n  ","390101":"\n  i grew

autumn. i cannot stand the heat.\n  ","390104":"\n  i think when you round up people of varying genders, it would be nearly impossible to come to a consensus regarding which gender cheats more in relationships. it all comes down to individual experiences.\n  ","390105":"\n  thank you, kittie. your positive posts are delightful. :'))\n  ","390106":"\n  probably not, it's not something i've ever looked into.\n  ","390107":"\n  we're talking about vision, not amputation.\n  ","390108":"\n  no, wearing glasses doesn't make you disabled, as long as the corrective lenses you wear makes your vision acceptable.\n  ","390109":"\n  nope, i've retained absolutely zero knowledge of the french language. lmao.\n  ","390110":"\n  the united states doesn't have an official language, and there are a multitude of languages spoken in this country.\n  ","390111":"\n  yes, spanish is commonly used throughout the united states. they offered spanish classes when i was in high school (we were supposed to take one foreign language course), but i chose french for some unknown reason. it would have benefited me a lot more if i chose spanish.\n  ","390112":"\n  not really, no. which is amusing considering my ex is cuban and his family speaks spanish fluently. i've just never picked up on the language.\n  ","390113":"\n  unless they learn how to take accountability for their actions, then it may get worse in the long haul. not apologizing for the mistakes you have made is not a good trait to have, and when things get more serious in your relationship, that type of behavior is going to spill over into other things, i.e. if you decide to move in together, get married, have a family, etc etc.\n  ","390114":"\n  i've always questioned it myself, LOL. i suppose i'm an approachable person and people feel like they can confide in me.\n  ","390115":"\n  what is this even supposed to mean, LOL. no, obviously i refer to them by their own names.\n  ","390116":"\n  exactly !! i would feel as if i would be doing those anons a disservice, because i frequently have anons coming to my page and asking for advice that they wouldn't feel comfortable asking off-anon.\n  ","390117":"\n  this is a complicated question, because even though i did live with my ex for a few years at his house, i wasn't moved out of my parents' house during that time either. i would stay with him for a few days, then return home and get more clothes and do laundry, etc etc. i also moved to massachusetts when i was 17 years old to attend college, where i remained for one year until i moved back to new york.\n  \n  the only real \"solid\" move i've experienced has been my recent move into a house with my two roommates, which we did last october. we've been in this house for about nine months now. this living situation is the best, by far, because i've established my own independence from my parents at last and can do things according to my own terms.\n  ","390118":"\n  it's why i keep anon on, tbh. as many weird\/hateful messages as i get, there are also so many anons who are thoughtful and have been my anons for years.\n  ","390119":"\n  LOL, aw thank you ~~\n  ","390120":"\n  my weekend has gone pretty well, not gonna lie. it's been an incredibly lazy weekend, though. i did virtually nothing all weekend long except for friday night.\n  ","390121":"\n  perhaps they're not married to the right person. i couldn't really give you a concrete answer on that, i've never been in such a position before.\n  ","390122":"\n  lol, i don't drink as much coffee these days as i used to. two cups in the morning at the most -- my coffee consumption was actually much worse when i *was* working in the office because we had a coffee machine in my department, lmaoo.\n  \n  but yeah, i drink water. and if i think i'm getting too dehydrated, i always have a stock of gatorade in the fridge.\n  ","390123":"\n  i've never believed that a markup *that* extreme was plausible, that was just the example another anon in this thread offered. my initial presumption that people can buy things for cheap from thrift stores and sell them for much-higher prices was based on my own limited understanding of the industry, not really influenced by anyone or anything in particular.\n  ","390124":"\n  well, thank you for your openness and allowing me the time to become educated on the process. i realize that my initial response to the first question was rather ignorant considering i don't know the ins-and-outs of the industry. but now i have a clearer understanding of the details involved.\n  ","390125":"\n  i 100% agree with your grandfather, LOL. the second it turns spring, all of my drinks are iced, like coffee and tea.\n  \n  unfortunately, because i've been working from home, i've been drinking hot coffee half the time because i make a pot of coffee every other day. the first day, i drink it hot. then i save the rest in the fridge, and have iced coffee the next morning.\n  ","390126":"\n  comfortable silence is wonderful, tbh. you shouldn't feel pressured or obligated to talk the entire time you and your partner are together. if you two can sit comfortably in silence with one other (i.e., while watching tv\/movies together or you're both doing your separate thing in the same space), then that's healthy.\n  ","390127":"\n  (cont) ... You don\u2019t even know if it *will* resell! I found a genuine Valentino skirt once which was exciting but it was ugly af! Lmao. I put it on ebay for bidding and got a great price but that was a rare event. I\u2019ve had losses, things which barely sold over the purchase price!\n  \n  --\n  \n  i think this is from the same person? i apologize if these two messages are unrelated.\n  \n  i'm gaining a better understanding of the market through these messages, however. i've never exactly been a fashion type of person, i buy my clothes from amazon (lol). i don't even know what the value of designer clothing\/items are.\n  ","390128":"\n  i do, but not very often lately considering it's summer time where i live, and the last thing i want is a steaming hot cup of tea, lol. i've been drinking solely iced tea if i want tea in my life.\n  ","390129":"\n  i'm unsure. it will be good in the sense that people may be more cognizant of how they interact with other people, especially in terms of personal space and whatnot. but obviously it'll also be bad because our societies have been so shaken by what has happened that it's difficult to envision life going back to the way it was.\n  \n  like, there are some people who have already tried reverting back to that old lifestyle of going out with friends, having parties, going to the bar, etc etc., and that's why rates\/cases have been skyrocketing again. COVID is still clearly here, but some people are in such denial of how severe this is that they don't want to take accountability.\n  ","390130":"\n  towards the end of the relationship, there was. we started seeing each other less and less (maybe only once per week), and the same feelings weren't there anymore. i was still in love with him, but he didn't reciprocate those feelings as strongly anymore, and although we tried working through it, it was obvious we had just grown apart with age.\n  \n  honestly, our friendship is a lot stronger now than it was when we were actually dating, now that a lot of time has passed. we're still super comfortable around each other and there isn't even any tension or awkwardness or anything.\n  ","390131":"\n  honestly, there is no difference. all of the work we do in done on the computer to begin with, and we a remote log-in system to access our desktops in the office from our home computers, so everything is literally the same.\n  \n  i prefer working from home, tbh. sometimes i wish i could see two or three of my coworkers, but we also text often so it's not as if we're all completely disconnected. we also have a department-wide \"happy hour\" zoom meeting every few weeks, which is fun and brings everyone together.\n  ","390132":"\n  yes, i've been working from home since march. my job hasn't said anything about if\/when we're even returning.\n  ","390133":"\n  even without the threat of COVID-19, there are still going to be concerns and worries because of how sudden and dramatic the change was between february and now (for example). i can't really foresee society going forward as \"normal,\" and i do agree to some extent that there's going to be a \"new normal.\"\n  ","390134":"\n  that's understandable. i've only gone thrifting maybe once or twice in my life, i don't even know of any thrift stores around me besides the salvation army (which i don't support anyway).\n  ","390135":"\n  i'm unsure of the morality of the situation, tbh. admittedly, i don't know very much about the DIY industry because i've never been very crafty. i do obviously understand people who buy items for cheap, refurbish them, decorate them, etc etc., and then selling it for a higher price because of the cost of materials and labor involved, though.\n  ","390136":"\n  my sleep is fine, if anything i over-sleep sometimes because i can easily sleep for 9-10 hours per night if i allow myself.\n  ","390137":"\n  you evidently didn't read my last statement regarding language and trans identities.\n  ","390138":"\n  educate me, then. i'm open to have a civil conversation instead of being told off because of my ignorance towards the subject.\n  ","390139":"\n  i was asked a question & i answered that question. i'm not sure why you're so pressed when i made my thoughts clear.\n  ","390140":"\n  indeed. however, the language has changed in recent years as trans identities have been spoken about more often.\n  ","390141":"\n  LOL, you're right about that.\n  ","390142":"\n  that's different from simply buying a piece of clothing and re-selling it as it already is. if you're putting the time and effort into refurbishing the items, customizing them, etc etc., then you should be compensated for your labor.\n  ","390143":"\n  this is correct. i'm not sure what you're trying to express here.\n  ","390144":"\n  no, bisexual basically means you're attracted to genders like and unlike your own. being bisexual isn't transphobic.\n  ","390145":"\n  i've been drinking more often, but it has no relation to my smoking.\n  ","390146":"\n  i eat a healthy diet most of the time, so in that respect, yes. everything else about my life ... not so much, lmaoo.\n  ","390147":"\n  yes, that makes complete sense. when i was running low on my pack (like, less than 5 cigarettes left), i would get a sense of worry and anxiety and would have to buy my next pack before the current pack ran out. it's an addictive mindset.\n  \n  quitting cigarettes is difficult, but i went from cigarettes to vaping so the transition was easier for me. my family still hates the fact that i vape because the effects on the body are inconclusive right now, but i still feel 100x better while vaping than i did when i was smoking cigarettes.\n  ","390148":"\n  i quit smoking cigarettes, but i do vape occasionally. i've had a cigarette here and there since i quit last year, but it definitely doesn't feel the same and it isn't something i miss. the cons totally outweigh the pros (it got so bad that i would be coughing my brains out every morning before i had my morning cigarette).\n  ","390149":"\n  lol, no that isn't the reason why we broke up. if that was the case, we would have separated years ago.\n  \n  i don't really have a preference, but i am more drawn to people with bold personalities, so interpret that as you wish. that could mean people who are extroverted with introverted tendencies, or introverted with extroverted tendencies. as long as that person understands that i need my own alone time to get through the day, that's all that matters.\n  ","390150":"\n  he's extroverted for the most part, but he also does value his alone time a lot too.\n  ","390151":"\n  i'm doing pretty well today. :'))\n  \n  it's been a relaxing day thus far, although i have done absolutely nothing productive (lol). i'm going to try to get some writing done this evening while my roommates aren't home.\n  ","390152":"\n  i'm fairly introverted, especially when i'm by myself or around large groups of people. i gain energy by having alone time to myself, and i really value solitude.\n  \n  however, i'm also a tad extroverted in a sense, but only around close friends. most of my friends are similar to me in that sense.\n  ","390153":"\n  no, i meant my ex. lol, i'm not dating anyone or in a relationship currently.\n  ","390154":"\n  yeah, i have in the past prior to entering my most recent relationship.\n  ","390155":"\n  it should be evident what my thoughts on child r*pe are.\n  ","390156":"\n  i considered the word pansexual 4-5 years ago, yeah. i went by it for a while, but a few years ago, i felt that bisexual described me better.\n  ","390157":"\n  technically, i already live on an island. haha.\n  ","390158":"\n  yeah, i'm bisexual.\n  ","390159":"\n  red team ftw.\n  ","390160":"\n  just because i live in new york state doesn't mean i know every celebrity who has lived in new york, lmaoo.\n  ","390161":"\n  i was an adult at that time, so their music didn't interest me. when i did become interested in music when i was around 11\/12 years old, i listened to rock and hip hop.\n  ","390162":"\n  i don't have an opinion because i've never listened to his music before. i also didn't know he was a new york native, lol.\n  ","390163":"\n  i didn't like music during the boy band era of the 1990s.\n  ","390164":"\n  it'll be uneven or i'll accidentally shave off chunks of hair that aren't meant to be shaved.\n  ","390165":"\n  thank you !! my roommate actually has one, so if i get desperate enough, i might use his or at least ask him to try to shave it for me, lol.\n  ","390166":"\n  no, i don't trust myself. lmao.\n  ","390167":"\n  yes, i wholeheartedly agree with you. eventually, the truth always comes out and you end up feeling like an idiot for believing the lie, even though it wasn't your own fault. there are so many negative emotions that arise when someone is lied to and the truth is revealed, it hurts much more than if we were told the truth in the very first place.\n  ","390168":"\n  i would like to get back into playing the keyboards again (or piano, although i never played piano before).\n  ","390169":"\n  regardless of how much the truth may hurt, it's much healthier to be told the truth than to be suppressed with lies. we all deserve to know the truth of various situations, and it's honestly disrespectful to someone if you're lying to them just to keep them \"happy.\"\n  ","390170":"\n  i honestly can't even remember... it was probably applebee's with my roommate pre-COVID, haha.\n  ","390171":"\n  i love tattoos, and i think they're an amazing expression of art. the human body is a canvas, and we can paint or decorate it in any way we desire.\n  \n  i have seven tattoos with plans to get several more.\n  ","390172":"\n  LOL. hell no.\n  ","390173":"\n  i look like a mess today, lmaoo.\n  ","390174":"\n  only if i know that person well enough, yeah. when it comes to friends and family, i can tell when someone is lying, trying to hide something, or trying to manipulate me and\/or others.\n  \n  when it comes to other people, it's a bit more difficult for me.\n  ","390175":"\n  no, my family isn't close like that at all. we don't have any family traditions or recipes.\n  ","390176":"\n  i've never worn one before, and i probably wouldn't like it. i hate wearing turtlenecks because it makes me feel as if i'm suffocating.\n  ","390177":"\n  a selfie from last night.\n  ","390178":"\n  i'm a writer and editor for a publishing company.\n  ","390179":"\n  i'm answering questions on my laptop, so i can't post videos. i'm also not going to be posting videos for askfm today.\n  ","390180":"\n  as my bio indicates, i live in new york state.\n  ","390181":"\n  no, my heritage comes from europe.\n  ","390182":"\n  i live in the united states.\n  ","390183":"\n  as my bio indicates, i'm 28 years old.\n  ","390184":"\n  i think she's 14 years old.\n  ","390185":"\n  that cat's name is tinkers.\n  ","390186":"\n  when you love someone, you care intimately about their happiness and well-being, and will do everything in your power in order to make them most comfortable and secure. when you love someone, their presence in your life fulfills you and makes you feel as if you can accomplish anything with their support on your side.\n  ","390187":"\n  i don't really have a strong opinion, but i think the people who do that are clearly taking advantage of the situation by selling something way overpriced to another person, even though the original item was very cheap.\n  \n  it's one thing if you've going through your wardrobe and selling clothing that you don't wear anymore just to get rid of them, but it's something else entirely to try to make a living out of selling cheap items at a wildly marked-up pricetag.\n  ","390188":"\n  \"warning: will break easily.\"\n  ","390189":"\n  i don't remember the exact instance, but in general, i sometimes say things without thinking beforehand of how i'm going to phrase them. in those instances, sometimes they come out the wrong way and end up sounding weird or insulting when that wasn't my intention at all.\n  ","390190":"\n  even when i was young, i was intrigued by the story and legend of elizabeth bathory. the whole \"bathing in the blood of virgins\" thing was really interesting to me, so i read up on her as much as i could.\n  ","390191":"\n  compromise my own happiness or mental well-being for the sake of someone else.\n  ","390192":"\n  even though i grew up in the 1990s, i would have liked to have been a teenager or young adult in the 1990s just so i could experience the music on a more intimate level, i.e. seeing my favorite bands live and whatnot.\n  ","390193":"\n  i dislike my dead name, but i'm happy with my current name.\n  ","390194":"\n  lmao, no. i'm there to shop for groceries, not to attract people. i usually end up shopping in a random tee shirt and shorts or leggings because it's most comfortable and the easiest to slip into.\n  ","390195":"\n  yes, i have a pretty normal sleep schedule. during the week, i usually fall asleep around 11:00pm to midnight, and then i wake up at 8:00am.\n  \n  there's more flexibility on the weekends because i don't have work, so i'll sleep in as late as i want. last night, for example, i fell asleep around midnight and didn't wake up until 10:00am, haha.\n  ","390196":"\n  i wear a mask when i go out in public because i care about the safety of myself and others around me.\n  ","390197":"\n  lol, no. it was mainly stone temple pilots, linkin park, soundgarden, etc etc.\n  ","390198":"\n  yes, i've pulled several all nighters throughout my life, mainly when i was a teenager and could actually function the next day while doing so, lol.\n  ","390199":"\n  i honestly don't remember !! i think i either heard my brother listening to them or i saw one of their music videos on MTV, but regardless, i was hooked after i heard \"somewhere i belong.\" i bought their CD meteora, and i fell in love instantly.\n  ","390200":"\n  i've written song lyrics in the past, but not an actual song. i imagine i would have written some

pass the time by engaging in those hobbies, or by simply scrolling through social media and answering questions here on askfm.\n  \n  as for my skills, i don't really think i have any besides a skill

someone too much and was backstabbed as a result.\n  \n  i can relate to this a lot, personally. i've always been afraid to trust people unless i've talked to them and connect to them a great deal, which can take months or years depending on the person.\n  ","390400":"\n  some house party that i went to when i was attending college in massachusetts during my freshman year, i was 18 years old. i

haven't had it since because even the smell of it disgusts me, lol.\n  ","390401":"\n  teachers in general, especially teachers who teach anywhere from kindergarten through high school grades. their jobs aren't a simple 40-hour week job ; they put in the hours teaching per day, but they also spend so much time outside of the classroom in preparing their lectures, grading homework and papers, making examinations, thinking of new ways to approach subjects, talking to parents, having meetings with colleagues and administration, etc etc.\n  \n  there is so much to teaching other than simply standing in the classroom and talking to students. most of the work is behind the scenes, and teachers also do not get financially compensated enough for the work they do.\n  ","390402":"\n  hey, sorry for the late response -- it's been a wild day, and i'm only getting deeply into my questions rn (it's already 8:00pm).\n  \n  i can understand why you're paranoid about how they feel, but the rational part of me also thinks that you might also be overthinking the situation as well. i think the best approach would be to ask that person about their feelings toward the subject and explain that you don't want them to think of you any differently in light of it.\n  \n  there's *definitely* a stigma against it, even from professionals, so your worries are definitely valid. but again, considering it's all out in the open now, i would simply ask them their thoughts to make sure they don't think any differently of you.\n  ","390403":"\n  yeah, that doesn't matter much to me. there

nearly two hour from now.\n  ","390420":"\n  i've never been to a car show before, which is fine by me because i've never been interested in cars before.\n  ","390421":"\n  i'm left handed.\n

bargaining, depression, and acceptance.\n  \n  anger and depression have always been the most difficult stages for me, particularly because those are feelings i experience anyway outside of grief.\n

friends have told me about the interaction.\n  ","390432":"\n  yeah, i do.\n  ","390433":"\n  yeah, the basement is where we keep our storage boxes. there's also a washer and dryer down there, as well as some other necessary household things like the water heater.\n  ","390434":"\n  lmao ... when i was very young and dating my ex, we were both drunk at a house party. some girl was quite obviously trying to flirt with him and getting close to him, so i ended up becoming jealous and angry. i stormed over, grabbed her by her hair, and threw her to the ground.\n  \n  not saying i condone that behavior, but ... yeah. lmaoo. it was totally out of character for me.\n  ","390435":"\n  i would rather be on the no fly list. it's imperative to have a car to get around where i live, and i wouldn't be able to live my life independently if i didn't have a driver's license.\n  ","390436":"\n  it sounds like you're putting too much emotional effort into something on the internet that you shouldn't be so attached to.\n  \n  i'm not obligated to answer every question in my inbox, and if i don't answer your questions, they're either not questions at all, trolling, ridiculous statements, or things i'm not comfortable answering.\n  ","390437":"\n  absolutely nothing, haha. i have zero plans for the upcoming months thanks to COVID, unfortunately. in light of this, i've simply been trying to take

anon who's a complete stranger, rofl. there's no sense in harboring anger toward a stranger from the internet.\n  ","390442":"\n  yes, it's considered a slur. the fact that you referred to it correctly as the R-word only validates that fact.\n  ","390443":"\n  i'm currently single.\n  ","390444":"\n  i woke up early this morning because it was hot in my bedroom, so i grabbed some ice water and opened my bedroom door to let the cool air in before going back to sleep for an additional 2-3 hours. i normally wake up at 8:00am for work.\n  ","390445":"\n  lately, nowhere else really besides the biweekly trip to the grocery store. i work from home, and in light of COVID, i haven't gone anywhere else. the last time i saw a friend was on july 4th.\n  ","390446":"\n  i don't have anything in my pockets, haha. i rarely ever put things in my pockets unless it's my phone when i'm out going to the grocery store or pharmacy.\n  ","390447":"\n  it's been several years since i've been in a pool, tbh. i really can't remember when the last time was because nobody i know has a pool.\n  ","390448":"\n  my clothing and shoes, as well as some old handbags from the past that i don't use anymore and a box of miscellaneous items from the move that i never sorted through.\n  ","390449":"\n  i don't believe in the existence of god.\n  ","390450":"\n  i didn't end up eating dinner tonight.\n  ","390451":"\n  i don't follow celebrity news, so i don't know much about kanye besides the ridiculous things he's doing with respect to running for president, lmaoo. regardless, i do think he's a bit mentally unstable and i hope he can get some help because his behavior isn't normal.\n  ","390452":"\n  i dislike the sound of my own voice too.\n  ","390453":"\n  i've heard about astral projection before, but i have no experience with it whatsoever.\n  ","390454":"\n  no, i've never burned sage before. however, it is something that my roommate wants to do because we're fairly certain that our house is somewhat haunted, lmaoo.\n  ","390455":"\n  i don't know much about crystals at all, and it isn't something i necessarily believe in (i.e. them having special powers and whatnot). i don't own any crystals.\n  ","390456":"\n  my last outgoing call was to the director of the counseling center that i go to, because he left me a voicemail stating that they found a therapist for me. however, that didn't work out because they didn't have hours that accommodated my work schedule.\n  \n  my last incoming call was someone else from the counseling center, who had another therapist who could take me. this one *did* work out, and i set up an appointment with a new therapist for next week.\n  ","390457":"\n  it isn't simply talk, it's scientific fact. wearing a face mask *does* help reduce the spread of COVID, and it's ridiculous that there are so many people out there who are anti-maskers and don't believe the words of health care professionals, who insist on everyone wearing a mask whenever they go out in public.\n  \n  if americans wore masks like they should, there would not have been such a rise in cases in recent weeks.\n  ","390458":"\n  i look forward to reading the answers of\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n  ,\n  \n   @ManicMartyrdom\n  \n  , and\n  \n   @CourtneyUwU\n  \n  the most, likely because they're the three people to whom i'm the closest from askfm.\n

coffee every day, lol.\n  ","390462":"\n  the air conditioner is on, and has been on pretty much the entire time since we purchased it a few weeks ago, lol.\n  \n  it's a rollaway air conditioner, like one of those portable ones with the tube that goes into the window. even with the AC on, it still reads 79 degrees in the house.\n  ","390463":"\n  from starbucks, yeah. i went to starbucks for the first time since march last week.\n  ","390464":"\n  yeah, i've been saving money for a few reasons during this time. the biggest money drainer was gas for my car, because i would be driving 30 miles per day to and from the office. since i've been working from home, i haven't needed to use my car very often.\n  ","390465":"\n  i'm doing fine, although i'm still really overheated and uncomfortable. i ended up taking a nap accidentally, which felt nice in the moment, but now i'm hot again, lol.\n  \n  the sun is setting now, so i hope it cools off the later it gets.\n  ","390466":"\n  to a small degree, yes. it wasn't a huge inconvenience, though. those are just privileges i experience, and obviously i can certainly live without doing those things.\n  ","390467":"\n

","390469":"\n  i'm not hungry, so probably nothing.\n  ","390470":"\n  unfortunately, that's all for the selfies. i only took two today, lmaoo.\n  \n  in other news, it's hot as balls & i'm

shop for groceries (obviously as long as it's within the same chain of stores).\n  ","390485":"\n  nah, i cleaned prior to drinking. i fed the cats and then mopped the kitchen and bathroom tiles. then i opened a bottle of wine, lol.\n  ","390486":"\n  one of my roommates is a truck driver, and the other roommate is a manager of a grocery store.\n  ","390487":"\n  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  \n

his \"alcoholic roommate\" to his coworkers, which... i guess hurts my feelings? but at the same time, i'm not sure if it's actually true?\n  \n  they questioned my roommate how i handled my money, and when he told them i handled my money extremely well, they seemed surprised. i thought that was rather insulting.\n  ","390495":"\n  no, i don't consider that to be cheating.\n  ","390496":"\n  oh please, i'm allowed to have a few glasses of wine before bed. i'm a grown adult, lol.\n  ","390497":"\n  thanks !! the same to you.\n  ","390498":"\n  other than wine, i only really drink beer and some liquors, i.e. tequila and amaretto.\n  ","390499":"\n  i was interested in watching it, but i never got around to it. heavy subjects like this are things i can only watch when i'm in a good state

choose to become a vampire. i've never really been all that interested in werewolves or the lore associated with them, and even in video games when given the option to be a vampire or werewolf (such as in skyrim), i've always chosen to be a vampire.\n  ","390513":"\n  i would say it's an even split. i was broken up with once, i broke up with someone once, and my last breakup was pretty mutual even though i still love(d) him.\n  \n  this doesn't take into account the people who have broken my heart without us even dating, though, lol. i've had infatuations with plenty of people who weren't interested in dating me, and i'm sure it was also vice versa.\n  ","390514":"\n  back in the day, married couples would stay together because there was such a stigma associated with divorce, and they would be 100% unhappy in their relationship but continue to stay married because they didn't want to be viewed as a divorcee.\n  \n  these days, it's much more common to see married couples get divorced because there's so much less of a stigma, and people are standing up for themselves and their own worth in their marriage when they're being treated unfairly.\n  ","390515":"\n  my own self-motivation to succeed in the things i do, especially with respect to my job. also, iced coffee in the morning motivates me to get out of bed in the first place, lol.\n  ","390516":"\n  it should be mandatory, and i'm glad that businesses can refuse to serve customers if they walk in without wearing a mask. wearing a mask protects yourself and other people from spreading or contracting COVID, and it's ridiculous how there are so many anti-mask people wandering around.\n  \n  there are literally no downsides to wearing a mask for the 15-30 minutes you're in the grocery store. surgeons and other health professionals wear surgical masks all day long. people need to listen to health workers instead of reading a stupid post on the internet validating their wrong opinions.\n  ","390517":"\n

has never been therapeutic, lmaoo.\n  ","390521":"\n  i haven't done much today at all. i had breakfast, had a phone appointment with my psychiatrist, and then the counseling center called me and told

\n","390527":"\n  none of y'all are licensed psychotherapists ... it isn't the same.\n  ","390528":"\n  the counseling center just called me, and they found a therapist for me that fits into my schedule !! :'))\n  \n  they're emailing me the paperwork, and my first appointment with her is next monday. i'm excited but also nervous. i'm going to have a lot to unload on her, lmaoo.\n  ","390529":"\n  uneventful so far. the only things i've done are order breakfast and do my telephone appointment with my psychiatrist.\n  ","390530":"\n  lol, yes. i'm not going to elaborate on it, though.\n  ","390531":"\n  no, i haven't seen friends other than my two roommates since july 4th. prior to that, i don't even remember when i last saw a friend.\n  ","390532":"\n  idk, most of the daring things i've done or have done with other people were actually really reckless and dangerous, lol. it felt thrilling in the moment, like i was truly alive and nothing could hurt me.\n  ","390533":"\n  i ordered breakfast through grubhub this morning, and in the instructions, it says to leave the food on the stoop and then text me. instead, this delivery driver f*cking pounds on the front door, even though we HAVE A DOORBELL.\n  \n  like ... what. it scared the crap out of me.\n  ","390534":"\n  i have absolutely no clue about any of that, so i can't comment. i wouldn't want to comment on it even if i knew what you were talking about, because sending people's names around and asking for opinions on *their* opinions is silly and childish anyway.\n  ","390535":"\n  some drama is entertaining, yes. sometimes i find myself scrolling through the comments of people's posts on facebook if they're arguing, lmaoo.\n  ","390536":"\n  i'm both, haha. i'm very impulsive and spontaneous, and i don't generally make plans ahead of time. at the same time, i'm also organized -- particularly in my work space. i'm also cleaning often because i like the house looking spacious and organized.\n  ","390537":"\n  white pizza with spinach and ricotta. if i'm not in the mood for that, then i usually order caprese pizza (fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, and balsamic glaze).\n  ","390538":"\n  i'm not a fan of sweets, but oatmeal cookies are delicious.\n  ","390539":"\n  i have two roommates. it would be weird to pick a favorite, because they're people ... not objects. they're both good people.\n  ","390540":"\n  the emotional neglect i experienced in childhood contributed to my intense fear of abandonment as an adult.\n  ","390541":"\n  the weeknd, even though i only know a few songs of his.\n  ","390542":"\n  i mean, sure? if you're interested in reading, then it's beneficial mentally to read various books because not only does it increase your vocabulary and creativity, but it's also a valuable way of spending spare time.\n  ","390543":"\n  alcohol, nicotine, listening to music, and reading.\n  ","390544":"\n  happy sunday ~~\n  \n  i just had a telephone appointment with my psychiatrist, and in light of my increased stress and anxiety, she upped the dosage of my xanax and strongly urged me to seek out therapy.\n  \n  so ... that's how my day is going.\n  ","390545":"\n  it's currently 88 degrees fahrenheit where i live.\n  ","390546":"\n  yeah, but not by a police officer ... lmao.\n  ","390547":"\n  dunkin ; large iced coffee with skim milk, vanilla swirl, and a shot of espresso.\n  \n  starbucks ; venti cold brew with sugar-free vanilla syrup and soy milk.\n  \n  bagel store\/deli ; large iced coffee with vanilla creamer.\n  ","390548":"\n  stable mental health. :'))\n  ","390549":"\n  new zealand, iceland, italy, spain, russia, and greece.\n  ","390550":"\n  i've been reading a book about ab*sive\/toxic parents, and it just resonates with me a lot and has been making me emotional.\n  ","390551":"\n  that sounds very tranquil, haha. i wish i could do that where i live.\n  ","390552":"\n  i once saw the constellations when i took a vacation to upstate new york a few years ago, it was life-changing and absolutely marvelous.\n  ","390553":"\n  unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to see the stars where i live because of light pollution, lol.\n  ","390554":"\n  cease and desist. it basically means that it's a legal action taken against someone who's doing illegal activity and threatening to sue them if they don't stop.\n  \n  since linkin park issued it, twitter deleted the tweet that trump posted showcasing the video with their music.\n  ","390555":"\n  linkin park tweeted that they issued a C&D, and now the video is deleted off of trump's twitter account !! yes !!\n  ","390556":"\n  my roommate made spaghetti and meatballs two weeks ago for dinner, lol. it's always been a favorite dish of mine, especially with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.\n  ","390557":"\n  considering i was emotionally & physically ab*sed for 15-plus years and i still feel the effects of their ab*se in my adult life, yeah.\n  \n  i'm on page 64 and i've cried already. it's difficult acknowledging things, but in light of what's been going on with my parents lately, i felt like i needed to finally read this book.\n  ","390558":"\n  i'm starting to read this book, and i'm only on page 9 of the introduction & i'm already tearing up, lmao fuck.\n  ","390559":"\n  it does, LOL.\n  ","390560":"\n  i think it would deteriorate, because the majority of my social interaction is done online.\n  ","390561":"\n  i prefer the former.\n  ","390562":"\n  no, they're not targeted to aid in sleep or anything. i have valerian root in case i do need help with sleeping, but i only take that when i feel as if i can't sleep.\n  ","390563":"\n  this defines more than half of my friendships, unfortunately. i feel as if i'm *always* the one reaching out to see how a friend is doing or to hang out. i've never brought it up in conversation before because i don't really want to give off the impression that i'm clingy or anything, and i also don't want to lose them as a friend. :\/\n  ","390564":"\n  thankfully, i don't have problems with sleeping. the worst that has ever happened is waking up throughout the night every few hours, but that only happens on the rare occasion.\n  ","390565":"\n  i use profanity a lot, but other than that, i'm not a vulgar person.\n  ","390566":"\n  usually, yes -- both in a platonic and romantic fashion. i try to express my love and gratitude on a regular basis.\n  ","390567":"\n  it doesn't sway me either way, tbh. i don't have a desire to see one, but i'm not against it either.\n  ","390568":"\n  i've never really listened to it before, and i've never been to an opera before. so i honestly don't know.\n  ","390569":"\n  yeah, i would get plastic surgery in a heartbeat, lol. i would have a neck lift surgery to make my jawline more prominent.\n  ","390570":"\n  yes, saturdays and sundays are my days off from work.\n  ","390571":"\n  i don't think there is? trump has done this *multiple* times in the past regarding using artists' songs, and then the artist being like, \"hey, don't use my song because i don't support you.\" i'm not entirely sure how it works.\n  \n  chester can't, but the rest of linkin park can. mike shinoda in particular, i'm sure he's going to speak up on it eventually.\n  "}}
