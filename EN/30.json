you so much ! happy birthday america ! independence day was amazing ! ? ? ? ? ? ?","27803":"i would never want to do this . the amount of research that i have done on possession and negative entities i would never want this to happen to anyone . it is truly a horrific event","27804":"i find salmon kind of exotic i don t know why . i find sushi kind of exotic . calamari . fried frog legs . certain types of seafoods . alligator .","27805":"just depends . we actually haven t really ate in at a restaurant and probably four or five months now because of coronavirus . if i go into a mess i have to personally clean now my entire booth or table and spray around it and they re not going to let me do that probably so i m not going to eat there because i m not about to take the risk of getting sick because they re not cleaning their tables correctly . i do not go into restaurants that i have too many people . if there s not a lot of people like maybe people if that that i will go in but i honestly haven t got the opportunity because every time i have went to one there has been more than people . so no i have not been eating at restaurants since coronavirus but we have been ordering takeout . but not often because we re still trying to be careful . i m used to cooking so it s not really that big of a deal . so i do miss some of my restaurant food but it s not honestly a big deal . i can live without it . it s not the end of the world .","27806":"finger sandwiches . chicken salad . some sort of a soup and bread . bbq . vegetable trays or maybe fruit trays . cheese and crackers just depends","27807":"me and my husband would love to buy the house of our dreams for our future family","27808":"i like onions and ham","27809":"throughout my life i ve had many cats and dogs part of the family pets right now with my husband we own two pit bulls and we have a roommate with a chihuahua . we want to get a cat and one more dog . but we re not getting another dog unless our roommate moved out . and we re not getting a cat too until then","27810":"you re welcome . making these types of things from scratch taking lot of work practice and technique . usually you have to grow up in the culture to be able to do things like that but it s definitely possible to learn . but you need to be around people that know how to make it and watch very closely . but making gumbo from scratch can be a little tedious . so that s why i recommend the boxes with the directions on the back because they may not taste the best but they are pretty close . plus making the homemade ones could take a lot and cost a lot of money . but yeah i most definitely recommend those kinds of things . also crawfish fettuccine or shrimp fettuccine are really good cajun dishes to make that aren t that hard to make . crawfish bisque is a little hard to make but that s another recipe and the south that we make . just a few more .","27811":"i have already answered this question . i do this for work","27812":"i like some old rock and i like some new rock . i don t mind either","27813":"i m doing great . thanks for asking","27814":"i already answered this question","27815":"for more than half of my life i volunteer to feed the poor and help people that had nothing . and i just did it because i wanted to help . if i could do it again i would but i m nowhere near the bank that i used to work at . i might be looking into getting into a bank nearby . and a bank i mean a food bank","27816":"this isn t a complete sentence so i m not sure exactly what you were asking . are you asking me what is the most spiciest food i ve ever had ? i ve had hundreds of different types of extremely spicy foods . we had a crawfish boil with extremely spicy boiled in the food . different types of foods in cajun dishes with high bernero ghost pepper or carolina reaper in them sometimes . it just depends . louisiana peppers are pretty darn delicious but can be a little hot sometimes but there is really good with different types of recipes","27817":"jambalaya is really simple to make . and you don t always have to make it really spicy . you can look up really simple recipes online and you can also get the boxes that have the directions on the back deliver to your house . on jambalaya is a meat or to rice water and seasoning . that s a simplified jambalaya . gumbo is also really easy to make . it s almost just like jambalaya but at the same time it s not . it s a meat or two for seasoning and is has more like a soup . you can also look up small simplified recipes for gumbo . you can also get the boxes sent to your house with the directions on the back . sides with gumbo are usually potato salad and rolls . potato salad is really easy to make it s just potatoes boiled until they re done . eggs boiled until they re done . you peel the eggs you peel the potatoes you mash them up a little bit and then you add mayonnaise and mustard until it tastes correct and the way that you wanted to be tasting . you add more mayonnaise and mustard . mustard is really for color . you add salt and pepper and you can have pickles onions and whatever else you want the potato salad . potato salad is not exactly a salad . we just call it that it s a salad of its own out of potatoes and eggs . it s good with black eyed peas with the gumbo and with the rolls . you can look up potato salad recipes online . when i make the black eyed peas i usually add bacon to them for flavor . homemade chocolate pies are awesome and so are sweet potato pies . you can also add cinnamon to sweet potato pie . you can look up homemade recipes online . this is just a few southern recipes and ideas . it s all about technique . taste your food while you are cooking it . when you re making the gummo the rice is separate . when you re making the jambalaya the rice is in it","27818":"us out here in mississippi and louisiana we hunt and fish . so it honestly wouldn t affect me near to none . i would probably start growing more crops and would probably plant some more fruit trees in the yard and bushes . i would probably get livestock and grow . i would probably start a small farm . it wouldn t affect me really near to none . and if we couldn t get certain supplies i would build them and have substitutes for things . sometimes you just got to appreciate what you got .","27819":"maybe the s or s possibly","27820":"i really enjoy riding bikes . two years of my life when i lived in louisiana where i live everything was around me and i could travel just a mile or two to get to where i needed to . i lived in a small town where there were tons of stores surrounding where i lived at in my home . so i used a bike as my transportation for almost two years straight . after i moved i m not able to do that now because i live out in the countryside where there are lots of wild animals it is scorching hot and it could be quite dangerous riding your bike near a highway because people actually tried to hit people here but that was one source of exercise was my everyday transportation of riding my bike . i also like to walk jog lift weights and play many different types of sports . i also try to watch my way of eating and how much i eat and what time i eat at .","27821":"people use cinnamon as a way of a spice considering it is a spice but to make something hot more or less . and i guess that s not a problem . me personally i m allergic to cinnamon and cannot have any of it at all so cinnamon and chili yes or no i say no but to someone that likes cinnamon and can eat cinnamon ? i don t feel like that s crazy at all . but i m not sure how much you should put . eating too much cinnamon can really make anyone sick and can overthrow the flavor of things . so just be aware of how much you put in there of course . because you don t want it just tastes like cinnamon right ? you want to taste the chili . and you don t want to end up in the bathroom for the rest of the day","27822":"they have oreo biscuits ? . just sounds strange unless you re referring biscuit as a cookie ? but doesn t usa we usually refer cookies to just cookies . that s where the confusion comes in at . i had to think this answer and question because biscuits in the usa is actually baked bread . a breakfast circle biscuit type thing . usually you would add jelly or butter to . or eating meat on as a sandwich in the morning such a sausage bacon or ham with cheese egg or whatever you choose . so that s where the confusion came in . i forget that sometimes people refer biscuits to cookies . but i most definitely love oreos they re really good .","27823":"thanks !","27824":"gooood","27825":"biotin and really any vitamins b c and d and e are good for hair growth . but before taking vitamins i will discuss with your doctor before doing because some vitamins are not healthy for certain humans because the body naturally gets those vitamins . or you could be on a type of medication that does not mix with the type of vitamin . so just check with your doctor before taking certain vitamins . taking too much of a vitamin can really mess up your body . getting your hair trimmed at least every three months is really good for hair growth . eating the right foods for hair growth is really a good way of going don t wash your hair every single day . more strain on your care of makes more hair come out . don t brush your hair still hard be very careful when you brush your hair . try to let your hair air dry . don t use a hair dryer or straightener is all the time . warm to cold showers are really good on the hair . and more .","27826":"i already do this for work","27827":"i don t have this autocorrect feature with my phone sadly","27828":"sure . yeah","27829":"the last gift i got my mom for mother s day . kind of for her birthday too . i got her a ginseng bonsai tree and a giant chocolate covered fortune cookie with a message inside of it . me and my husband got that for her . we almost got her a magnolia tree but decided not to . i think i m going to get her that next time . not sure . because they re really big and you have to have a really big yard and their yard is a little small .","27830":"yes . i do . but ever since we ve had to wear these stupid masks i can t really do that","27831":"just my coworkers are goofy . they really make my day sometimes .","27832":"i love collecting different types of rocks and different types of currency from different countries . i find things like this really cool . i also like to collect different types of documents and just really old antique items from any era and any country . i love going flea market shopping and antique shopping . because you never know what you re going to find . garage sales can be really good hot spots to for things like this . if you ever been on a storage container sometimes these things can be hot spots to old money old documents and old antique items . especially things that are worth a lot of money if you re looking for money . bid on a storage container and you could make thousands of dollars only buying it for maybe a grande . a good way to finance your money and make more . i enjoy collecting zippo lighters . half . different types of really cool mardi gras and beads . i like to collect card . like decks of cards . and then i collect different types of temporary tattoos and bracelets . i collect more than just this but this is just a few things that i like to collect .","27833":"i didn t really learn anything in quarantine . in or out of quarantine i knew the same recipes . everything that i did in quarantine i did before . nothing really changed from this covid quarantine except for the fact that i m not able to travel as much as i used to . i ve always been really ocd and clean about everything . i ve always kept the environment around me clean . i ve always spent time with family and friends . i ve always get things around the house and outside of the house . i ve always cooked . i ve always spent time with my dogs . nothing different","27834":"honestly i m a really cold person so i really don t like to wear jackets in the winter unless it is literally freezing . when it s degrees that s the only time i put a jacket on and i only own two or three jackets . i own a thin hunting jacket . which i usually wear that one because it has holes in it purposely so air can flow through it so i m not completely warm . jackets make me really hot even after a few min . i don t own any of the above i don t own fur coats . i don t own any leather jackets . every now and then i wear my husband high school letter jacket that he got . just because i loved it but it honestly makes me hot after a few minutes so i don t put it on for long . really i don t wear any of the above . i own one or two hoodies and a sleeveless hoodie jacket that still keeps me warm . and then i may be owned one or two other jackets . that s total of maybe five jackets . i don t really use them because i like the cold and i don t like to be warm . unless it s snowing or fahrenheit i don t wear a jacket . and if it s raining . if it s pouring i ll put a jacket on . but only to protect myself from getting drenched","27835":"monroe louisiana ? no . i lived more close to the bottom of louisiana . monroe is located more near the top of louisiana . which you would be surprised of how northern the top of louisiana is compared to the bottom of louisiana . but now i am from around located more near the top of louisiana . which you would be surprised of how northern the top of louisiana is compared to the bottom of louisiana . i m more near the baton rouge new orleans side of louisiana . the bayou bottom . duck dynasty is a pretty good show .","27836":"yesss i love the smell . snowing is such a gift of a sense in life . people definitely take this for granted because some people cannot smell . and i just don t know what i would do if i couldn t smell . i love the smell of some fresh flowers . walking into a greenhouse is probably the most satisfying smell ever because it s just the smell of just nature and beauty . i love the smell of some fresh baked goods and cajun food . especially some boiled crawfish or crabs or even shrimp or all of this together . i love a new car smell or a new controller or a new pair of shoes . all of these smells are wonderful . i love countryside snow . fresh cut grass and mud and rain can smell so good sometimes . i like different types of perfume smells . i also like the smell of vegetables cooking down in a pan . i also love citrus smells and different types of fruits . sweet smells and very smells especially raspberry smells . sweet pea and violet . cucumber fresh smells . the most definitely . i can be comforted by smell .","27837":"cajun is my fav . then i really love mexican food and chinese food . and then i also like italian food and indian food .","27838":"my passion in life for the things that i love and do and the people that i love . my ambition . my determination .","27839":"honestly in south usa we don t do any of the above . we might do the lemon with the tea but that s it and we might do a honey with the tea if that . . we don t put milk and stuff in our tea or not at least from what i know of . we usually make sweet tea . some people put sugar some people put sugar and honey some people add lemon it just depends but this is usually the only kinds of teas i have ever heard down here and green tea .","27840":"sure","27841":"nice i love

unavailable . just cause it is just unavailable .","28520":"i really honestly like to throw a type of sauce together with many different types of things . say for instance i m making a spaghetti right okay . . . but i will chop up tomatoes or get me a can of tomatoes and a can of tomato paste and will create my sauce . out it together . or you can just simply get you a can of already ready tomato sauce from your local grocery . they have that too and that can save you time if you don t want to make home made . ragu . the traditional one or the meat added one . but i will just get some tomatoes and smash them down and even make my own . you just have to adjust it with salt , garlic , italian seasonings , maybe even some of the minced garlic more or less . onions different spices and other sauces . just things like that to make and shape your own homemade spaghetti sauce . i think honestly making your own homemade is the best because you can make it taste the way you want . you can make the sauce more tangy or maybe more sweet or maybe strong tasting or spicy . when you re making your own homemade , you need to slowly make it and try the food as you go . taste the sauce . if it does not taste good , then add different seasonings to your taste buds to the sauce to make it taste the way that you want . sometimes you have to add more water to make it more liquidy and sometimes you have to add more tomatoes and thick tomato pulp to thicken the sauce more . adding even a slight bit of different types of bbq sauce and sugars can help also make the sauce taste better . but honestly that s just what i do . i like my spaghetti sauce to taste really really good and not be so harsh on your stomach when going down . rather had it more natural than all those canned preservatives in it . ?","28521":"i don t know but i m honestly not really a fan of hot weather . i like winter cold weather . snow . cold . ice . hints ice frozen vocals . i looove the cold .","28522":"isabella star or

we have to be really careful with how we put the garbage out or they won t take it . we have to put it in multiple bags and be very clean about it . which i m fine with . i have always been that way . but we have these giant garbage bins that we put our garbages in . usually when we take the garbage out we gather all of the bags together and put them into another bag and then close that back . to prevent the back from busting and making a mess . but honestly the bags are really heavy and we bring them to the road and sometimes we accumulate anywhere from three to seven bags just depending on what s going on that week . sometimes we have family over and we took and sometimes we get out in the yard and do yard work . plus lately we have been doing work on our house so we have more garbage

just you know inside that you did your best and helped . not everyone is going to appreciate everything you do is sometimes you have to do some bite the bullet and go on . sometimes you just need to

up to your bully . i know some people say that that isn t the way , but it really is ? i mean . . . you can t do it in a weak , stupid way . but beat them with the facts . with kindness and stand up to them . don t give them any information about yourself . they don t know you and don t need to know you . don t feed into their hate . they want you to give them attention . they are bored . that is why they are bothering you . you are giving them something what they want . you are putting a show on for them . your entertaining them . something . just tell them to screw off once and be serious . then move on . don t look at them . nothing . ignore . get away from them . if they touch you . you turn at them and look at them as serious as possible and tell them to not touch you and then if they keep touching you or hurting you . you teach them back how it feels to not want to be touched and defend yourself . and if they i want to start tattle telling and asking questions to why you touch them back . . . well then you tell them . . . well how do you like being touched when you don t want to be ? that s what you kept doing to me ? so i did it back . leave me alone . as i said before . and do not touch me . and if they do it again . stand up for yourself fully . and you know what i mean . they keep touching you . physically defend yourself . i don t really recommend tattle tailing but i would definitely show signs of you not wanting them to touch you and you . warnings . but at the same time you just want to walk away move on and ignore them . when you do that that s you showing that you re not feeding into them and you don t care but if they really start to touch you and stuff that is crossing the line . people should keep their hands to yourselves . there is absolutely no reason for them to have to put their hands on you . they touch st . say no . and keep . then you need to show that you don t want to be touched . defend yourself"}}
