It's just surprising on how they treat other people that you know what I mean are difficult or something maybe more? But honestly they were all like that. So if I was to file a complaint honestly I think that they would all gang up and say that they didn't do anything wrong and that I was just crazy or something. LOL it didn't make any sense at all. But yeah. They most definitely were not doing me right. And I'm sure I had other clients that were there that could have vouched for me. I just wanted to get away from them. But yeah I was kind of young when this happened so I guess I never thought about reporting them. I'm sure that they got fired soon after there's no way they didn't.

Makes you feel free and that you're exploring. Not so much stress. Of course pack anything and everything because you might do anything and everything. But sometimes some of those kinds of trips are the best in my thoughts. Say for instance you start in Louisiana and you just go up to Michigan from Louisiana to Michigan and just do all kinds of things from that point to the other point.

All I know is when I do go to a doctor I tell them about my past experiences before they do it so they understand why I get really massively upset when they are taking blood from me. I let them know that I was harassed once. I let them know that I was felt uncomfortable before. I let them know all of the past events that happened to me last time I had it happen. But yeah. I don't appreciate people using us as guinea pigs especially if they don't ask. If they want to use me as a guinea pig asked me. Most of the time I don't care and I'll let you do it.

I'm not more or less scared of myself dying I just don't like losing people and seeing the people that I love and just people getting hurt. Such as people just having people inflict pain on them murder or more. If you know what I mean there. The only reason why I freak out when I get blood taken from me is because it makes me feel really bad. My body does not like having blood taken from it at all. It naturally just shuts down when it gets blood taken from it so that's why I don't really like it plus I have bad experiences with doctors not knowing what they were doing. I didn't know that they didn't know what they were doing. I trusted them. They were supposed to be professionals.  This happens once in a blue moon I don't know why. They poked me tons of times not understanding how to do what they were doing. Honestly if they didn't know what they were doing they shouldn't have done it. Been doing it. They traumatized me really bad. They also said a lot of really messed up things to me. They said a lot of really messed up things to me for no reason. I didn't do anything wrong to them to say those things to me. I was so confused. They kept asking me if I had been drinking? Which I hadn't been? I was terrified and confused and feeling weak because they kept poking me and taking so much blood from me... ? and made me feel really bad. Both physically and mentally.

If I go into a mess I have to personally clean now my entire Booth or table and spray around it and they're not going to let me do that probably so I'm not going to eat there because I'm not about to take the risk of getting sick because they're not cleaning their tables correctly. I do not go into restaurants that I have too many people. If there's not a lot of people like maybe 10 people if that that I will go in but I honestly haven't got the opportunity because every time I have went to one there has been more than 10 people. So no I have not been eating at restaurants since coronavirus but we have been ordering takeout. But not often because we're still trying to be careful. I'm used to cooking so it's not really that big of a deal. So I do Miss some of my restaurant food but it's not honestly a big deal. I can live without it. It's not the end of the world.\n  ","32764":"\n  Finger sandwiches. Chicken salad. Some sort of a soup and bread. BBQ. Vegetable trays or maybe fruit trays.

We want to get a cat and one more dog. But we're not getting another dog unless our roommate moved out. And we're not getting a cat too until then\n  ","32768":"\n  You're welcome. Making these types of things from scratch taking lot of work practice and technique. Usually you have to grow up in the culture to be able to do things like that but it's definitely possible to learn. But you need to be around people that know how to make it and watch very closely.\n  \n  But making Gumbo from scratch can be a little tedious. So that's why I recommend the boxes with the directions on the back because they may not taste 100% the best but they are pretty close. Plus making the homemade ones could take a lot and cost a lot of money.\n  \n  But yeah I most definitely recommend those kinds of things. Also crawfish fettuccine or shrimp fettuccine are really good Cajun dishes to make that aren't that hard to make. Crawfish bisque is a little hard to make but that's another recipe and the South that we make.\n  \n  Just a few more.\n  ","32769":"\n  I have already answered this question.

And a bank I mean a Food Bank\n  ","32774":"\n  This isn't a complete sentence so I'm not sure exactly what you were asking. Are you asking me what is the most spiciest food I've ever had? I've had hundreds of different types of extremely spicy foods.\n  \n  We had a crawfish boil with extremely spicy boiled in the food. Different types of foods in Cajun dishes with high bernero Ghost Pepper or Carolina Reaper in them sometimes. It just depends.\n  \n  Louisiana peppers are pretty darn delicious but can be a little hot sometimes but there is really good with different types of recipes\n  ","32775":"\n  Jambalaya is really simple to make. And you don't always have to make it really spicy. You can look up really simple recipes online and you can also get the boxes that have the directions on the back deliver to your house. On jambalaya is a meat or to rice water and seasoning. That's a simplified jambalaya.\n  \n  Gumbo is also really easy to make. It's almost just like jambalaya but at the same time it's not. It's a meat or two for 3 seasoning and is has more like a soup. You can also look up small simplified recipes for gumbo. You can also get the boxes sent to your house with the directions on the back. Sides with gumbo are usually potato salad and rolls. Potato salad is really easy to make it's just potatoes boiled until they're done. Eggs boiled until they're done. You peel the eggs you peel the potatoes you mash them up a little bit and then you add mayonnaise and mustard until it tastes correct and the way that you wanted to be tasting. You add more mayonnaise and mustard. Mustard is really for color. You add salt and pepper and you can have pickles onions and whatever else you want the potato salad. Potato salad is not exactly a salad. We just call it that it's a salad of its own out of potatoes and eggs. It's good with Black Eyed Peas with the gumbo and with the rolls. You can look up potato salad recipes online. When I make the Black Eyed Peas I usually add bacon to them for flavor.\n  \n  Homemade chocolate pies are awesome and so are sweet potato pies. You can also add cinnamon to sweet potato pie. You can look up homemade recipes online.\n  \n  This is just a few Southern recipes and ideas.\n  \n  It's all about technique. Taste your food while you are cooking it.\n  \n  When you're making the gummo the rice is separate. When you're making the jambalaya the rice is in it\n  ","32776":"\n  Us out here in Mississippi and Louisiana we hunt and fish. So it honestly wouldn't affect me near to none. I would probably start growing more crops and would probably plant some more fruit trees in the yard and bushes. I would probably get livestock and grow. I would probably start a small farm. It wouldn't affect me really near to none. And if we couldn't get certain supplies I would build them and have substitutes for things. Sometimes you just got to appreciate what you got.\n  ","32777":"\n  Maybe the 1970s or 80s possibly\n  ","32778":"\n  I really enjoy riding bikes. Two years of my life when I lived in Louisiana where I live everything was around me and I could travel just a mile or two to get to where I needed to. I lived in a small town where there were tons of stores surrounding where I lived at in my home. So I used a bike as my transportation for almost two years straight. After I moved I'm not able to do that now because I live out in the countryside where there are lots of wild animals it is scorching hot and it could be quite dangerous riding your bike near a highway because people actually tried to hit people here but that was one source of exercise was my everyday transportation of riding my bike. I also like to walk jog lift weights and play many different types of sports. I also try to watch my way of eating and how much I eat and what time I eat at.\n  ","32779":"\n  People use cinnamon as a way of a spice considering it is a spice but to make something hot more or less. And I guess that's not a problem. Me personally I'm allergic to cinnamon and cannot have any of it at all so cinnamon and chili yes or no I say no\n  \n  But to someone that likes cinnamon and can eat cinnamon? I don't feel like that's crazy at all. But I'm not sure how much you should put. Eating too much cinnamon can really make anyone sick and can overthrow the flavor of things. So just be aware of how much you put in there of course. Because you don't want it just tastes like cinnamon right? You want to taste the chili. And you don't want to end up in the bathroom for the rest of the day\n  ","32780":"\n  They have Oreo biscuits?. Just sounds strange\n  \n  Unless you're referring biscuit as a cookie? But doesn't USA we usually refer cookies to just cookies. That's where the confusion comes in at. I had to think this answer and question\n  \n  Because biscuits in the USA is actually baked bread. A breakfast Circle biscuit type thing. Usually you would add jelly or butter to. Or eating meat on as a sandwich in the morning such a sausage bacon or ham with cheese egg or whatever you choose.\n  \n  So that's where the confusion came in.

Or you could be on a type of medication that does not mix with the type of vitamin. So just check with your doctor before taking certain vitamins. Taking too much of a vitamin can really mess up your body.\n  \n  Getting your hair trimmed at least every three months is really good for hair growth.\n  \n  Eating the right foods for hair growth is really a good way of going\n  \n  Don't wash your hair every single day. More strain on your care of makes more hair come out. Don't brush your hair still hard be very careful when you brush your hair. Try to let your hair air-dry.

Because you never know what you're going to find. Garage sales can be really good hot spots to for things like this.\n  \n  If you ever been on a storage container sometimes these things can be hot spots to 4 old money old documents and old antique items. Especially things that are worth a lot of money if you're looking for money. Bid on a storage container and you could make thousands of dollars only buying it for maybe a grande. A good way to finance your money and make more.\n  \n  I enjoy collecting Zippo lighters. Half. Different types of really cool Mardi Gras and Beads. I like to collect card. Like decks of cards. And then I collect different types of temporary tattoos and bracelets. I collect more than just this but this is just a few things that I like to collect.\n  ","32791":"\n  I didn't really learn anything in quarantine. In or out of quarantine I knew the same recipes. Everything that I did in quarantine I did before. Nothing really changed from this covid-19 quarantine except for the fact that I'm not able to travel as much as I used to. I've always been really OCD and clean about everything. I've always kept the environment around me clean. I've always spent time with family and friends.

When it's 20 degrees that's the only time I put a jacket on and I only own two or three jackets. I own a thin hunting jacket. Which I usually wear that one because it has holes in it purposely so air can flow through it so I'm not completely warm. Jackets make me really hot even after a few min.\n  \n  I don't own any of the above I don't own fur coats. I don't own any leather jackets. Every now and then I wear my husband High School letter jacket that he got. Just because I loved it but it honestly makes me hot after a few minutes so I don't put it on for long. Really I don't wear any of the above. I own one or two hoodies and a sleeveless hoodie jacket that still keeps me warm. And then I may be owned one or two other jackets. That's total of maybe five jackets. I don't really use them because I like the cold and I don't like to be warm. Unless it's snowing or 20\u00b0 Fahrenheit I don't wear a jacket.\n  \n  And if it's raining. If it's pouring I'll put a jacket on.

People definitely take this for granted because some people cannot smell. And I just don't know what I would do if I couldn't smell. I love the smell of some fresh flowers. Walking into a greenhouse is probably the most satisfying smell ever because it's just the smell of just nature and beauty.\n  \n  I love the smell of some fresh baked goods and Cajun food. Especially some boiled crawfish or crabs or even shrimp or all of this together.\n  \n  I love a new car smell or a new controller or a new pair of shoes.
