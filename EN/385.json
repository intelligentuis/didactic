thought about giving them a call, but i thought about it and didn't really want to screw up the medication regimen i already have because idk if that experimental medication would even work for me to begin with.\n  ","413125":"\n  my day was quite productive !! my supervisor allowed me to take control of the fulfillment aspects of the program i'm administrating, so i spent about two hours

don't really have any thoughts on the matter because i don't know the person you're talking about. however, being a parent requires a certain degree of instinct where you feel a natural inclination toward caring for a child, and if someone doesn't feel that instinct or express empathy toward others, then they may not be suitable for parenthood.\n  \n  at the same time, however, parenthood *does* change people into more expressive, sensitive individuals sometimes. they develop a natural bond with their baby and it becomes natural from there. so it goes on an entirely individualized basis.\n

forgets a conversation.\n  ","413132":"\n  about a month ago. i was debating on distancing myself from a friend, but then he really did something that disappointed me and my boyfriend, so i decided to completely cut ties with this friend. he had been doing some pretty sh*tty things for a while, and every time we brought them up to him, he wouldn't try to better himself or alter his behavior. but after what happened about a month ago, it solidified my decision.\n  ","413133":"\n  i usually watch documentaries and docu-series about serial k*llers, true crime, m*rderers, etc etc. it's always been really interesting to me.\n  \n  other than that, i've been watching \"the world's worst disasters\" the past two days, and it's very informative. it describes some of the most terrible and disastrous natural disasters that have occurred on earth and it explains why it happened.\n  ","413134":"\n  idk, i don't really have any new hobbies. my hobbies have been the same for as long as i can remember (reading, writing, video games, photography, painting, etc etc).\n  ","413135":"\n  i worked for the majority of the day. when i got home, i called my boyfriend, ate dinner, answered some questions on my laptop to clear my inbox, and put on some netflix.\n  \n  now i'm laying in bed, haha.\n  ","413136":"\n  no, not at all. i seldom go out on the weekends because not only are bars & restaurants crowded, but the roads are too. i usually stay inside on the weekends.\n  ","413137":"\n  both, depending on my mood. sometimes i like to plan things because it allows me to look forward to something, but it's also an issue for me because idk how i would feel when the time comes.\n  \n  at the same time, i like being spontaneous because i can easily text a friend and ask what they're doing in a few hours and go from there. at that point, i know that i want to do something, but at the same time, i also become disappointed if no one is available, lol.\n  ","413138":"\n  i've never watched any of the star wars movies.\n  ","413139":"\n  no, haha. i don't really seek out new friends or have the opportunities to find new friends, which is perfectly fine by me. i only really see two people on a semi-regular basis, and then i have three coworkers who i take breaks with every day.\n  ","413140":"\n  yeah, but i usually prefer them in documentaries or docu-series. right now, i'm watching \"the world's worst disasters\" on netflix. it's basically about all of the tragic environmental disasters that have happened within the last 120 years or so, i.e. volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, tsunamis, and earthquakes. it's really interesting and informative.\n  ","413141":"\n  i don't really care so much to be up to date with new technology, but i do prefer streaming services like netflix & hulu over owning dvds. blu-rays go for $20-30 each, but you can pay $12-15 per month for a subscription service and watch whatever they offer as many times as you want.\n  \n  there are some movies that i want to see that aren't offered in subscription services, but i can always rent them on demand for like $5 instead of going out and buying the dvd without knowing if i'll like the movie or not.\n  ","413142":"\n  i only had one internship, but it was for social media marketing at a technology company. i basically took care of all of their social media accounts, updated them accordingly, and they also had me designing graphics for them too, even though i has no formal training, lol.\n  \n  i needed an internship for credits and to graduate, so i was only there three days a week during the summer. it wasn't terrible, but it made me realize that i wanted to be more hands on with actual writing and proofreading.\n  ","413143":"\n  uh, don't put off the advanced oral communications class (if you have to take one) as much as i did -- i was so afraid to take that class that i ended up putting it off until my final semester, even though i needed the class to graduate, lmao. it's better to take it early and get it out of the way, especially on top of the stress of every other advanced class you have to take as a senior.\n  \n  also, try finding an internship !! communications is a great field because it's versatile so you can find anything from social media marketing to business management to writing & publishing, etc etc. my advisor helped find me one, so you can probably inquire within your department. internships are wonderful for your resume.\n  ","413144":"\n  \u2727 my favorite video games are skyrim, fallout 4, destiny 2, assassin's creed, and the bioshock series.\n  \n  \u2727 i have a bachelor's degree in communications\/professional writing with a minor in english literature.\n  \n  \u2727 i've been in a relationship for nearly 10 years.\n  \n  \u2727 i currently work as a writer and editor for a publishing company.\n  \n  \u2727 i'm a strong mental health advocate and i try to take advantage of my ability to write well to raise awareness of mental health issues & erase stigma.\n  ","413145":"\n  yeah, i sing along to most songs that i listen to on the drive home from work. it destresses me after the day.\n  ","413146":"\n  i've never been to a party where i had to decorate before, lol.\n  ","413147":"\n  yeah, i believe it's very helpful. presentations, especially oral presentations, help prepare students for moments in their professional lives where they'll have to speak in front of a group of people, especially if they become part of a management team.\n  ","413148":"\n  i want to go to bed, but it's only 8:00pm, lmao.\n  ","413149":"\n  we have the same taste in music for the most part, but he listens to more hip hop than i do. i've never really disliked a song he has shown me, though !!\n  ","413150":"\n  anyone have any questions ?? my inbox is empty ~~\n  ","413151":"\n  my day has been going well so far, actually !! i had a pretty decent and productive day at work, where my supervisor trained me on some new programs and materials since i'm officially the administrator of the newsletter program now. :'))\n  \n  after work, i treated myself with taco bell & i've basically been listening to music and answering questions ever since.\n  ","413152":"\n\n   @poetalunam\n  \n  .\n  ","413153":"\n  yes, i have instagram. my account is private, though -- i only accept requests from people i know.\n  ","413154":"\n  geoff ramsey, barbara dunkelman, and jeremy dooley.\n  ","413155":"\n  i think body positivity is for everyone, because everyone has their own struggles regarding their bodies and their own self image in general, regardless of how conventionally attractive they are.\n  \n  however, i do believe there's a distinct difference between promoting body positivity and the whole \"fat acceptance\" movement. obviously it's good to be positive about your body, but if you're obese, then that's a health concern that needs to be addressed, whether it's through eating healthier food, exercising, taking supplements, etc etc. some people are disillusioned when it comes to obesity because of the body positivity movement, but good health is something we all should strive towards.\n  ","413156":"\n  i prefer savoury foods, as i don't like sweet foods all that much. i would rather have a hot meal as opposed to something like candy, or a bag of salty chips instead of a box of chocolate.\n  ","413157":"\n  chewing with their mouth open is probably one of the most irritating things other people can do around me.\n  ","413158":"\n  i'm not entirely sure tbh, LOL. if my life depended on it, then perhaps i would have literally no choice, but i can't imagine trying certain insects now without having a massive panic attack about it or puking it up immediately.\n  ","413159":"\n  good hygiene is very important to me, but at the same time, it isn't really my business because it would only matter to me in a relationship context & i'm already dating someone.\n  \n  i have a friend who smells like BO sometimes, but it doesn't really bother me anymore because she's always been that way, lol. however, there was a coworker who used to work at my job whose clothes smelled like they were never washed, so the people who sat next to her actually put a complaint in to HR.\n  ","413160":"\n  i don't have a concrete personality, so my sense of humor and verbiage and interests generally change depending on who i'm with. i *think* the person i'm most like myself around is my boyfriend, but i also adopt his habits as well, so who knows for sure.\n  ","413161":"\n  i don't have a \"true\" self, so there's really no deception involved. if i had a true sense of self, then i would simply act the way i naturally am. but because i never developed a real identity, my personality constantly changes depending on who i'm around.\n  ","413162":"\n  i can dance, but that doesn't exactly mean i can dance well. lmao.\n  ","413163":"\n  no, not at all. i find the silent treatment to be extremely childish. when i have to recoup and walk away from a fight, then i'll usually indicate to the other person that i need some time to myself before we can continue the discussion so that i can collect my thoughts.\n  ","413164":"\n  i don't really *love* food in that respect, but i was craving taco bell tonight, so i impulsively stopped at the local taco bell and bought a veggie power burrito.\n  \n  i only usually have fast food once per month or so, though, so it isn't really something that i can't get enough of.\n  ","413165":"\n  it depends on how you actually felt when you were drinking, lol. you can throw up after one drink, it doesn't necessarily mean you were drunk. it just means the alcohol didn't mix well in your body. i've vomited after having two drinks before even though i wasn't drunk at all, it just didn't sit well in my stomach at the time.\n  ","413166":"\n  i know people with high IQs, but i don't know if that would classify them as a genius or not.\n  ","413167":"\n  i would rather my shirts be two sizes too big. i wear looser clothing as it is, so it wouldn't be too far of a stretch for me. i also dislike the way my body looks in tight clothing, so wearing a shirt too small would make me feel very self conscious.\n  ","413168":"\n  my text messages have my friends' and boyfriend's first & last names, as well as pictures, so i won't post personal information like that on askfm.\n  ","413169":"\n  yes, i usually need some sort of cool off period before i can resume the conversation, otherwise i may act out of impulse and say things in the heat of the moment that i don't necessarily mean. or i end up bursting into tears and remain a blubbering mess, where i can't even hold a conversation at all.\n  ","413170":"\n  i was tipsy last saturday, but i wouldn't really classify it as being drunk. other than that, the last time i was actually drunk was two weeks ago when i went to the bar with a friend.\n  ","413171":"\n  i'm decent at saving money -- i buy groceries and bring lunch from home to work instead of buying lunch every day, and the only thing i really splurge on is coffee every morning (i usually go to starbucks or dunkin).\n  \n  i also transfer money into my savings account every month or so, so that i can build it up instead of letting it remain stagnant.\n  ","413172":"\n  any of the times my boyfriend and i went upstate on vacation together were the happiest memories. it felt nice to have the entire day to ourselves, where we could eat whenever we wanted, talk a walk through the woods, lay down in the grass at the lake, etc etc.\n  \n  here's a photo of the wooded area upstate where we frequent ;\n  ","413173":"\n  tbh i wish it was easier for me to get out of bed in the morning, lol. it usually takes me 30-45 minutes to finally crawl out of bed, which is absolutely terrible. no matter how much i sleep throughout the night, i can never wake up by 7:00am.\n  ","413174":"\n  my boss said she was going to fill out the employee review sheet this week to get me promoted and earn a raise !! :'))\n  ","413175":"\n  with any sort of relationship, platonic or romantic, there should be loyalty and respect between everyone involved. that includes lines that people shouldn't cross, which varies from person to person. a person is free to do what they want within a certain boundary, i.e. if a couple is monogamous then it's crossing a line if someone is sleeping with somebody else.\n  \n  however, it's permissable to a point -- if one partner is preventing their significant other from doing things like dressing how they want or going out with their friends, then that's controlling and manipulative behavior.\n  ","413176":"\n  how would that make me a hypocrite ??\n  ","413177":"\n  i drink sometimes because it relaxes my nerves, but i also drink more to get tipsy (not drunk).\n  ","413178":"\n  it's a locally brewed IPA. my boyfriend's father brought it back for me when he went out east this weekend, haha. it's a 7.2% beer so it's pretty heavy though.\n  ","413179":"\n  ask me questions, friends !! i have a full can of beer & an empty inbox ~~\n  ","413180":"\n  any time my boyfriend & i go on vacation together is the best day of my life, lol. specific moments, however, were when we went upstate together and spent the day relaxing, wandering the woods, and spending time at the lake. and also when we went to montauk together and relaxed in the hotel room (which had a balcony!) and spent the day finding cute shops and restaurants, and we hit the local brewery during the day as well.\n  ","413181":"\n  i really have no idea how to answer this question because my personality changes depending on who i'm with, lmao.\n  ","413182":"\n  i would personally say \"i'm down for anything,\" but it varies depending on the person and perhaps even their regional dialect.\n  ","413183":"\n  i really enjoy baroque, renaissance, and neoclassical art. i find that the styles and movement are so beautiful and captivating, and the more you look at them, the more you discover.\n  ","413184":"\n  i've never really been the type of person to give into dares, because i've never felt pressured to do something by someone just daring me to do it. if i wanted to do something then i would, and if i was uncomfortable with doing something, then i wouldn't do it.\n  ","413185":"\n  i have over 18,000 coins, so perhaps i might be able to put down a down payment on a house, haha.\n  ","413186":"\n  YES. this happens to me a lot with random memes on facebook or twitter that are like, \"you were alive in the 90s if you remember this show,\" and it's a screenshot of a really old children's show. it brings back vague memories because it feels so familiar, and it's so bizarre.\n  ","413187":"\n  i enjoy making my loved ones (i.e. my friends, boyfriend, and a few coworkers) happy. most of the time, i couldn't care less about what a random stranger thinks.\n  \n  in addition, men in bars are looking for a fling & i'm not going to entertain any notion by inviting them for conversation. i shut it down before it even begins.\n  ","413188":"\n  i'm extremely empathetic toward the people i care about and i'll do anything in my power to help a loved one. i genuinely enjoy making other people happy.\n  ","413189":"\n  i have no desire to do that. i'd rather just go to the store and pick up a six-pack.\n  ","413190":"\n  i'm not entirely sure -- would it be too self-centered to assume that it may be because i enjoy talking about myself & my feelings ?? haha.\n  ","413191":"\n  yeah, i drink beer any time i go out to the bar. i'm also planning on trying a new beer tonight that my boyfriend's father brought home for me from one of the brewing companies out east (it's called twin forks).\n  ","413192":"\n  fine, i suppose. i seldom get sick as it is -- however, when i do get sick, i'm usually bound to my bed for at least a day. that usually only happens once or twice per year at the most, though.\n  ","413193":"\n  i don't really have anything planned that i'm looking forward to these days. i'm going on an eight-day vacation next winter, but that's over a year away.\n  ","413194":"\n  aw, matching pajama sets are cute !! i feel like my boyfriend would wear them if i bought them for us, lol.\n  \n  the only things i dislike are those possessive shirts that say something like \"belongs to (boyfriend\/girlfriend's name)!\" i think that's honestly kinda creepy.\n  ","413195":"\n  if i has no option but to choose very spicy or not spicy at all, i would choose non-spicy. i like a moderate amount of heat, but nothing too wild.\n  ","413196":"\n  would it be too cliche if i said my boyfriend ?? lmao. he used to have long hair & i was completely captivated by it. he cut his hair short quite a few years ago, but he grew it out to around shoulder-length when we were 19-21 years old and it looked fantastic on him.\n  ","413197":"\n  uh, either drinking while driving or possession of marijuana. i don't drink and drive, but i do drink a lot so it would probably be one of the first things people would assume.\n  ","413198":"\n  lately it's been sleeping, lmao. but i also enjoy reading, writing, playing video games, seeing my boyfriend & friends, and watching television.\n  ","413199":"\n  not very often -- only when it's applicable.\n  ","413200":"\n  my favorite subject when i was in high school was either english literature or forensics. my favorite class in college was mythology and its contemporary applications and russian literature.\n  ","413201":"\n  you'll have to specify who you're talking about.\n  ","413202":"\n  i don't remember my childhood, so i really have no idea.\n  ","413203":"\n  emotional stability & a raise at work would be nice. lmao.\n  ","413204":"\n  i don't have any photos of me smoking.\n  ","413205":"\n  nearly every question posed about feet or socks is a fetish. i'm not taking any chances, plus it isn't something i would ever take a photo of anyway.\n  ","413206":"\n  i'm not even known, so i suppose my answer would be \"nothing.\"\n  ","413207":"\n  lmao, yeah. like -- if you were seriously shaming women for having multiple partners, then we would have called you out on it. anon seems to forget that the people they send these things to actually know you and understand you, and we're comfortable telling you that you're wrong if you were wrong about something.\n  ","413208":"\n  my boyfriend makes me grateful because of how supportive and loving he is. idk what i would do without him in my life.\n  \n  i'm also grateful for my job because not many people have had the employment opportunities i have had, and it allows me to pay my bills on time every month.\n  ","413209":"\n  i can take charge of projects and act in a leadership role, but it doesn't encompass my entire being. i know how to be a respectful leader and manager without becoming obsessed with power.\n  ","413210":"\n  yeah, i have a vape with nicotine juice that i use to smoke when i'm on breaks at work.\n  \n  except i accidentally left it in my jeans pocket when i did laundry a few hours ago (it only went through the wash), so i'm pretty sure i broke it. :\/\/\n  ","413211":"\n  that's not true at all, rofl. someone's class ranking has nothing to do with the vices they enjoy. if anything, it might mean that they also enjoy coca*ne since that's a popular drug among people with wealth.\n  ","413212":"\n  definitely not, lmao. i've never experience baby fever before. i'm not even sure if i ever want children in the future.\n  ","413213":"\n  probably, because i enjoy smoking since it helps with my anxiety as well.\n  ","413214":"\n  no, not really. i have work tomorrow & all of the kids will be back in school, so the commute there and back is going to be horrible.\n  ","413215":"\n  no, considering i'm a smoker, lol.\n  ","413216":"\n  from my understanding, that isn't what morgan believes and she was making a totally different point than what you're discussing.\n  \n  either way, it's cute that you're still seeking validation for your feelings from a debate that was over yesterday. get over it and find something to do.\n  ","413217":"\n  i don't think that's necessarily true -- if they're the one asking someone out, then perhaps they would feel more obligated to pay for the whole dinner, but it doesn't make someone more or less of a \"man\" if they don't end up paying for the entire bill.\n  ","413218":"\n  nah, i'm not a person who entertains strangers' fetishes.\n  ","413219":"\n  i used to enjoy sunbathing, but now i really can't stand the heat at all. i usually tan really well.\n  ","413220":"\n  we haven't gone on an actual date in a few months, rofl. we simply don't have the time & usually only see each other at night, either after 8pm or 10:30pm.\n  \n  but when we order food, we swap back and forth. if i pay one day, he'll pay the following time, etc etc.\n  ","413221":"\n  i think expectations like that are generally rude regardless of your opinions on social justice issues. like, if you go out to dinner with someone with the expectation that you'll get a free meal, then that's entitled behavior and gross.\n  ","413222":"\n  i don't really believe in signs like that. life is generally unfair & happens randomly, people aren't given a portion of good events and bad events based on the goodness of the universe or something.\n  ","413223":"\n  ... well on that note, i'm going to take a shower.\n  ","413224":"\n  no, it's 2019 and men aren't obligated to pay for all of the dates. if anything, splitting the bill is probably the most ideal thing to do -- however, it depends entirely on the person. some people are traditional and want men to pay, while other people don't see the value in that anymore.\n  ","413225":"\n  my humor changes depending on who's around me, haha. with certain people i'm witty and lighthearted, while with others, i have a dark sense of humor.\n  ","413226":"\n  grey & cloudy with a slight chill.\n  ","413227":"\n  i can't remember the last time it was sunny where i live, lol. it's been dreary and raining and snowing for the past week.\n  \n  during the spring & summer, i enjoy going to the park and taking photos.\n  ","413228":"\n  LOL. sometimes i read certain things on askfm and it literally gives me a headache.\n  ","413229":"\n  congratulations, this is the most bizarre thing i've ever been sent on askfm.\n  ","413230":"\n  i haven't found a new series to watch since i finished big mouth. i'm thinking about checking out the umbrella academy, though.\n  ","413231":"\n  nah, my coworkers and i don't really have much time to talk since we only talk on our breaks, so usually we're talking about things we're working on and our personal lives.\n  \n  sometimes my boyfriend and i run out of things to talk about, but it isn't awkward or anything because we're at the point where we can comfortably sit in silence with each other.\n  ","413232":"\n  yeah. if i'm not comfortable doing something, or if i'm not up to doing something, then i have no problem telling them how i feel and saying no to them.\n  \n  obviously i say no in a nice manner, but still clear enough to get the point across.\n  ","413233":"\n  walk up to her with a straight face and say, \"spoiler alert: *i'm* the one shitting in your garden.\"\n  ","413234":"\n  the package wasn't ripped or torn or anything, unless it happened in the packaging facility. i've never had an issue with amazon before, so i was pretty confused.\n  \n  but yeah, amazon was extremely helpful. i've been a customer of theirs for basically 10 years and i own an amazon credit card, so they sent me a new charger without me having to pay for another one.\n  ","413235":"\n  i don't really believe it's narrow-minded, no. everyone has their own personal preferences when it comes to dating, and sometimes people don't want to deal with certain things when it comes to a person's former life with previous people.\n  \n  it's sorta the same concept of individuals not wanting to date people who have children period. sometimes it can be too much for a person to handle, and they're not ready to accept that for what it is.\n  ","413236":"\n  anyone have any interesting or thought-provoking questions ?? my inbox is empty ~~\n  \n  disclaimer ; anything trollish, invasive, or inappropriate will be deleted.\n  ","413237":"\n  nothing has really surprised me recently tbh.\n  \n  however -- i did surprise my coworker last night !! she originally invited me out to this one bar in town, but i told her that i was tired and didn't feel like going out. however, later on in the night, her husband texted me and said she was drunk & talking about me, so i decided to randomly go out and surprise her. i walked up to her inside of the bar, and she stared at me and was like, \"OH MY GOD YOU'RE ACTUALLY HERE,\" lmaoo.\n  \n  it made her night, and it made me pretty happy. apparently she also texted a few of our other coworkers, but no one responded to her. so i'm glad i was the one who came out.\n  ","413238":"\n  i have zero clue, lmao. it wasn't even a box, it was one of those bubble-wrapped packages because the charger was ... well, would have been ... small and thin, so they wouldn't waste a box on that.\n  \n  i literally walked through the front door after coming home from work & my father told me i got a package in the mail, but it felt empty. so i picked it up and it was completely flat. i opened it and there was absolutely nothing inside. i was so confused, lmao.\n  ","413239":"\n  coupons. when i worked in retail, there were so many people (usually middle-aged white women, lol) who would literally get *so* upset and angry because i wouldn't take their expired coupons. or that they accidentally didn't pick up the sale item because it was a different size, so they wanted it for the sale price. it was unbelievable.\n  ","413240":"\n  the last time i had an issue with a delivery was perhaps a few weeks ago ... i don't remember when it was exactly. i had ordered a fast-charging phone charger to use at my boyfriend's house, and when i got the initial package, there was literally nothing inside of it. lmao. so i emailed amazon and told them what happened, and they sent me another charger.\n  ","413241":"\n  my saturday was fine -- i spend the morning hours working on some freelance writing, and then i was so mentally drained that i wound up taking two naps, haha. at night, one of my coworkers went out to a bar that's down the road from my house and apparently she was drunk and asking for me (it was her birthday), so her husband texted me and asked if i was available to hang for a bit. so i went down there and saw her for like an hour.\n  \n  my sunday just began, actually. it's only 11:30am. i did wake up around 8:30am, but i felt horrible from staying out late last night so i ended up falling back asleep for a few hours. now i'm finishing up my freelance work.\n  ","413242":"\n  that usually doesn't happen to me, LOL. usually my life is pretty neutral and uneventful and bad things happen every once in a while.\n  ","413243":"\n  yes, i was bullied a lot when i was in middle school.\n  ","413244":"\n  i've gotten into confrontations with customers while i was working in retail, yeah. most of the time, it was because they were being persistent about something that wasn't plausible, i.e. their coupon was expired or it wasn't for the product they bought. i would politely explain to them why i can't take it, but sometimes they would get so irrationally angry and demand to speak to my manager.\n  \n  also, it happened a lot with people trying to scam the system or steal things. i confronted a person trying to steal a whole cart of items, so when they left the cart in the aisle and walked out the door, i quickly grabbed it and placed it behind the registers. when the next group of people came in looking for the cart, they were confounded because it was gone. lmao.\n  ","413245":"\n  \"hey boyfriend, can we go to the diner?\"\n  \n  lmao. i'm craving diner food so much. they usually have the best omelettes and i'm a sucker for diner coffee.\n  ","413246":"\n  not much time at all tbh. i can't stand looking at myself in the mirror, so i usually only use it to check my outfit before i go to work and to also make sure my hair is fine.\n  ","413247":"\n  i don't think there's any social pressure regarding how often people spend on their phones, considering most of us are on our phones often throughout the day anyway.\n  \n  personally, though, i like checking social media first thing in the morning, although i don't usually post anything. i also check it one final time before i lay down, but then i put my phone on airplane mode to charge while i'm sleeping.\n  ","413248":"\n  i couldn't imagine being a teacher tbh. i experience some social anxiety, so the prospect of standing up in front of a class and teaching for hours and days and years is so daunting to me.\n  \n  regardless, i would teach english, since that's my field of interest. perhaps english literature or grammar & rhetoric.\n  ","413249":"\n

play now.\n  ","413284":"\n  my bed is my favorite part -- i have a mattress pad on my bed, four cozy pillows, a weighted blanket, and a down blanket. it's literally the most comfortable thing i've ever slept in before.\n  ","413285":"\n  yeah, i only really let them lick my chin and stuff, though. nothing near my lips or my eyes. i think it's sorta gross, but i know it's an expression of

different way of loving someone else, and often distance is a determining factor.\n  ","413300":"\n  i agree for the most part. people are multifaceted and are deeper than their external appearance, and you can only truly know a person when you get to hear their thoughts and feelings, which takes time and effort.\n  ","413301":"\n  you're correct in that it's not 100 percent effective. i don't have an answer as to why i've never fallen pregnant before. perhaps i'm infertile.\n  ","413302":"\n  i've never heard of that before.\n  ","413303":"\n  ~* contraception *~\n  ","413304":"\n  i seldom smile in selfies to begin with.\n  ","413305":"\n  when i got home from work, i got a letter in the mail from my psychiatrist's office indicating that i, somehow, owe them $97 after i paid my initial co-pay for my last visit.\n  \n  i was rehearsing in my mind what i would say to the receptionist when i call them tomorrow, lol. i'm obviously angry and confused, but i also don't want to convey those emotions in the phonecall. however, at the same time, i also need to be stern so that perhaps i can get out of paying the additional $97, considering i have no clue why i even owe that money in the first place.\n  ","413306":"\n  boyfriend -- resourceful, ambitious, creative.\n  \n  best friend -- compassionate, patient, understanding.\n  ","413307":"\n  i'm not physically affectionate, no. i don't like when people get too close to me, and i try to avoid physical affection at all costs, unless it's obviously from my boyfriend. he's really the only person i crave physical affection from.\n  ","413308":"\n  no. if i'm sad or depressed, i prefer absolute silence.\n  ","413309":"\n  i seldom use profanity when i'm using social media ; however, in real life, i'm CONSTANTLY using profanity, lol. it has become second nature to me at this point, and i'm not entirely sure why that doesn't transfer over to my typing and writing.\n  ","413310":"\n  the only people i hug are my boyfriend and best friend. i don't like being touched by anyone else.\n  ","413311":"\n  no, i'm basically just winging it. it's funny how when you're young, you think adults have their lives all sorted out. however, when you get older, you realize that most people really have no idea what they're doing and they're just winging it.\n  ","413312":"\n  i think it depends on the scenario and the individual person. both circumstances can happen to a person, whether an individual is directly causing us unhappiness or our own emotions and feelings cause us unhappiness due to the unconscious actions from others.\n  ","413313":"\n  no. when i'm stressed, i have a tendency to not eat.\n  ","413314":"\n  no, i only follow people whose answers and personalities i enjoy. it would be pointless to follow someone i thought was annoying, because that would just be an annoyance showing up on my dashboard every day, lol.\n  ","413315":"\n  no, my physical pain isn't for no particular reason -- i mostly experience back pain, which is due solely to the fact that i work in an office & i'm sitting down for eight hours per day.\n  \n  as for mental pain, there has always been a reason behind that. if i'm hurting emotionally, it's usually because someone hurt my feelings and i never got closure from it. the only mental thing that happens spontaneously is my anxiety. there's usually no rhyme or reason to my anxiety attacks.\n  ","413316":"\n  would it be too stereotypical of me to say susanna from girl interrupted ?? LOL.\n  \n  even when i read the book ages ago, prior to my diagnosis, i related significantly to what she thought and felt, as well as her behaviors.\n  ","413317":"\n  i'm a strong debater on online platforms, but not so much in person. i stumble over my words and it's difficult for me to express myself verbally. however, in writing, i can put up strong arguments and counterpoints, and i also like to do research prior to stating an opinion on something.\n  \n  i do separate my emotions from my debates, though. debates, ideally, should be logically-based, as well as based on scientific evidence and factual support. there's no room for emotions in those contexts.\n  ","413318":"\n  i honestly believe it should be around 12-13 years old, because at that age, you fully know what you're doing and the ramifications of your actions. however, i also believe it does go on a case-by-case basis and it depends entirely on the situation itself and how severe the ab*se is.\n  ","413319":"\n  they both sound the same to me, tbh. i don't really have a preference when it comes to finding one that's more personal and intimate because they both convey the same message.\n  ","413320":"\n  yeah, a few months ago i reached out to an old friend -- someone i used to talk to online for many years, but we stopped contact because we eventually just drifted apart when i went to college.\n  \n  now we talk every few weeks or so, just to catch up and tell each other what's going on in our lives. she also likes reading my essays and poetry, so i'll send them to her whenever i've written something new to get her input.\n  ","413321":"\n  i don't have one at all.\n  ","413322":"\n  every time i take the personality types test, i always get INFJ (\"introversion, intuition, feeling, &

that i'll get injured or d*e.\n  ","413324":"\n  my clothing style isn't really inspired by anything -- i just buy what looks interesting and comfortable to me, and i don't really have a style anymore, haha. some days, i'll look like a stereotypical hipster with skinny jeans, knee-high boots, and an oversized sweater with a beanie, while other days, i'll wear a flannel with converse. most of the time, however, i simply wear hoodies with skinny jeans and sneakers.\n  ","413325":"\n  i remember when i was a pre-teen, i would constantly play tony hawk's pro skater on the xbox !! even when i was much younger, i remember liking the legend of zelda, pokemon, super smash brothers, and crash bandicoot.\n  ","413326":"\n  so are the cigarettes i smoke, but you don't see me quitting smoking anytime soon.\n  ","413327":"\n  it's a good quality to be persistent in a general sense, but it's *not* a good quality if you're trying to pursue a person and you simply won't take \"no\" for an answer. that's not persistence at that point, that's just being entitled and privileged.\n  \n  if someone says \"no\" when you ask them out, then leave them alone. they clearly don't want to go out with you, and if you're consistently vying for their attention, it gets irritating and overwhelming. some people simply cannot handle rejection.\n  ","413328":"\n  \"if the sun refused to shine, i

about before. i couldn't care less.\n  ","413330":"\n  i can't recall any conversation in particular, but my boyfriend and i regularly have intelligent conversations about current events and other theories relative to life, death, ambition, our purpose in life, religion, etc etc.\n  \n  he doesn't believe he's very smart, but he's honestly one of the most intelligent people i know. he has a plethora of knowledge crammed into his head, it's unbelievable how much random information he knows and in such great detail.\n  ","413331":"\n  last week sometime, my boyfriend and i debated over the chuck e. cheese pizza conspiracy theory, LOL. i had just watched the shane dawson video where he poses the theory so i was discussing it with him, and i lean more toward the side where it's somewhat believable whereas my boyfriend does not believe it in whatsoever.\n  \n  that conversation eventually led to a conversation about how technology is always listening to us, especially now with smartphones and other smart household items, like alexa.\n  ","413332":"\n  i would probably want to go to iceland, because it seems absolutely beautiful there and it would be a tremendous and different experience. iceland is a place i've always wanted to visit -- one of my old high school friends got engaged in iceland, and her pictures were absolutely beautiful.\n  ","413333":"\n  i feel the same way about some people i interact with too, haha. i have some of the nicest coworkers, and a lot of the sales representatives are really polite, but their voices are so grating. some of them are extremely high-pitched, and the actual way they speak is irritating at times.\n  ","413334":"\n  no, we're going on a caribbean cruise. :'))\n  ","413335":"\n  i watched that video the other day & was absolutely floored, LOL. i brought it up to my boyfriend and he was all like, \"THAT'S SO RIDICULOUS I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE THINK THAT, WHAT THE HELL.\" he rationalized the hell out of the situation, which was so amusing.\n  \n  anyway, the more unbelievable conspiracy theory i personally know is the whole \"famous people are lizard people\" thing. i don't know much about it, but i think the entire notion is ridiculous.\n  ","413336":"\n  i honestly don't have anything to look forward to this year at all. :\/\/ i'm going on a big vacation with my boyfriend's family in 2020, but that's in more than a year from now.\n  ","413337":"\n  no, you're not responsible for that person, and they shouldn't make you feel obligated to take care of them simply because they're depressed over the breakup. that's hella manipulative.\n  ","413338":"\n  writing & grammar, as well as mental health and certain disorders in general. i studied psychology briefly in college, but most of what i know is due to independent research and my own personal experiences.\n  ","413339":"\n  no, i usually have my phone on airplane mode so that nothing wakes me up besides my alarm.\n  ","413340":"\n  yes, i need my phone on because i use the alarm clock on my phone to wake me up in the morning.\n  ","413341":"\n  i can't really think of any food that i haven't tried & also want to try. i always try different food at least once, so the reason why i haven't tried a certain kind of food is because i haven't been given the opportunity to try something new.\n  ","413342":"\n  i don't need to have access to the internet within my brain because i have 24\/7 access already thanks to cell phones and computers.\n  ","413343":"\n  my boyfriend. for his birthday, i bought him a big 17oz candle, a new wallet, and some really cozy pajama pants.\n  ","413344":"\n  my day was pretty good, actually. i was extremely productive at work, i implemented some of the new things i was taught earlier in the week to various spreadsheets and programs, and my office catered brunch today, which was hella awesome.\n  \n  i don't have any plans for the evening, so i might just relax with some coffee and work on some freelance writing.\n  ","413345":"\n  yes, i'm fairly ambitious -- especially when it comes to my job. i'm always trying to seek out new information and further myself in the workplace.\n  ","413346":"\n  major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are highly co-morbid, so yeah, that's pretty common.\n  \n  if you're experiencing episodes of anxiety alongside your depressive episodes, i would definitely bring it up to your doctor so they can treat the anxiety accordingly.\n  ","413347":"\n  sometimes i enjoy life, especially when i have a particularly good day

","413352":"\n  i disagree with that statement. having wealth these days is moreso a matter of luck and personal connections than anything else. also, to use a blanket statement such as \"all people who are poor are lazy\" is inaccurate since that's obviously not the case.\n  ","413353":"\n  i've been wearing glasses since i was a child, actually -- i want to say maybe since i was 5 years old ?? i also have astigmatism.\n  ","413354":"\n  the only jewelry i wear is a necklace, only the ones my boyfriend has bought for me.\n  ","413355":"\n  it was part of the filter from snapchat, LOL.\n  ","413356":"\n  here are two, since i couldn't decide on one. rofl.\n  ","413357":"\n  it's useless because it won't change their appearance, lol. instead of making fun of something that's meaningless, criticize their behavior instead. that's what makes someone a bad person, afterall.\n  ","413358":"\n  if they're a bad person, you should be criticizing their behavior or thought patterns. to make fun of their physical appearance is pretty useless and juvenile.\n  ","413359":"\n  it's been a long time coming and i'm happy he's finally being held responsible for his horrid actions. that must at least give his victims some closure.\n  ","413360":"\n  considering my weekend hasn't started yet ... lol. i just got home from work, so i guess technically my weekend starts now.\n  ","413361":"\n  uh, no ?? that statement literally came out of nowhere, rofl.\n  ","413362":"\n  yeah, tbh that's bad -- even though you acknowledge that their behavior is toxic to you, you're still allowing them to make a significant impact on your life. you already know that the best thing to do is to let them go, but i do understand the familiarity of keeping them in your life. however, you have to recognize that their presence in your life is not good and you would be a better and more productive person without them.\n  ","413363":"\n  no, i don't really pay much attention to who likes my answers tbh.\n  ","413364":"\n  yeah, a lot of personality disorders are comorbid with one another because the diagnostic criteria can overlap.\n  ","413365":"\n  obviously. mocking in any shape or form is rude in itself. nobody can help what their accent is, so to make fun of someone for how they sound is pretty rude.\n  ","413366":"\n  one of my coworkers is pretty androgynous looking, but she's a cis woman. however, she came up to me all upset today because she walked into the women's bathroom and apparently two women in there gasped and said to her, \"this is the WOMEN'S bathroom!\"\n  \n  idk it irked me the wrong way. i couldn't believe that those woman actually said that to her, like if you don't have something nice to say then don't say anything at all. it's almost harassment at that point because it's happened to her multiple times, and it's just really sad.\n  ","413367":"\n  it depends on what they needed help with. there are some people i'm willing to help, but others not so much because of what they need help with and the vibe they give off.\n  ","413368":"\n  honesty, loyalty, a dark sense of humor that resembles mine, creativity, likes music as

heathers, tbh. it's probably one of my favorite movies and no matter how much i watch it, i can never get tired of it.\n  ","413371":"\n  i'd rather have one \"get out of jail free\" card tbh. i've done a lot of stupid sh*t during my life, and it would be good to keep handy if anything catches up to me, lmao.\n  ","413372":"\n  i love cosmetics. it's a good art form and if it makes people happy, then let them practice their art.\n  ","413373":"\n  i seldom wear matching socks tbh.\n  ","413374":"\n  no ?? beauty is subjective. what one person believes to be ugly may be beautiful to someone

them first.\n  \n  i haven't ghosted them yet, but i'm planning on stopping contact with one of my friends. they've been told time & time again that they're not doing the right thing, but at this point, it seems like they don't really care anymore. i'm not going to put effort into a friendship if it's one sided.\n  ","413378":"\n  most governments are corrupt. politicians only care about power

shopping was last sunday.\n  ","413381":"\n  the last clothing item i bought was a shirt from blackcraftcult -- i mainly bought it because they had a thicc\u2122 sale going on & the design on it was beautiful.\n  ","413382":"\n  pajama pants & an oversized hoodie !! usually accompanied by fuzzy socks and a cup of coffee.\n  ","413383":"\n  my phone, my laptop, and my medication.\n  ","413384":"\n  i've been awestruck by someone's beauty, but i don't believe that it's ever intimidated me.\n  ","413385":"\n  i usually just ghost them, but this is coming from the understanding that the communication was faulty to begin with. the people i've erased from my life did nothing for me anymore and every conversation we *did* have was toxic, or just their presence in my life was toxic enough.\n  ","413386":"\n  hurricane sandy was pretty wild. thankfully my house didn't get damaged, but homes further south than me near the coast were destroyed. one of my old professors from college was forced to cancel the remainder of the semester because her house was destroyed and she couldn't teach lessons anymore.\n  ","413387":"\n  no, it's always been easy for me to cut people out of my

people have the capacity to change. however, not everyone does, and some people are in far too deep in their own toxic ways that they'll never realize their own behavior, even if it's pointed out to them time and time again.\n  \n  sometimes it *is* too late, and that's the way life goes. not everyone is willing to wait for someone to change, and tbh, most people don't deserve to be forced to wait on someone like that.\n  ","413390":"\n  i honestly don't know, i haven't tried doing push ups in years, LOL.\n  ","413391":"\n  i use doordash, and sometimes grubhub. i've never used ubereats

trust people easily at all. people have to prove their loyalty to me, trust isn't something i give away freely.\n  ","413453":"\n  i'm fairly stubborn, but i'm also open to suggestions at the same

race, though.\n  ","413457":"\n  my weekend was fine !! i was dogsitting all saturday afternoon and evening, and sunday i basically did nothing because i was so exhausted from staying up until 4am. i

long as both partners are open to communication and willing to compromise on things like any other relationship, then there shouldn't really be an issue.\n  ","413466":"\n  i don't believe that the person moving in should be directly and solely responsible, considering the pet is owned by the other person. however, it isn't unreasonable for them to take care of that pet in their partner's absence, because they're living in that space just as much as their partner is now. it should be a joint effort.\n  ","413467":"\n  it's definitely possible, yes. some people simply don't place much importance on political beliefs because it doesn't directly affect their relationship, especially if those beliefs aren't typically seen as radical or extreme.\n  \n  a lot of people obviously can't be in a relationship with someone if their beliefs strictly oppose their own, especially if a person is pro-life or something, but it ultimately depends on the couple's dynamics and what they can compromise on.\n  ","413468":"\n  no, sex and intimacy are not the same things. intimacy is a feeling of being deeply connected to a person, which doesn't necessarily have to involve physical affection. sex can be a physical display of that intimacy, however, if those people are both consenting to that type of expression of intimacy.\n  ","413469":"\n  no, that's hella gross, in my opinion. even though you share bodily fluids with the person you're dating anyway, you're basically picking up their dental bacteria by using their toothbrush and rubbing it all over your mouth and gums. it isn't sanitary.\n  ","413470":"\n  it's traditional for a lot of families to value the partner asking the parents' permission to marry their child, so in that vein, it can be seen as more respectful -- especially if both partners are family oriented and believe in those sorts of traditions.\n  \n  however, if someone wasn't close to their family or didn't believe in such a tradition, but their partner asked their parents' permission and were turned down, then i think it would be disrespectful to the child if the partner decided not to marry them based solely on their parents' wishes. if that makes sense, haha.\n  \n  personally speaking, it doesn't matter to me either way. i'm not close to my family and i wouldn't feel disrespected if my boyfriend asked me to marry him without consulting my parents first. after all, it's ultimately our decision.\n  ","413471":"\n  it wouldn't sway me either way -- as long as they're not judging me solely based on my astrological sign, then i see nothing wrong with being interested in astrology. i have plenty of friends who fully believe in astrology and whatnot.\n  \n  i.e. if a prospective partner suddenly didn't want to date me anymore because they found out i was a scorpio, then that would be pretty disappointing. then again, it also wouldn't bother me very much because i wouldn't want to date a person to begin with if they didn't want to get to know me before judging me first.\n  ","413472":"\n  i think it ultimately depends on the couple themselves, because it ranges depending on each person's needs.\n  \n  when my boyfriend and i don't see each other, we usually talk on the phone once or twice per day for 10-20 minutes each. we don't really text each other, though, because my boyfriend is terrible at texting and it's just easier to talk on the phone. this is what works for my relationship, though.\n  ","413473":"\n  i see nothing wrong with gender reveals. it's literally just to announce the sex of your baby, and the fact that there are some strong opinions *against* gender reveals is a little ridiculous and overbearing.\n  \n  when children are babies, they have no concept of gender. so it's normal for parents to raise them according to their sex unless that child indicates that they feel otherwise somewhere down the line.\n  ","413474":"\n  depends on how close you are to that friend. if you said yes initially and now you changed your mind, then that's pretty sh*tty.\n  ","413475":"\n  i don't really know why someone would do that unless it was for a malicious reason, so i suppose it would be fairly inappropriate.\n  ","413476":"\n  probably, but i'm not well versed in this kind of law at all. you would have to google this or perhaps ask\n  \n   @princess_tal\n  \n  .\n  ","413477":"\n  spending time with my boyfriend and close friends, listening to music, writing, and creating new experiences.\n  ","413478":"\n  yeah, their zodiac sign is only one facet of who they are & it doesn't necessarily mean that their personality matches that of their zodiac sign. people's personalities develop based on their genetics and environment, and i've always been questionable about astrology to begin with personally.\n  ","413479":"\n  you were on anon, so i didn't even realize that was you before. lol.\n  ","413480":"\n  yeah, renaissance and baroque art are some of my favorite art styles.\n  ","413481":"\n  as my bio indicates, i live in new york.\n  ","413482":"\n  i answered this already.\n  ","413483":"\n  i only wear my fitbit, and i rotate necklaces that my boyfriend has purchased me in the past. lately, i've been wearing a necklace that's shaped like a circle with a bronze tree in the middle. the circle is made out of opal.\n  ","413484":"\n  arrogance; ignorance; any exhibition of discrimination against people's race, sex, gender, mental or physical health, etc etc.; the inability to acknowledge that they were wrong; and manipulative tendencies.\n  ","413485":"\n  a few months ago when my boyfriend and i booked a hotel room one night to crash after we attended a wine tasting event at a local fish aquarium !!\n  \n  we got to the hotel pretty early, so we dropped our things off and walked around the small town for a few hours. we ended up at a really small brewery, and then we found a really cute pizza parlor on the way back to the hotel. after we took a nap, there was live music playing outside the hotel by their pool, so we sat by the outside bar and listened to music for a while. :'))\n  ","413486":"\n  yes !! me and\n  \n   @Courrtana\n  \n  met in real life after talking to each other for ages on askfm and through text !! :'))\n  \n  i wish we could have hung out more when she was in new york, but i'm really happy that we were able to spend an afternoon together. it was so much fun.\n  ","413487":"\n  please don't call me \"gorgeous,\" it isn't an adjective that makes me feel comfortable.\n  \n  regardless, i'm doing fine. i got home from work not too long ago, and now i'm listening to music and trying to relax from the long day i had. i texted my friend to see if she wanted to celebrate national \"drink wine\" day with me, but if she isn't available, i'm just going to pour a glass by myself, lol.\n  ","413488":"\n  i used to deal with that when i worked in retail -- i had some coworkers who were on a lower level than me in terms of promotions, and i was technically their manager if the assistant store manager or regular store manager weren't available. they would take it upon themselves to make decisions that should have gone by me first for approval, and they wouldn't communicate what they did to *anyone* so there was miscommunication within the store, which was difficult to handle.\n  \n  thankfully, it isn't something i've had to deal with working in office environments. granted, i've never really been in a supervisory position with these office jobs, but it isn't something i really notice. if it happens, it doesn't happen around me, lol.\n  ","413489":"\n  i have a lot of playlists on spotify, but the one i've been listening to the past few days is just called \"feb 2019 music.\" it's just a compilation of all of the songs i've been listening to in one place.\n  ","413490":"\n  no, love at first sight doesn't exist. love is a deep, intimate connection you develop with a person over time. you cannot know if you love a person or not by simply meeting them for the first time. in those instances, the attraction you're feeling is simply lust.\n  ","413491":"\n  my coworker told me it was national \"drink wine\" day !! when i initially looked it up, national wine day is actually in may. but apparently national \"drink wine\" day is different. i think americans just want any excuse to be validated while they drown themselves in alcohol.\n  \n  regardless ... uh, yeah. i bought a bottle of wine after work. lmao.\n  ","413492":"\n  there's nothing wrong with that. i don't think whiskey expires, lol. it's good to keep around for celebrations, special occasions, if you're having a guest over, etc etc.\n  ","413493":"\n  that's not stupid at all, that's actually a really great thing that you seldom drink alcohol. most alcohol is absolutely terrible for you anyway, with the exception of perhaps a glass of red wine per night (allegedly).\n  \n  i've personally never been a fan of whiskey, scotch, bourbon, etc etc. it tastes too gross to me.\n  ","413494":"\n  i'm good at writing (mostly prose, but sometimes poetry); understanding people's feelings and worries; and playing certain video games.\n  ","413495":"\n  LOL. honestly, disaronno is one of my *favorite* liquors. i only ever drink it on the rocks, and it's terrifying how it goes down like water.\n  \n  i haven't had it in a long time, though. perhaps i'll pick a bottle up one of these days, it's definitely a good winter\/night-time drink.\n  ","413496":"\n  i like being busy for most of the day, but definitely not *all* day. i need some down time each day to collect my thoughts, relax, and recoup from the day. for me, that normally happens late at night when i have no responsibilities left to worry about for the evening.\n  ","413497":"\n  no, i don't have any plans for the summer. if anything, i'll be traveling to local places and perhaps spending a weekend here and there, so it isn't something i need to plan too far in advance.\n  ","413498":"\n  LOL. yeah, it shows how fragile their sense of masculinity is, because they're clearly insecure in themselves if they feel the need to constantly broadcast that they're a \"real man,\" or something along those lines.\n  \n  i don't have time in my life for people who think too much into masculinity versus femininity or feed into false stereotypes of what a \"real man\" or \"real woman\" should be.\n  ","413499":"\n  no, not at all. family isn't strictly by blood -- you can be seen as a part of someone's family even without being related to them if your relationship is close enough.\n  \n  my boyfriend's family is going on an extended vacation next year and they included me in their excursion, so i texted my boyfriend's step-mother sometime last week thanking her for including me, and she said, \"no need, you're family !!\"\n  \n  i've been so close with his family for so long that they basically consider me part of the family now too, even though we're not engaged or anything, lol.\n  ","413500":"\n  personally speaking, i don't. it's difficult to really keep track of them because it unfortunately happens so often. and i find that if i focus too much on current events, shootings, etc etc., too much then i just wind up becoming angry and upset.\n  ","413501":"\n  nope, i've been at work all day. when you asked me this question, i had just gotten home.\n  ","413502":"\n  lately, it's been listening to music. i don't really do much while i'm listening because i prefer to focus on the music and vocals and lyrics and whatnot, it's pretty therapeutic for me.\n  \n  my boyfriend and i have gotten into the habit of sitting down, talking about our day and our daily thoughts, and then putting music on and discussing it while showing each other the recent music we've been listening to.\n  ","413503":"\n  i like being asked questions related to my interests, i.e. video games, mental health, cosmetics, television series & documentaries, music, coffee, alcohol, etc etc.\n  \n  i'm pretty open to most questions, though, as long as they're not invasive, inappropriate, or troll-ish.\n  ","413504":"\n  currently, my favorite song is \"apologize\" by grandson ;\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wjILi6KaVuY\n

","413506":"\n  pay off all of my debts, buy a house, and buy my boyfriend a new car.\n  ","413507":"\n  no, i've never cheated on anyone before. i never really saw the point in cheating unless it's an ab*sive relationship that you can't escape easily, or something along those lines.\n  ","413508":"\n  yes, my boyfriend bought me one for valentine's day !!\n  \n  i'm not sure where he bought it from, but it's essentially a 20-pound blanket, and there are ones with higher weights depending on your frame. i've always been curious, and honestly i didn't think it would do anything different to my sleep, but i feel more well rested when i use it and it does help my nighttime anxiety a lot.\n  ","413509":"\n  yeah except now it exists within capitalism.\n  ","413510":"\n  no, i've never pretended that my self image was positive. i've always been quite open about the fact that my self image is nonexistent, lol.\n  ","413511":"\n  it probably stems from the fact that humans evolved from being hunters and gatherers and were on the top of the food chain, so to speak.\n  ","413512":"\n  yeah, considering it's something i always strive to have. a positive self image is important to most people because it gives people greater confidence in themselves.\n  ","413513":"\n  sure, that works.\n  ","413514":"\n  sometimes, yeah.\n  ","413515":"\n  i'm not sure what i'm having for dinner tonight. i'm honestly not even hungry.\n  ","413516":"\n  i'd probably choose to save them, then. however, that's assuming that you would even know in the first place who was in which group, which seems pretty biased.\n  ","413517":"\n  depends on whether or not i want to die that day.\n  ","413518":"\n  because it's obvious that more people being hurt is worse than less people, lol. that isn't something that needs to be explained.\n  ","413519":"\n  this is a stupid question.\n  ","413520":"\n  i haven't liked any of your answers, dude.\n  ","413521":"\n  a similar sense of humor to mine, loyalty, honesty, creative, hard working, and passionate.\n  \n  it's changed with age, yeah. but my boyfriend has thankfully exhibited those qualities as we've grown together.\n  ","413522":"\n  uh, yeah. it's based on the number of people you wind up hurting overall.\n  ","413523":"\n  because of the amount of people it ultimately affects. would you rather the families of 20 people be grieving or the families of 100 people ??\n  ","413524":"\n  uh, hello. do you have a question ??\n  ","413525":"\n  yeah -- he's super messy, lol. when he does clean, he does a terrific job at it, but in general he's just a fairly messy person and sometimes it frustrates me.\n  ","413526":"\n  sometimes my paranoia acts up, but lately it's been manageable.\n  ","413527":"\n  yes, i'm quite happy. :')) my boyfriend is one of the best things to have happened to me & i'm forever grateful for his support, love, and friendship.\n  ","413528":"\n  if that meant that if i didn't let those 20 people die then 100 people would die, then yeah. 100 is a greater number than 20 and it would be for the greater good.\n  ","413529":"\n  no. personally speaking, i only have social and emotional connections with a few people in my life. most people generally don't have connections to complete strangers.\n  ","413530":"\n  well yeah -- you're the one who said \"humans,\" lol.\n  ","413531":"\n  it's something we have in common with each other, sure. i thought you meant like a social or emotional connection, though.\n  ","413532":"\n  when it originated in other cultures, it was meant to signify \"species.\" as time progressed, language changed so now it's mainly a historical homage to what it used to be.\n  ","413533":"\n  in some ways, sure. there are some people who gain a little bit of knowledge about something from the internet & suddenly they act as if they're an expert in the subject, even if the information they received was from social media.\n  ","413534":"\n  no, not

rather do exercises on my own as opposed to in a group, although it does motivate me more when i have someone there with me, such as my best friend or my boyfriend.\n  \n  ideally, i would have a gym inside of my house, LOL. if i had the money, i would buy a treadmill and set it up in the empty room of my house so i could work out in peace.\n  ","413599":"\n  my best friend and i couldn't coordinate our schedules anymore because she started working extra hours at work, so it discouraged me from returning to the gym because i didn't want to go alone.\n  \n  which is a really sh*tty

run an extra mile, etc etc.\n  ","413607":"\n  because i've let my health go to waste in recent years, LOL. i started drinking beer instead of liquor, my medication made me gain a lot of weight, and i haven't exercised in about a year.\n  \n  i intend on going back to the gym, though. my boyfriend actually signed up for the same gym as i have, so we're going to start going together to motivate me more.\n  ","413608":"\n  you surely aren't suggesting that i forego my own health simply because a person's personality is more important in interpersonal relationships than their health, lol.\n  \n  my physical appearance, and my health, is equally as important to me as developing my own personality. my body and my face are my biggest insecurities, and that undoubtedly affects what i think about myself.\n  ","413609":"\n  because i have to deal with myself and my physical appearance moreso than anyone else. even though what's within a person is what matters most of all, it doesn't mean that my own physical appearance isn't important to me. i'm personally not happy with myself and i want to change that.\n  ","413610":"\n  LOL, no, i barely have the confidence to be nude around my boyfriend, let alone the entire town.\n  ","413611":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree with you.\n  ","413612":"\n  well, yeah. but there are hundreds of ideologies out there, so some are good and some are bad.\n  ","413613":"\n  i'm becoming more & more unhappy with myself, which mostly has to do with my weight and the way i look in general (especially my face). i think i'll become more confident once i start working out and losing weight.\n  ","413614":"\n  not generally, no. the only peoples' opinions i care about are those of my boyfriend, my best friend, and my few close friends.\n

is a group of ideas, which usually refers to some sort of cultural or political or economic theory.\n  ","413617":"\n  i don't really see that tbh -- i feel like it's more of a mantra for people who

fraction of the universe that exists.\n  ","413626":"\n  i said it was a fleshlight, not a flashlight.\n  \n  either way ... uh, your best bet is to google it. it's too inappropriate to explain on

cold. my showers only last 10 minutes at the most anyway, so it isn't a big deal.\n  ","413630":"\n  yeah, i take cold showers occasionally to preserve my hair color. hot water makes color rinse out faster, and it's recommended to use cold water so that color lasts longer.\n  ","413631":"\n  uh, i wasn't bragging. you asked if i would be your valentine, so i informed you that i had a boyfriend. then you stated that you were basically better than him, even though you don't know him, and i told you that i'm perfectly happy in my relationship.\n  \n  that isn't bragging, and you shouldn't misplace your anger on strangers like that. just because your friends are all in relationships doesn't mean you're allowed to impose that anger onto other people who did nothing to you.\n  ","413632":"\n  my best friend and her family are out for the night, so they asked me if i could watch their dogs while they're out of the house. they're going to be gone until at least midnight, so they wanted to make sure the dogs were fed, let outside, etc etc.\n  ","413633":"\n  lmao. if you were simply nervous to talk to me, then you wouldn't have said that you didn't believe i had a boyfriend and disrespected me when i told you i was already in a relationship.\n  \n  it doesn't matter to me either way because i forgot all about it up until you sent me this & i had to scroll back to see what you said to me yesterday.\n  ","413634":"\n  uh, i'm not an expert. my best friend's dogs are just well behaved, so it's easy to take care of them when she and her family are out of town.\n  ","413635":"\n  yeah, there's one person in my life who always irritates me and puts me in a terrible mood. i usually deal with it by distancing myself from them and venting to my boyfriend or my best friend about what happened.\n  ","413636":"\n  i understand what you mean by that statement, so i personally see nothing wrong with it. it might be more concise to say something like \"what name did you save me under in your contacts?\" or something similar, though.\n  ","413637":"\n  i've been fine. my anxiety has been a little problematic, but that was because i went an entire week without my medication (luckily that situation was sorted out). otherwise, i've just been spending a lot of time working and seeing my boyfriend whenever possible.\n  ","413638":"\n  not really, no. they listen really well, though. if i say \"stop\" or \"stay,\" they know not to move. if i tell them to sit or lay down, they do so. if i tell one dog to go outside and the other to stay inside, then they listen. they're all really well behaved dogs.\n  ","413639":"\n  i've never been in a physical fight before.\n  ","413640":"\n  i'm dogsitting three dogs -- i'm not sure how old they all are, but they're all between 2 and 5.\n  ","413641":"\n  i'm sorta talkative, but i'm more of a listener than anything else. sometimes i have stories to tell, but when i'm talking to people, we're mostly talking about events and feelings and opinions, not so much about other people.\n  ","413642":"\n  no, i appreciate that they trust me enough to vent to me with their problems. it doesn't happen too often anyway.\n  ","413643":"\n  i agree with him too !! after thinking about it some more, i can definitely see his point of view.\n  \n  cc:\n  \n   @urlsareshittbh\n  \n","413644":"\n  it probably won't affect my life directly, especially if i believe nothing will happen with the deal at all. but it's all speculation at this point, so it's impossible to say anything with resolution.\n  \n  and yeah, if the goal is to end poverty, then it's terrific in theory.\n  ","413645":"\n  lol, i saw. i don't really think it makes very much of a difference either way, people will still know what the anon means.\n  ","413646":"\n  considering you don't know much about my life at all, your conclusion is unfounded. lol.\n  \n  compared to some other people, sure -- my life wasn't as hard as their lives. however, that doesn't mean my life was easy. it's useless to compare who \"had it worse\" because oppression olympics is gross.\n  ","413647":"\n  no, but i've done the best i can do for myself despite the circumstances.\n  ","413648":"\n  it doesn't matter if i agree with the goals at all, because i'm not a politician, nor do i work for the government. i have absolutely nothing to do with the deal, so technically it makes no difference what i think, lol.\n  \n  i said its goals are great, in theory. implementation will be difficult. but it doesn't matter because that isn't my job, and there's nothing i can do about it.\n  ","413649":"\n  it varies depending on the day. if my boyfriend is working early that morning, he usually doesn't text me until he's on break in the afternoon. sometimes i'll text him to tell him that i got to work safe and that i hope he has a productive day.\n  \n  if he's awake and he's working the late shift that night, he'll text me first in the morning while he's having a cup of coffee.\n  ","413650":"\n  i swear when i'm outside on breaks with my coworkers. other than that, i don't talk to anyone at work.\n  ","413651":"\n  i said it sounds terrific -- in theory. they're goals that i agree with personally, and i can still think that they're good goals despite the fact that i also think it's going to be difficult to put forth.\n  ","413652":"\n  most of my friends have different opinions than i do. it's unrealistic to expect everyone you're friendly with to hold the same views, considering everyone is their own individual person and has their own respective backgrounds and opinions.\n  \n  as long as we respect each other's opinions, even if we don't agree with each other, then it doesn't much matter.\n  ","413653":"\n  my opinions have changed on things over time as i've gotten older. however, it's not going to change if i'm firm on a stance and a random stranger claims i'm wrong, lol.\n  ","413654":"\n  it's goal is to reduce greenhouse emissions, create jobs for americans, invest in the infrastructure to meet economic challenges, secure sustainable energy and clean air and water, and promote justice and equality among all people regardless of race, sex, gender, religion, etc etc.\n  \n  like i said, it sounds ideal. however, it's going to be difficult to actually implement because the government likely won't pass anything regarding the deal and a lot of the issues addressed have unrealistic conclusions.\n  ","413655":"\n  no, if someone were to threaten me in a serious manner, then they would speak to me privately. it's useless to get worried over a threat from an anon because they're a complete stranger who likely has no information on you besides the information you choose to share online.\n  ","413656":"\n  it sounds terrific in theory, from the small bit of information i've read about it, but it's going to be difficult to implement in the foreseeable future.\n  ","413657":"\n  it depends on the subject matter. it's easier for people to make me think twice about my opinion if i'm uneducated on something, since in those cases i'm willing to understand different sides of an issue. however, in cases where my opinion on something is firm, then nothing can change my mind.\n  ","413658":"\n  yeah, just because it's from my boyfriend doesn't mean my skin magically stops hurting, lol. i obviously don't mind physical affection from him, but massages still hurt like hell.\n  ","413659":"\n  LOL. no, not at all. that's some juvenile, high school sh*t. how could they even \"fight\" me if they're too afraid to come off anon ??\n  ","413660":"\n  i absolutely hate massages. i don't like people touching me to begin with, and massages hurt my skin because i'm sensitive.\n  ","413661":"\n  i've learned to accept the fact that not everyone is a friend, even if they say they're your friend. actions speak louder than words, and sometimes it's okay to distance yourself from people who don't put the same effort into the friendship as you do.\n  ","413662":"\n  i've never watched kids or cats before, lol. i assume it would be easiest to watch cats because they keep to themselves.\n  \n  these dogs keep on running toward the front door and barking even though no one is there, i think they're expecting my best friend's family to come home and they miss them. :'((\n  ","413663":"\n  i find it interesting because most of the time, it's instigated by anons who are too afraid to come off anonymous, LOL.\n  \n  but in general, i don't pay attention to drama. most of the time, it happens when i'm not even online.\n  ","413664":"\n  i'm watching three dogs !! two are pit mixes and one is a chihuahua-weenie mix.\n  ","413665":"\n  for a second i thought i was drunk already because of this question, LOL.\n  \n  lately i've been drinking cold brew coffee or espresso over ice with soy milk.\n  ","413666":"\n  l'oreal everpure sulfate-free moisture shampoo & conditioner !!\n  \n  i find that it works the best for me when i color my hair. my hair is still super blue, even though i colored it about two months ago.\n  ","413667":"\n  y'all keep liking my post that says to ask me question, but no one is asking me anything.\n  \n  send your questions my way, i'll answer anything !! as long as they're not inappropriate or trollish questions.\n  ","413668":"\n  i don't even know who that is.\n  ","413669":"\n  oh, perhaps !!\n  \n  in that case, anon, to \"subpost\" someone means to passively-aggressively post about someone in a negative manner without specifying who the person is.\n  ","413670":"\n  i'm not entirely sure. it sounds like a simple typo.\n  ","413671":"\n  i generally don't pay attention to what people think of me.\n  ","413672":"\n  it depends on your intention, with i'm pretty sure means you've taken a lot of medication instead of taking something akin to a bath in medication, lol.\n  \n  it would be better to say \"with meds\" instead of \"in meds.\"\n  ","413673":"\n  it feels pretty sh*tty, but i try not to allow it to discourage me. there are some people my age who own houses and have their own families, but i also know that everyone exists on their own respective timelines.\n  ","413674":"\n  this happens to me with some music, which is why i like looking into different musicians that aren't played very much and listening to their music !! i.e. i like hozier, but i don't want to wear myself out by listening to him too much, so i'll research artists who sound similar to him and listen to them in a playlist along with his music.\n  ","413675":"\n  my saturday has been going well so far -- i'm currently at my best friend's house and i'm dogsitting for the rest of the night, so this should be fun. lmao.\n  ","413676":"\n  i'm dogsitting today, so y'all should ask me questions to keep me occupied !!\n  ","413677":"\n  sometimes i ask myself, \"what's the point?\" in regards to certain things in my life, because it can feel as if i'm taking one step forward and two steps back at times, which is incredibly frustrating.\n  ","413678":"\n  i don't really know much about hazing because neither of the colleges i went to had sororities or fraternities (that i'm aware of, lol). however, i do know that some hazing rituals are actually incredibly harmful, embarrassing, or dangerous, which doesn't make it sound worth joining the club, in my opinion.\n  \n  people in the clubs claim that they're doing it because it means they value their participation, or something along those lines, and it makes them closer in the long run. but i honestly don't believe you can care about someone while watching them endure such dangerous and bizarre hazing rituals. it's contradictory.\n  ","413679":"\n  i don't have children, but it would really irritate me if the other parent decided to do important things with that child without discussing it with me previously. even if a couple is not together anymore and they have a child together, there still needs to be open communication and a general understanding of each other's values.\n  ","413680":"\n  i loved the hunger games trilogy as novels, but i wasn't a huge fan of the movie adaptations of them. i don't even think i even had a desire to see the rest of the films besides the original hunger games movie.\n  ","413681":"\n  i would be a little alarmed, to say the least, because if they claim that they're in love with you solely based on *one* date, then they clearly must have created some fantasy of you that they're basing those feelings off of, instead of getting to know you over time.\n  \n  it's somewhat of a red flag and it can be seen as obsessive behavior. especially if they're looking at you and seeing only what they want to see instead of seeing you for how you actually are. they're creating an intimate connection over a fantasy of you, and that's not healthy at all.\n  ","413682":"\n  to me personally, there's a remarkable difference between \"i love you\" and \"i'm in love with you.\"\n  \n  the former saying can be applied both romantically *and* platonically because it's just an expression indicating your love and appreciation for a person, whether it's your partner, friends, or family. the latter, on the other hand, signifies a deep, intimate connection you feel towards someone on a romantic level.\n  ","413683":"\n  i think it ultimately depends on what you're looking for. i believe netflix is better for movies & documentaries, while hulu is better for television series. i don't know much about amazon video, so i can't comment on that.\n  \n  i prefer netflix, though. they have a lot of true crime documentaries and series, and i'm always down to watch a disturbing story.\n  ","413684":"\n  i don't like receiving gifts from my parents. i wouldn't want to receive anything from them at all.\n  ","413685":"\n  lmao, no. i apologize profusely quite frequently, it's just one of those words that slip out without conscious thought behind it.\n  ","413686":"\n  depends ultimately on my mood that day. sometimes i'm incredibly proud of the person i am, while other times i'm very disappointed in myself and believe i could do so much better than how i'm doing. i'm never really neutral on myself, it's either one extreme or the other, which can be overwhelming at times.\n  ","413687":"\n  i wouldn't know, i'm not a boy. lol.\n  ","413688":"\n  unfortunately, yeah. i have regrets about trusting a certain person in my life because they don't know how to keep their mouth shut.\n  ","413689":"\n  making intimate connections with people and education.\n  ","413690":"\n  financial stability, emotional stability, and a strong support system.\n  ","413691":"\n  yeah, it's about sex -- but also \"skeet\" is slang for c*m, so i thought it was hilarious (and also horrifying) how a bunch of 13 and 14 year olds were dancing to a song that's basically about c*mshots and having sex, lmao.\n  ","413692":"\n  my boyfriend and i spent the morning sleeping in and having coffee outside together. :'))\n  \n  things like that always make me happy.\n  ","413693":"\n  UGH SAME. i watched abducted in plain sight a few weeks ago & was absolutely confounded at the parents. not only was the documentary creepy af, but those parents were either incredibly ignorant or simply did not care about their daughter.\n  ","413694":"\n  i don't have anyone blocked on social media, actually. if someone annoys me, then i just delete them off of my friends list. or, in the case of askfm, i just delete their messages.\n  ","413695":"\n  aw, thank you !!\n  ","413696":"\n  honestly, this reminds me of when i was in middle school & everyone was dancing to \"get low\" by lil jon, without knowing or realizing what it was actually about, LOL.\n  ","413697":"\n  lmao, if you think i'm not being a mental health advocate because i spoke up when you started incessantly spamming my inbox, then you clearly don't know what a mental health advocate is.\n  \n  please stop sending me messages. i'm just going to delete them from hereon out.\n  ","413698":"\n  dude, just leave me alone. i have no interest in being your friend. i said \"challenge accepted\" because you said you would go on a hunger strike if i didn't say hello to you.\n  ","413699":"\n  i poop at least twice per day. i'm not sure if that's normal, lmao.\n  ","413700":"\n  i believe creative writing is an art form, so there's really no such thing as straying too far from formality. my prose is pretty informal itself.\n  ","413701":"\n  challenge accepted.\n  ","413702":"\n  i just looked him up. i appreciate his hair and beard, but his face isn't attractive to me.\n  ","413703":"\n  no, i don't even know who she is. lol.\n  ","413704":"\n  i think an anon has mentioned that to me once before, but i don't remember when it was exactly.\n  ","413705":"\n  not really, no. i understand that everyone has a different style, however. one part of editing that's interesting to me is that each writer has a different voice and style, so it's important to respect those styles while still maintaining formality and conforming to the AP and in-house styles.\n  \n  also, i write creatively in my free time so that breaks up a lot of the monotony as well.\n  ","413706":"\n  i haven't heard that term in ages, LOL.\n  \n  i wouldn't know, it isn't something i handle in my job. i doubt it's even touched upon at all for most publishing companies.\n  ","413707":"\n  it still isn't seen as formal, so no. the only times we're instructed to use ampersands are when they're included in the official names of organizations.\n  ","413708":"\n  no, that's not a formal style and i don't think it's encouraged in AP style. not unless it's the official name of an organization, like most law firms.\n  ","413709":"\n  it's mostly irrational, especially considering my greatest fear in particular is my boyfriend leaving me. he's never given any notion that he would ever do such a thing, but it's still something i fear every day.\n  ","413710":"\n  leaving me, i.e. ceasing contact with me with no discernable reason whatsoever to where i can't get closure. i become extremely attached to my friends and if they don't talk to me or respond to my messages, i assume they're angry with me or don't want anything to do with me, and i freak out.\n  ","413711":"\n  yeah, i don't really know what else you can be abandoned by, lol.\n  ","413712":"\n  no, but i do fear abandonment.\n  ","413713":"\n  that basically defined my entire teenagehood. well, i wouldn't necessarily say i fell in love with them, but i was infatuated with a lot of different

clip.\n  \n  i splurged on some chapstick and a valentine's day card for my boyfriend tonight because i had a $7 extrabucks from CVS, LOL.\n  ","413858":"\n  everything has been wonderful, actually. we're in the process of planning a massive family vacation next year. :'))\n  ","413859":"\n  i believe that certain extents of challenging your partner is healthy in a relationship, yes. ideally, your partner should inspire and motivate you to be a better version of yourself, which also includes calling you out on your bullsh*t if you're making excuses in an attempt to not do something.\n  ","413860":"\n  yeah, i live with my parents at the moment.\n  ","413861":"\n  the best thing for me when i'm sad or depressed is to be around my boyfriend. he knows how to make me feel better without overstepping boundaries, and he understands that it's often the smaller things that have a tendency to give me hope, like forehead kisses or waking me up to a freshly made cup of coffee or allowing me to sleep in if i need a day to sleep.\n  ","413862":"\n  i can see both of them within myself, actually. i have my father's nose and mouth, but i have my mother's eyes. i inherited the short (as in height) gene from my mother's side of the family, but i have the analytical nature and some psychological issues that also stem from my father's side.\n  ","413863":"\n  the only thing about my external appearance that i change often is my hair. i usually color it every 4-5 months or so, and i have to maintain the shaved portions of my head as well.\n  ","413864":"\n  i'm doing well !! i had a very productive day today, and i even ran errands after work and *finally* got a call back from my doctor regarding my anxiety medication.\n  \n  so now i'm just relaxing and catching up on my questions in my inbox.\n  ","413865":"\n  i don't mind flossing because it feels better when i'm done. i floss once per day.\n  ","413866":"\n  not really. i'm not looking forward to working and waking up early, but usually once i'm there, i'm fine.\n  ","413867":"\n  yeah, it wasn't bad. i did the rest of my work today and i've just been relaxing and watching netflix while drinking tea.\n  ","413868":"\n  i'm sure some people probably do, but in general he's an attractive man.\n  ","413869":"\n  i follow 51 accounts. however, there are a lot of accounts which are backup accounts of people, and a lot of them are also inactive.\n  ","413870":"\n  no, friendship can't be forced. it only happens naturally. however, i'll answer any questions that you have.\n  ","413871":"\n  i'm definitely not conservative, haha. if anything, i'm between centrist and leftist. my beliefs align with those ideals the most.\n  ","413872":"\n  perhaps it is more of a specific regional thing, like the other anon said they heard of it referred to a penis as well.\n  \n  i mean... i've always just called it a penis. or a d*ck, haha.\n  ","413873":"\n  i think it's disgusting. you're basically sxxualizing children and things associated with children, which is wrong.\n  ","413874":"\n  i'm not posting a photo of my fridge because it's a mess rn, rofl. i have to clean it out.\n  \n  my favorite food is sushi, and lately i haven't been all that interested in pasta. it all tastes the same to me.\n  \n  tonight, i'm having chicken parm and salad with my boyfriend and his family.\n  ","413875":"\n  HAHA. it makes me wonder why strangers on the internet are curious about my boyfriend's penis.\n  ","413876":"\n  probably !! that's what i was thinking, it's interesting how each region of the world has it's own slang terms.\n  ","413877":"\n  if that personally happened to me, then i would simply shrug it off and be reminded that their opinion isn't necessarily factual. i would perhaps ask them why they thought that way and take that into consideration, but if it's totally false, then there isn't much else you can do.\n  ","413878":"\n  this sounds like a fetish question. i'll never understand how certain people have urine fetishes, it makes no sense to me. it's literally bodily waste.\n  ","413879":"\n  i've literally never heard of a penis referred to as a \"bird\" before.\n  ","413880":"\n  because it was incredibly random, as well as invasive. i'm not answering that question, lol.\n  ","413881":"\n  LMAO. congrats, this actually made me laugh out loud.\n  ","413882":"\n  he's a 28 year old man.\n  ","413883":"\n  no, i've been in a relationship for quite a few years. lol.\n  ","413884":"\n  well, he was 4 years older than me and i felt like he was taking advantage of me, so that was a major component. in addition, he lied to me all the time and i was getting tired of it. i didn't actually love him like i thought i did, i only loved the idea of him, and i didn't enjoy spending time with him anymore.\n  ","413885":"\n  he didn't -- i broke up with him, actually.\n  ","413886":"\n  yes, i would. i love my boyfriend regardless of what gender he is, and i would want him to do what makes him happiest and most comfortable with himself. if that means transitioning, then i fully support his desire and would try to help in any way possible.\n  ","413887":"\n  anyone have any questions ?? my inbox is empty ~~\n  ","413888":"\n  i hope you feel better soon !!\n  \n  do what you need to do to get well, and don't worry about askfm. you need to focus on yourself first and foremost.\n  ","413889":"\n  i'm already someone's favorite person.\n  ","413890":"\n  well i went back to bed for the past hour, lol. i wrote one assignment this morning after i got home and decided i was still tired, so i slept more.\n  \n  now that i'm awake again, i'm going to try to finish my work and drink some coffee to keep myself motivated.\n  ","413891":"\n

appear on the radio.\n  ","413895":"\n  i like having a small light on while i sleep at night. :\/ it helps me see the room somewhat instead of it being pitch black, although it's terrible to keep a light on for that length of time.\n  ","413896":"\n  i only run the water when i need it, i.e. while cleaning off my toothbrush instead of letting the water run the entire time. i also use energy-saving light bulbs.\n  ","413897":"\n  uh, askfm never said what the coins were exactly for, lol. i highly doubt they'll be giving away actual money or prizes.\n  \n  regardless, i don't want to do question for question. i don't ask people questions to begin with, and i don't make any exceptions to that.\n  ","413898":"\n  i used lexisnexis when i worked for the law firm. i don't use an e-library for my current job, though.\n  ","413899":"\n  because i would probably lose it if i kept it in my jeans, to be perfectly honest with you. lmao. at least when it's in my bag, i know exactly where it is and it isn't going anywhere.\n  \n  i have an over-the-shoulder bag, so it would be difficult to grab my bag and steal it since it's wrapped around my entire body.\n  ","413900":"\n  my favorite class when i was in high school was english literature. i took both AP literature and AP grammar, but i preferred the literature course because the teacher was much better and more interested in the class itself. i've always been a fan of literature as it is, so it melded with my interests quite well.\n  \n  i also enjoyed taking forensics when i was in high school. we studied blood spatter patterns, bullistics, famous murderers, and the psychology behind why some people k*lled and others didn't. it was an extremely interesting class.\n  ","413901":"\n  i only own one knife, and i keep it in my handbag in case i ever need it while i'm out of the house.\n  ","413902":"\n  aw, thank you !! :'))\n  ","413903":"\n  thank you so much ~~\n  ","413904":"\n  i honestly have no idea, i haven't weighed myself in a long time.\n  ","413905":"\n  aw, thank you !! i didn't think i could pull off blue because i've never tried it before, but i was pleasantly surprised. one of the best colors i've ever dyed my hair.\n  ","413906":"\n  yeah !! i bought a wig for my halloween costume last year.\n  ","413907":"\n  LOL, yes. well i drink coffee as i'm writing, but writing exhausts me sometimes so i took two naps yesterday, lmao.\n  ","413908":"\n  so after thinking about this question and discussing it briefly with another anon on here (lol), i think it should ideally go on a case by case basis, so the age would change depending on the circumstances and severity of the crime.\n  \n  i would agree with my previous anon and say anywhere between 12-14 because you definitely know right from wrong at that stage. however, it does ultimately depend on the child themselves.\n  ","413909":"\n  ugh -- it's literally the worst. especially people who don't even look when changing lanes and figure \"hey, they'll move out of my way!\"\n  \n  fucking hell. it's so terrible. i want to live in an area where i don't have to deal with other drivers, lmao.\n  ","413910":"\n  i hate everything about driving. i hate the anxiety i experience when i get behind the wheel. i hate dealing with other drivers who always think they're entitled to the road. i hate sitting in traffic every day.\n  ","413911":"\n  \u2615 ? \u2712\ufe0f\u2615 ?\u2712\ufe0f\u2615 ?\u2712\ufe0f??\n  ","413912":"\n  i think it's good !! there are a lot of bugs because it's still relatively new, but the graphics are beautiful and it helps a lot if you have friends to play with, considering its multiplayer.\n  \n  i would suggest buying it if it goes on sale -- that way if you don't personally like it, at least you won't feel as terrible spending money on it. i would also watch a lot of streamers play the game so you get a better feel for what it's all about before you decide to purchase it.\n  ","413913":"\n  amused, lol. that's such a juvenile thing to say and imply, it's something someone would say if they were in high school. nobody can make a person \"cool\" and being \"cool\" is a subjective trait.\n  ","413914":"\n  idk, i've never had one before.\n  ","413915":"\n  i don't like the taste of pineapple usually, so no.\n  ","413916":"\n  i've been playing fallout 76 lately. however, i also really enjoy the rest of the fallout series, skyrim, assassin's creed, the bioshock series, the halo series, life is strange, and destiny 2.\n  ","413917":"\n  it wasn't something i did regularly, but i was a terrible friend in the past where i would purposely manipulate friends for my own gain, like using them basically for drugs and alcohol. then i ended up dropping them completely when they weren't useful to me anymore.\n  ","413918":"\n  i don't own a playstation 4, so xbox one by default.\n  ","413919":"\n  yeah, it's happened on a few occasions, in both situations where i was apologizing for my wrong behavior and where i was reaching out because i was concerned about them.\n  \n  it's understandable in both instances. if i wronged someone, then it makes sense for them not to want to talk to me and i accept that. i can't be everyone's friend and i make mistakes like everyone else. in the case of someone struggling and not responding when i reached out, that's also understandable because sometimes people don't have the energy in them to respond to things like that.\n  ","413920":"\n  i don't consider myself to be very interesting, but all right.\n  ","413921":"\n  yeah, there are so many factors involved. it should ideally go on a case by case basis.\n  ","413922":"\n  yes, it's wrong. and i think you know it's wrong too, considering you sent this question out to ask for a second opinion.\n  \n  either break up with your girlfriend or stop cheating on her. chances are she doesn't deserve that kind of heartbreak.\n  ","413923":"\n  i was thinking somewhere around there too. at that age, you obviously know the difference between right and wrong. however, idk what the current laws are now regarding the topic and i also think it heavily depends on the crime itself.\n  ","413924":"\n  LOL. i still want to do some research on the topic first.\n  ","413925":"\n  as my bio indicates, i live in new york.\n  ","413926":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","413927":"\n  it's an opinion question that i have to think about because i'm not sure what my opinion is on the issue.\n  ","413928":"\n  i only have one question in my inbox besides this one.\n  ","413929":"\n  continue driving. i'm not going to give someone the satisfaction of an emotional response on the road, and plus i'm usually too focused on actually driving to really have a reaction to begin with.\n  ","413930":"\n  i don't talk privately with strangers on askfm.\n  ","413931":"\n  sometimes i get angry, but most of the time i'm concerned about my safety so i don't allow myself to become angry because it could impede on my driving.\n  \n  i've never flipped anyone off before, lol. that's just an invitation for trouble.\n  ","413932":"\n  nah, it doesn't anger me. it's useless to emotionally invest yourself into something a stranger thinks they know about you.\n  \n  i delete most of the anon hate i get because it doesn't warrant or deserve a response.\n  ","413933":"\n  if it's lighthearted and people know that they're just teasing, i see nothing wrong with it. my coworkers and i make fun of each other semi-regularly, but that's also because we hang out on breaks every day, lol.\n  ","413934":"\n  i went to alt92.3's not so silent night at the barclays center last december. i don't remember everyone who was there, but i saw mike shinoda, bastille, AJR, muse, florence and the machine, and death cab for cutie !!\n  ","413935":"\n  i went to public school.\n  ","413936":"\n  when i was growing up, i had a dog for quite a few years. she passed away around the time i was 19\/20 years ago.\n  \n  since then, i've only had fish -- two bettas and a corycat.\n  ","413937":"\n  i don't know much about comedy, but i'm fairly certain that not *all* comedians make racist jokes.\n  ","413938":"\n  i don't need space from my boyfriend really, but i do need space from my friends and people in general. i value my alone time a lot, and i always need time to recharge after i've been out or at work for too many hours. i like the quiet.\n  ","413939":"\n  if your idea of a joke is blatant racism, then you probably aren't very funny, rofl.\n  ","413940":"\n  i seldom wear rings unless i'm going out to a formal occasion. my boyfriend has bought me a few over the years, and i try not to wear them often because i'm honestly afraid to lose them. in addition, it impedes on my typing speed at work.\n  ","413941":"\n  who cares what they think of you. their behavior is not appropriate for the workplace and they need to be reprimanded accordingly.\n  ","413942":"\n  talk to them directly and tell them that their behavior is inappropriate and racist. if they continue doing it, then i would probably go to HR.\n  ","413943":"\n  i don't remember my dreams most of the time, so i honestly can't say.\n  ","413944":"\n  i'm from new york. as for my goals and career plans, i want to eventually move up within my company and obtain more responsibilities (which equals out to more money). i want to continue in the field i'm currently in and perhaps do more freelance work.\n  ","413945":"\n  sometimes i regret them, while other times i know there's nothing i can do about those mistakes now & the only thing i *can* do is learn from those mistakes and move on with the knowledge that i can do better.\n  \n  i try not to think about the past ; rather, i've learned over the years to be more mindful of the present.\n  ","413946":"\n  i don't believe that the united states is the best country in the world, lol.\n  ","413947":"\n  i didn't eat lunch.\n  ","413948":"\n  it doesn't change my mind either way. if he doesn't ask my father, it's not as if i won't marry him. also if my father said no, i would marry him anyway. it's not something that makes a difference to me personally.\n  ","413949":"\n  right now, he's at work so he's probably thinking about what he needs to do and now to do his job efficiently.\n  ","413950":"\n  nothing in particular, unfortunately. i would say my tax returns but i don't suspect i'll get much money back.\n  ","413951":"\n  anyone have any questions for me while i work on some freelance writing ?? my inbox is empty ~~\n  ","413952":"\n  zero. i've never displayed psychotic symptoms.\n  ","413953":"\n  smoked with a squeeze of lemon on top of it.\n  ","413954":"\n  seafood is all right. i don't love it, but i'll eat salmon every now and again.\n  ","413955":"\n  writing freelance assignments, cleaning, and doing laundry usually. i also take a nap in the middle of the day since i'm normally tired by 2pm.\n  ","413956":"\n  uh, it's after 10am, lol. i normally wake up around 8:30am which is sleeping in for me, actually.\n  \n  i haven't done much today at all so far besides write one assignment and eat breakfast.\n  ","413957":"\n  uh, i'm not anywhere close to being \"insane,\" lmao. i have a firm grasp on reality and i don't struggle with any symptoms that correlate with insanity.\n  ","413958":"\n  i've heard of it, but i've never watched it before !! it sounds like it would be right up my alley.\n  ","413959":"\n  aw, thank you !! i was never interested in journalism persay, but most of my freelance work has to do with press releases and other written features that clients pay for to get more online exposure, like website articles and magazine features.\n  ","413960":"\n  yeah, which is terrible. most americans also work 2 or more jobs just to keep afloat. i technically work two jobs because my work week doesn't end on friday -- i also do freelance work on the weekends, so i'm basically writing for profit every day of the week.\n  ","413961":"\n  LOL. i remember reading about a study somewhere in europe (perhaps the netherlands or denmark?), where people had shorter work weeks or only worked 4 days per week instead of 5 days. it ended up leading to more productivity throughout the week and employees were happier. i thought that was incredibly interesting.\n  ","413962":"\n  yes, that's entirely true. and i'm glad that there's more exposure to mental health problems in the workplace and companies are becoming more understanding of people's need to take time for themselves to recoup and recharge. there's still somewhat of a stigma that exists, but for the most people, people are understanding and encourage \"mental health days\" because it leads to better productivity when the person returns to work.\n  ","413963":"\n  thank you !! i didn't know that. i'll definitely keep that in mind in case my mental health declines. thankfully it's gotten much better within the past two years thanks to medication and therapy, but it still comes and goes in waves somewhat. if i'm out of work, it's usually only for one day at a time and it only happens perhaps once or twice per month.\n  ","413964":"\n  me too. the woman in HR has had her own host of medical issues, and there are a lot of people in my office who deal with mental health issues (including my immediate boss, whom i've spoken to multiple times about my problems). so i think that she's more sympathetic than anything else because she knows what it's like to be struggling.\n  \n  i've never used FMLA before, but i do have the paperwork in case anything does happen. i was out of work for about a week with my last job when i was first diagnosed because i was very s*icidal, but that job was fine with just a doctor's note excusing me from working for the week.\n  ","413965":"\n  honestly, the world would probably be more at peace because there wouldn't have been any religious wars and people wouldn't feel the need to be in conflict with religions that differ from their own. a lot of people (not saying all people, obviously) feel like their religion is the \"best\" religion and every other religion is \"wrong,\" which leads to a lot of conflict.\n  ","413966":"\n  this past week, i've been dealing with a lot of anxiety due to running out of my medication. unfortunately, my doctor hasn't returned any of my phone calls to prescribe me something else or at least a different milligram of my medication to hold me over until the pharmacy gets more in stock. i was extremely panicked on thursday & ended up leaving work early because i couldn't stop my racing thoughts and nerves and crying, and i spent the rest of the afternoon exhausted in bed.\n  \n  i don't know if there was any silver lining associated with it besides the lesson that i need to take better care of myself. thankfully, my company was completely understanding of what i went through and offered their help if needed, and HR even said that it's good that i knew to leave work because i have to take care of myself first and foremost.\n  ","413967":"\n  it sounds like the rule is meant to keep dogs safe in the car, which is something i fully support. there are so many people who travel with their dogs in their laps or unrestrained in the backseat, which can lead to a lot of distractions and possible accidents.\n  \n  i've never traveled with my own dog in the car, but when my boyfriend and i are transporting his dog to places like to get groomed or going to the vet, we usually have him on the leash in the backseat with a cover over the seats that prevents him from climbing into the front seat. thankfully, his dog behaves really well in the car and just lays down the entire time, so it isn't something we had to worry about.\n  ","413968":"\n  don't invest your time and energy into people who aren't willing to do the same for you in return. it's a lesson i previously learned in the past as well, but a situation arose in which i had to distance myself from a close friend because they kept taking advantage of the friendship and refused to see the error of their ways whenever it was discussed with them.\n  ","413969":"\n  i've called the police, a rental service, and a radio station. i've never called the rest of what you listed, however.\n  ","413970":"\n  i honestly can't remember the last new movie i saw. i re-watched the crow a few months ago, and i absolutely love that movie because i like themes that have to do with revenge. the dialogue was also wonderful and the characters were well-rounded.\n  ","413971":"\n  completely androgynous, with a flat chest and skinny bodice. my hair would probably remain the same because i love the half-shaved, half-long look, and my face would also be thinned out so my cheekbones would be more prominent.\n  ","413972":"\n  yeah, i've blocked certain family members from seeing my posts in the past, when you create a new status, there's a button that shows who you're sharing the status to, and you can click on that and change it to say \"hide x, y, and z.\" you can hide certain people from seeing your posts that way.\n  \n  however, much like\n  \n   @CelineM96\n  \n  said earlier, facebook isn't really the best means of finding a new job. i've personally found the best results on sites like indeed.com, ziprecruiter.com, and monster.com.\n  ","413973":"\n  do you mean like pens and stuff ?? if so, then yeah. i don't really keep much at my desk, though. i only have a few pens and some notepads, but i seldom use them.\n  ","413974":"\n  \"if you're going through hell, keep going.\"\n  \n  it basically means that you've survived this far, and you have the potential to survive again. don't give up hope in the face of adversity, and you'll indeed make it through to the other side.\n  ","413975":"\n  how about a selfie instead ;\n  ","413976":"\n  i mean, my best friend & i go months without texting each other. two weeks is literally nothing. i would just respond to them accordingly as if nothing happened.\n  ","413977":"\n  neither -- beer.\n  ","413978":"\n  ... what ... i have literally no words. lmao.\n  \n  some people are out of this world. literally. that's so ridiculous i cannot even fathom his rationale.\n  ","413979":"\n  his mother passed away. i clearly stated that in my answers.\n  ","413980":"\n  \"sanguine\" has always been appealing to me, both aesthetically and in meaning.\n  ","413981":"\n  i think dreams are either randomized or they're reflections of our subconscious. sometimes dreams can be meaningful, but there are also dreams which are utterly meaningless, which makes dream interpretation tricky.\n  \n  i think most of my dreams are meaningless, but i've also had a few dreams that did indicate i was stressed out or upset (like the climbing up a hill or teeth falling out ones). i also used to have frequent nightmares which were very graphic, and i think those were also indications of my stress levels too.\n  ","413982":"\n  i seldom remember my dreams, but the last portion of a dream that i remember having was from earlier in the week. someone i knew was in the hospital for four days last week, and in my dream, they were randomly in my boyfriend's house wearing a ball gown and hugged & kissed me hello as i walked through the door, lmao.\n  ","413983":"\n  probably askfm, lmao. i always enter the app if i see i have a new question (if i'm not doing anything else) and then i just catch up on my feed after i answer the question(s).\n  ","413984":"\n  it was the best decision i honestly could have ever made. his family *still* talks about how helpful i was & how grateful they are that i was home to help them during that time, because no one else in their lives stepped up to help at all. and that was nine years ago.\n  \n  sometimes even the simplest decisions can make a huge impact on people. returning home meant the world to him and his family, even though they didn't expect me to make that leap, and i put myself in a better headspace because it prompted me to mature and be responsible. i would have gone down a darker road, i expect, had i stayed in massachusetts.\n  ","413985":"\n  it was really complicated, so there were multiple reasons. the first reason was that i was severely depressed my first year of college, and i ended up failing the same class two semesters in a row (which was unheard of for me, considering i got straight As in high school). the second reason was that my boyfriend's mother passed away, among other things going wrong with his family, so i felt the need to be closer to him to help him and his family during that hard part of their lives.\n  \n  it was overall a better, healthier decision for me. i flourished when i returned home, and i was also able to remain close with my boyfriend and his family and help them out whenever they needed it during that transition phase, among other things.\n  ","413986":"\n  originally massachusetts for one year, then i returned to new york.\n  ","413987":"\n  uh, pretty much any question on here pertaining to fetishes are weird af. keep that sh*t out of my inbox, thx.\n  ","413988":"\n  talking on the phone has always given me terrible anxiety. it's difficult for me to explain things verbally to begin with, but over the phone makes it 10x worse for some reason.\n  \n  i.e. i had a phone at my last job and sometimes i would have to speak to clients about their cases. which always gave me either horrible anxiety or a full-blown panic attack. i dreaded going to work each day because of not only the general stress of the job, but also because of the possibility of having to talk to clients on the phone. they were never pleasant experiences either.\n  ","413989":"\n  i only talk to my boyfriend on the phone -- i prefer that over texting because he's terrible at texting back, and it's easier to have a conversation verbally than through text.\n  \n  the last time i video chatted with someone was when i was using oovoo in college, lol. i would video chat with my boyfriend, as well as my best friend, because they both lives in different states than me.\n  ","413990":"\n  i've never owned an iphone, so i honestly don't know much about them. i've only had android phones once smartphones started coming out.\n  ","413991":"\n  -- i'm monogamous.\n  \n  -- no, my hair is not my natural color (lol). my hair is currently blue, but my natural hair color is dark blonde.\n  \n  -- i'm only allergic to seasonal allergies.\n  \n  -- yes, i believe in s*x before marriage. if you're planning on spending the rest of your life with someone and s*x will be an important part of that relationship, then you have to see if you're s*xually compatible.\n  \n  -- my boyfriend and i were long distance for about nine months when we first started dating, so i guess so, lol.\n  \n  -- i'm 100 percent pro choice. people should have the right to decide what to do with their own bodies in terms of pregnancies. they have bodily autonomy, and everyone has the right to terminate a pregnancy

favorite food lately has been sushi, and my favorite drink will forever be coffee.\n  \n  -- i support black lives matter. the whole notion of black lives matter arose because of the injustices committed against black people in the legal system, and just because people are raising awareness of those injustices doesn't mean that injustices toward other people don't exist.\n  \n  -- yes, global warming\/climate change is real.\n  ","413993":"\n  -- the only language i speak is english.\n  \n  -- i don't have any pets currently, but i used to have two fish.\n  \n  -- i don't label myself as a feminist due to the stigma held against modern-day feminism, but some of my beliefs align with intersectional feminism.\n  \n  -- i don't have any necessary dietary restrictions, although lately i've been focusing on cutting out more carbs and eating more lean proteins and whole grains.\n  \n  -- all of my pet peeves have to do with driving, lol. i hate when people don't use blinkers or drive too slowly in the left lane.\n  \n  -- traits in others i appreciate the most are honesty, loyalty, a sense of humor, and maturity.\n  \n  -- my own worst trait, in my opinion, is my mood instability, which can cause me to question everything around me and makes me unpredictable. it's gotten more under control in recent years, but it's still somewhat there.\n  \n  -- my five year plan

I recently had to teach someone on here what a QPR is because of straight, cis girls trying to \"be cute\" and fit in with LGBTQ+ people and using our terms.?\n  \n  --\n  \n  ugh, that sounds so obnoxious. people who are straight & cisgender who try to fit in with the lgbtq+ community normally have zero understanding of what it's actually like to be lgbt, just because they believe that being gay is \"trendy\" ... for some odd reason. like, just because you have a stereotypically sassy gay best friend doesn't mean you're entitled to be part of the community. lmao.\n  ","414008":"\n  i absolutely agree !! idk, i've personally always felt weird calling myself queer even though i *am* bisexual, it's just one of those words that i feel like i'm not qualified to use, if that makes sense ?? especially because i'm cis-passing and i'm in a relationship with a man, idk.\n  \n  but it happens a lot where a lot of straight people try to include themselves into the lgbtq+ community, i think it's sickening.\n  ","414009":"\n  i really appreciate\n  \n   @Courrtana\n  \n  , so so much. she's such an amazing friend and i know i can always go to her with my struggles. she tries to take time out to check up on her friends even when she's not feeling well herself, and i think that needs to be appreciated more often.\n  ","414010":"\n  i paid $7 for a cup of coffee a few weeks ago, lmao. it was ridiculously absurd to pay that much money for coffee, but i felt like treating myself & trying something new.\n  ","414011":"\n  my boyfriend inspires me. he's endured so much adversity growing up and he's survived everything, and he continues to live his life to the best of his ability despite those struggles. he's never once spent time feeling sorry for himself, or if he has it was short-lived, and he's the hardest working person i know, both in his personal and professional lives.\n  ","414012":"\n  other people's opinions, specifically those of acquaintances or strangers. i used to worry incessantly about what people thought of me, but as i've gotten older, i started caring less and less.\n  \n  if you cared about what *everyone* thought about you, then your brain would be in shambles. it's easier to go through life only caring about what *you* believe and think of yourself, as well as perhaps your significant other or a close friend.\n  ","414013":"\n  i like my

notice the sounds of the filters anymore (or his fish thrashing around, rofl).\n  ","414017":"\n  no, i've surprisingly never felt that way before. people who know me or read my answers know that i'm a straightforward person, so if i had something to say about a topic, then i would just message that person off-anon or privately. i've never been worried about being misconstrued as an obnoxious anon.\n  ","414018":"\n  i've always rolled my eyes at all of these weird orientations that have popped up recently, because i feel as if people are trying to slap the \"queer\" label onto something that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with being gay. sapios*xual is one of them.\n  \n  most people are attracted to intelligence to begin with, so it's not out of the ordinary for people to look at someone and find them more attractive because they're either educated or highly intelligent. while education is indeed a privilege, you don't necessarily have to have a formal education in order to be intelligent either. sometimes it just comes naturally.\n  \n  at the same time, however, i couldn't care less how other people decide to label themselves because it doesn't affect my life at all. i've just always thought the whole sapios*xual label was a bit redundant.\n  ","414019":"\n  yeah, quite a few times actually. needless to say, i broke off the friendships because i knew i didn't deserve to be used like how they were trying to use me.\n  \n  i'm also somewhat going through the same situation now, again, but it's different because this person has been my friend for 10 years and they've only started exhibiting these behavioral changes within the past year or so. however, every time they're spoken to about what they're doing wrong, they just shrug it off and continue doing what they're doing. it's tiring and exhausting, and all of their friends are getting hurt in the process.\n  ","414020":"\n  last night, i found beauty in the mundane. i saw my boyfriend, which obviously isn't unusual, but the conversations we had last night were beautiful, even though we were just talking about our days and what feelings we were experiencing. there's always a certain beauty in honest conversation, when you've connected so intimately with a person that the dialogue flows more greatly than water and you understand each other on a deep, emotional level.\n  \n  on the surface, it just probably looked like two people having a conversation. however, it felt so much more than that and it was beautiful in my eyes.\n  ","414021":"\n  i'm probably not going to live that long to the point where i'll be unable to take care of myself. and if i do end up living that long, i hope i somehow d*e so i never have to put that responsibility upon someone else.\n  ","414022":"\n  i would rather explore the ocean. there's still so much we don't know about our own planet, and it's intriguing to me how even though we've advanced so far technologically, we still don't have the resources or technology available to explore the deepest depths of the ocean.\n  ","414023":"\n  i'm not proud of the united states, so there's no picture for me to post. i would say that i'm proud of the civic advancements we've accomplished, but at the same time, we're also *so* far behind other countries and there is still a lot of discrimination that exists on a large scale level.\n

years.\n  ","414025":"\n  \"the vampire chronicles\" by anne rice are really compelling, well written books. i also enjoyed the psychology behind \"i am not a serial killer\" by dan wells and the

sometimes i wake up every hour, so i'll smoke marijuana or take some anxiety medications to sleep throughout the night. however, most of the time, my sleep is uninterrupted.\n  ","414030":"\n  i've

time i received good news (even though other bad things were happening, ironically).\n  \n  my boyfriend has been struggling with his life for a while now, and he was only able to really admit to myself that he would feel better if he changed his ways slightly recently. we had a long discussion about his feelings and what to do to make him feel more fulfilled in his life, and he came to the conclusion that he should spend more time making experiences and generally enjoying life -- to work to live, not to live to work, if that makes sense.\n  \n  it made me happy because he seemed more motivated and hopeful just from having that conversation alone, and i want him to do what's best for himself.\n  ","414051":"\n  i think it goes on a case-by-case basis. you have to ask yourself why they aren't improving -- it is a lack of motivation, are they going through a rough patch in their lives, or do they sincerely believe they're doing nothing wrong ??\n  \n  i'm dealing with this situation myself rn, actually. sometimes it's better to distance yourself from people who see nothing wrong with their actions and don't want to improve because it can be detrimental to your own progress and well being.\n  ","414052":"\n  my breaking point is when i have a full on mental breakdown or meltdown -- crying uncontrollably, wanting to throw things across the room, exploding at other people, isolating myself, etc etc.\n  ","414053":"\n  i picked it up from my boyfriend, because he says this phrase a lot too -- \"it is what it is.\"\n  \n  it can be helpful in some situations where you cannot change the outcome, and the only thing you can do is deal with what comes next and make the most out of the situation.\n  ","414054":"\n  there's nothing wrong with having roommates, as long as they're responsible and good with money. the two people we have in mind are extremely hard working, responsible people.\n  ","414055":"\n  that's the only way we would be able to afford a house. my boyfriend and i have discussed it & a house is a more ideal choice for us, but we would need roommates to keep afloat. we already have two people on board, so we'll see what happens.\n  ","414056":"\n  it entirely depends on the reason why they're home to begin with. if they're not motivated and aren't actively working or going to school or anything, then i think the parents need to be strict with them and help them get their sh*t straightened out.\n  \n  however, if they're actively working, or going to school, and generally trying to do what they can to make the most out of their life, then i see no reason for them to be kicked out. most of the time, people of that age don't *want* to live at home but they don't have any other choice, whether it's for personal, medical, or financial reasons.\n  ","414057":"\n  my short-term goals are to continue working extra hours to gain more money in the next few weeks, spend more quality time with my boyfriend, and eventually get

married.\n  ","414058":"\n  it's funny you mention that because i was just watching a docuseries entitled \"encounters with evil\" which discusses serial k*llers \/ thrill k*llers and whether or not their inclinations toward violence are genetic or environmental.\n  \n  i think criminals who are the most \"evil\" (though i don't really believe in the whole evil thing) are the ones who k*ll with no motive behind their actions whatsoever -- they hurt others just for the \"fun\" of it, and that's more terrifying that anything else.\n  ","414059":"\n  i normally listen to a playlist. i don't

ridiculous how those companies can sell your information to third parties like that.\n  \n  idk if the act of selling information should necessarily be illegal because you have to agree to it

as for the whole disregard for the law thing ... lmao. yeah, he's had some instances in the past where it was fairly questionable. he likes to take matters into his own hands.\n  ","414110":"\n  i think it's wrong to make assumptions on people based on a mental illness -- while the mental illness may explain an aspect of them, it doesn't define every facet of them, and no two people with the same disorder are alike.\n  \n  my boyfriend has questioned whether he has ASPD, but he never went to a psychologist to inquire further about it. i think he has some traits, but not enough to meet the diagnostic criteria.\n  ","414111":"\n  yeah, where i live plastic bags cost five cents each. the county implemented it in an effort to reduce plastic because of the effects it has on the environment.\n  ","414112":"\n  generally speaking, yes. i try to retain an open mind and see things from other people's perspectives in an effort to understand where they're coming from and come to a mutual agreement. however, it does depend on the other person as well, because you can only do so much when the other person isn't cooperating or doesn't know how to come to a peaceful resolution.\n  ","414113":"\n  i honestly have no clue. every year has it's ups & downs, and 2018 was rather uneventful as a whole in terms of my personal life. i believe my best years are still ahead of me.\n  ","414114":"\n  instead of buying bottles of water, i have a reusable cup that i use every day (and it helps that my fridge has a filter in it). i bring my own bags to the grocery store so that i don't have to pay for plastic bags. i carpool with friends if we're going out instead of everyone wasting gas & driving separately. i pack my own lunches and bring them to work instead of buying food at the cafeteria.\n  ","414115":"\n  it used to be ideal in the past, but i believe times have changed and now it's the easiest method to divide a nation and turn each side against each other. the democrats blame the republicans, and the republicans blame the democrats. it's silly and childish, and i do believe there should be more options available or at least *some* reform regarding the political system as a whole.\n  ","414116":"\n  i believe it means that if we get our heart broken, it does take us a bit of time to come to terms with the heartbreak and open ourselves up to the possibility of meeting someone new. however, our view on love is indefinitely changed from that experience, and we're constantly being shaped by our experiences with love, whether it's romantic or platonic.\n  \n  it's also a fact of getting older too. our perspectives on love change as we evolve into mature human beings, and values we desired in the past might not reflect who we are in the present or in the future.\n  ","414117":"\n  the only time a brand's political stance pushes me away from endorsing or using that brand is when they exhibit opinions that directly oppress or discriminate against a group of people, whether it's racist or sexist or homophobic or transphobic, etc etc. i'm also turned off when a brand explicitly states they're pro-life.\n  ","414118":"\n  this sorta coincides with my last answer regarding toxic masculinity, actually. the whole point of the commercial is to challenge toxic masculinity and give examples as to how men in general can improve, especially in terms of teaching their children how to behave instead of brushing off problematic behavior as \"boys will be boys.\"\n  \n  instead, people have misinterpreted the commercial to be an attack on men as a whole, and like i stated in my previous answer, it seems as if the only people who are offended by the commercial are those who feed into toxic masculinity because they're been so brainwashed by it over the years.\n  ","414119":"\n  i think it entirely depends on the context it's in. because there are some instances where it's factually correct to say \"not all x do y.\" it's a simple fact of life, but there are also moments where people say that phrase as a means of backing themselves up if they're not making a valid point or they're using it as a scapegoat.\n  \n  i.e. \"not all men.\" when men become combative when people critique toxic masculinity, sometimes the whole \"not all men\" thing comes up. however, it's fully evident that it isn't all men who behave that way. however, the problem arises when there's such a societal expectation for men to behave in a specific way and *that's* what we're focusing on. the people who get offended by that are usually the ones who are feeding into those stereotypes.\n  ","414120":"\n  it's a common phrase, but thankfully i've never actually heard a person IRL use it without being sarcastic.\n  \n  however, i mainly think it's a statement used by men who *think* they're nice guys, when really they're not as nice as they believe they are & they're basically relying on that phrase to give themselves validation that they're right. instead of looking at themselves critically and wondering how they could do better.\n  ","414121":"\n  it's all right -- tbh it gave me a backbone and taught me to allow other people's opinions and feelings to roll off my back. at the end of the day, *they're* the ones with the problem and i'm under no obligation to take on that problem as my own.\n  ","414122":"\n  it was a nightmare, but i had no experience and i was very young when i first got the job, so i didn't have much of a choice besides to work in retail. i can't tell you how many times i drove home crying or ran into the stock room to cry because customers were so cruel.\n  ","414123":"\n  LOL. sometimes when i'm down, i feel that way. however, generally i have a realist outlook towards my own life and i understand that while sometimes bad things happen, you shouldn't let them define you or bring you down. the best thing you can do in those circumstances is understand that it's a bad moment, not a bad life, and you can persevere and rise above those challenges.\n  ","414124":"\n  self-doubt, my lack of confidence, and my anxiety and incessant worry over things out of my control. i'm sure if all of those things magically disappeared, i would be a better, more fulfilled person.\n  ","414125":"\n  i prefer frozen yogurt because it's generally healthier for you. however, i cannot resist chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. which is why i seldom buy it.\n  ","414126":"\n  a car, if that counts ?? my second car got totaled when i got into an accident many years ago. granted, the accident wasn't my fault and there was virtually nothing i could do to avoid it, but it was probably the most expensive thing i've ever \"broken.\"\n  ","414127":"\n  when i do my proofreading, i mainly make sure the sentences flow well and aren't awkwardly placed, the grammar is correct, everything is consistent, and the entire piece follows AP style. i also fact check the pieces against the information it was based off of to ensure that everything is factually correct.\n  ","414128":"\n  yeah, that pretty much defines the first 4 years of my professional life when i worked in retail. i still can't believe i put up with that crap for so long.\n  \n  some of the customers were nice, but most of them were middle aged to elderly people who couldn't take no for an answer and had no idea how sales or coupons worked. i can't tell you how many times i got berated because a coupon was expired, a sale ended, they didn't buy enough items to qualify for the sale, etc etc.\n  ","414129":"\n  plot twist ; i never learned how to ride a bicycle.\n  ","414130":"\n  uh, taco bell. LOL.\n  \n  i ordered a burrito off of their power menu, so it was expensive in terms of taco bell prices, but it was ... so worth it.\n  ","414131":"\n  i've never worn braces, but i've been thinking about eventually getting invisalign in the future.\n  ","414132":"\n  i'm sure there are some programs that don't incorporate religion into their meetings. it's all a matter of finding the right social worker and group of people who work out well for you.\n  ","414133":"\n  depends on the values of the relationship. some people think it's a good gesture while others don't really care either way. a lot of people view it as a matter of respect.\n  ","414134":"\n  you do realize sex and gender are two different things, right ?? i'm assigned female at birth (sex) but i'm also non-binary (gender). there's nothing contradictory about that.\n  \n  as for therapy, we only touched upon it once or twice due to my body dysmorphia, but we mainly talk about what's happening in my life in the present moment & relating my feelings to perhaps some moment in the past that would have influenced those feelings and behaviors.\n  ","414135":"\n  i've only ever sent nude photos to my boyfriend.\n  ","414136":"\n  thank you ~~\n  ","414137":"\n  eventually, yeah. i cut down a lot already because i've been vaping too.\n  ","414138":"\n  because i wanted to comment on the person who thought she was my anon, obviously.\n  ","414139":"\n  it's values are completely contrary to the customs and societal trends of western society. although i think it has a lot to do with the regions islam is most prevalent, i.e. the middle east, because the culture of the middle east largely influences the values of islam as well.\n  ","414140":"\n  how do i appease anyone ?? i don't even talk about anyone on my page. and if people mock me, they're sure not making it obvious or saying it to my face, which basically makes it worthless.\n  ","414141":"\n  thank you !! it's from over the summer, but it's one of the only photos where you can really see my shaved head.\n  ","414142":"\n  LOL. absolutely zero dollars, unfortunately. what i wouldn't give to get rid of them.\n  ","414143":"\n  i speak my mind all the time, lmao. half of my page is me giving my opinion on things.\n  ","414144":"\n  i already have half of my head shaved, lol.\n  ","414145":"\n  that's never happened to me before, so idk how i would react honestly.\n  ","414146":"\n  i've intervened in a verbal fight, not a physical fight.\n  ","414147":"\n  yeah, definitely. when i was 15, i tried drinking alcohol for the first time because my friends had a bad influence on me, and i smoked marijuana for the first time when i was 16 years old.\n  ","414148":"\n  who would i even snitch to ?? lmao. i'm only surrounded by adults, and adults have the ability to make their own decisions.\n  ","414149":"\n  tbh i don't even remember what prompted me to start smoking cigarettes. i remember i was 18 years old when i started & i was in college, but idk if one of my friends asked me if i wanted one or if i picked up the habit myself.\n  ","414150":"\n  no, not at all. there are a lot of people who have never had the desire to smoke cigarettes.\n  ","414151":"\n  anyone have any questions while i work on some freelance assignments ?? :'))\n  ","414152":"\n  we don't talk outside of askfm or anything, and i think we only follow each other on instagram.\n  ","414153":"\n  meh, not really. i *was* looking forward to finally having one of my meds again because there's been a bad shortage and i haven't had it for a week, but apparently it's still on backorder. ugh.\n  ","414154":"\n  aw, thank you. i hope your day goes well too !!\n  \n  for the rest of the afternoon, i'm planning on finishing my freelance work. then i'm going to clean up a little bit and head to my boyfriend's house to watch the superbowl with him and his family.\n  ","414155":"\n  this isn't an appropriate question to ask someone.\n  ","414156":"\n  my day has been a bit wild, lol. i woke up early this morning, which was actually a great thing because my boyfriend ended up texting me and asking me to bring him insulin because he needed it at work & he couldn't leave work. so i had to rush to bring him insulin prior to my doctor's appointment at 11am, which i thankfully made on time.\n  \n  since i got home from my appointment, i've been working on some freelance assignments for my job.\n  ","414157":"\n  yes. when i was in high school, i went from having hair that was a little longer than shoulder length to a very short pixie cut.\n  ","414158":"\n  i've always preferred shorter hair on myself, which is shorter than shoulder length. when my hair is longer, it becomes really limp and straggly and doesn't generally look good.\n  ","414159":"\n  i'm not entirely sure, which is why i've kept this question in my inbox for a few days. the only good thing about focusing on what is going wrong is that it's easier to spot mistakes and correcting them accordingly. if we only focused on things that are going well, we might overlook the things that *do* go wrong and not be able to fix them at all.\n  ","414160":"\n  to a degree, yes. i was raised surrounded by american culture, as well as the regional culture, so it's had an effect on my perspectives as well as my patterns of speech.\n  ","414161":"\n  she has verbally & physically abvsed me for as long as i could remember. she hasn't touched me since she became disabled because she's basically bedridden now, but she still verbally attacks me and my father on a regular basis.\n  ","414162":"\n  depending on the situation, i may be able to sue them for negligence if they didn't tell me they had HIV at all.\n  ","414163":"\n  i would rather fly to wherever i want to go, which is looking like either new england or somewhere down south, depending on which area i like better.\n  \n  i won't be able to thrive living where i am now because prices have been skyrocketing in new york in general, and my best option is to move out of state.\n  ","414164":"\n  i believe most people needs love, to some degree, in order to survive. whether it's through family, friends, or their significant other. love doesn't always have to be romantic and it's super important to have a support system when you're struggling.\n  ","414165":"\n  don't settle for anything less than what you deserve. if your partner, or a potential partner, shows any red flags for abvse or controlling behavior, then get rid of them. most people deserve to be in healthy, loving relationships where there is open communication and patience.\n  ","414166":"\n  i'm seldom happy with my selfies, which is why i rarely post them. however, a few of them do come out good, which are the ones i do post.\n  \n  i don't post selfies, or pictures in general, that i don't like. however, i'm comfortable sending ugly selfies to my boyfriend, especially if it's over snapchat, lol.\n  ","414167":"\n  i own a car. i never learned how to ride a bicycle.\n  ","414168":"\n  i found out that someone i know was admitted to the hospital on friday because they had a flare up of their medical condition, and doctors can't figure out what's wrong with her. she's hopefully going to be released today, but i wouldn't be surprised if they keep her for another few days.\n  ","414169":"\n  go to your local pet store and see if someone can help you in finding a medication that will treat her. or call your vet and tell them you can't afford to take her in and ask for advice.\n  \n  adversely, you can also see if the vet will set up payment plans for you instead of paying for the vet bill all at once.\n  ","414170":"\n  drink coffee & smoke cigarettes, lol.\n  ","414171":"\n  i prefer water slides. roller coasters have always scared me.\n  ","414172":"\n  i don't know who you're talking about, so no.\n  ","414173":"\n  manipulated people to get what i wanted out of them by taking advantage of their kindness. i look back on those memories with regret, but unfortunately there's nothing i can do about it now. i was young and naive.\n  ","414174":"\n  spending the day with my boyfriend is the perfect day for me, because it feels like a vacation away from home whenever i spend time with him and his family. whether we're just hanging out at home or spending time exploring parks or going to a winery or brewery.\n  ","414175":"\n  i vaguely remember it, yeah. i was like 11 years old, though, and it was more of a peck on the lips than an actual kiss.\n  ","414176":"\n  i usually don't like celebrating my birthday. i don't advertise it anywhere to my knowledge, and if anything, i prefer small gatherings with friends where we just hang out for a few hours.\n  ","414177":"\n  i don't really like either show, but i prefer rock & morty.\n  "}}
