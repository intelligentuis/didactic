flesh and bone in this living world . but at the same time you cannot eradicate all pain because you need a warning signal .","727968":"love is when you care about a person so much that they hold the special place in your heart . sexual desire is not love , it s lust , it s wanting to procreate for the sake of procreating . passion is any powerful or compelling emotion or feeling , as love or hate . strong amorous feeling or desire love ardor . strong sexual desire lust . so in short terms love is completely different from sexual desires , but passion actually works in both .","727969":"i
