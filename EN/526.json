in class that was like it wasnt god but its not this theory either . the popular big bang theory is still trying to make us special that it took billions of years for the universe to expand for us to be created . so , i did my own digging on other scientists who disagree with that . i believe that when the sun explodes it destroys the previous universe to start a new one infinite amount of times . when that explosion happens everything gets created . everything starts over . we would start over whatever we would be . its a constant cycle of energy . that even means multiple dimensions would also start over . so if we were to do something to destruct that cycle , our universe will never exit again . believe whatever you d like , the truth will come out eventually . the only difference is im ready for it . all of it . good or bad , probably bad lol .","486600":"oh my god , they are about to be shook ?","486601":"its a good thing that even if hitler was never killed , he would be dead

right and change their actions . because in the end sorry is just a word , anyone can just say sorry and then go right back to doing exactly the same thing . so dont tell me your sorry , show me you are .","486623":"california but living in reno","486624":"where are you from lovely ?","486625":"i have been verified for a long time . i was actually contacted by them cause they wanted me to be

was verified so early i actually got an email from them about the coins before they started whitelisting people telling me that if you re verified we will be in the trial for cryptocurrency cause that

for their own wants . now , im not saying men havent hurt me , ive been hurt by many but also some of the best people in my life are men . but with females , even the best are even a little petty at times . i can also be way more real with guys because they usually dont take things so personally . idk what it is about females , but they take everything like they are being personally attacked . no one is probably going to like what im gonna say next . . feminist need to stop fucking things up for the rest of us . like before women used to be in the background as the mastermind , while the men are the ones that execute everything . now , females want to be the masterminds and execute it ? this whole equal pay thing pisses me off , like why the fuck would i want to work in mines , construction , or hard labor . you realize men get paid more because they are willing to travel for work , work longer hours , and do harder jobs . why do females have to complain about staying home and doing basically nothing all day except arts and crafts with children ? like dont take that away from me just because you dont want it . maybe i want to sit on the couch pregnant without having to worry about working . we technically arent all equal . some people are smarter , faster , taller , funnier , artistic , musician , ect . . we all want different things cause we are all different people but we all have a role to play . i just dont want my role to be a female getting fucking drafted into the military . so stop saying we are smarter and stronger than what the men think we all know its true but thats what made us more powerful .","486667":"i feel great . i took a great shower , and i trimmed my hair . i ve just been doing little chores around the house . its been a nice day

even going to try to explain physics to you , itd be a waste of time cause clearly you have no idea .","486784":"religion isn t real . if you burned every holy book and every book written about science and completely wiped all our memories . none of the same religions would come back but all the science will . people for hundred and thousands of years have always needed to believe in something its just human nature . . . but with literally s of different religions none of them are real and nobody would even be able to see the truth even if it was right in front of us . so dont even try to talk about religion with me . ive studied and visited all types of religious churches , temples , or organizations . . for about years straight . you are all the same . all want the same thing but you re too close minded to new information cause it doenst fit with your book . . . life is always changing , if you cant change with it thats your fault . and i can choose to not have those types in my life . now thats the real shame . someone who has a mind but doesnt use it to expand or grow .","486785":"i try really really hard do a little of each but i get so frustrated like i just end up answering whatever i see first ?","486786":"destroying the space time continuum . our universe consists of layers . and its all connected image the craziest pattern ever , our universe is obsessed with patterns . anyways , a blast that destructs our dimension will also destruct other dimension we need for infinite amount of time but if we put a hole we will destroy everything forever .","486787":"oh im always schwifty ?","486788":"i believe in the possibility . i have a lot of questions when it comes to destiny . is destiny another word for preprogrammed if we are in a simulation ? i have even been pondering predestination myself because i was wondering when a kid is put up for adoption are you taking that kid out of the correct simulator for their destiny and thats why even when you put the kid in a different home they essentially still end up doing exactly what they were supposed to do just in the wrong simulation ? is that why theres such a huge controversy with nature vs nurture ? these are my thoughts . dun . dun .","486789":"im just gonna ignore i read that ? i like it so much better . it doesn t make you feel all heavy .","486790":"thank you so much ? i am how old are you ? ?","486791":"i will never stop ?","486792":"i totally read that as schwifty and now im sad ?","486793":"i like it for when people want to know more so its easy for them to ask detail questions but i think on the page itself it should say like the question but shows you how many are in the thread ect and you can choose to read through it . another thing is when you scroll through they made it so you have to go really slow cause they want you to react to everything ?","486794":"im slightly concerned this is the gif that pops in my head ?","486795":"no , im a rambler . if you follow me , you should expect a lot of rambles . especially after i get off the phone with my best friend cause thats all we do ? you should knew what you were in for before diving into the deep end buddy .","486796":"awh ? thank you so much ?","486797":"does oat milk count ?","486798":"days old . i do this thing where if i read your question and an answer doesn t automatically pop in my head then i just delete it . i have so much activity that the chance of me getting that same exact question again is very very high . so i dont waste my time stressing about it . its kinda like taking a test , answer everything you already know and then come back to it but in this came the question always comes back to me lol my god im rambling a lot today","486799":"i used to when i was younger . . but then i realized i hate the spotlight . if there was anything id be famous for i feel like it would be modeling .","486800":"any movie where animals get hurt or killed i cry ?","486801":"you re chilling ? im not worries about it i thought that was funny !","486802":"? ? ? ? ? oh my god . you didn t even look and you were judging me hahaaha","486803":"hurry upppp dont make me wait for so long ?","486804":"you re not getting it , im so active i dont need to ask myself questions . . . also , i feel like thats such a loser thing to do . ive always done things organically . it will happen . i answered like questions in like a month .","486805":"ive been on and off for years . i just started to be on more regularly these last few months but i went for a solid three years of attempting to come on but wouldnt for months and even when i did come on it was like minutes . . so i havent really been active but my account is active when im not on . if you knew how many questions i had when i opened up ask after being off for so long . . . it was impossible to get through so i just had to delete all of it and start over . such a nightmare now im rambling im sorry ?","486806":"i really cant wait ?","486807":"awh ! ! im glad you re resting ! i ordered sushi lol and you re so amazing !","486808":"i cant wait to watch movies again ! ! ahh","486809":"omg , i totally understand thats why i

everything . theres nothing wrong with getting everything , but its good to learn how to work for things . i just took advantage . i was just a little asshole when i was younger .","486822":"i love that movie so fucking much .","486823":"but i love talking to you !","486824":"toxic energy . pretty self explanatory lol","486825":"there really isnt one .","486826":"just because someone grew up wealthy doesnt mean them themselves are wealthy . my parents are wealthy , just because they are doesnt mean i am . . . i cant touch their money unless they give it to me . also , for you to make the assumption that all wealthy parents just funnel money into their kids mouth is ignorant . i have a friend thats a billionaire and her parents dont pay her rent , for her car , for her food . . they dont pay for anything . wealthy parents have this mindset , if you dont learn how to take care of yourself on your own , and learn how to manage your life . . . why would you all of sudden learn when you have a bunch of money ? you have to also consider , i was given everything and whenever i needed money i got but i was an idiot with money . now my parents are like uhm no , you ruined that privilege . so yeah i needed help with rent like everyone else because i didnt realize how good i had it when i was younger , so dont judge me for needing help .","486827":"i like buffalo breaded nuggets with ranch or bbq sauce i pretty much like bbq sauce with everything .","486828":"yes , we are all boomhist here !","486829":"i like more sundance indie type movies . not too romantic though .","486830":"i would rather put myself around more positive people but that doesnt mean positive people dont have problems or struggles . everyone has a time where they need a little help , like a shoulder to lean on or someone to guide them through a process .","486831":"actually , helping others helps you grow . you should help more people , or you would already know that .","486832":"the one i wrote is dedicated to myself . all the other books i write will be dedicated to my cousin , she is dead . . . writing is the only way i feel like i am talking to her . i want to clone myself to make an army of boom omg that would be sick .","486833":"noooo , i forgot to ask . give me one of your lists please .","486834":"i am not perfect you sweet butter biscuit .","486835":"well shit . this is a great question . i have never really thought about that until now !","486836":"oh my god . i love it ! ! i have this weird ocd thing where i like to make a random list of movies i just find on the

with them lol what are you doing ?","486868":"i feel like its because when you let go , a part of you has to let go of all the good times and just be okay with them as memories .","486869":"blade blade blade","486870":"i honestly have no idea whats the story behind my name . i should probably ask but i doubt ill get an honest answer .","486871":"i forced myself to do delayed gratification when

bad . i am a huge believer in being honest , and so be it if you have to be anonymous to be honest at least i am learning how people truly think and feel . i am also weird and i look at life as a behavior experiment so its also fascinating to see what people are willing to say when nobody knows who they are .","487019":"oh no , while im eating i go , oh gross . and continue eating it

right above us was a triangle . it was dead silent . all you could see were three huge lights and it was way bigger than we thought . it was only there for about seconds before it just shot up into

someone finds me interesting , i have learned that they are most likely interesting themselves . i hope i will get to know you as well ? my whole life was unique which is why i have more out of box way of thinking . ive had so many weird moments in my life that have made me realize we really have no fucking clue about our world . ill tell you something thats been on my mind . idk how much i believe in hypnosis but anyways . i had nannies growing up but they never spoke english . so up until i was years old . i was fluent in spanish . so much that my family told me i would translate from spanish to english for them . i have memories of speaking spanish but i dont even understand what im saying . and my moms fluent in italian and she said i even spoke that . . i think the trauma of the divorce did something to my brain because i cant speak any other language than english and from hearing those stories ive tried learning spanish again and its like i have a mental block . . what do you think ?","487064":"omg yes its so embarrassing ?","487065":"some might say that im a little too comfortable ?","487066":"omg , this just made me so happy ! ! ?","487067":"yeah when i was gonna start doing it , i didnt realize my body wasnt in the best health yet and i need to get healthy first cause i had agents send me a response to my application and they said , savannah is very pretty and we are interested in her . if she does more commercial shoots and builds her portfolio she will likely have agents looking for her . im paraphrasing cause it was actually two paragraphs . anyways , that kinda got me to realize i should really try and so thats why im gonna work out and be healthy .","487068":"yes . . . but im blanking on what it was . i know eggs is one of them .","487069":"i

working on it . lol","487073":"my beliefs are weird . my thoughts probably wont be popular opinion . i think that all religions are right and all of them are wrong . i think they are all shooting for the same end result but i dont think people realize that we arent even able to consciously understand what s really going on or the truth has been bended so much , the truth wouldnt even look real . my beliefs are closer with buddhism . i believe that life is a constant balance . i believe that new souls are created and old souls are reincarnated infinitely . i believe that our universe consists of layers of dimensions , you wouldn t keep reincarnating in the same dimension over and over . i kinda think of it as a recycling of souls . next life will be light then dark over and over again ying yang the universe is energy and in order for life forms to be able to survive the energy has to be constantly restored . i know most will think im insane lol ?","487074":"honestly not as much as i plan too . i try to just set a couple hours but then i get distracted so im just off and on .","487075":"i really want to learn more about chinese medicine or other cultures herbs they use for

laughing at them . . . . like no thats so rude ?","487096":"are we ever really control or are we just a bunch of puppets with masters pulling the strings while sprinkling the illusion of free will ?","487097":"thanks sweetheart ?","487098":"booooooooo ?","487099":"whats going on ? wanna talk about it ? i really hope this week will get better for you . ?","487100":"if you aren t grateful about

thing to say . i mean , you live in a great , big , vast world that you ve seen none percent of . even the inside of your own mind is endless it goes on forever , inwardly , do you understand ? the fact that you re alive is amazing , so you don t get to say i m bored thats exactly how i feel and why i pretty much enjoy everything lol","487108":"ok so im eating this chocolate chip cookie and it had brownie batter in the middle . . . duh fuh . ?","487109":"not anymore . i used too and then i realized im wasting my time worrying about things out of my control and that i should only be worried about things i can control like my actions , words , and reactions","487110":"well i own this little dumb dumb so does that mean im a witch ? or that im cursed ? or gonna have bad luck ?","487111":"kimchi is too spicy for me i love sauerkraut and mustard tho","487112":"actually no , because that means you re in a state of flight or fight . which makes you completely survival mode so

illusions by thoughts i mean specifically , chatter in the skull . perpetual and compulsive repetition of words of reckoning and calculating . i m not saying that thinking is bad like everything else , it s useful in moderation . a good servant , but a bad master all so called civilized peoples have increasingly become crazy and self destructive because , through excessive thinking they have lost touch with reality . that s to say , we confuse signs with the real world . this is the beginning of meditation . most of us would have rather have money than tangible wealth a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed to read about it the next day in the newspaper is oddly more fun for us than the original event . this is a disaster , for as a result of confusing the real world of nature with mere signs . we are destroying nature . we are so tied up in our minds that we ve lost our senses . time to wake up . what is reality ? obviously no one can say because it isn t words , it isn t material , that s just an idea . . reality is . . the point cannot be explained in words . i m not trying to put you down . it s an expression of you as you are . one must live , we need to survive , to go on . we must go on .","487144":"thank you","487145":"no , you are ?","487146":"showers . i dont know if its just me that always feels like a new person after a shower

like the candy corn would be such a weird texture with chocolate .","487151":"yaaaa you re not getting it . . . its not money that they are looking for its just so happens that right now the more money the more power but they have things set in place for if and when our society breaks down . they adapt to society and how society responds . their end goal is something you and i cant even comprehend because its so intensive . i call them the slaves to the master of the universe .","487152":"i want more wigs ?","487153":"what are you doing in the military ? ive just been staying safe and bettering my health and mind","487154":"i dont know you ?","487155":"lovesss youss ?","487156":"thats a lot of babies ?","487157":"actually , that was kinda the intention . dont assume their end game is anything good and something you want to be apart of unless you want to be soulless . they benefit from the masses being dumb . they benefit from destruction cause it doesn t do anything but create more power for them .","487158":"yeah because my parents are jewish when it comes to their money lol but when i really need something they get it but they threw too much at me when i was

feet","487164":"you are so sweet omfg ?","487165":"wait , you dont think its real ? when they have free mason temples all over america ? when theres records of them starting it in france way before ? illuminati is just a code name for free masons . . its a certain level of them . all the presidents are in it . . big pharma , corporations , the music industry , the movie industry ect . . like literally everything you see is run by them . ive met a bunch of them which is making me start to question if my parents are in it cause now im realizing they were all my parents friends they brought

just the bites and pieces i say about my life , youd all get the picture ?","487168":"i think you need a little bit of both to be able handle problem solving . life is just a series of constant problems that need to solved so intelligent people are able to problem solve quickly and comprehensively . i believe in balance . i dont believe you should measure someone s intelligence based on their tests scores but i do believe a good education as your foundation . i also don t believe that one can learn everything just from the street either though because the streets are dark and all about survival . but i believe you need to be exposed to the world you live in and see it for yourself . feel it for yourself . you will never learn about the world by just reading textbooks . knowledge comes from being open minded in all aspects of life . knowledge comes from comprehending key words and context clues of our society and taking off the color glasses . knowledge comes from understanding that you should never stop learning and to never stop learning means never stop growing and expanding the mind .","487169":"hes a patent attorney . but he does other stuff on the side

came out as pretty bubbles i would be so happy ?","487172":"i just need you to understand that that if you believe in the illuminati than you believe about free masonry which you should cause theres proof of it everywhere which means that theres tier free masons , which means they control everything . like that morning poop you took , ya they control that . they dont just control golf , everything literally everything has free masons dick in it . but only tier have control ive had quite a few people in my life that were either from a family in that tier or they were in that tier themselves . ive played golf cause i lived in rich bitch area but i hate golf lol","487173":"oh fucking great , i swear if china tries to go to war with america . . . . you know i really dont know how

mean did we not see how airstrikes were just sent a few years ago lol i know that trump has done a shitty job with our allies and china wants to get america out of their backyard . . . the only issue

would make eye contact . hes super soft spoken too and so am i . . like im thinking back and i realize he and i even spoke exactly the same . the same tone and everything . every time i think about it

down","487276":"a little bit but not really .","487277":"hearsay . no one had any evidence of that . they just assumed she was so distraught about it . but now im thinking what if since she was in love with him , having his child was like a miracle and the fact she couldnt keep me she fucking loses it because they all told me she was really effected from giving me up . also they said she was slightly obsessive over me . it would also explain why she ran away freaking out because i look so much like him and i looked like a baby version of him when i was little . . . like can you imagine how scary that would be ? !","487278":"it came off more as like i cant keep holding this in anymore so she like put little hints in her messages that i missed the first time","487279":"i look way more

sacrifice themselves for me all the time . . almost like they have too . both my parents told me ill find out why i was such an important child when i get the will . i guess everything is in there .","487289":"he was married with kids ! ! ! he couldnt be with her ! ! unless he cheated and got her pregnant and he fucked her over ? ! dude i think it might just be the craziest coincidence ever

parents are so shady . . . they just say it was a closed adoption we dont know anything . bullshit","487292":"ive tried times .","487293":"okay , probably should add more of a back story . i hung out with dave a few years ago . he came into the boutique i was working at and sat with me the whole time talking to me asking me all these questions about me . . btw i had no idea who he was until after

adoption .","487296":"actually shes the only one that thought i deserve to know more about them . her and i talked for a long time actually .","487297":"he never told me . but he was very adamant

that she accidentally said , im the reason they even had the opportunity to get you , i was the one that picked your mom . i was your social worker . i didnt know how to respond , i was just like

where i would literally pick some wild recipe that i had no idea what it was or anything to see if she could cook it , and every time i would be amazed at how good it was and the best part is she

apologize in advance this is going to probably be very long . aliens have been on this planet for billions of years . there are hundreds of different species that are all harvesting different materials for different reasons . some say that theres species that require metals such as gold . theres other species that require dna . aliens also have a hand in manipulating our dna . they are saying that they finally have decoded our dna after years and of our dna is classified as unknown , exterrestrial aliens contact have been in contact with government officials for decades and they give notes with ascii binary code . they have been warning us to stop sending signals up into space , which is exactly what bill gates , elon musk , stephan hawking have all been saying . they are saying that we are having an increase in ufo et encounters from life from , years from the future to stop us from making any nuclear bombs . after the bomb in japan , they have numerous sights of ufos at different nuclear sights . they communicate telepathically . they come in many different forms . they can be lights , androids , or whatever they want to perceive themselves as . president eisenhower had meetings with aliens , even obama states , well , certainly i can tell you that in , president eisenhower had three encounters , set up meetings with aliens , which took place at certain air force bases including holloman air force base in new mexico . nordic aliens come from the pleiades who resemble nordic scandinavians . blonde hair , blue eyes , fair skin . nordic aliens are often associated with spiritual growth and love and act as protectors for the experiencers . now lets talk about rendlesham forest the first of several sightings occurred in the early hours of december , when u . s . military personnel spotted strange lights . it is one of the few officially documented ufo sightings where witnesses claim to have seen a craft land nick pope , who was a ministry of defense employee from to , this was not some vague lights in the sky sighting the ufo actually landed . officer jim penniston s witness account , . . . no landing gear was apparent , but it seemed like she was on fixed legs . i moved a little closer . . . i walked around the craft , and finally , i walked right up to the craft . i noticed the fabric of the shell was more like a smooth , opaque , black glass . the next day , radiation levels recorded at the site of the indentations were also reported to be unusually high . united states air force lieutenant colonel charles halt recorded , it looks like an eye winking at you . . . here he comes from the south , he s coming towards us now . . . now we re observing what appears to be a beam coming down to the ground . this is unreal . i could go on , and on . lol","487365":"i try to send out a couple a day i kinda just send one out whenever a question pops into my head .","487366":"dc is probably not exciting for you like

the picture . my mom is an investor my mom is a little different , but makes sense how they my dad ended up together and why they still work together . my mom has always had her hand in multiple businesses . she also comes from a very insane history of japanese manufacturer and business owners . my grandparents owned apartments , bowling alleys , gentleman clubs , bars , hotels , homes ect . so my mom became a big pharma rep to make a fuckload of money so she can have her hand in all these other businesses . all the people my mom would have me meet were like top inventors or business owners . sometimes government officials as well . i am pretty sure my parents work as a team . my dad patients things while my mom invests into it and then they become major businesses that you and i see everyday . thats why my parents are wealthy and they really dont care what i do as long as i am happy . they just want me to do anything like i could work in a cafe my whole life , and theyd be

my parents that people are born the way they are and you can t do much to change them which taught them how to love themselves actually . they said i was always okay when someone didnt like that i didnt agree with something they said cause i was okay with myself . the stories my parents have about me as a kid are wild . . . they make me sound like i was some brilliant baby . lol ."}}
