Even if not every single racehorse trainer is outright abusive to their animals, the extreme physical toll that running so fast takes on the horses\u2019 bodies results in poor health and injury that can even result in the death of the horse. Horses were never meant to run that fast or for so long. It\u2019s people who have bred them to be that way and it\u2019s people who are stressing horse\u2019s bodies to their breaking points. The idea in general seems almost cruel to me.\n  \n  I also have a distaste for the general poor treatment of the vast majority of animals running races who aren\u2019t top winners, for how many horses a year die at racetracks as a result of being pushed too hard or from being mishandled, and the fact that horses are raced while they\u2019re very young(1-3 years old) before their bones are developed and fused enough to carry a rider or properly absorb the shocks of galloping at top speed over long distance.\n  \n  I hate the way that so many horses essentially get discarded when they don\u2019t win like pieces of garbage left to rot out in a back field somewhere or sent to slaughter to make dog food. The culture of horse racing which treats the animals like pawns in a game designed to make money with no regard for the welfare of the animals also really bothers me and makes me feel uncomfortable. Not to mention the shortcuts, cruelties, and seedy medical practices like pin firing that are also happening behind the scenes just so people can feel like they\u2019re getting ahead or to force the horse to ignore pain in order to make them more money.\n  \n  Not sure if it\u2019s the case anymore, but I know jockeys historically haven\u2019t been treated particularly well either and have starved themselves and lived on low wages to make weight and get by.\n  ","228612":"\n  Sure, there are lots of things and  shows and movies that I like.

Supporting and loving thy neighbor no matter his\/her appearance, gender, sexual preference, or race is the most Christian thing you could do! God preaches love, not hate!\n  \n  I think some people get confused when interpreting that specific part of the Bible and that there\u2019s still a lot of negative stigma surrounding lgbtq put there by the church that\u2019s leftover from the Middle Ages when they were very focused on creating child-producing marriages and on population growth since everyone died so young back then since they didn\u2019t have good medicine. Basically, I\u2019ve come to understand that they saw that homosexual relationships didn\u2019t produce children, so therefor they\u2019re were seen as \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cpointless\u201d by lots of people back then... plus the church used its power and influence to  control the dumb uneducated masses of people by taxing, tithing, and offering indulgences to sinners and used fear of going to hell as punishment for not doing what they said because then you\u2019d be \u201cgoing against gods word\u201d (aka undermining their influence)  Basically they scared people into conforming to what benefitted them for a long time in history. Things like being gay were \u201cbad\u201d back then because it didn\u2019t benefit them monetarily or society for population stabilization.  Now we have food medicine and lots of people so that ideology is totally pointless now. Still though, all that historical talk just furthered the negative stigma around being homosexual and it became ingrained into the collective human memory.\n  \n  Imo, with all these social movements and stuff about gay rights, we\u2019re now realizing that it was men who corrupted the word of god for their own benefit back then, and what I think God wanted the whole time was acceptance and love of all thy neighbors.\n  \n  The echoes of that time where people shunned and demonized lgbtq people can still be heard today pretty loudly, especially in small towns and places that are more focused on traditional, conservative, values that are passed down from generation to generation. Information is just slower to disseminate in small places like that because most flow of info is centered around big cities with lots of influx of new people and ideas.\n  \n  Honestly there\u2019s a lot lot lot to unpack from different biblical interpretations, different historical precedents and times that shaped our own time now, historical events and social norms that influenced the church\u2019s teachings, and the echoes of those old ways that are still influential in how we tbink today...like honestly way too much for an ask post\n  \n  It really boils down to one thing for me though and it\u2019s-   if all people are children of god and god loves and accepts all his children, then it seems (to me) he would want you to  do the same thing as well.\n  ","229112":"\n  People who fabricate their own truth based on feelings because they cannot accept or do not want to accept peer-reviewed, repeatable, scientific research and fact based on data and mathematical algorithms\n  ","229113":"\n  Hmmm I don\u2019t own a lot of pink...probably some socks with pink trim lol\n  ","229114":"\n  Happiness, peace, serenity, stability, connection, and opportunity\n  ","229115":"\n  Aw thanks lol\n  ","229116":"\n  You could say \u201cHey babe, I\u2019ll cover your vet, feed, and farrier bills this year\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n  \n  Haha nah jk jk but actually though, taking a GENUINE and actual interest and having curiosity in what she does with them would go a long way and make her feel supported and impressed that you cared about something she likes doing!

Your own riding skill level \u2013 are you balanced correctly and can you remain balanced through any unexpected  movements? Are you effective in your legs, hands, seat, and voice or do you get nervous easily and shut down? Are your muscles strong enough to remain engaged but not grip the horse for extended periods of time?\n  \n  2. Is your horse used to the sensation of riding tackless? Have you ever tried it before? The feeling of a rider with a saddle is different than the feeling of a rider without one and may be somewhat confusing for some horses the first time it\u2019s introduced\n  \n  3. What is your horse\u2019s demeanor- calm or prone to spooks? Will riding bareback be a safe option for you based on this (and your ability to cope)?\n  \n  4. What is the status of your horses back health? Are they well-muscled and in shape, bony and elderly, or sway-backed? Being able to support your weight over a strong and capable set of latissimus dorsi muscles is important. Riding bareback is not as comfortable for either of you if your horse has a weak or bony back\n  \n  If you meet all these conditions, riding bareback is not harmful or unwise and can be quite fun and freeing for both horse and rider!\n  ","229509":"\n  Old Town Road is a stupid ass song about cheating on your girlfriend and doing drugs set to an upbeat rhythm so people like it anyways, but it doesn\u2019t have a message about cruelty to animals.\n  \n  If you\u2019re referring maybe to the lyric where he says \u201cride till I can\u2019t no more\u201d I think he\u2019s talking about not being able to sit up straight cause he\u2019s so intoxicated.
