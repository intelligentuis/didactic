try it whether its out loud or in your head , or if its a problem that you need to work through but can t tell someone else about just pretend you are that someone else it ll help you to focus and think it out , but only if this is your way of focusing , if its not there might be something else out there to help you slow down and think on something","197294":"thanks for checking up on me though

excited that they answered my message and sad when i see they looked but didn t answer , when i cant stop laughing when talking to them , when i can trust them enough to tell them my past , it takes a
