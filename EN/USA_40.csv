   In your personal opinon why do you think some people end up being hateful and toxic?
  ","
  I think sometimes people are toxic without realizing it ironically they may be trying to avoid messing up in a relationship but end up coming on too strong or controlling without realizing. Other times it could be that it’s in their nature to be a certain way like always 100% honest and to some they don’t want to hear the truth when it’s about things that may make them feel insecure so it comes off as being toxic. When people are hateful or toxic the reasons varies with perspective as well because there are always two sides to every story and even then sometimes you’d need a third person that sees both sides from an entirely different perspective. There’s no need to be hateful but it happens whether it’s on purpose out of spite, jealousy or strong emotions like anger which they may later regret when they’re calm. All in all, it happens for different reasons like little triggers, past experiences, characteristics, etc.

   Thinking of peace whilst spilling blood is something that only humans could do. 

Share your Thoughts 💭
  ","
  I think you may be referring to when sometimes it is generally accepted to spill blood throughout history in cases like an eye for an eye. In the justice system, people think or accept it as wrongful to take a life but then there is a death penalty for certain crimes which is a life for a life. It is contradicting and questionable when we consider what is ethical and a just cause for such crimes.

   Is it true that everybody have a weakness rather they admit it or not or do they just have too much pride to look at they own flaws?
  ","
  I don’t think that’s it. I don’t think people are trying to hide or disregard their flaws if they don’t talk about it or “admit to it.”  There’s nothing to admit to when you accept yourself for who you are. It’s not a flaw or weakness in your perspective when you focus on your strengths. People that talk about what makes them feel vulnerable are strong being open and perhaps if they don’t it’s just that they’re private or don’t trust to tell those that aren’t close to them.

   When are we going to start being more forgiving to people who sometimes don't think things through before saying something?
  ","
  When we learn to understand sometimes people speak up with emotion and don’t mean what they’re saying at the time. They’re doing it for a purpose like to get you to feel like they do in that moment. Could be not knowing better or adjusting to new people/environment. Sarcasm could even be problematic at times. In the end you just have to be willing to understand their intentions and it maybe worse if you don’t even tell them you’re upset with something said. I think people learn to be more forgiving after certain experiences and as we grow in time. Some learn sooner than others and some are just more cautious or particular about forgiveness given the circumstances & what’s said. It’s all understandable though

   All I’m asking for the phone call, nothing else, she can’t be the stubborn, because it is about control. Again, I’m allowing her to have any control over me, because once I’m gone it never will apply again. If she wants to be with me in the future she has to call me tonight.
  ","
  Relationship shouldn’t be about who has control. I can’t assume anything about how she’ll respond or if she does but it’s her choice and what you do next is yours.
  "
217384,"
   So essentially she just wants to control the situation? I hope everyone can see how childish it is, because ultimately when a woman is in a relationship with me, I give them the power. At any moment I can take it back, and that’s what she’s understanding, power means I respect you
  ","
  not necessarily, it doesn’t have to be about control alone. Perhaps she just wants time to think. It shouldn’t be about one or another having control.
  "
217385,"
   If she doesn’t want to speak with me then she does not wanna be with me at all. And then I am going to have to leave. She needs understand that as an adult you have to do things you don’t want to do. She knows I know all this information about her, but I don’t wanna discuss any of that
  ","
  It’s true that it’s better to communicate with one another to work it out. However, if she chooses not to then you can’t make her.  You can be insistent and respectfully ask to talk.  It’s best to keep it private and show you care without being too repetitive or overbearing.
  "
217386,"
   I don’t wanna argue anymore, I would love to be able to speak on the phone with her and just so we can talk, I’m not saying that she has to be at my house at midnight to get back to full around. I just wanna be able to have a line of communication because I miss him like crazy
  ","
  Fair enough but if it’s not what she wants then there’s nothing you can do but wait respectfully and patiently.

  "
217390,"
   That can’t be all you have to say. I’ve seen you talk on here, is there any suggestions any advice you can give?
  ","
  Every individual is different, men & women. People respond and react differently. Some are open and willing to work through things or at least talk about coming to terms. Whereas sometimes people may choose to just completely shut down and close the door not wanting to allow even closure. It could even be somewhere inbetween but all in all everyone will not always be as responsive or cooperative
  "
217391,"
   Can you at least acknowledge how toxicity forms in relationships without people realizing?
  ","
  I know it happens I was just listing other important aspects of a relationship. I wasn’t saying respect was more or less important. I mean no disrespect in my responses I’m just saying what I think as well.
  "
217392,"
   On a scale of 1 to 10 how “cool” are you?
  ","
  1
  "
217393,"
   That’s exactly what I want! And I just wish that women didn’t confuse frustration in a desperation to be with someone as a weakness. If you’ve never had a man truly love you but it looks like behavior that’s kind of crazy. What was crazier is knowing that someone’s going to give up for no reason
  ","
  All the best
  "
217394,"
   it needs to be at the forefront. It Hass to be on top of everything else. Could you could be honest and hurtful, you can have communication that’s extremely hurtful, I know that better than anyone. But a lack of respect causes the honesty and communication to be mean and cruel
  ","
  🤐
  "
217395,"
   No respect. Honestly could still get people upset. You have to have respect without respect there is no foundation
  ","
  Fair enough but respect is a part of all of those things. It’s implied

  ","
  It is normal for your emotions to be all over the place during a relationship when there is uncertainty or you are still at the point of getting to know them and decide whether or not it is what you truly want. It does not have to stop unless it is becoming problematic in your relationship then you can just resolve it through communicating with your significant other about it.

  This translates to ""How can I drop my case, and I don’t know who caught them and who is my lawyer. I don’t want any problems. Kfaya that my dignity is high. I don’t want to lose someone’s future because in them I don’t want them to control, but I want to cure myself and I’m not going to like it for a while. And I don’t think what happened in the first place.""
  
  This translation is a little confusing but I would say to look things over and think it through because you sound like you are stressed and unsure of what you should do. When making big decisions sometimes you just need to take a deep breathe, talk to someone you trust, and think it over carefully.

  I think sometimes people are curious about the past or just want to get to know you better by knowing what you’ve been through. They’re not trying to say you are that same person, just a way of learning and empathizing if possible. However it’s fair if you aren’t comfortable talking about it and you tell them that then, if they continue to pry it’s questionable.

  You must be 100% committed to what you want and certain. When you have doubts about people it shows as well as having doubts about your own success.

I understand if you have doubts with commitment due to past experiences but never compare the two; they’re not the same person.

  Silence. Ironically saying nothing can say a lot about someone especially given the circumstances. I'd prefer someone to be outspoken & tell me what they're thinking rather than mock me with their silence or think negatively about me without getting to know me. How do I know they're thinking about me & bad company if they're quiet one might ask. It's simple. They're looking right at you with an upset look like they do not want to be there & stare for long periods of time even when you catch them because they don't care.

  Is it weird that I don't want to be remembered? I know I'd be missed, but I wouldn't want people to stress & cry over a loss. You can hold on to memories. I can't stop that. I just don't want to be associated with heart ache & depression. Even reminiscing on good times can be saddening.

  Indulge in this thing called life & enjoy every last second knowing there is no stress in preparing for what is to come next(:

  Yes! There are all kinds of love ! I love my family, my pets, my friends, etc.

   Who was the last person you took a picture with?
  ","
  My mom on valentine's day! I surprised her with a lovely blue women's coat since it's our first Valentine's day without him. R.I.P. daddy
  "
219103,"
   Do you think that you’re a good person?
  ","
  Tbh idk. I'd like to say yes, and I'm sure my friends would say I am, but I can't tell. I'd rather let my actions speak for themselves & let you be the judge of me. I do value others opinions and constructive criticism so I'd feel selfish defining myself because I only know me from my own perspective. A friend, family member, or stranger would see me differently.
  "
219104,"
   Are you afraid of the future?
  ","
  Yes, but that just proves that I plan on taking on my fears and overcoming them to achieve my goals.
