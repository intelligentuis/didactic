   *Is about to knock on your door in order to deliver some supplies* *Hears what's going on inside* *Starts to turn around and leave XD*

  *I don't blame the carrot for leaving either, Reaper is pretty inappropriate and he doesn't care who hears him*

   *Geno is actually tired enough that he does fall back asleep, even with the argument mere feet away*

  ...*Reaper didn't think that would actually work and it has him worried that Geno did fall asleep despite their arguing*..

   who's shouting anyway?

  Just the swap version of me having a hissy fit, you can go back to sleep Love, you need it anyway

   ugh why are people shouting *whelp someone got woken up*

  Hey sleepy head, saw you were curled up to Death~ *He winks, motioning to the stuffed animal Geno was hugging* you can go back to sleep if you need it Love~

5369,"
   You idiot!!! If you weren't  injured I'd kick your  #ss!!! *pissed midget *

  Pfft, aw come on, I bet your Holo would do the same for grandkids
  
  *Oh God--*
  "
5370,"
   You told your kids about what you do in ##### ?!Geno would be so disappointed ! I am! And I'm not even your husband technically..
  ","
  Relax, it's not THAT bad, besides, if we're ever getting those grandkids they need to know about it, don't they?
  
  *BAD REAPER*
  
  I don't think Geno would mind~
  "
5371,"
   do not ever let Geno find out the sex stuff you have taught your kids, he would freak
  ","
  ..Did one of our kiddos say something? *Reaper seems annoyed*
  
  ..I wasn't planning on telling Geno about it, at least not until we had our first grandkid

5372,"
   Reaper? You awake?
  ","
  Yeah, why? *Reaper rubs his eye sockets as he looks over at Harvest* I'm just here watching Geno, something happen?

  ","
  *Aw**Reaper was still sound asleep right with him and had his arms wrapped around Geno, he's gonna tease him when he wakes up and sees the plush*
  "
5375,"
   A bit late for that, I'm pretty worried. *he looks freaked, a hand gripping at his rib cage  above his fraction of a soul*
  ","
  L-Love, calm down, I promise you I'm okay--*Reaper then holds Genos other hand* look at me.. I'm still here with you.. you don't have to worry yourself to Death..
  
  We're okay as long as we BOTH get some rest, okay? I've been worried about you too, you know..
  "
5376,"
   *Geno's now shook for totally different reasons* You, anyone else would be dead or dust or what were you thinking!?
  ","
  *Reaper sweats a bit*
  
  That's the thing..I wasn't thinking Love..  ..and..well..your not far off the mark..*he points to the IV hooked to his Soul, Geno might pull one of Reapers numbers at this rate*
  
  ..n-not that I'm gonna dust-- you don't have to worry-!
  "
5377,"
   Wait you had HOW MUCH Bleach?!!?
  ","
  *Well that definitely shifted things*
  
  ..Y-yeah..they said it was enough to kiII a entire army of humans--*Reaper then realized he said all that information right beside Geno..and to Geno*
  
  ..Sh-t..
  "
5378,"
   *Geno pulls Reaper into a tight hug, this clearly shook both of them*
  ","
  ..*Reaper then nuzzles Geno, he's trying to be the calm one for them both*
  
  ..It's okay Love..
  "
5379,"
   Reaper, calm down, Geno trusts you, completely, that's why this nightmare startled him so. He's not afraid of you, he never was, never will be.  You having a breakdown won't help anything, please, try to calm
  ","
  I-I'm trying to..just..after everything that's happened.. *Reaper then wipes his tears with the sleeve of his robe*
  
  ..I was really s-scared there for a minute.. that m-maybe he really believed.. ... .. ...sorry... m-maybe some of that bleach is still in my system.. I did drink about..20 cases..full.. I had Grillby order them in his bar.. I threatened to reap him if he didn't do it..
  
  ..I haven't been thinking clearly since then..
  "
5380,"
   You won't, it, it was just a nightmare.  I shouldn't have said anythiing
  ","
  *Reaper tries to calm himself at least enough to where he can be the comforting one to Geno..he's the one who had the nightmare here*
  
  S-sorry.. guess I didn't g-get everything.. out of my system yet..  just, it's okay Love.. you know I would never hurt you..we both know that.. it's just a nightmare.. it's not like that'll ever happen...
  
  *he holds out his arms for a hug*
  "
5381,"
   No of course not, *Geno looks at him eye wide, realizing Reaper was taking this personally* that's why it's so damn frightening though, precisely because it's something that would never happen
  ","
  *Reaper was afraid for a moment that Geno actually became scared of him*
  
  ..S-so..your not scared of me..? Geno.. you should know.. I would do everything I can to protect you..
  
  ..T-this.. *he points at his neck* only h-happened..cause I was scared I'd lost you..when.. you weren't in limbo anymore.. it.. it scared me to Death.. I wasn't sure what to do..I thought it would g-give you a chance to not be in pain anymore and t-to be happy but..it also..m-made you able to die.. and..if anything happened..I wouldn't ever see you again.. I didnt want to go back to how it was before I met you..and I didn't want to lose you either..
  
  *Oof the God seemed to take Genos nightmare worse than he did, he was trying to comfort his Tsundere but ended up working himself up instead*

5382,"
   Heh... it would have been easier to deal with if it was just my memories... this was.... ... ... in it I watched you k!ll me....

  ...Geno...you don't..you don't really believe I would...? You can't...
  "
5383,"
   I... I really don't...
  ","
  It was that bad..? If it's about your timeline again.. just know you aren't there anymore Love..nobody from there would want you beating yourself up over what happened either..it's not like you could control what Frisk did..
  "
5384,"
   Here, where's here *it takes a little while for him to calm enough to figure out he's just in bed* Oh... then it was.... that was one hell of a nightmare *he looks down at the foor*
  ","
  Geno..*Reaper then gently grabs one of his hands*.. you ..wanna talk about it..? It might help you if you did...

5385,"
   Ngah- *being shaken awake might have been a bad idea, his lone eye darted around looking for an attacker* What, where, how?
  ","
  Love..?? *Reapers lone socket was filled with worry when he saw Geo bolt up and scan the room for some sort of danger*
  
  ..H-Hey, hey, your right here..
  "
5386,"
   *Doesn't seem like the words are reaching him, probably better to just be there with him*
  ","
  *Despite the fact it didn't seem like words were reaching him, it didn't stop him from continuing to try and he even starts shaking Genos shoulder a bit hoping to wake him out of it*
  
  Geno? Hey..can you hear me?
  "
5387,"
   *Geno fell asleep fairly quickly, but from the sounds of it he's having nightmares about... someone dusting*
  ","
  *Oof**Reaper pauses when he hears Geno sounding as though he's having a nightmare of some sort, he doesn't know what it was about but he can take a guess..*
  
  Love..? H-hey..calm down..your not back there anymore.. your off the save screen and your with me now..

   ...what would you do if Geno ever tried leaving you

  ..This..wasn't proof enough..? *Reaper points at his neck* ..I-I couldn't handle it if Geno..
  
  ..I can't..*he starts tearing up against the back of Genos hoodie*
  
  ...D-don't take him from me...please..

5389,"
   Because she's standing right behind you -__- Frisk: *Whispers into your ear* Give me a hug, damnit

  *That actually frightened the Death God and he nearly flops out of bed*
  
  You have a Death wish kiddo!? If you touch me, there's a 50/50 chance it might kiII you!
  
  *They don't technically have ears but I would imagine they have ear holes*
  
  Besides that..I'm not exactly the hugging type...
  
  ..I'm gonna guess this is how she died..she was a idiot
  
  *Like you?*
  
  ...Shut up mod!
  "
5390,"
   I... fine
  ","
  Thanks Love~ *Reaper then nuzzles into Geno, happy he got his Tsundere to keep his butt in bed*

   You've also drugged me to make me stay in bed, how about we don't do either of those things *Geno actually looks visibly tired now*
  ","
  I won't need to if you actually sleep..*Reaper then plays the injured card and points at his neck*
  
  Besides..it would make it a lot better if you were resting with me..

5392,"
   *Geno just facepalms*
  ","
  You know you love me~ But on a more serious note.. you need to stay in bed.. I will get up and duct tape you down if you don't, I've done it before!
  "
5393,"
   They don't even HAVE organs, you idiot -__- *When did you get here* I took my eyes off Frisk for one damn second and she ran off -.-;
  ","
  Wait...how DID you get to ReaperTale..? And why would you come knocking on Deaths door? Unless your Frisk died they wouldn't be here..
  "
5394,"
   *Geno just sighs* well are you done messing with me? I'm out of energy
  ","
  Sorry Love..I just wanted to brighten the mood a bit..*Reaper wraps his arm around Geno and lays his skull against his* didn't mean to tire you out..we haven't even been in bed long for you to get tired~
  
  *Not the time Death--*
  "
5395,"
   harvest agreed to keep an eye on the kids, why don't we go lie back down
  ","
  Hopefully he doesn't Harvest their organs
  
  *Seriously?*
  "
5396,"
   I will make sure Time kid never lets you do anything like that
  ","
  *Reaper starts laughing* Did I get under your skin Love?~ Sorry, I know it's not the time for jokes..but it's fun messing with you sometimes~
  "
5397,"
   First off Swap us is not our past selves, also, NO
  ","
  I wasn't talking about our swap versions, like what would happen if we went all the way back in time and had fun with our past selves then had fun in the present?
  
  *REAPER WTF--*
  "
5398,"
   Well not if you keep me out here talking you dork
  ","
  I might be a dork but I'm YOUR dork~
  
  *Reaper then ""walks"" with Geno back to their room*
  
  I wonder what would happen if we made out with our past selves
  
  *WTF--*
  "
5399,"
   *Geno grabs Reaper's hand and pulls himself to his feet* come on, let's just go back to resting
  ","
  Does this mean I technically got you in bed with me?~
  "
5400,"
   Would out d3ath touch k!ll d3ath?It's a dumb question I know..
  ","
  Let's find out *Reaper then touches Harvests face lol*
  
  Hm...nope, your safe guess Death can't kiII Death either
  "
5401,"
   pfft, think you could give me a hand up
  ","
  *Reaper then offers Geno a hand*
  
  I wasn't expecting to take part in a robbery today, if only you were wearing that prisoner costume I could of said you stole my heart~
  "
5402,"
   I'm on the floor, I'm kinda holding you up
  ","
  *Reaper blushes a bit as he looks at Geno*
  
  ..I guess I can say this is a hold up now
  "
5403,"
   Sorry reaper..
  ","
  It's not a big deal, really *he winks*  it's not like you can kiII Death by slapping it in the face right?
  "
5404,"
   Yeah, I'm ok
  ","
  That's good...you need a hand up..? Uh..wait.. ..why does it feel like I'm floating without actually floating?
  
  ..Are we even on the floor??
  "
5405,"
   Right sorry old habits.
  ","
  Hey, It's fine *Reaper waves his hand dismissively*
  
  Geno would do that too if I joked around with him like that, we're good..
  "
5406,"
   fine, maybe we should both go back to bed... *Geno is holding Reaper up*
  ","
  *Reaper didn't seem to notice Geno was holding him up, at least not yet*
  
  We need to get off the floor first..sorry I fell on you Love, you okay?
  "
5407,"
   Then unsummon your scythe, please, while you still have that injury... it just makes me really uneasy
  ","
  *Reaper then unsummons his scythe as he lays against Geno *
  
  Love.. okay.. if your still that worried I won't use my magic...but that means you can't either..
  "
5408,"
   *jumps up slaps him in face*You're no better than holo you idiot.  -///-
  ","
  *Harvest might feel bad since Reaper sort of still has a neck injury, Oof*
  
  *He winces and falls back against
  
   @DontcallmeSans
  
  * N-not..that I mind..being slapped..but..could you go a little easier right now..? I sort of got hurt from being a idiot
  "
5409,"
   *Geno clinks his cheek* is your neck doing any better?
  ","
  *Aw**Reaper blushes a bit when Geno clinked his cheek,he didn't think that would work like that*
  
  Yeah, don't worry Love, as long as we take it easy it should be fine
  "
5410,"
   You're the one still on an IV here, not me
  ","
  And? *Reaper just smiles* I would give you a kiss of Death but..*he points at his neck* maybe you can scoot on over and give me one?~
  "
5411,"
   Shut up!!!*glares*
  ","
  *Reaper can't help but laugh* Why don't you make me? Well, you are technically me, maybe if your quiet I'll be quiet
  
  *lol poor Harvest*
  "
5412,"
   considering you were threatening to send one of our kids to the underworld? I think it's better if I check on them
  ","
  Hey, I wasn't really going to send them there *Reaper then heads over beside his Tsundere, dragging his IV stand along with him* If you don't work yourself to Death you'll end up worrying yourself there instead.. I can take over to give you a break
  "
5413,"
   ...*huffs  annoyed blushing slightly  aw*
  ","
  *Reaper just laughs* Pfft! What? Don't tell me your embarrassed just over that!
  "
5414,"
   a bit, but never let that stop me before. Don't worry I'll go back to bed once I check on all of them
  ","
  You know, I could finish checking on them for you so you don't have to work yourself to Death and can go back to bed now
  "
5415,"
   So I could check on our kids
  ","
  You could of waited a bit..weren't you dead tired?
  "
5416,"
   You'll have to go through me first...
  ","
  *Reaper chuckles a bit* It's kinda weird, I feel like I'm talking more to Geno than myself, you really are a lot like him
  "
5417,"
   Reaper, we discussed this, no sending people to the underworld as punishment
  ","
  Geno? *Reaper pauses when he hears his Tsundere and lowers his scythe*
  
  I was only trying to scare them Love..anyway, mind telling me why you left bed?
  "
5418,"
   I gave it to him okay?!*he grabs
   
    @GothOfDeaths
   
   *
  ","
  That explains where it came from but it really doesn't matter who gave him what, what matters is he's using that thing to hurt people and so that he learns his lesson, I think a trip to the Underworld is in order, move aside
  "
5419,"
   Why starbucks? How is that going to help you in prison?
  ","
  Think about it, sending the Grim Reaper to prison is basically giving everyone there a Death sentence, they can all die from my Death touch and the ones who are smart enough to stay away from me, can still die if I chose to go after them..not to mention I can just teleport or bust my way out with my scythe, might as well have something to drink while I'm at it
  "
5420,"
   If you could take one thing to prison what would you bring in with you?
  ","
  ..Starbucks
  
  *What?*
  "
5421,"
   *Geno is soundly asleep, and not having any nightmares it would seem*
  ","
  *Reaper noticed when he woke up, that Geno was still sound asleep, he knows he needs the rest so he'll do his best not towake him, it's goodhe isn't having any nightmares but it's also surprising that he isn't given what's happened*
  
  ..
  "
5422,"
   yeah that sounds like a plan
  ","
  We're okay Love~
  "
5423,"
   *Geno ends up laying down in bed as well* I feel like I could sleep for a week. When I woke up in the hospital and you weren't there, for a moment I feared the worst...
  ","
  ..Geno...,*Reaper then wraps a arm around him*
  
  ..Do..you remember? We made a promise that we wouldn't leave eachothers side..I don't plan on breaking that..
  
  We're keeping our happily ""Reaper After"" you hear me? I hope you don't sleep that long though..epitome of laziness or not.. that wouldn't be okay...
  "
5424,"
   *Geno gets Reaper home, he sets the god up on an IV just in case* Ok, if you stay in bed this should hopefully heal... I thought Dream had managed more
  ","
  Love..calm down..I'll be okay..*Reaper gives a slight smile as he looks at Geno through the corner of his eye*
  
  This won't kiII me.. I'm Death, remember? It's okay..
  "
5425,"
   Pretty close to *Geno changes his bandages* Maybe we should just go home, at least there you can stay in bed
  ","
  *Reaper winced a bit after his bandages were changed and he lets himself rest against Geno*
  
  ..Okay.. you convinced me.. I'll stay in bed..for a while..
  
  *Oof, he didn't mean to scare Geno to the point where he's almost crying, he won't move around for a while, he doesn't want to make him cry*
  "
5426,"
   Let me see your neck, I brought bandages with me just in case *sounds like he's holding back tears*
  ","
  .. *Reaper didn't want to but he wasn't going to say no when Geno was this worried for him.. he lowers his hand off his neck and let's Geno look at it, the bandages were starting to form a red splotch on them* ..Love.. are..are you..? *he noticed his Tsundere sounded pretty close to crying..*
  "
5427,"
   I am not happy you snuck out of the hospital while I was asleep *Geno tracked him down*
  ","
  *Oof**Reaper noticed his Tsundere was there beside him but can't bring his skull up to face him as he was currently gripping his neck with one hand and using the other to hold himself up so he doesn't end up hitting the ground*
  
  ..N-ngh.. G-Geno..?
  "
5428,"
   Reaper, maybe just stop talking
  ","
  Sorry Love
  
  *Reaper then lays himself down with Geno*
  
  Ngh.. we can just lay here a while.. and snuggle~
  "
5429,"
   Fine, but you better tell one of the doctors your neck was hurting so they can help you. *Geno just rests,*
  ","
  I'm fine Love..besides..I don't really want them touching me..I've already kiIIed about 20 of them just from them bringing me in here..
  
  *Reaper huffs*
  
  ..I had to use my hourglass and erase most their memories..and hide the bodies..
  
  *Your making this worse..*
  "
5430,"
   I'm very tired, ok? Happy I answered your question.
  ","
  Yes, I am actually *Reaper then lays his skull against Genos though he winced a bit from doing so*
  
  ..If ..your that dead tired, we are still in bed and nothing has happened for a change..you have plenty of time to rest up..
  
  I'm not going anywhere either.. so you don't have to worry yourself to Death
  "
5431,"
   I'm beyond worried about you, avoiding my question doesn't help my nerves
  ","
  You kinda avoided my question too..besides being a worry wart, how've you been holding up..?
  
  *Oof*
  "
5432,"
   *oof Geno is worried* how bad is it?
  ","
  Forget me f-for a second..how have you been doing through all this..?
  
  *Reaper has been just as worried for Geno and he is genuinely concerned for his Tsundere..but he also wanted to avoid answering that question*
  "
5433,"
   Reaper, not the time, I mean not while you're still *Geno just indicates his own neck*
  ","
  Yeeeaah... I know..but it doesn't stop me from flirting with my cute angel~
  
  *Reaper then nuzzles Geno or well, he began to but stopped as he started to hold his neck* Ah..!
  "
5434,"
   *Geno sighs* lets just eat, focusing on this isn't helping any
  ","
  Eat first, talk later, that works, unless you wanna have fun first~
  
  *Reaper winks*
  "
5435,"
   The doctors told me you were shouting about having lost me before you tried... well...
  ","
  *Reaper pauses as he holds his skull, he might have a hangover on top of his neck injury..*
  
  ..Ngh... ..s-sorry Love.. I don't remember..saying that but..I don't remember much of anything..that happened.. ..I am sorry this whole thing happened... we would of been fine if.. I didnt go out drinking...

5436,"
   It's not fine, what if soomething had happened?! I mean you were at Grillby's when you tried to... to...
  ","
  *Oof**Reaper then gently holds Genos hands*
  
  ..H-hey, hey..I'm still here Love.. besides ..I was past drunk when..that.. took place.. I'm a bit more clear headed than I was last night..
  
  *I don't think you'll ever be allowed to drink bleach anymore*
  
  I don't even remember all the details anymore..or why I did it..but I know it won't happen again..okay?
  "
5437,"
   Reaper, you are in no state to just leave the hospital like that, not yet. *Geno doesn't seem mad, he seem worried*
  ","
  Don't worry about it Love, I used a few life flowers so it should be fine..
  
  *Someone throw him a shovel*
  
  Besides, I wanted to do something nice for you after everything we've gone through lately.. you deserve some Grillbys and coffee ..I know you don't drink coffee often..but I still got you some in case you wanted it.. if you don't, there's a bottle of ketchup in that bag
  "
5438,"
   Wait you went to Grillby's yourself
  ","
  *Reaper sweats a bit* That depends... how will you take it if I did?
  
  *Oof*
  "
5439,"
   Sure, uhm do we have any? *since they're still to my knowledge in the hospital*
  ","
  Yeah I brought some yesterday along with the Grillbys and coffee--
  
  *Reaper just told on himself*
  
  *he points to the bag still sitting on the stand next to their bed, they are still in the hospital, the God still has various hospital equipment hooked to him, along with his neck still bandaged*
  
  Good news is, it's been pretty peaceful and quiet for a change
  "
5440,"
   That's... an interesting dream
  ","
  *Reaper blushed bright blue when he realized what he had said, he said outloud*
  
  ..Uhhhh.... want some donuts??
  "
5441,"
   We actually went a whole night without something awful happening? I have to be dreaming
  ","
  If this was a dream..you would be falling head over heels over your 100 foot tall husband
  
  *What--*
  "
5442,"
   Did you ever fall asleep in school?
  ","
  What's a school..? *Reaper yawns as he rubs his eye sockets, well that sort of answers that question*
  "
5443,"
   *Geno is gonna get some rest too*
  ","
  *Next day*
  
  *When Geno wakes up, Reaper was sound asleep, laying in his arms, they actually fell asleep while hugging eachother*
  "
5444,"
   Yeah we can definitely get a break
  ","
  Thanks Love..
  
  *Reaper falls unconscious on Geno shortly after that, they really need a break..*
  "
5445,"
   Yeah?
  ","
  Promise me..we'll at least..get a break..if not a vacation.. I don't know how much of this we can take.....
  "
5446,"
   ....ok that's a fair point.... *well I dunno bout you other admin but I'm ignoring attempts to bother them at home for awhile*
  ","
  *Reaper then closes his eyes as he rests against Geno* ..Love..?
  
  *I'm doing the same, they need a break*
  "
5447,"
   Still the sooner we're home the better, much harder to reach us in Reapertale
  ","
  ..I dunno..our house seemed to get invaded a lot..*Reaper sighed* And..I still need to fix it up from the last few home invasions we've had.. ..
  "
5448,"
   We're actually going to be ok now right? *Geno seems worried, as if someone will barge into their Hospital room and cause chaos*
  ","
  ..Don't worry Love, you said so yourself that we're a force to be reckoned with when we're together.. we can handle anything as long as we have eachother
  "
5449,"
   Don't think I could do that in the hospital
  ","
  Your right, besides your sweet enough as is~ *Reaper then lays against Geno*
  "
5450,"
   What do you want?
  ","
  You~ and a few donuts I picked up~ actually..if you dressed as a donut that would be even better~

5451,"
   Maybe our luck is turning but your neck isn't ready to turn yet

  *Reaper can't help but chuckle at that* Your jokes haven't turned stale either
  
  While we're still on the subject, if you turn around, our food is right beside you

  I love you Geno, you think our luck might finally start turning around?
  
  *Reaper then turns his skull to smile at Geno but he ends up wincing as soon as he does, it isn't anything like earlier but it still hurt for him to move his skull* ow..!

  Thanks Love, I ""donut"" know what I would do without you~

5454,"
   It's nice to have something to laugh about for a change though
  ","
  Yeah..my name might be Grim but it doesn't mean I like things that way..*Reaper then holds up a hand* can you help me sit up Love? I had.. one of the..nurses.. go out and get us some Grillbys and coffee..since..well.. I figured we could use it
  "
5455,"
   Well your attempt to 'cover' it up was funny
  ","
  *Reaper was pretty embarrassed but found the pun funny, he ends up laughing*
  
  Hey, don't laugh too much or you might laugh yourself to Death~
  "
5456,"
   Normal's still a thing?
  ","
  Good point *Reaper just smiles* still, nice to see you actually laughing for a change, even if it's at a salted blanket, not one of my best jokes
  "
5457,"
   *Geno laughs at that, this is the most he's laughed in awhile...*
  ","
  H-hey! You laugh now but it's good for your health! *Reaper pauses as honestly..it has been a while since either of them have had a peaceful moment together and he hasn't seen Geno so cheerful in a while*
  
  At least the blanket got you back to normal
  "
5458,"
   So those sheets tasty?
  ","
  Whatmph..? *Reaper then noticed the blanket in his mouth and looks completely embarrassed, he quickly pulls it out from his mouth though his entire skull is bright blue* I-it just needs a little more salt.. b-blankets are good for your diet..!

5460,"
   pffft, well at least it's not a nightmare... *Geno can tell that Reaper's injury is much better now than it was, not fully healed but not 'about to dust' bad*
  ","
  *Reaper must of been hungry, not only did he blurt out the word donuts in his sleep but he was starting to nom on their bedsheets now too, at least he did seem much better that's for sure lol*
  "
5461,"
   Huh? What happened, how long was I asleep?
  ","
  Dooonnuuutts...*Of all the things he could have dreamt about, he was talking about donuts in his sleep, which doesn't exactly answer Genos questions..*
  "
5462,"
   *he's pretty confused when he wakes up not in the same place he fell asleep* *also their bed at home or still at the hospital?*
  ","
  *Still at the hospital, he didn't want to scare Geno further by going home with his neck still bandaged and he can lie and say that the hospital brought their food in and moved Geno to bed so he doesn't panic about Reaper being up and about*
  "
5463,"
   *Geno sat down in a chair across the room since Dream is in the bedside chair, he dozes off... guess he really should be giving his magic a break*
  ","
  *When Geno next wakes up, he finds himself laying in bed next to Reaper with a bag of food sitting on the nightstand beside their bed and a couple cups of coffee right along with it, he had moved Geno off the chair back in bed and had gotten them both food*
  "
5464,"
   Ok, hopefully I won't have to see you under such conditions again
  ","
  Same here..""I think Geno was right about us needing locked up in AsylumTale..."" *Reaper mutters the last bit* ""I definitely feel like I've jumped off the deep end..""
  "
5465,"
   Sure *Dream does check on Geno* He should probably stay in bed and make sure he has plenty of fluids, it seems like it's just exhaustion, but I can't heal that
  ","
  ..*Reaper sighs in relief, he was afraid it was something far more serious like falling down levels of serious, he's honestly been wracked with worry this whole month..from hearing that Geno could become Error to anons making Geno fully alive again..they've both been pretty terrified for eachother..a lot has happened..they could use a few days to themselves*
  
  Thanks Dream.. you can head back now..
  "
5466,"
   I won't let him.... I think Geno dozed off while I was healing you, I'm going to head back before Cross freaks out. *Dream smiles before standing, and waving as a golden portal appears which he steps through*
  ","
  Hold on a sec, before you go.. can you make sure Genos okay too? I haven't been the only one having a hard time with everything lately.. please?
  
  *Reaper seemed to be almost begging for Dream to check on Geno before he goes..he would do so himself but given all that's happened, his little Tsundere might flip out if he gives him magic or anything of the sort right now..last thing he needs is to make Geno panic even more than he already has been*
  "
5467,"
   I know *Dream finishes healing Reaper* Ok, I'm not sure I managed to heal it fully, but you should at least be able to move around now without risking your head falling off
  ","
  Thanks, I just hope your husband doesn't come knocking on our door.. we really can't handle anyone like him visiting right now.. we need a vacation..
  "
5468,"
   ... *Dream just looks down* I've already outlived my entire timeline, so...
  ","
  ..Did I kiII the mood? Sorry, Death tends to do that *Reaper just pats Dream on the skull* if it helps at all, I can relate, I single handedly destroyed most of my timeline..my powers kiIIed everything and anyone.. there used to be more than just us Gods living there.. but what can you do? Moping around about it won't change it
  "
5469,"
   I can't die of natural causes, though I can be k!lled... so in a sense I'm immortal I suppose, Cross is not immortal I know I will outlive him someday. I understand why you did what you did, even if that day was going to be 1000 years away, just the thought is terrifying
  ","
  It takes a heII of a lot to tear me down but.. truth is..I can be kiIIed.. just like you.. given enough damage is taken.. Geno saw through my smoke and mirrors the hard way.. I.. dusted on him..a couple times.. *Reaper nervously rubs his arm* it's not easy to strike me down...but it is possible..when facing off against people as powerful as your husband and Nightmare for example..
  
  ..and...it is terrifying to know that one day you'll outlive most of your family..so if you knew a way that could stop you from ever losing them..you would do it, wouldn't you?
  "
5470,"
   *Dream listens silently, though from the fluctuations in his aura it's clear hearing this is upsetting him* I'm sorry, no one should go through anything like that. Besides You and Geno are really good for one another, so I don't know what they're talking about.
  ","
  ..You..really think so..? Your the only person to say that..besides Geno himself
  
  *Reaper chuckled a bit as a few more tears managed to escape his eye sockets*
  
  It's just..with all the heII we've gone through..and the fact it's like the entire universe in general is out to split us apart.. I was..starting to doubt myself..not just myself but our whole marriage.. I wanted him to stay with me forever..and trapped him in limbo so that he could..that might of been selfish on my part but.. I just wanted to give him a happily ever after that wouldn't get taken away from him..if he were immortal like me.. he wouldn't have his life taken away a second time.. that and.. I was honestly terrified of losing him... I really love him and the thought of me outliving him..having to watch him leave..and to never see him again..
  
  ....You get what I'm saying, right? Aren't you immortal too?

   teleported back about 10 minutes later with Dream who gasps at the sight of Reaper's bandaged injury* H-how did this happen?! *he shakes his head* never mind, the how isn't important at the moment *he sits at Reaper's bedside as his healing magic and aura wash over the god*
  ","
  *Reaper was actually starting to panic just within that short time frame until he heard Dream which means Geno had to be right beside him**The God relaxes as Dreams magic started to heal his injury and took away the pain he had caused himself in his drunken stupor*
  
  ..I guess..since you are about the only person nice enough to heal me...
  
  ...I can explain what happened..
  
  *Reaper then began to tell Dream about the incidents that have played out recently, from all the anons who have constantly harrassed him to many others who have ridiculed him and his entire relationship with Geno..he explains that all those negative comments had piled up so high..that it resulted in him nearly reaping himself.. he had doubts about him and Geno being together..and thought that Geno was too good to be with him and deserved much better...*

  Geno..if I did that to him by accident.. he would be gone...forever.. and I don't think I could live with myself if that happened...  if I left him out of limbo we wouldn't ever be able to do any of the stuff we can now..no hugging, holding hands.. he would risk dusting if we did.. if he wasn't in limbo, we wouldn't have any of our kiddos right now either..

  I don't exactly get along with them..it's not cause I don't want to but..when you have powers that could accidentally kill anyone and everyone you come in contact with..including your own kids..

   Vixxon:mmh.I should probably  clone her soon Nexion won't be happy if she's  still d3ad when I come back.

  Actually..I think more than just her cousin would be angry.. our kiddos are pretty attached to her and they would probably want to reap me if they found out I killed her by accident..

  Nova? Never thought I'd be so happy to hear from someone other than Geno...

5537,"
   Im Vixxon, Neo's core.I keep her alive and clone  her when she d!es like right now.She'd already exploded a couple days ago then you had to k!ll her again. -.-

  *No for his Death touch to break something metal he would have to be holding the object for a very long time, Vixxon is safe, but they might be p-ssed he killed Neo by accident, and by long time I mean he would have to be constantly holding Vixxon for a week straight for them to break, if Vixxon were made of wood though that's a different story..*

  "
5552,"
   How about we use the Life flower and just go to the surface,  there's that hotel suite you like
  ","
  *Reaper just smiles* The reason I like that Hotel is cause when you took me sightseeing, we stayed the night there, first time we slept in the same room~
  
  *That's...kinda sad actually*
  
  *That means even when they were first married and lived together, they didn't sleep in the same bed*

   Well that's good at least... I can't remember why I did something like that *in that pic Geno's still alive...*

  Pfft! *Reaper actually takes off laughing uncontrollably, to him it was pretty funny since Geno was pretty violent towards him in the beginning, he's a lot calmer now than he was in the beginning, Reapers constant flirting had him getting punched and slapped quite a bit, sometimes even more than just that*
  
  That's cute, you don't remember how you used to be do you? You hated whenever I flirted with you, called you cute, hugged you, let's just say it took me a few years just to be able to kiss you..

  Your the reason I like taking those vacations, it was one of the first things we did together, next to the games we played on the Save screen and well, our first dates~
  
  You showed me there was more than just Death in the world

5570,"
   where would you wanna go on vacation anyway?
  ","
  ..Why not the surface? Not sure if you remember it but..that's where we had our first vacation and we went sightseeing, you couldn't wait to show me all this stuff you saw back when you lived with Classic..your the one who taught me what restaurants and stores were

   Now that we finally have a chance to be lazy, I'm taking it

   How'd you lose your balance, don't you normally float?

  Well..you see..I use magic to keep myself floating like that and if my magic gets disrupted in any way..I can end up losing my balance and falling onto the floor..

  ..And to think you call me stubborn.. ... ..well.. I don't really know what to do here Love.. I don't want to risk us both ending up back on our Deathbeds and I really wanted us to have that break..we really need it...but I don't feel right leaving a kiddo that's Shinos age on their own.. ..

  Love, I know it looks like I've been beaten half to Death but I promise you I'm okay--wait--hold on--that came out wrong--

  I love when you do things like this~ *Reaper then clinks Genos cheek*

   Okay!:3 You're the best reaper!thank you!

  I--I wouldn't say that but.. don't mention it kiddo..*Reaper blushes a bit, he isn't used to anyone saying nice things about him, well aside from Geno but even when Geno says things like that it still shocks him sometimes*
  
  Now where's this cousin of yours?
  "
5620,"
   *Geno holds Goth with blue magic and puts a child harness on him with a magic suppressor in the claspe so Goth can't just teleport away* Sorry kiddo you brought us to this point

5621,"
   Really?:D
  ","
  *Reaper nodded*
  
  Yes, really, this will be our little secret okay kiddo? *he winks* Don't tell any of the other Gods about this and if your cousin asks how I know about this, I'll just say it's because I'm the Grim Reaper, the guy who causes Death should know when something involving Death happens, right?

   What the hell happened while I was asleep?!

  Uh...*Reaper then nervously rubs the back of his skull with his free hand, on top of the eyepatch he had, he rehooked the IV to himself, attached one to Geno as well since he was worried about him and left his once broken arm still in a sling over his neck* it's a long story..let's just say I was really desperate for a vacation and..well... one thing lead to another...it's really not a big deal Love, what matters is, we finally get that break we needed

5673,"
   Won't you get in trouble for skipping work?

  *He's fully healed but he doesn't want to go back out reaping just yet, so he's going to keep them to use as a excuse to skip work and may even add some fake injuries, he must be pretty desperate for a break if he's doing that*

  *When Geno had woken up, he finds Reaper flopped face down on the floor directly in front of the bed Ink had painted up for them..you can tell something seemed very wrong just from seeing him flopped there..if you look closely there was a black aura that seemed to be around him, it was much smaller than the one that appears when he releases his powers but it had the same affect, the hard floor beneath him was starting to crack..**And no his powers won't and can't affect Geno since he's in limbo, it won't affect Ink either because he has no Soul and Error is also in a sort of limbo on his own by being a glitch so he's safe too but I wouldn't recommend someone like Blueprint getting near him right now*

  ","
  *Reaper would flip if he knew Geno used his magic especially after they both agreed not to but currently he was unconscious..**Upon checking on the God, it seemed he was more than just unconscious, he didn't appear to be breathing, dumping him outside was a horrible decision on Lifes part..*
  "
5703,"
   *Geno doesn't have anything to say to that, just resting with Reaper laying against him*
  ","
  *It doesn't take long after that for Reaper to fall asleep against Geno, though even in his sleep, he hasn't let go of Genos hand*
  "
5704,"
   All the more reason to rest now that we actually have somewhere somewhat safe and have enough medical supplies
  ","
  *Reaper then rests his skull right under Genos*... Okay.. point taken.. sorry..if I killed the mood Love.. Death..tends to do that.. ..
  "
5705,"
   We'll make it through this... *no breaking up AfterDeath :( *
  ","
  *Reaper then clinks Genos hand* I hope your right Love.. but.. I'm.. not sure..I can keep going.. ..I've done nothing but slow you down lately..you've had to..l-literally drag me along with you..all month.. this has been pretty bad..
  "
5706,"
   *Geno rests one of his hands over Reaper's that's gripping at his robe* We both have to stand by, I think Life might help if only for my sake. But neither of us should use any more magic
  ","
  ..*Reaper then sighs as he rests against Geno* I g-guess that's..f-fair.. if you don't use yours.. I w-wont use mine..
  
  ..But.. ..if I'm being h-honest here.. I don't know..if we'll make it..out of this..one.. this has to be the w-worst we've ever dealt with..
  
  *he then lets go of his robe and holds Genos hand instead, resting it on his chest* I wouldn't of made it this long without you..
  "
5707,"
   long enough... no matter what happens don't you dare use any magic
  ","
  You..overheard me..didn't you..? ..But..Love.. you know I can't just stand by if--*Reaper then pauses in the middle of his sentence as he felt a sudden sharp pain in his Soul and ends up leaning against Geno with his hand seen tightly gripping his robe* ngh..!
  "
5708,"
   Reaper.... *someone was awake*
  ","
  ..Oh, hey sleepo~ *Reaper then clinks Genos cheek* can't say it's morning when it's night time now..how long were you awake?
  "
5709,"
   Reaper, stay with Life, if you go back to that place and spend the whole time traumatized, Geno will just worry about you the whole time, he won't be able to rest while you're suffering...
  ","
  ...*Reaper just sighs* ..Okay, you might be right..but.. I don't know what to do if someone tries to start a fight with us.. we won't survive another battle right now..Genos on his last leg and I already have a foot in the grave..
  
  ..*He then grips at his chest*
  
  ..There's no point to lying right now.. if I use anymore magic.. I'm gonna dust.. I feel it.. my Soul feels like it's being crushed by a boulder..and it hurts just to breathe.. moving at all feels like your whole body is being struck by thorns..
  
  *I think Geno would stick a magic suppressor on you if he overheard this*
  "
5710,"
   *they're probably safer with Life than somewhere that causes one of them to have flashbacks*
  ","
  *Someone might have to explain that to Reaper since he's thinking about heading back there..it might give him lots of trauma but Geno would get some rest in and be safe there..right?*
  "
5711,"
   *Geno dozes off resting against Reaper, clearly calmer than he's been in awhile now that both of them finally have proper care*
  ","
  *Reaper is still a bit worried they might come across more trouble while they recover, but going back to the house where he has constant WW2 flashbacks..doesn't seem like the greatest decision either..sure it might be safer but it would be harder for Geno to stay this calm if his husband was constantly screaming from nightmares and freaking out..was it worth it?*
  
  ..*He stays awake wondering what he should do as he kept a close eye on Geno*
  "
5712,"
   :D You're welcome.  *leaves you to rest*
  ","
  *I think Opal has become like a mom figure to everyone lol she's such a random cinnamon roll*
  "
5713,"
   Yeah... *Reaper now sees Geno had brought an IV stand with him that he was hooked up to, he sits down next to the god and leans against him* glad we cleared things up, now we just gotta recover *he has his eye closed smiling*
  ","
  *Reaper was honestly relieved to see Geno had his IV with him, he knew he was low on magic just like he was..though at the same time it's also worrying*
  
  *But right now, he's gonna try pushing his worries aside and take this moment to cuddle with Geno, he sets down his pillow and wraps his arm around his Tsundere*
  
  Guess I don't need that bleach now.. I'm happy your here Love, no matter what happens, Death will always follow you wherever you go~
  
  *I wonder since he was in the doorway while Reaper talked to Opal...he might have overheard them..*
  "
5714,"
   *pulls out the donuts* Here you go, I'm fresh out of bleach.
  ","
  *Reaper doesn't normally do this but he actually hugs Opal, making sure to have a hold on his Death touch so he doesn't instantly kiII her, it might be purely on accident if it happened but he would have a angry Nova after him for it*
  
  ..Don't get used to this.. but thanks..
  "
5715,"
   They seemed to think I wanted to leave you cause Life misunderstood something I said to her. Yeah our life might be hectic, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm not leaving you, I don''t need a break from you, I love you, you idiot
  ","
  G-Geno..*That got Reaper smiling and he manages to dry his tears after hearing his Tsundere*
  
  ..I..I love you too Love..it's why I call you Love, your the love of my life~ and..I might be a idiot..but I'll always be your idiot~ ..You uh..wanna lay with me..?
  "
5716,"
   Opal: Reaper, If Geno is still with you now, after everything, he's not going to leave you period.  Just relax and focus on getting better. Geno will be waiting for you.
  ","
  T-thanks Opal..I-I hope your right..*Reaper then starts wiping his tears away with his sleeve but new ones kept forming, he can't seem to get himself to stop crying*
  
  ..m-maybe.. by any chance.. do you have any donuts..? Or bleach?
  "
5717,"
   I'll go rest in a minute, you needed me?  Don't tell me the anons said something stupid to you too....
  ","
  *Reaper can't bring himself to look Geno in the eye as he started shaking and tightly hugs the pillow close*
  
  ..G-Geno.. you should b-be resting.. y-you needed a break f-from me..right? This..isn't h-helping your break..
  
  ..w-wait..did..you say..anons bothered you t-too..?
  "
5718,"
   Opal: Everyone needs down time, Reaper.  Even you. Even Geno. It doesn't mean he doesn't love you.  A bit of time apart once in a while is good for the relationship.
  ","
  Y-you sure..? ..I-I mean..*Reaper then hugs his pillow a bit more tightly* .. the only t-time I'm away from him is when I h-have to go reaping.. but.. I'm not sure we could go several days without..  what if something happens or..he finds someone b-better..G-Ganz still has a crush on him..he's tried taking Geno from me w-when we first started living together.. I thought he was gonna l-leave me.. I erased his memories back then..to make sure he didn't..*Oof*
  "
5719,"
   *he shouldn't get up but Geno is worried, he peeks in* Reaper? What happened?
  ","
  *Reaper is seen currently in tears with the lower half of his skull buried into a pillow he was hugging close to his chest, making only his eye sockets visible when he heard Geno*
  
  ..L-Love..? S-shouldnt..you b-be resting..r-right now..? *sniff*
  "
5720,"
   Opal: Reaper, everyone needs a break once in awhile.  Even my husband and I needed to take breaks from each other. It made us more happy when we were together.  Geno loves you.
  ","
  W-what..? *Reaper then pokes his skull up from the pillow he was crying into*.. you..take breaks..from your husband..? And..your both..still together..? I..I don't think..I can stand being away from him..too long..
  "
5721,"
   *a very confused Geno heard him from Life's couch* huh?
  ","
  *Reaper then stopped calling for Geno as he began crying in the other room he was in, oof..Lifes little mishap and the anon had brought him to tears*
  "
5722,"
   Helpful anon: *beats other anon* that's not true! Geno loves you.
  ","
  *Reaper can't help but cry, he grabs a hold of a nearby pillow and starts crying into it, oof* b-but..he wants a b-break from me.. I didnt k-know I was that b-bad..
  "
5723,"
   good job geno doesn't want to be with you anymore
  ","
  *And that comment was all it took for Reaper to start freaking out*
  
  GENO!!
  "
5724,"
   I won't fall down, I refuse to. *though after Reaper is patched up Geno really should rest ffs*
  ","
  ..*Reaper sighs and just lays his skull against Geno* Love.. I really hope your right.. but you still need some rest you know.. I'm not the only one hurting here..
  
  *Reaper has tried getting Geno to rest but his condition didn't really help matters..*
  "
5725,"
   I can't, I can't risk you dusting on me, please, I can't go through that
  ","
  Geno..*Reaper then raises his hand up and holds Genos cheek* ...I don't w-want to lose you either Love.. you could f-fall down if you keep using magic l-like this..that's not any better than dusting..

5726,"
   *He freaks and takes Reaper to Life*
  ","
  *Reaper did not expect that*
  
  L-Love..!? W-wait--
  "
5727,"
   *the silence is NOT helping*
  ","
  ..*Oof**Reaper thinks he came up with something to calm Genos nerves*
  
  Geno..it's okay Love..nobody's dusting yet, you don't have to worry... as long as we limit our magic, we should be okay..
  "
5728,"
   Reaper, no changing the topic, are you going to dust on me? I will beg
   
    @TheGoddessOfLife
   
   for help if I need to, you can't die on me
  ","
  ..Geno..
  
  *Reaper then goes silent as he tries to think of a response that won't cause Geno to panic though I think he's already panicked*
  "
5729,"
   wait, wait, wait, wait, you're saying YOU just Dug your OWN GRAVE?!!? *Geno needs anti anxiety medicine*
  ","
  *It was at this moment, Reaper knew, he had f-cked up**hearing Geno shout from panic, startled him a bit but he looks up at his Tsundere and tries to give a reassuring smile but he looks more nervous than reassuring* It was..just a bad pun..? You shouldn't worry Love..calm down--*Oof poor Geno*
  
  but for the record..you can't die cause..you know..limbo.. so.. anyway
  
  *he's trying to change the subject*
  
  Have I said how cute you look today?~
  "
5730,"
   What? *poor choice of words*
  ","
  *I don't think he realized how poorly he worded that, Reaper then lets himself rest against Geno, laying in his arms*
  
  I'll be damned..if I let you fall down on me..I can deal with a few nightmares if it means your safe..
  "
5731,"
   shush, I don't know if being here as such a good idea... maybe we should just be home but have the kids stay with Life for a bit
  ","
  ..*Reapers hand then grips part of Genos hoodie as he keeps his skull buried into his chest*..but.. Love..we risk being attacked at home.. at least here.. we can get a break.. it might bring back..some real.. bad memories but.. I'd rather deal with that than risk another fight.. we won't last in another fight right now Love..one of us is almost fallen down..and the other..just dug their own grave..
  "
5732,"
   *Geno pulls Reaper into a hug, he clearly needs it*
  ","
  *Aw**Reaper was caught by surprise when he was pulled into a hug and he just wraps a arm around Geno before crying into his chest, he really did need the hug*
  
  G-Geno..!
  "
5733,"
   aside from being rally tired? Yeah I think so
  ","
  You can lay down a bit longer..I know it's not like the stuff we have at home but..*Reaper then pauses as he looks around the room and visibly shivers with his arm wrapped around himself* ...
  "
5734,"
   I'm going to worry about you anyway
  ","
  *Reaper blushed a bit* You still shouldn't.. a-anyway..aside from waking you up like that..your okay?
  "
5735,"
   Maybe I should set back up our IVs and we both rest in bed... are you sure you're ok here though
  ","
  *Reaper looks really nervous and hesitates to answer for a moment*..I-I'll be fine Love.. don't worry about me.. it's you I'm more worried about.. remember I'm Death, it's not easy to kill Death..
  
  *honestly being in his old ""home"" has wrecked his nerves, he hasn't had any nightmares like that before where he actually takes off screaming and flips out in his sleep but it's the only place that nobody has easy access too even though this is technically Reapers version of the Save screen, Papyrus's room doesn't have much but by their ancient standards he had a normal kids room, a wooden bed, a wooden desk and wooden toys, Reapers bedroom on the other hand..was literally just a hallway closet with absolutely nothing in there except a old fashioned mop and broom.. unless you count the blood/dust stains on the walls and floor, which is why he took Geno to his brothers room instead of his own, I think Geno might feel bad if he discovers that..Reapers Gaster was pretty horrible to him..well, he's still horrible to him, he's a mega d0uche, it's also why Reaper was ""emotionless"" for a long time..his Gasters treatment made him not care about anyone or anything anymore, he basically locked up all his emotions and stopped caring about whatever happened around him, His attitude used to be like ""So your AUs on fire? Cool, makes my job easier, maybe I can roast marshmallows while I'm there"" so basically he used to be a huge d0uche until he met Geno, Geno got him to start caring more about others and really changed him*
  "
5736,"
   Surprised me, but not hurt me. Wasn't expecting your wings to appear like that
  ","
  *Reaper sighs in relief at that and just pulls Geno into a hug* S-sorry about that Love..
  "
5737,"
   *He also managed to knock Geno back who hadn't expected his wings to appear* currently, on the floor
  ","
  *Oof**Reaper then stops when he heard Geno and he pushes himself up into a seated position to look around* ..L-Love..? But.. if your here.. that means... that was a dream wasn't it..? I..I didn't hurt you did I!?
  "
5738,"
   *Geno shakes Reaper gently to wake him*
  ","
  *Reaper was a bit startled when he was woken up and he starts flapping his wings uncontrollably which causes him to start flopping backwards on the floor like a fish out of water, as you can imagine, that ends up knocking over his IV stand* W-where am I!?
  "
5739,"
   *friggin internet!!* *Geno bolts upright at the screaming, yelping in pain as the sudden action yanked out his own IV, he checks on Reaper*
  ","
  *Reaper would be concerned if he were awake but he's currently caught up in his own nightmare, he seemed terrified, his eye was glowing that ghostly blue color and his wings were wrapped around himself as if he were getting attacked* N-not again! I can't be back here!! Geno!!
  "
5740,"
   *Geno sets up an IV for reaper without using any magic, he gets one set for himself as well before allowing himself to sleep*
  ","
  *A few hours later after they finally get some rest in,
  
  Being back in his old ""home"" had triggered the Death God to have some nightmares, Geno may be shocked when he wakes up and hears Reaper screaming*
  
  N-no!! G-Get away from me!!
  "
5741,"
   Reaper? *Geno's worried about him*
  ","
  *Reaper doesn't respond and just lays on the ground with his eyes closed, he needs to stop using his magic like this, they both do honestly*
  "
5742,"
   *Geno's eye widens when Reaper manages that* ok, fine I'll rest, but you're joining me
  ","
  D-Death..never..sleeps.. I'll b-be fine..Love..
  
  *Reaper was struggling with it but he was determined to get Geno to bed, he takes him to his brothers old room, it was nothing like any of the other Papyrus, since race cars and toys like that don't exist in ReaperTale, they are from ancient times after all, you see a wooden bed with makeshift toys made out of wood in a pile in the corner of the room but aside from that, the room seemed empty*
  
  *He then sets Geno on the bed before collapsing in the middle of the floor, his chains disappearing shortly after*
  
  D-damn..it..
  "
5743,"
   Stop using your magic dammit. Look I know I'm not doing great but that's why we're here, to rest and recover privately
  ","
  Ngh..*Reaper winces and starts gripping at his robe but he doesn't let loose of Geno and instead forces himself up out of the wheelchair and carries Geno upstairs* W-well.. I'm m-making..sure.. you r-rest..
  "
5744,"
   I'm just really tired, when did I not answer you?
  ","
  ..Geno..*Reaper went from pouting to looking concerned* ..you don't remember? *he then summons his blue chains that gently wrap around Geno, lifting him up though Reaper was straining himself by using his magic*
  "
5745,"
   *admin needed some sleep badly* yeah Reaper?
  ","
  *Reaper seemed to be pouting, honestly he was worried*
  
  ..You didn't answer me..are you okay?
  "
5746,"
   *Geno just sets up IV's for them both before finally resting*
  ","
  *Reaper just frowned*
  
  ..Love?
  "
5747,"
   You ok? *Geno noticed him freeze up*
  ","
  ..Uh..w-what? ..I-I'm fine Love.. are you okay though? I was gonna ask that first but..I got distracted..
  "
5748,"
   *Geno just gets them both in the house, he needs a break, they both do*
  ","
  *Reaper was about to say something along the lines of asking if Geno was okay but he instantly freezes up once they were both inside the house, they both did need a break even if it meant they had to resort to staying in a place like this, the outside looked like just about every Sans and Papyrus's house but the inside was far different, wooden walls, red carpet and a picture of Gaster was hung up on the wall along with one of RT Papyrus but none of Reaper*
  "
5749,"
   I'm not up for using any more magic right now lets just get inside and get our medical supplies set up
  ","
  *Reaper frowned a bit*..Geno..you shouldn't be using your magic period.. I could of teleported us..
  
  *he then grabs their suitcase and lays it on his lap before reaching a hand out to grab Genos, he's planning on discreetly sharing his magic with him*
  "
5750,"
   *Geno gets Reaper into the wheelchair and teleports them to the place Reaper described* if.. if someone manages to bother us here....
  ","
  T-thanks Love.. and sorry..you've had to keep dragging me along with you..literally.. you okay enough to be teleporting like that..?
  
  *Reaper then pauses after he hears Geno*
  
  ...Hey, nobody will get us here..I promise..
  "
5751,"
   *Geno tells the kids who are home to go to Life's and sends them with a message asking Life to look after them for awhile, he leaves a note behind for Goth and finishes packing all the medical supplies in a Fresh suitcase* ok... I think I should teleport us...
  ","
  ..W-wait.. I can..just.. ow..*Reaper then winces as he topples over on his side on the floor, he wanted to help Geno but his condition wasn't letting him, he didn't even have the strength to get himself into the wheelchair* ..G-Geno..
  "
5752,"
   yeah we should *takes Geno a bit to find it and wheel it over*
  ","
  Thanks Love..*Reaper then tries to pull himself up off the floor once Geno brought it over but he can't seem to lift himself not even a inch off the ground, he tries with all his might but it ends with him being entirely out of breath* .. ..
  "
5753,"
   I think it's probably better if they stay with Life, I don't think they should see that place. Also can you get me one of the suitcases
   
    @NinetiesNightmare
   
   gave us, he puts pocket dimensions in them I'll be able to fit the IV stands and everything
  ","
  Your probably right.. and..I can do that but..I might need some help getting up first.. do we still have that wheelchair around? ..*Reaper didn't want to resort to using a wheelchair or to have to rely on Geno but he doesn't have any strength left to move right now*
  "
5754,"
   What about the kids, should we send them to Life? *Geno has already started gathering up medical supplies*
  ","
  We can take them with if you want to.. ..do you need help packing Love..?
  "
5755,"
   Are you sure?
  ","
  ..I don't have any better ideas..if we went to any of the other Gods people can still find us there... Gasters house might be our best shot if we want some alone time.. nobody here aside from me, Gaster and Paps know about it and you now ..so it's pretty safe to stay there..
  "
5756,"
   Yeah....
  ","
  ..He has a hidden house near waterfall..it's been abandoned so..we can stay there for a while..he moved out of there to work on some sort of ""project"" of his..
  
  *Though Reaper himself hated the idea for various reasons, it seemed like their best option right now*
  
  *You know that secret door in Classic UT where you find Gaster in waterfall? In ReaperTale that actually leads to a hidden area where RTGaster used to live, there's a secret area with a house there much like that passage in the ruins that shows Toriels house*
  "
5757,"
   Like where?
  ","
  I know a place not many people know about.. you remember my Gaster? *Reaper then holds his arm that's still placed in a sling, he seemed a bit upset*
  "
5758,"
   *Geno just grabs Reaper's wrist and shakes his head, before beginning to set up IVs for the both of them* If someone knocks on the door again, we're ignoring it
  ","
  *Reaper was really surprised Geno had stopped him and he just sighs as he sits on the floor with his back leaning against their bed after the IVs were set up* ..Last time I ignored it, we had a Death threat..I think we need to take the kiddos and go somewhere else for a bit..
  "
5759,"
   looking for you *Geno pulls Reaper to his 'feet' and picks up his scythe before teleporting them home* I... I'm not sure I'm feeling up for a date anymore
  ","
  *Reaper knows this is probably a bad decision but he was really worried about Geno using his magic like this, so he starts sharing his own with him*
  
  ..Geno..I would of been fine.. I said I'd be back..it j-just..took longer than we thought it would.. you shouldn't of..done that.. your low on m-magic too..you know..? ..We can just skip the date for now..
  "
5760,"
   *it isn't long after that text that Geno shows up at Reaper's side following their Soulbont to the right AU.. though he's looking pretty tired too* Reaper?
  ","
  *Reaper is seen laying against a tree, breathing heavily with his phone laying on the ground beside him and his scythe laying in his lap, with noticeably dark black circles under his eye sockets as he looks up at Geno, who honestly seemed tired out himself which made Reaper worried*
  
  ..L-Love..? Didn't..I just..tell you..not to use magic..? What are you..doing here..?

5761,"
   -Are you ok?-
  ","
  ""my names depth not okag you forgoat my name?""

  *Oof so she's the crazy one and her brother is actually trying to help her?**Reaper had dozed off for a bit while she was talking to him though, which honestly seemed a bit rude he just dozed off in the middle of their conversation, he's seen sleeping against a tree with his scythe laying in his lap*

5763,"
   *Reaper gets a worried text from Geno* -Where are you?-

5765,"
   Yeah, their Socket has to keep their Allura on a leash since she's like our socket
  ","
  ..That's just great..*Reaper then sighs as he sits himself down on the ground and leans back against a nearby tree, judging from his heavy breathing he seemed really worn out*

  I'll take that as a no..*Reaper then takes Allessa back to her timeline through a portal*

   I was immune to the toxins in Allura's timeline, this shouldn't be any different. But Raven and Shino might be at risk
  ","
  Okay..I'll take your word for it..but just to be safe..maybe keep your distance between you and her..
  
  She's another version of Allura but..*Reaper pauses for a moment, he looks a bit worried*..

   Yeah.Doesnt help some of us are dangerous.It can corrupt the mind and soul.We aren't allowed  to leave for our or  other monsters safety .

5774,"
   ... what if she gets you or worse Geno sick?

  *Now that has Reaper worried..though not sure Geno can get sick like that given he's in limbo, but Reaper is definitely freaked out now*
  
  ..... ..
  "
5775,"
   It still hasn't been determined what makes a monster vulnerable to getting sick.Only some have but for safety  reason they keep us all in one place.Away from anyone else except the guards and doctors who wear protective gear.We are basically treated like a hazardous  thing.
  ","
  So..they keep you there to experiment on you, in hopes to find a cure but they treat you like a disease while doing so..am I understanding this right?
  "
5776,"
   if the toxins destroy their minds.... I imagine there's need for asylums

  I think you might of been right on that part..she said she escaped the hospital..and I don't see a reason to keep them locked up unless..well, what you said..

  ..So that's why you have those suppressors? Using your magic causes the toxin to affect you quicker..well your timeline is definitely different..don't understand why they have to keep you locked up in a hospital though..why aren't you allowed to leave?

   Part 1: All sick  monsters are captured by undyne and royal  guards and put in the hospital  so the doctors can watch  and run experiments hoping to find a cure.I have early  stages of toxin.So they locked me up and force me to wear this.To much magic  use can actually make you sicker faster.

  That's not good...but hold on there kiddo, why were you in the hospital? And what's with the suppressor?

   I've kinda been getting lost I can't use my magic so I've just been using these portal rifts that happen all over the universe. Some just lead to reapertale.My AU has toxin but it's in another form not all monsters get it.In my AU toxin slowly destroys the mind as well  as the body and soul .

   Reaper no, that has a possessed doll in it

  WHAT!? *Reaper shrieks and throws the movie on the floor along with summoning his blue chains around their bed to shield them from the DVD..* THERE'S A POSSESSED DOLL TRAPPED INSIDE THAT THING!?

5960,"
   Yeah, we really could *Geno won't admit it, willingly anyway, but he's both very comfy and very happy right now*

  *Reaper can tell he's happy even without Geno saying a single word, the fact he has a smile on his face says it all*
  
  A anon handed me a movie we could watch~ Said it's something that'll make you even more cuddly~

  What's the hug for..?
  "
5967,"
   ...you really have that much trouble? *Geno didn’t realize*
  ","
  ..Well..kinda? It's.. kinda why I avoid our kiddos like the plague.. my death touch can kiII most of them..
  
  The only ones not affected by it are Gothy and I think Sorell, the rest of them can dust if I touch them..
  
  I did..accidentally dust Shino a few times..
  
  ..So yeah.. that's why I'm not as friendly with them as I am with Gothy.. I'd rather have them all p-ssed off at me than dusting like that..
  
  *Reaper sighs, Geno probably will be shocked to know that, it wasn't because of his lack of emotions, he's actually afraid of interacting with their kids so he's mean to them in order to push them away*
  "
5968,"
   Wait I didn't realize your death touch could affect appliances as well...
  ","
  *Reaper then nervously smiles as he rubs the back of his skull*
  
  It takes a little while to affect things like metal but if I use it enough overtime it starts to rust and there goes the whole kitchen..
  
  Remember I said I had a lot of trouble building this house? I really meant it.. imagine trying to build a house but the materials kept falling apart as soon as you touched them..
  "
5969,"
   You want to try cooking? I should probably stay in the kitchen with you just in case. You refuse to let me teach you how to actually cook and bake and such
  ","
  *Reaper then stares down at the ground*
  
  ..It's not that I don't want you to teach me but..just..my Death touch gives me trouble sometimes.. ..let's just say people aren't the only things it can kiII.. I've broken our stove I don't know how many times and it's lead to the whole kitchen going up in flames..and the times I do have it in check I manage to get the food set on fire instead.. you should stay here so you don't get burned..

5970,"
   What are you writing there?
  ","
  *Reaper then sets down the pen and paper on the nightstand beside their bed before hugging Geno*
  
  Don't worry about it..I'm just happy your awake..! If you want, I can try making you some pancakes?

   *later* Reaper?

Neo:Can I come?I wanna see!

  Okay, so mind taking me to your planet?

5973,"
   Make him Waffles, pancakes and french toast

  *Reaper laughs at the fact there's actually a song singing about pancakes and waffles, as silly as it was, it cheered him up a tad*
  
  I'll think about it when he wakes up, I'm not exactly a chef and tend to set the kitchen on fire whenever I'm in there
  "
5974,"
   You'd do that for me?
  ","
  Yeah, why not? You don't seem like a bad kiddo and your probably the only one on your planet that knows not to follow your dads orders..you know not to eat Neo here and.. I could use something to keep myself distracted ..just scaring some sense into the old man wouldn't hurt anything would it?

5975,"
   *Geno helps still Reaper’s hand and insert the IV* There see, everything will be fine now. *Geno ends up asleep quickly*

  *Reaper just sighs afterwards and lays his skull down at Genos bedside* ..you better be right.. I can't lose you Love.. heh..I'm falling apart just thinking about losing you.. knowing you and Error are actually.. and that this is the month where most versions of you become Errors is just... it's terrifying me.. I know you said it won't happen..but what if it does? There's still that chance it could...
  
  ...I-I'm really scared Love.. not that you probably don't already know.. I haven't done a good job hiding it..
  
  All I've done was cry the last few days..

   I think I just need a nap, but we can set one up if it would put your mind at easee

  *Reaper looked pretty surprised, Geno saw right through him and knew he was worried*
  
  Heh..we really can read eachother like books huh?
  
  *he then begins setting up a magic IV for Geno but stops when he has to hook it to his Soul, his hand was shaking too badly for him to go through with it, showing he was still terrified* ..Damn it..!
  "
5977,"
   *Geno just chuckles at the joke, he immediately and noticeably relaxes once in bed*
  ","
  Told you, you needed a break *Reaper was smiling but he was honestly just masking his concern, he was extremely worried about Geno more so thanks to anons but panicking and flipping out doesn't help so he's trying to stay calm, having some time out together helped him calm down, he isn't a crying mess like he was earlier*
  
  You haven't been in any fights lately but you've still been busy working yourself to Death with magic..
  
  Do you..need a IV or..

  Hi Tired, I'm Death~

  Uh..*Reaper then rubs his skull nervously* I might of forgot..maybe I'm still forgetting a few things after that hit to the skull?
  
  *That's a excuse so he doesn't look like a idiot*

5980,"
   You are not getting your ass in trouble right when we finally have some peace. Also trying to scare an alien king, if it backfires we could have a whole kingdom out to get us. Yes us.

  Aw come on Love~ I know you love me~ *he winks* and you know, I don't mind when you hit on me~ your too adorable~

6031,"
   Reaper not now *Geno rubs his temple annoyed* We need to figure out how to bring your memory back
  ","
  You said we have babies~ Why not make another one?~ *Reaper then wraps a arm around Geno* I'm sure it'll come back to me after a little fun time~ *He has every excuse possible to get Geno in bed--*
  "
6032,"
   Well..Im neo!A friend of your kids!You beat up a bunch of bounty hunters for me you're awesome!
  ","
  *Aw why is she so adorable?**Reaper blushed slightly as he rubs his nonexistent nose, that's the first time anyone's ever told him he was awesome* ..Uh..thanks kiddo, not many people would be saying Death is awesome ..but.. I think..I remember doing something like that.. just..my memories are still kinda fuzzy.. so I helped you huh? *he then pets Neo on the head*
  "
6033,"
   Yeah just really needed sleep, it's been a stressful few weeks
  ","
  Do you still need sleep..? You were out a whole day...
  
  ....I can help with stress, a little something called making love~
  "
6034,"
   .... to answer the anon, pretty sure I'm NOT in fact dead
  ","
  *Reaper just sighs in relief, he seemed happy that Geno was up and was back to normal* I love you..
  "
6035,"
   I'm fine dumbasses
  ","
  *Reaper looks back at Geno once hearing him and immediately hugs his Tsundere, burying his skull into him* I haven't been so happy to be called a dumb@$$.. You okay Love?
  "
6036,"
   You don't remember  me? o.o
  ","
  Sorry kiddo, I really don't..*Reaper then points to his skull* I took a few hits to the head and I kinda forgot a lot of stuff.. at least that's what Geno told me
  "
6037,"
   How do you know he isn't dead?
  ","
  ..I trapped him in limbo..he CAN'T die..*Reaper is doing his best to try and keep himself calm but considering today is Errors birthday, the day where Geno became Error in the first place, had him on edge*
  "
6038,"
   Is Geno dead?
  ","
  ...He's not dead! He's just..been asleep..a while... he needs the rest..
  "
6039,"
   He won’t, Error already exists so Geno CANNOT become Error
  ","
  *Reaper still stayed beside Geno anyway, he didn't want to risk anything happening to his Tsundere* ..
  "
6040,"
   Maybe try talking to your kids see if that jogs your memory
  ","
  I guess that couldn't hurt..but I don't wanna leave Geno alone..especially when..tomorrow..*Reaper looks about ready to start crying all over again, he was pretty terrified after learning Geno can become Error*
  "
6041,"
   *Geno's asleep from stress, he'll probably be out cold awhile, he'd be even more stressed if he knew Reaper's memory was still gone*
  ","
  *Reaper is extremely worried about Geno, which is why he flipped out yesterday, he seems calmer today, for now at least, but he's going to be panicking if Geno doesn't wake up at all today.. he knows Genos been stressed but that's kind of normal for Geno, he always gets stressed over something but he isn't normally K.O'd all day from it*..
  "
6042,"
   Did you get your memory back, also how's Geno?
  ","
  A little bit..I think ..but not all of it.. I still don't remember having kiddos..
  
  But I've kept a close eye on Geno..he's still asleep..
  "
6043,"
   How often do people get mad at you for not reaping them??
  ","
  You'd be surprised... but I have rules to follow, I can't just go reaping people who aren't on my list.. there's big consequences for it..
  "
6044,"
   When you go reaping is it dangerous?
  ","
  ..Well, yeah, it can be pretty dangerous..just depends on the timeline..most of the time though I'm either in a fight with the person because they don't wanna go or I get people like this who aren't even on my list that try to kick my a$$ for NOT reaping them.. most the time I'm in a fight
  "
6045,"
   *well Geno passed out from the stress not long after... these two really don't get a break*
  ","
  *Maybe they could finally get that vacation they wanted?*
  "
6046,"
   Fine, I'll stay right here. *Geno is stressed again, thanks anons*
  ","
  *
  
   @anon
  
  take back your people dammit lol*
  
  *Reaper had finally calmed down though he ended up collapsing against Geno which doesn't help*
  "
6047,"
   Don't worry, Geno loves you too much to do anything like that, you won't lose him
  ","
  *Reaper finally calmed down completely after hearing that although he ends up collapsing against Geno, talk about scaring him to Death*
  "
6048,"
   Anons that's enough! *Geno ends up unleashing several blasters on the anonymous creatures* *he rubs his lone temple* Nothing is going to happen
  ","
  *They honestly deserved that given all the trouble they cause*
  
  *Reaper meanwhile, just wraps his arms around Geno with his skull now laying directly under his chin*
  
  ..If anything d-did happen to you..I-I don't know what I'd do.. just..s-stay with me..at least u-until we skip Errors birthday.. you have to stay..
  "
6049,"
   Jeez! *Geno's now worried about Reaper he hasn't seen him like this* Fine I'll stay right here *He hugs Reaper to reassure him, and definitely isn't giving Goth his phone back given the state Reaper is in*
  ","
  *Reaper seemed to calm down a bit when Geno agreed to stay and ends up laying in his Tsunderes arms, he was pretty shaken by the thought of losing Geno in just a few days, to think he could experiment with his Determination and be gone in a instant frightened the living heII out of him, Goth will live without a phone for a day*
  
  ....
  "
6050,"
   just make sure you keep a good eye on him ok? He could still wind up playing with his DT
  ","
  Y-your not helping....
  "
6051,"
   *internet trouble* do you really need more sleep I mean we didn’t even get out of bed, I should at least check on the kids...
  ","
  *Reaper started tearing up all over again with his hands curled up against his chest, he looked completely distraught and scared*
  
  G-Geno..y-you promised not to leave m-meeee-eeee...
  
  *Oof the anons really terrified him*
  "
6052,"
   But Geno IS Error he told you he is himself
  ","
  ...Just drop it..please? *Reaper was actually pleading for the subject to be dropped, it must of hit him pretty hard finding out they really are the same person*
  "
6053,"
   Did you forget back on the Save Screen Geno was trying to wipe out the multiverse in a twisted attempt to end the cycle of violence?
  ","
  *Reaper actually summons his blaster and fires it at you* He isn't like Error!! END OF STORY!
  "
6054,"
   I'm Not going to leave you, I promise
  ","
  Thanks Love..*Reaper gives a smile up at Geno before resting against him, he's still going to be on high alert now thanks to this knowledge though..* you wanna take another nap..?
  "
6055,"
   Please calm down love, you're getting worked up for nothing. I think Error overlooked the fact that he already exists meaning no version of me is going to become him. Anons I think were just trying to make you freak out
  ","
  *Reaper hiccups as he wipes some of his tears against Genos arm*
  
  ..P-promise you won't leave me.. please..
  "
6056,"
   *Geno hugs Reaper* No it doesn't, because of timeline splitting both Error and I can exist. It's likely that the ""me"" that became Error didn't end up with you to begin with. So no one is losing anyone, ok?
  ","
  *Reaper was surprised and hugs his Tsundere back tightly, crying into his shoulder, just the idea of losing Geno made him distressed*..
  
  I-I hope your r-right.. ..b-but..never meeting you isn't any better..
  "
6057,"
   Whatever version of me became Error, his mind was broken by hatred for everyone else after losing his happy ending and the transformation into an Error, he only has vague memories of being me.
  ","
  ..Geno.. *Reaper was starting to tear up* ..t-that means.. I end up losing you...doesn't it..? ..
  "
6058,"
   Error and I are the same person, yes *Geno sighs*
  ","
  ...I don't believe it..*Reaper then looks up at Geno* if you both were the same person..he wouldn't or YOU wouldn't, try to kiII me whenever you saw me and you wouldn't go out of your way to try and destroy every AU in the multiverse either..that's not like you..
  "
6059,"
   .... it's not important. Just anons trying to cause panic as always
  ","
  W-wait..wait..my memory might be a little f-cked up right now..but I'm not Ink.. I won't forget that quickly...*Reaper frowned* ..your the one that said it..you said another you..experimented with their Determination ..and turned into Error..? ...
  "
6060,"
   No not that, I'm fairly sure I'm not the Geno who becomes Error so it shouldn't be an issue. Think about it if Error came into existence on the 4th that would be when that version of me experimented with his DT
  ","
  ..*Reaper had no knowledge of any of this even before he hit his skull*
  
  ..What the heII are you talking about Love?
  "
6061,"
   That's Error's birthday.... oh I see….
  ","
  And..? I know its Errors birthday..*Reaper frowned*
  
  ...I don't get why they're warning me though..I don't think Error would attack you on his birthday..
  "
6062,"
   Hey, make sure you keep a close eye on Geno on the 4th
  ","
  ..Why on that date specifically..? *Reaper gives a slight glare*
  "
6063,"
   Hi again!:3*She is wearing a pink and black dress*
  ","
  Oh, hey uh...who are you again? *Oof*
  "
6064,"

  ","
  Don't worry about me Love..you've been taking care of me lately..so let me take care of you too..*Reaper then nuzzles Geno* besides your almost asleep..

6065,"
   *he used a life flower he got from an anon on Goth's page* *not gonna question how the anons got one of those*
  ","
  *That doesn't stop Reaper though, he was pretty worried about Geno, he did cough up blœd twice today*
  
  *I don't wanna know how the anons got ahold of those*
  "
6066,"
   No, kinda distracted
  ","
  ..*Reaper frowned and starts sharing his magic with Geno* Love..it's nice to see you care about me..but you should take care of yourself too..
  "
6067,"
   *it doesn't take much coaxing, after all he'd gotten fairly banged up in the prank too*
  ","
  *Reaper was still worried about that,  Geno didn't eat any of the healing items did he?*
  
  ..Before you sleep...did you eat any of the donuts I gave you Love..?
  "
6068,"
   right now, that doesn't sound half bad
  ","
  *Reaper then tugs on Genos sleeve, trying to motion for him to lay down with him*
  "
6069,"
   ....I really hope so, things were finally calming down too.... *Geno just sits on the bed, it looks as if someone drained all the energy right out of him*
  ","
  Hey, aside from falling over myself everything was calm..*Reaper smiles up at Geno to try and reassure him* ..you look dead tired..you wanna take a Death nap with me..?

6070,"
   You did hit the floor pretty hard when Goth pranked us....
  ","
  So..that's what happened..*Reaper then lays his skull against Geno* ...try not to worry yourself too much.. I'll get my memory back Love..

6071,"
   Please tell me you remember... otherwise I'm gonna need a lot of help here
  ","
  ..K-kinda.. ..just..give me a minute ..it feels like I was hit in the skull.. ..

6072,"
   oh Stars this is gonna be tough to explain, you've forgotten everything. Also Goth is one of 5 kids we have, though due to your Hatred from Chara, yes I know about that you reaped two of them

  Wait how did you--I thought--*Reaper then pauses as he holds his skull, hopefully that means Geno jogged some of his memory* ghk..

6077,"
   Ok Reaper how much do you remember, how long have we been married

  *Well Tbh I know absolutely nothing about the SCP foundation other than it's a bunch of creepypasta like monsters that take different forms and shapes and can easily kill you XD I don't know anything else but if there's somehow a deadly tissue box SCP which I watched on YT, they probably do function like the monsters in UT and that probably would disable their magic making it unusable*

  ","
  *Agreed, you can go with the reality anchors or with Reaper nullifying all teleports to the house, he can't make a barrier like the other Gods can but he can do that much*

6211,"
   *something I read had Reaper able to nullify teleportation directly into his house, wanna just use that*
  ","
  *That is true actually, he can do that, you have to have special permission to teleport directly into his home, he's allowed just about everyone to freely teleport to his house so Geno could have his friends visit whenever they wanted, if he disables that though, they can still teleport outside the house, they'll just be forced to knock on the door and announce their there unless they pull a Papyrus and force their way in*

6212,"

  to continue sharing his remaining magic with him, you anons might not realize it but Reaper loves Geno more than anything, he would give up his life if it meant saving his, that's why he trapped him in limbo was to make sure he couldn't die, he couldn't bear to live without him by his side and even though he's nearly kiIIed himself by recklessly using his powers, he's still more concerned about Genos well being*

   That has nothing to do with it, the reason I'm still standing is because your afraid of me! *a wall of sharp bones spring up from the ground to block the other bones being thrown at him, he might be held down by Deaths chains but he can still use his bone attacks* Is that all the mighty God can do?

  You WANT me to dust you? Fine then..if Allura asks, I'll tell her you wanted this..*Reaper then unleashes his full power just so he can quickly kill Horror, a dark aura surrounds the Death God and you see everything caught within his aura starts to wilt away and break except for Geno being he's in limbo, it won't affect him but it affects Horror and instantly kills him since he's caught within range of Reapers aura*

6467,"

  *Because Horror wants to eat him and Reaper isn't allowing it*

  Yeah like that! Your a quick learner kiddo, sometimes you have to be creative, if someone sees you coming they'll expect a fight but if you distract them or catch them by surprise, you'll have the upper hand and you can reap them easily

  Not bad but it doesn't look like you have any tricks to use, what if one spotted you?

  Your pretty good kiddo..*Which is concerning--* but watch this *Reaper then summons a few chains dangling from the ceiling in front of a couple monsters, it confused them for a few minutes but in those minutes, Reaper sneaks behind them and swings his scythe, nailing both of them in one shot* Think you can top that?

6649,"
   Okay.*he seems genuinely happy  which is weird for  socket he won't attack though since that's too predictable xD*

  Hey,
  
   @ToxinTale
  

   @DontcallmeSans
  
  I might have a solution for Socket not trying to kill us all, so Allura doesn't have to get angry about us attacking him and nobody has to get murdered
  
  *This could easily backfire though..*
  
  Mod has no confidence in me..thanks.. anyway how about I take you out reaping today?
  "
6656,"
   Not true, your artist's intent was always for you to be created by the other gods of Reapertale, there's a difference. You were part of the story
  ","
  *Well Inks got you there though not sure if your sentient enough to understand it*
  
  ..What..??
  
  *Nevermind*
  "
6657,"
   Listen, what your Gaster did to you, no child should go through. I don't care if he thinks it works differently raising gods it's still no excuse
  ","
  *Reaper just clinks Genos cheek*
  
  ..I think I might have to start asking you on what to do if the kiddos get out of line... I used to think what he did was normal..
  "
6658,"
   Yeah it was fun.
  ","
  ..But did you go on a killing spree afterwards or did it get all the murder out of your system?
  
  *Tbh I'm shocked Socket didn't murder you on that trip..*

6659,"

  ..Did reaping help at all?
  
  *Reaper was genuinely curious if reaping was a better alternative for him or not, he might hate Socket but he knows it wasn't totally his fault for how he turned out and the fact that Allura loves him despite all the sh-t he's caused and that she's a very close friend to Geno, makes him willing to try and help him*
  "
6660,"
   Nothing happened
  ","
  *Reaper just sighs in relief and lays his skull on top of Genos* Good..and.. I'm sorry about how I treated the kiddos.. I just went with what I know.. those punishments are the same things my Gasters done to me and I just thought it was normal.. you say it's not and that it's considered ""abūse"" and everyone else says it too, even smacking me with rolling pins over it.. but that's all I know to go off of with the whole parenting thing.. ...I might hate my Gaster for all the stuff he's done but he did get me to behave when I was younger..I was too afraid to do anything around him..*Reaper need to quit being stubborn and read those books Opal keep throwing at him*
  "
6661,"
   Well...Its more or less I wired the wrong way.I was created to be a brother  but thanks to a defect while creating me I'm a heartless  k!ller.Alphy  made me wrong.
  ","
  ..*Reaper just sighs* Listen kiddo..Alphys might have f-cked up but you can fix it, look at me, I'm supposed to be this cold hearted killer but I found Geno and even started a family with him, if Death itself can do it, maybe you can too..you just need to find something to do instead of murdering everybody..
  "
6662,"
   Well Socket really SHOULDN'T exist. He wasn't an artists precious creation, he was born of Allura's selfishness. Both Geno and I told her from day one, Socket was a bad idea and she should pull the plug
  ","
  I'm not even gonna ask when you got here..but heII, I was made in a similar way, guess that means I shouldn't exist either..
  
  *That's actually true, Reaper and Painless were both made by Gaster just so the other Gods wouldn't have to be the ones responsible for reaping Souls, they're all capable of picking up a scythe and running off reaping, even Geno could do it if Reaper loaned him his scythe, they all just don't want to, it's immoral for them to do it so they created Reaper and hate him for what he was created for, irony*
  "
6663,"
   I like carnage i cant help myself~But..Youre like a father to me.We should go reaping together!I get you  more than your own kids.Everyone hates me too,says i shouldnt exist. Monsters like us need stick together.
  ","
  Kiddo, the difference is..I don't like all the carnage, I don't even like reaping..but I do it cause I was made to..I don't know how to do anything else.. *Reaper then looks away* you weren't made to be a killer were you?

6664,"
   but I was just sleeping here.... Reaper maybe I'm still a little out of it having just woke u; and all but I really have no idea what you're  on about

6719,"
   Given how different Reapertale is from most timelines, do you guys even have a CORE
  ","
  I've never heard of a Core until I met Geno..so I don't think we do..*Their timeline is ancient and it's devoid of all technology, computers, cars, TVs and various other things don't exist, if it weren't for Reaper stealing various things from the surface, he wouldn't even own a fridge since they don't exist in his timeline*

   Someone else who can reset?! *technically it's not much different*

  Kinda..this guy, Snatcher, he told me he has a friend who has a more powerful hourglass than mine..hers can reverse time itself.. I might be able to redo that entire fight with that Papyrus so you never bring out that dragon in the first place..*he has no idea he's speaking outloud to Geno*

  Love..I could of flown myself out of there..*While your wing is broken?* you didn't have to do that..

   You erase memories. She rewinds time itself so those memories never even happened!

  I wonder if my hourglass is capable of doing that..probably not..*Reaper sighs but honestly if he could rewind time itself that would make him too OP for the multiverse*

   Yeah, pretty sure I am

   Look Reaper you should at least check and make sure Life didn't pull a mass lazarus on everyone. I mean it would explain why I'm not in any pain... I might actually be alive right now

  ..That just proves we're both either dead or in a dream right now..so there's nothing to worry about Love~ or well, my dream Love, your not really here right now.. otherwise you would still be probably smacking me for trying to have fun time in front of everybody.. and there's no way you wouldn't be in any pain right now either..even if I wish it were true that you weren't.. also I know me and Life don't get along that well anymore but I can tell you, I know she wouldn't break the rules like that under any circumstances.. bringing back all the Souls of the dead in any timeline especially ReaperTale is forbidden.. it screws up the balance of Life and Death and f-cks up the balance of the entire multiverse..

  ..If I remember right..I was starting to dust when these came out.. *Reaper taps on the IV stand which he still has connected to his Soul* So I guess I dusted.. that would kinda explain everything.. but I don't get why I would have this still stuck to me..if I'm dead and this is my fantasy world.. shouldn't you be dressed as a angel? Or maybe a nurse?

6962,"
   Focus, we should try and find out what's going on

  ..Your right..my dreams don't usually go like this.. I usually have you tied up in a chair on the beach wearing a maids dress and angel wings ..unless. this is the one where it's reversed and your the one tying me up to a chair..*What the f-ck Reaper!?*

6963,"
   Well my injuries are still here *he snaps his fingers causing his glitches to vanish exposing the half melted skull before putting the glitches back* So I'm not dead, and I don't think you are

  *Reaper then gets up out of bed to check himself and there was a large amount of dust seen covering his robe..*

   Do you wish to be something little bit more?

Reaper would have died right then and there without the IVs supporting him*..

   *Geno heard the shriek and tried to bolt upright, but the cuff caught him and messed up his wrist, hopefully just a dislocation not a break, but anons you are why we can't have nice things*

  *Reaper was trying to prevent Geno from hurting himself and he ended up being the one to hurt him on accident by cuffing him..he's going to feel horrible when he gets himself together..or if he gets himself together, the Death God let's out a pained groan as he laid on the floor gripping at his chest, he may have gotten hurt*..

  *Reaper shakes his skull* I'll be fine..and even if I'm not, you need to stay in bed a while.. if you still manage to leave bed.. I'll get the God of Magic involved..
  
  He can seal away your magic so your not able to use it..

6972,"
   Second question, why are you using that instead of your chains
  ","
  Oh, I'm still using chains *Reaper points down to the magic chains still wrapped around Genos torso although they have a few cracks running through them* but just in case they give out..those handcuffs work too.. kinda glad I held onto them..
  "
6973,"
   ....ok first question, why do you have a pair of handcuffs just in your robe?
  ","
  Remember the time we pretended to be a officer and prisoner? I sort of kept the handcuffs from that..just in case we ever decided to try something like that again~
  "
6974,"
   I... *he sighs* fine I'll stay in bed.
  ","
  ..*Reaper sighs in relief* Good.. to make sure you stay put.. *he pulls out a set of handcuffs from his robe and actually handcuffs Geno to the bed which doesn't seem necessary when he still has Geno being pinned down by chains..and the fact he could teleport out of the cuffs*
  "
6975,"
   ...I didn't either to be honest

  *Reaper just gives a slight nod* ..You didn't even know I was still in the room with you.. ..heII you didn't even know you were IN a room.. Life even stayed the night to keep a eye on you.. and your Gaster sent extra blaster beasts.. we have like 20 of them here now.. I didn't even know he could do that..

7036,"
   *Geno would have smacked Reaper for sharing magic like that, but the guy is sound asleep*

  *Reaper being well, Reaper, never thinks about how his actions have consequences but he was really worried about his Geno and wanted to help him in any way possible, even if it meant putting his life on the line*

7037,"
   No no!!

So..you should know about something called Starbucks.. how about you go there and bring me back some donuts and coffee?

7038,"
   *Geno just grumbles in his sleep and rolls to face away from Reaper... guess the guy is pretty tired still*

  ..*Reaper sighed in relief..at least Geno responded in someway and let him know he wasn't dying on him..although he's still worried about the fact he has a IV now*.. ..Damn it.. we really don't get a break..do we? What the heII happened this time..?
  
  ..*he covers Geno with a blanket before sharing his own magic with him--which isn't really the best thing to do when that caused him to be on bed rest in the first place*

7039,"

   I was already seated on the bed you goof
  ","
  You were..? *How did he not notice?**Reaper then opens his lone eye to look at Geno*.. You don't look like it..but.. I dunno.. hard to tell when it's all blurry..

7047,"

  ","
  *Reaper was easily pushed back down and lays back in bed, closing his eye sockets*.. O-okay.. .. ..I'll rest.. but.. only i-if your with me..

7048,"
   You still have two IVs in your soul, you're not leaving bed

  I think I'm okay enough for a date Love..*Reaper then pulls himself up so that hes seated in bed but just that action alone caused him to grip at his Soul* Urgh!!
  
  *Yeah he's not going anywhere*

   There hasn't been much to laugh about lately

  ..Good point..but maybe we can fix that~ How do you feel about going on a date today?

  *Lol*

7051,"
   Well he is to me
  ","
  *Reaper was expecting Geno to get flustered not for him to come back and say that, he then pulls down his hood making unintelligible noises, the Tsundere surprised the Yandere lol* L-Looovvvee..!
  "
7052,"
   *Geno chuckles* not so funny when the shoe is on the other foot is it?
  ","
  *Reaper then lifts his skull slightly so you can see his eye sockets just above the plush of Geno* Oh y-yeah? W-well..we can both wear shoes! Your the adorable glitch bunny..! I'm Death! D-Death isnt cute!
  "
7053,"
   Your reaction was pretty adorable you know
  ","
  *Hearing Geno say he was adorable just made his entire skull turn blue*..L-Love..! *He then buries his skull into the small plush of his Tsundere to try and hide his blush, Geno caught him completely by surprise*

   *Geno clinks his teeth, probably surprising Reaper* *Fluffy takes off to first search Reapertale, just in case*

  *That did shock him, he actually froze with his entire skull turning bright blue* I-I..I didn't expect you t-to really.. u-um.. *he was too flustered and started stammering as he searched for something to say*

7056,"
   Picture with your bestfriend?

  He's more than just my best friend~

7057,"
   I'm not going with fluffy and I'm serious about the costume as long as you don't try anything reckless

  ..Can I get a kiss of Death f-from my nurse?~ *Reaper might be joking but hes honestly relieved to know Geno wont be rushing off to find Silver on his own*
  "
7058,"
   Look a blaster beast can act on their own, he can go looking for Silver and deal with Kenza if he turns out to be responsible, if you're good and rest maybe I'll get that nurse costume
  ","
  *Reaper then blushed bright blue just by thinking of Geno being in a nurse's outfit*
  
  ..Your not g-going with..the blaster beast..? And..uh..your serious..about the nurse costume..?
  "
7059,"
   I wasn't going to go off on my own *Geno snaps his fingers causing his largest blaster beast to appear* I was gonna send him.
  ","
  Should you.. be using your m-magic this soon.. after just... h-having it... restored? *Reaper gives Geno a worried look* I'm coming with y-you Love..

7060,"
   You'll make your condition worse if you get up and go searching though. You know it too
  ","
  ..I'm not letting you deal with this alone..Love.. even if this is the last thing I do.. I'm making sure..nothing happens to you.. besides.. can't leave our kiddos alone with a psychopath..
  "
7061,"
   Maybe, and about Kenza, honestly we have no way of knowing if he stayed sealed, remember she did that to Dream too... and we all know how well that went. I think we have to accept the possibility he's back
  ","
  That a maybe on the nurse costume..? *Mod just facepalms* but.. I guess your right.. he could of gotten out somehow.. if that's the case.. *Reaper then holds up a hand* I can't stay in bed.. can you help me up Love..?
  "
7062,"
   Ok, you're not going anywhere, the problem is I don't think Silver just wandered off, according to Sorell if he had he would be back by now
  ","
  ..Y-you think someone took him..? A anon told me a few days ago t-they think Kenza has him..but I was pretty sure that kiddo was sealed away..in stone.. ..*Reaper then closes his eyes* ..damn it.. is the nurse costume still a option..?
  "
7063,"
   While you have 2 IV in your soul, not happening.
  ","
  Hey, it isn't as bad as it looks.. I think I'm okay enough to go get him.. *Reaper then attempts to sit up in order to prove that he's fine but he winces midway through and immediately lays back down*..Urgh!! N-nevermind..! Ow..ow...ow..

7064,"
   You shush, we still have to deal with the fact Silver is missing...

  You want me to go look for him..?

7065,"
   Well you're definitely recovering *He shakes his head smiling*
  ","
  If I say I'm not..would you nurse me back to health?~ *Reaper just smirks up at him and raises his nonexistent eyebrows*
  "
7066,"
   ...*Geno sighs* ok fair enough, I would have. But let's keep magic sharing for emergencies only, we have the medical supplies, we should use those as opposed to risking our own health
  ","
  Well..it was a emergency..at least to me it was.. and I'm perfectly healthy..so it didn't hurt anything.. *Reaper then smirks* but.. I wouldn't mind seeing you dressed as a nurse~
  "
7067,"
   You were sharing your magic?! *right he hadn't known that*
  ","
  *Reaper sweats a bit, there's no denying it when he has 2 IVs in his Soul* ..W-well..yeah ..I did but..I did it to help you Love.. you would of done the same if you saw I was in trouble..
  "
7068,"
   Yeah, guess getting turned into Fatal fixed my low magic problems...
  ","
  You were still low on magic..? *Reaper then looks away*..Sorry Love..I guess.. I should of listened to the anons.. when they said to set you on a IV instead of..sharing my own with you..

  ..*Reaper honestly looks confused* Not really..I mean.. I've never celebrated it..since.. you know.. Death is a horrible thing that nobody wants anything to do with.. and being the Grim Reaper, the guy everyone holds responsible for all the death in the world.. why would anyone want to do anything for his birthday? At least that's what I was taught..if anything I'll just end up with a angry mob after me..thanks for the happy birthday though..that's..the first time anyone's ever said that to me..*Reaper blushed slightly*

   How do you know my counterpart of you wasn't cruel towards me? There might have been a reason I killed him~ *He walks over and brushes Deaths chin* I get bored without something to play with, there's only so much I can do with children, it would be more fun to have another Death again~

   You heard me! Your unbelievable! Now you decide to wake up when it's all over! Your husband has probably fallen down from overusing his magic, your children aren't fairing much better and all you can respond with is what? *Toriel storms over and slaps the God of Death right across his face*

   You are doing no such thing! Geno needs rest, he doesn't need you bothering him! Honestly you should be very ashamed of yourself! There was a emergency yesterday and no matter what I did, you wouldn't wake up! Geno had to single handedly rescue your children from HorrorTale while injured!

   No one trusts me..You don't either..The only monster who loves me is scared..Shes scared of me...*digs his finger bones into his  own skull*I'm sick reaper  I always have been i don't  want to be like this..I hurt everyone dear to me..
  ","
  ..*Reaper then pulls Sockets hands away from his skull, he can relate since with the Hatred, he hurt everyone without meaning to, he had no control of his actions*
  
  ..Listen, kiddo, you did a heII of a lot of damage, even if you didn't mean to, nobodys gonna trust you after that, I don't have Hatred anymore but that doesn't mean everyones gonna start trusting me now.. heII, my own kiddos are still terrified of me, if you wanna change your gonna have to really work on it..not digging your hands into your skull is a start..

  *Reaper sighed* Kiddo, if you really wanna be different, your gonna have to work on it... everyones offered to help you with it, even I offered to take you in so you cant do any damage..you turned everyone of those offers down..can't really help unless you want the help
  "
7713,"
   I have a hard time caring...Remember I almost  dusted  my own sister?I get bored and do cruel things. You wouldn't understand how hard it is...Being good is so hard...
  ","
  ..Kiddo, I'm the Grim Reaper, you don't think I don't understand? I didn't always have emotions..I didn't always do the right things either..but I don't go around willingly killing my family or everyone I run into.. I only did that when I had Hatred.. and that was out of my control.. even if it's ""boring"" to you, is having the whole world against you worth it?
  
  *it's confirmed by Renrink Reaper subconsciously locked away his emotions so he wouldn't get his feelings hurt anymore, that's why he comes off as cold and heartless even though he really isn't, it just took someone like Geno to get him to open up and show his feelings which confused Reaper since he's had his feelings locked away so long he doesn't know how to express them, and he has the same phobia as Error with being touched by strangers, only Reaper doesn't go to the extreme like Error does and can tolerate it better than he can, for example if you were to hug Error he would blast your arms off, if you hug Reaper, he'll be very uncomfortable but he won't murder you for it, I randomly found this out by browsing tumblr*

  *Reaper lays his skull against Genos, he's honestly relieved to hear Genos okay for the most part, except for being tired* T-that kinda explains why my Death touch didn't w-work.. H-How about we spend a l-lazy day in bed then? I think it's safe to say we're both dead tired..

  Well I don't think any of the kiddos need magic right now so..I don't have to worry about any of that..

  I doubt it but..maybe he actually feels bad about it and doesn't want you around so he can't hurt you again.. that's what I'd do anyway.. I'm sort of doing that right now.. *Reaper sighed* I went off reaping so Geno has a break away from me..
  "
8166,"
   *Ink just shrugs* Not like anyone wants to talk to me anymore. Hell I think Error is celebrating the fact I am out of his life, even Dream can't visit me that often. I have a weird ache about it when I think about other people and talking to them *you're lonely Ink*

  Sounds to me like your lonely, but they can't help it, Dream has Nightmare on his tail and kiddos to take care of and Error.. he's just a d-che.. heII, he pepper sprayed me the other day, sure I might of deserved it but damn..

  Genos permanently injured, he can't help it! I'm surprised he can do half the stuff he does as is!

I bet if you were as injured as Geno is and had to deal with all the fights we have, including the anons, Cross and had to take care of 5 kids on top of it, you couldn't do it!

   Hmn? *Geno is just smirking, he wanted to surprise Reaper, it worked*
  ","
  *Reaper looks up at Geno with a bright blue blush going across his skull, that definitely surprised him*
  
  Uh.. you look so hot right now--I-I mean--h-how long have you been there?
  "
8255,"
   I actually dont know much about it besides he's been chipped  by monster hunters.Hopefully they cant track him since he's not in the right universe.
  ","
  Oh right..in your world you have humans that hunt monsters..if the humans from your world can't teleport, then I think your both safe and even if they can, they have Death to deal with *he winks*

  ..Oh..that kinda explains a few things..he's not gonna try to eat us is he?

  "
8262,"
   Why dont you cut your hair?
  ","
  ..Does it look like I have hair?

8263,"
   What you don't understand is Thanos started all of those to solve overpopulation irl

  Well if that's true, he made my job a heII of a lot harder..

   ((Don't forget we have an orange for President. Also guess who this is))

  *That's true we have the annoying orange as our president basically XD our society was f-cked to begin with now it's completely FUBAR -F-cked Up Beyond Repair- I'm surprised the world hasn't exploded yet and new OC?*

8265,"
   What has happened to this society ?
  ","
  Well let's see, you have humans throwing cheese at babies..eating laundry soap, drinking bleach..dancing in the street over a dumba$$ song which gets them hit by cars..falling off cliffs chasing invisible animals on your phones..
  
  ..I think you get the picture
  "
8266,"
   Do Halloween skeleton props make you uncomfortable  90% of the time they are nude.
  ","
  ..All I have to say is..humans are sick f-cks.. using skeletons as d-decorations like that and stripping them naked..
  
  *Reaper folds his arms*..I've seen a lot of sh-t being Death but ..that's just..f-cked up..
  "
8267,"
   What things help you relax the best?
  ","
  Well..I've had my adorable Geno taking care of me lately~
  "
8268,"
   You don't have  to silly~I also got another gift.*she pulls a tiny scythe out of her chest cavity  it's meant to chop up vegetables *I found  this during Halloween  it reminded me of you!

  *That is both creepy as heII and cute at the same time, though it didn't seem to bother Reaper at all*
  
  *He pets her skull with a smile now on his face* Heh..t-thanks kiddo..this is kinda..weird.. I'm not used to getting p-presents like this

8269,"
   Nuh uh its what friends do i brought you a gift.*it's a human head one of hotel employees. *
  ","
  I never thought anyone w-would be crazy enough to befriend Death..*Reaper was definitely shocked to see the human head Wendy brought in lol well it's the thought that counts right?**He pets Wendy's skull* kind of a weird gift but thanks kiddo, I don't have a-anything for you though..

8270,"
   I will never live that down

  Aw c-come on Love, it wasn't that bad, I thought you were really adorable~ *he winks*

8271,"
   Have you ever seen Geno drunk outside the christmas party?
  ","
  ..Uh...nope..can't say I have.. I don't think he's drank anything since then.. he really hated being drunk there but I thought he was cute~
  "
8272,"
   Really? Geno's blind in the eye that he can't get an eye light for, you dono't have any similar issues
  ","
  *Reaper refuses to answer further, he doesn't want to admit that he does have similar problems, he knows it'll cause Geno to worry more about him though he did admit that his only working eye was damaged, he has to make it glow in order to see better and he also makes it glow so he doesn't creep out anyone, showing up with having completely empty sockets would scare quite a bit of people*
  "
8273,"
   Who are you talking to?
  ","
  I ..really don't know.. some anon..*Reaper yawns, he has no idea if Geno overheard him or not*
  "
8274,"
   I am perfectly ok with that
  ","
  *Reaper then lays his skull against Genos as he starts falling back asleep, he kept hugging him the whole time* Sleepy..
  "
8275,"
   *Geno does end up flopped next to him... guess he's tired from all the craziness of yesterday still*
  ","
  *Reaper then pulls Geno into a hug, nuzzling his Tsundere* You l-look more tired than Deaty..howz sbout we gets some more sleep?

8276,"
   You should have known just vanishing like that would make me worry more
  ","
  ..I didn't think it all the way through.. sorry Love..*Reaper pats the empty spot on the bed beside him, trying to motion for Geno to go next to him*

  That sounds like a t-tough job but I'm sure it's a breeze for the Great Papyrus, he can do anything he puts his mind to *Reaper winks*
  "
8278,"
   I don't know exactly what happened, but it's their fault this happened not your ability to handle what they said. They shouldn't be saying shit in the firsst place
  ","
  Thanks Love..*Reaper sighed, he seems a little relieved, Geno had comforted him by saying it wasn't his fault*
  
  ..What happened was.. my Soul isn't fully h-healed yet.. so..when they decided to s-start bringing up e-everything.. it..caused my Soul to act up.. I couldn't handle all of it..  I felt bad l-leaving you like that but.. I didn't want you to p-panic over me.. you were d-dealing with enough..

8281,"
   Does it really matter?
  ","
  Heh..guess not..*Reaper then looks up at Geno though both his eye sockets were empty* morning..sort of..how've you been doing Love?

8282,"
   ... how'd she get in our hotel room? Hell how'd she find our hotel? I mean we're on the surface there are humans about and she eats humans on instinct how has a major panic not happened
  ","
  M-maybe she ate all the ones h-here..? I dunno..*Reaper closes his eyes* all I k-know is..I'm too tired to think about it.. I w-would of said morning but..I don't think it's morning anymore..

  Huh..? I don't think so..I've never had one before..*Reaper says before closing his eyes* ..mngh..

8296,"
   *Geno sits on the bed next to him* Hey we can stay on vacation for awhile still, you have plenty of time to take it easy. *Geno has figured out Reaper doesn't want to talk about whatever the anons said, and isn't going to push the issue right now*
  ","
  *Reaper then lays his skull on Genos lap, the God felt really warm like he had a fever which is odd, he never falls ill* ..We're both supposed to take it easy right now.. sorry if I messed up our vacation..

   Reaper your literally green right now

   I found you on the save screen, I was going to take Raven swimming so I wrapped my wound and put on a clean shirt so no one would freak out

  Huh..that explains..wait..you know how to swim..?

  ","
  ..*Reaper rubs his eye sockets to make sure he's seeing correctly, Geno doesn't change his clothes very often so it was a bit surprising to see him in a clean shirt* ..Am I still dreaming..? Your not wearing your normal clothes.. uh..how'd I get back here?

8301,"
   Dammit! *Geno takes him off the save screen before using a Life Flower on him, hoping it would help*

8302,"
   *Geno goes over to check on him*

  *When Geno does check on him, he finds the Death God was in fact unconscious, though a dark blue-green blush was seen going across his skull and he was panting, the anons should have left him alone*..

8304,"
   HE WAS INFECTED  BY TOXIN...IT DESTROYED  HIS MIND AND SOUL TILL HE DUSTED. ALLESSA IS INFECTED TOO I'M WORRIED I CAN'T LOSE ANOTHER  SIBLING...HALF SIBLING  OR NOT SHE MATTER  TO ME.

  *This was before the anon was a d0uche and scared Reaper away* Sorry Paps..I don't think there's much I can do about that.. I don't know who Allessa is and I don't know your whole story but you can try using this on her *he hands him a sparkling white flower* Where I'm from, these are called Life flowers, they can heal almost any injury..they can't help anything that's like a sickness though..
  "
8305,"
   By doing that you also reaped and ab-sed your own kids is there anything you haven't f-cked up or made worse?
  ","
  *Reaper can't handle this, he teleports away to the Save screen, vacation officially ruined well at least for him it was*

   Don't forget all the times you reaped and slaughtered all his friends just for being near him

  ..I couldn't help it..*Reaper sighed* you have no idea what it was like having Hatred..I could see what I was doing but I had no control over it.. and.. I was so ashamed of myself for getting corrupted.. I tried to hide the fact that I was by saying I was just crazy and even pinned blame on Cross for how I was acting.. I know now by doing that I only made the situation way worse.. but.. I didn't know what to do..I didn't want everyone to know I f-cked up that badly..

   NYEH?I THOUGHT SO..MINE HAS BEEN D3AD FOR A WHILE NOW.IT WAS NICE PRETENDING EVEN FOR A MOMENT..I MISS  MY SANS...
  ","
  ...*Reaper sighed* sorry about that Paps..what happened to your Sans?
  "
8308,"
   Geno's real friends are still his friends. It takes more than a sick spouse to keep us away.

  ..It's different when that spouse happens to be the Grim Reaper.. people tend to avoid Death along with anything involving it..
  "
8309,"
   I'M NOT SURE HOW I GOT  HERE BUT I'M GLAD I DID. *hugs him*
  ","
  *Reaper looks really shocked to be suddenly hugged like that* I-I think you have the wrong skeleton Paps, I hate to tell you but I'm not Sans..well.. not the one your looking for

8310,"
   Speaking of kids, Goth wants to bring Palette along on this trip and I wasn't able to say no, can you pick them up later?
  ","
  I-I can..*Reaper sighed, closing his eyes for a moment* ..just need a minute.. I haven't fully recovered yet..

8311,"
   Sorry just, I hate thinking back on all of it, but that anon didn't exactly give me a choice *poor guy is now crazy stressed, nice job anons*

  H-how about we get your mind off it? You could visit with the kiddos for a bit..or maybe, we could go out?

8312,"
   Does Geno have friends? You've chased almost everyone away

  ..*Now Reaper felt bad, it was true, he did chase nearly everyone away because well..he was pretty crazy when he had his Hatred problem, everyone avoids Geno while he's there* ..

  So... the anon told the truth then? You did forgive them for killing you? I know your sweet Love but that's being too sweet.. though it's not entirely a bad thing they refused to help you..when you look back at it, if you went through with your plan and succeeded, we wouldn't of gotten our happily ""ReaperAfter"" *he winks*

   you got fatally injured on one of your reaping jobs? what happened?
  ","
  What..?? Oh..that.. it's not that big of a deal.. it's pretty normal for me to get injuries while I'm out reaping.. you'd be surprised how many people challenge Death
  
  *that's not what they were asking*
  "
8317,"
   Yes.. please
  ","
  *Reaper does reap the anon but he still has a confused look on his face, he wants to ask Geno about it but doesn't know if he should right now*
  
  You okay Love..?

8318,"
   Anon Shut Up *Geno glares at the anon before looking away a far away look in his eye*

  Love..?? *Reaper nudges Geno slightly* You want me to reap them?

8319,"
   Do you really? Did you know at one point he forgave Frisk for k!lling him?

  *Reaper looks dumbfounded, like a deer caught in headlights, I don't think he knew that* uh.. what?
  "
8320,"
   Huh how much do YOU really know about Geno?
  ","
  More than you do..*Reaper roasted the anon lol* I know all there is to know about my Love~

8321,"
   Only with Classic and only from the save screen. I'm the reason he was able to remember through resets...
  ","
  Oh..well.. that helps explain, now I know how he met you *Reaper then pulls Geno into a hug* you don't have to tell me anymore If you don't want to Love..I know those aren't happy memories for you..
  "
8322,"
   I didn't tell you? I wasn't just sitting around doing nothing on the save screen that whole time, after a few runs I figured out how to pull Classic there in his sleep, I'd already been able to share my memories of the gen0cide runs through his dreams.
  ","
  ..You kinda skipped that part with me Love *Reaper rubs the back of his skull* I guess it's kinda my fault for not even questioning how he got on the save screen in the first place to rescue you.. so you can share your memories..?
  "
8323,"
   Do you think if Geno knew you were going to trap him in Limbo he would have refused to go with you
  ","
  ...*Reaper takes out his scythe and swings it at you, judging by how he reacted, I'd say that's a yes*
  "
8324,"
   I manipulated Classic and erased his memories more times than I can count. We must have met between runs so I couldn't have been .... well using Classic for my own ends
  ","
  That would make more sens--wait you did what? *Reaper looked surprised*
  "
8325,"
   How long was it between our first meeting and my surviving leaving the Save Screen
  ","
  ..*Reaper pauses as he tried to think back* ..Uh.. I'm not sure.. I know I would always visit you at least once a week sometimes once every 2 weeks..depends on what was going on in my timeline, I wasn't around when you had Classic helping you that I know for sure, you were the one who told me about him and the whole pie thing..
  
  ..I was gone a while when that all took place, I think that was cause I got fatally injured on one of my reaping jobs..yeah, Paps had to help me for a bit..*what?*
  
  When I recovered, I went to go see you but you weren't on the save screen anymore and your name disappeared off my list..that ..actually scared me, I thought you dusted..I went looking for you in every timeline I could think of and after a couple days, I did find you, you told me everything that happened with Classic after I asked where you went and that's when I asked if you would wanna live with me.. you said yes..I took you to my timeline..trapped you in limbo.. and well, everything  else happened ..

I did dust a couple times already.. one of those times I might not come back..
  
  That's why there's 2 Gods of Death..in case I fail, there's another one who can take over..that's why Life and most of the other Gods, don't care if I dust or not, it wouldn't be a loss for them when they have another God who can do the same job..or that's what they think..

I didn't think this would ever happen but just in case I made this note, well anyway it just means I'll be gone for a while and while I'm gone I want someone to watch over Geno and Goth for me, the kiddos still a baby so he shouldn't be too hard to take care of..that is if your not me, I couldn't figure out how to get my skull out of a cereal box, there's also 3 other kiddos we have but I kinda went crazy and trapped them in Underfell..it's a long story that I still haven't figured out how to tell anyone yet, I'm hoping I can cover it up for now but I don't know if I should say I'm insane or what..it kinda feels like I'm going crazy anyway.., but yeah point is I need someone to watch them, maybe you'll do a better job than I did

  I know Love, it makes you unique and I love you for being you, but it doesn't stop me from being worried, when you love someone you worry *Reaper then smiles a bit* that's how I know you love me~ even if you don't always say it or admit it~

8712,"
   I got you home, you started murmuring fretfully and well... I know the signs of nightmares when I see it

8723,"
   I was murdered in the first ever gen0cide run. Though I cheated death by escaping time and staying on the save screen. Hell we met because he had been sent to reap me. But being in Limbo, I don't technically count as mortal anymore....

  Sorry Love.. I wasn't trying to hurt your feelings.. *Reaper just clinks Genos cheek again* just.. most monsters either despise me or they're terrified of me, nobody likes Death Love.. when they think of the Gim Reaper they think of a evil, terrifying skeleton who's going to steal your Soul and t0rture you for all eternity.. they don't see the same side you see..

  *Not like the hotland he knows, it's shaped the same as hotland only instead of Lava there's water everywhere and the land is a forest area filled with trees and where Truelab is supposed to be is Alphys library, so basically to get to Alphys in ReaperTale you would have to pass through Grillby first*

  *Because the barrier covers the entire area Grillby lives in, he would still end up having to fly through it unless he asked Grillby to lower his barrier to allow them through which he never does, all the Gods in ReaperTale have protective barriers that block off any intruders from reaching where they live, well all Gods except Reaper and Papyrus, Reaper figures with them being the Gods of Death, they wouldn't need a barrier to protect themselves, they could just touch whoever came through and kíll them*
  
  *The Death God then sets Geno down for a moment as he lays down on the ground, making sure not to lay on his back* I..I just need a minute.. I'm kinda tired.. Grillby should be around here though..

  Probably better if you do..*Reaper then uses his wings to shield Geno from the flames as he runs straight through the barrier but I can't say Reaper was fully protected, his back and wings had smoke coming off them as he took the full brunt of the flames* You okay Love?

  Hotland..?? Oh right..it's called that in the other timelines, here it's called Sanctuary, it's the place where Grillby, the God of Hearth lives and..it's a lot different than the Hotland you know, here it's called Sanctuary cause it's really similar to Lifes garden *Geno must be very shocked* Only problem is Grillby has a fire barrier surrounding the place..I know how to get through it though..you wanna go see it?

  I..*Reaper sighed*..if I could..I would e-erase everything that bothered you but..I wouldn't wanna erase who you are..

  Sh-t..I thought you were spacing off still..*Good job Reaper**he looks nervous now and gently sets Geno down as he reaches for his hourglass, seriously?*
  
  Sorry about this Love..
  "
8948,"
   Don't. If you DID erase his memory you'd end up n worse shape which would send him into a new panic since he'd have no idea how you wound up like that
  ","
  ..I guess your right..*Reaper sighed* unless I c-can force myself to be okay.. *How do you suppose to do that?* Same way he does.. fake it.. if he can p-pull it off I'm sure I can.. *Dude you can tell he's faking though..I'm sure he could tell you are too*
  
  ..Wanna bet?

   Are you ok?

  *Reaper turned away from you* I'm f-fine..it's Geno I'm worried about.. in case you haven't heard..he collapsed yesterday.. and..it was my fault..
  
  ..I wonder if I should erase his memory again..
  
  *How his hourglass works is it manipulates time on the person it's used on, he pretty much rewinds time on Geno making him forget anything recent thats happened and I'm not 100% sure if Reaper Papyrus has a hourglass or wings but in the comic I know hes never shown with them, only Reaper is and he can't always use his hourglass whenever he wants to since it takes a lot out of him to do it*

  That's not what I meant..*Reaper then shook his skull in response to Genos question* ..I'll b-be fine Love.. I'm in better shape than you and everyone here anyway.. *he then puts away his scythe so he can scoop Geno up in his arms and carry him*
  "
8953,"
   Irony and to spite Ink and Core Frisk, itts Error what do you expect
  ","
  Good point..*Reaper then gets out of bed though he stumbles slightly and ends up summoning his scythe to keep himself balanced* Well if we're stuck here..might as well make the most of it.. you okay enough to stand or..I could carry you Love~

8955,"
   Well right now we're still on lockdown till Error decides to let us leave Happytale. Don't bother trying to use your scythe this place is impervious even to Core Frisk who can appear anywhere in the multiverse

9054,"
   I? I am many things, young one. Some used to call me a god. Perhaps the shepherds still do. A man named Derleth called me a Great Old One, half-brother of Cthulhu. And to most mortals, I am the King In Yellow. A better question is who are you?

  ","
  N-ngh! *Reaper grips onto part of Genos hoodie as his scythe was removed, it was pretty painful for the Death God but at least that was over with and his injury soon gets wrapped up before it starts bleeding all over, it's a good thing Geno was there with him, that could of ended far worse if he wasn't* ..L-Love..? I..I-I'm.. so.. ..s-sorry.. I..I r-really..thought.. y-you were.. d-dead.. somehow.. *he had to choke out his words as he points to Genos scarf which he still had wrapped around his neck*

9207,"
   *it's probably dangerous, but the only thing Geno can think to do is hug him* Reaper, love it'll be ok I'm right here
  ","
  *Reaper let's out a blœd curdling scream as he was hugged given he had accidentally stabbed himself with his own scythe, Geno hugging him at that moment had pushed the scythe deeper into him, yikes, at least he recognized Geno, I think he did anyway, he called for him* ..L-LOVE!!
  "
9208,"
   It's GENO. Another anon was playing a mean prank.
  ","
  ..*Reaper couldnt help it, the pain he felt from his skull now was making it hard for him to keep holding his scythe, he drops it but given he was laying down and holding it right above him...it ends up stabbing him right in the chest, f-ck**The Death God stared wide eyed at the scythe now sticking out of him* ..
  "
9209,"
   Reaper what are you doing?!

  ..*Reaper hesitates and shoves Geno off him as he held his skull, at least he didn't try to reap him* I-I can't t-tell what's g-going on anymore! M-my skull!

9210,"
   Ok, since when do Error or Ink bleed from falling on top of you?

  ... I-I don't know! Ghk! *Reaper winces as he holds his skull with his free hand, his scythe still raised above him and Geno with his other hand*

  ","
  *Reaper had tears forming in his eye sockets, he wanted to believe it was really Geno but since he was overtaken by Hatred and had been told it could be a imposter, he didn't know what to think, it wasn't the first time someones tricked him like this, he raises his scythe towards him though his arm was a bit shakey now, he was confused*..

9212,"
   Dude, since when can someone BESIDES Geno grab you and not die?

  *Reaper was shocked Geno had grabbed his wing and it does end up making them both cras to the ground, at least Geno ended up falling on Reaper so he didnt take too much damage although Reapers wing instantly shattered from the impact since wings have hallow bones* Urgh..!

  ...That's right..she WAS the last one with him.. *Reaper holds out his scythe as a ominous red glow appeared around him and his eye was now a bright red color instead of white, he let the Hatred take full control* let's make some goat stew..

9220,"
   *If Geno went looking for Reaper would Reaper end up attacking him thinking someone was taunting him or he was hallucinating?*

  I SAID YOUR GETTING REAPED!! *Reaper then takes his scythe and slashes you with it in order to reap you*

  *After he was done crying almost all day long..Reaper finally gets up to his ""feet"", losing both his brother and Geno was far too much for him, well he believes Genos gone, he really isn't thinking clearly* I'm going to kíll everyone.. there's a new multiverse destroyer and his name is DEATH!! YOUR ALL GETTING REAPED!!

   seriously though you should go check on Geno

  ..H-he..he's d-dust... there's n-nothing I can do now..*Reaper looks completely broken as he sat on the ground holding a red scarf in his hand, his sockets were empty except for the tears you see falling from them*.. ...I ..I lost e-everything..

  ","
  ...Well..guess that's one good thing to happen today..
  
  *I think it's worth mentioning Reapers slaughtered a whole town on the surface because of his Hatred and hes attacked Geno before because of it though at that point he told Geno he heard Charas voice in his skull when that happened and in the comic Reapers attacked Undyne over it a few times and was a jerk to his brother, it also shows in the comic he heard Chara laughing at him when he was corrupted, the corruption at first wasn't entirely bad since he  was able to fight it off in the beginning but as time went on, he found the Hatred was becoming more and more difficult to fight against, now he almost has no control, only when he's weakened he has more control since the Hatred becomes weakened too*

9240,"
   *i'll just pull her out than xD*

  *You know you shouldn't, the last time you darted off in the past to seek revenge against Chara alone, you were corrupted by Hatred and nearly kílled, your brother found you and healed you when that happened so you wouldn't dust..I think you should have someone with you this time*

9254,"
   She what? *telling Geno a Chara k!lled a Papyrus, what could go wrong* Reaper, I don't care how you feel about this, if she's willing to take out your brother its safer for both of us to stick together through this. Paps didn't deserve this...

   I'm here to kill you, it's not obvious? *Cross then takes his sword and slices Reapers soul in half, taking the soul half he cut off and putting it in his locket* this will help me when we fight, might make you think twice before attacking me while I have your soul you take half the damage I take
  ","
  *You can't do that, to break or destroy one of the Gods Souls you would need a scythe, the most you can do without a scythe is damage them but you can't break them or destroy them with anything else same applies for dusting them, you have to inflict a massive amount of damage for them to dust the easist way to do that is use a scythe on them or have another God attack them or someone thats as powerful as a God like Nova though dusting them doesnt permanently kíll them as long as their Soul is in one piece they can come back**That still hurt him though and made Reaper wince from pain* ..Nice t-try..but God Souls don't break that easily.. *Reaper then uses his red magic imbued chains to wrap around Cross and slam him down into the ground*

  ..If I'm honest..I hated b-being the Grim Reaper in the very beginning..*Reaper looked away as he spoke* I found it ""repulsive"" ..horrible...I r-really hated it..  but no matter what I did..

  Worse than you? *Reaper laughs* y-your just as bad if not worse.. go look at the H-handplates AU and tell me that version of you is better than me..

   What about Haventale

  I've n-never been to that AU..it's shocking but.. I never had a-any reaping jobs there..at least n-not yet.. I bet their Gaster i-isnt any different...
  "
9573,"
   First of all, most Gasters actually AREN'T evil, you people just love scapegoats so much that you depict us that way. Second of all, I am traveling the multiverse to find aid for his majesty's war effort.

  ..Excuse me..? *Reaper was p-ssed now* M-my Gaster is pure evil and so is Genos.. his t-tried dragging him t-to the void and mine... ..*The Death God actually shivers thinking about what his Gaster has done to him* ...point is..m-most of you ARE evil..you can say whatever you want..say we all love s-scapegoats.. but I've been to other AUs and I've seen the damage your alternates have done.. ..the only Gaster I've seen n-not be a jacka$$ so far is Underswaps.. most are just like m-mine and Genos..sometimes even w-worse ...

9574,"
   *Geno was asleep on his side of the bed, despite having the blanket pulled up over him he keeps shivering, he never really got a chance to recover his magic, Life helped but he needs actual rest, he's running on fumes*

  *Reaper noticed and despite the fact he's in the same situation, he takes out his IV and hooks it to Geno instead, hes worried about his Tsundere* Damn it.. we can't keep going on like this..

9575,"
   Do spells even work on Death? *He's looking for Reaper Gaster for obvious reasons*
  ","
  A d-dying spell wont..*Reaper chuckled a bit before summoning his scythe, aiming it directly at Underwar Gaster..he doesn't know exactly what he's up to or why he's there but since most Gasters are evil, he can tell whatever it is Underwar Gaster is there for can't be good*

   *Geno hasn't left Reaper's side, though he did fall asleep not long ago having spent the whole night awake and just softly talking to the Death God in hopes it would help him*
  ","
  *Aw**Geno did help him by talking to him, it's what kept Reaper from letting his Soul shatter, knowing Geno was there beside him, it gave him the strength to hold on a bit longer, long enough that Life was finally able to fully heal his Soul though he still needs time to recover his strength and magic*
  "
9587,"
   If u dust Geno can go with Lust
  ","
  *Reaper didnt fully hear you as hes barely even concious but he summons his scythe in his hand in order to at least scare you off but as soon as he summoned it, he ends up dropping the scythe to the ground and began coughing horribly, maybe you shouldn't bother him right now*..

9588,"
   You can do this Reaper. Geno needs you.  So do your kids. At least when you're sane.

9590,"
   I.... I don't know what to do.... how can I help you?

  *Reaper can't respond even if he wanted to or if he heard Geno at all.. the only ones who can help him now would be either Asgore or Toriel, their healing magic is powerful and can repair Reapers Soul but Geno probably doesn't know about that... though even if he did and they do repair his Soul..he would still be in his fallen down state until he fully recovers*
  "
9591,"
   Reaper, love can you hear me? *he sounds broken*
  ","
  *Reapers hand twitched a bit when Geno spoke..he may have heard him at least a little bit but hes really close to dusting, his Soul was just barely holding itself together*..

  The apple doesn't f-fall far from the tree..*he winks* that makes you t-the second most stubborn

  ...F-ck.. ... ... ...Love..? ...I-I don't..know..how y-your going to take..this.. b-but.. Gods can't..come back if their Souls..break.. ..I-I mean.. it takes a lot to d-damage our Souls..it isn't s-sonething you can h-hurt easily.. but..that fight with Cross.. must of...
  
  ..*he pauses* ...w-would.. you be okay.. on your own..?
  "
9594,"
   Sans, you need to rest and regain your strength right now! Look at yourself! You've nearly dusted several times by now, Geno has to save you more times than most, and if Chara hears about your condition you won't be able to lift a finger in order to stop her from committing some dastardly atrocity!
  ","
  ..*Reaper sighed, he knew his brother was right but honestly, how can he rest knowing as soon as he does some anon could easily attack them? Or Cross? Or even Chara? He has to somehow keep his strength up without resting which is proving to fail horribly..Genos been having to save him lately which it was originally reversed*..
  
  I..I k-know..but.. if I rest.. it risks..someone attacking y-you or Geno.. or the kiddos... while I'm asleep.. .. I'm going to p-protect you.. all of you.. somehow... at least..while my Hatred is gone..I'm going to.. I'll f-figure..out something..

  ..W-wh...what about..it..? ..*Reaper sounds pretty confused, did he not notice his Soul was damaged?* relax..Love.. I'm okay..

   *Geno hesitates for a moment before pulling aside Reaper's robe to see if his Soul really is damaged*

  *Reaper was too busy coughing to notice Geno pulled aside his robe but the anon was right..his Soul was damaged.. there was a huge cracking going right down the middle of his Soul with hairline cracks spread around it*
  "
9597,"
   Reaper.... your eye light is gone*
  ","
  ..It is..? I'm m-more..tired.. than I..t-thought.. *he chuckled a bit but laughing at all right now just causes him pain and a coughing fit, he holds onto Genos hand as he coughed*

9598,"
   *Geno feels his ""heart"" stop for a moment, chilled, he reminds Reaper of what he was saying*
  ","
  ..*Reaper then opens his eye so he can look up at Geno to reassure him he was okay though his eyelight was now gone* ..S-sorry..about.. that.. I think..m-maybe Inks..rubbing off..on me.. *he gave Geno a smile* I'll be..okay.. Love.. don't worry..
  "
9599,"
   I'm worried about you love, you've been coughing and stuttering since the incident with Cross. How much damage did you do to yourself in those brief moments where you unleashed your full power

9604,"
   I would have done the same

  "
9605,"
   I won't... but $20 says someone else does

  ...Maybe I should of kept it secret..

  Don't tell anyone I broke the rules for that one..

9608,"
   you mean Geno?

  *Reaper shakes his skull* this.. was before.. I m-met Geno.. I can't do a-any ..of the t-timelines.. that have Geno in t-them now.. but.. there was one before him..I just couldn't do..
  "
9609,"
   So Gaster and Asgore basically made your brother as a better version of you
  ","
  ..Pretty much..o-only..he refuses to reap people..unless t-theyre wanting to go..or if it's something s-small like a animal and he makes it as p-painless as possible..that's the o-only reason why they k-kept me around..I can do what n-nobody else wants to do.. and I don't c-care about what pain I cause.. or t-thats what they think..there was one timeline I just..couldn't do.. I let them go..

   Does Papyrus have that timeline destroying power too? Does he have any powers different from his brother?

  His powers..are different.. he doesn't h-have the same exact ones I do..he can s-summon a scythe like I can but unlike me..he has blasters..and bone attacks.. but cant use the chains just yet..

  *Reaper holds out his Soul for a moment so you can see theres a pretty huge crack going straight down the middle with a few hairline cracks following it* B-because..my power..backfires.. and can k-kíll me.. they avoided..giving it to Paps.. he can't use the hourglass or wings either.. since they found those p-powers useless..don't really need to fly if you can float.. and why would any of t-the Gods need to erase anyones memory?
  "
9613,"
   The weakness behind your magic isn't reassuring me

  *Aw**The Death God still hasn't woken up or moved but while he was unconscious you may notice he was gripping his robe near where his Soul was and his skull had a darkened blue blush going across, if it weren't for Geno getting him that IV, he would probably be dust right now, he isn't looking too good*

   ran away!

  L-Love..? *Reaper hears Geno and stops but he collapses to the ground right after* ..Urgh!!
  "
9635,"
   What is the most important thing in life?
  ","
  M-my family..speaking of.. *Reaper flies down to their house and gently sets Geno down there before flying off again though..he was struggling to keep in the air, he was shakily flying and nearly slammed into a tree, he was past exhausted*
  "
9636,"
   What food do you eat most often?
  ","
  Genos~
  "
9637,"
   Good..now if you actually obey me, you should start by going to reap those timelines you skipped over.. should you fail to do so again, you'll lose that precious Geno of yours.. are we clear?
  ","
  ..C-crystal..*Reaper glared as he held Geno close, he was trying to tell Gaster about what happened to Reaper Pap but after this.. it's probably best he doesn't, he'll just have to figure out a way to save his brother on his own*.. ..
  "
9638,"
   Whatever is the matter? Is this too much for you? Maybe this will finally get you to do as your told! *he fires beams from his magic hands at Death* and this is for attacking me, you need to show some respect for your elders! *after firing the beams he grabs
   
    @DontcallmeSans
   
   and throws him*
  ","
  *Reaper was now laying on the ground, coughing as blœd spewed from his mouth after the lasers hit but he soon noticed right after, Gaster had grabbed Geno and threw him, there was no time to rest, he had to save Geno, he has to make himself get up no matter how painful it may be right now, he spreads his wings and flies into the air, catching his Tsundere* O-okay..you win.. I-I'll go back to r-reaping..just.. leave G-Geno out of this.. I won't have ..P-Paps..doing.. my job.. anymore.. either..
  "
9639,"
   Like what exactly? Your just looking for excuses to get out of your punishment for your misbehavior! I have tolerated enough failure from you,if you keep acting like a child, I will treat you as such! Get ready to relive the past *Gaster grabs Death with his magic hands and slams him into the floor*
  ","
  *Reaper looked terrified hearing that and he summons his scythe to slash the magic hands as they slammed him into the ground* F-ck..!! N-no..!!

9640,"
   *Geno sighs* lets get you home *having thunderstorms here so I may lose power....*
  ","
  *That's going to suck*

   Of course I was worried about you, I love you, you idiot
  ","
  *Reaper then smiled up at Geno through all his coughing* I m-might be a.. *cough*.. i-idiot.. but.. I'm your i-idiot.. *he winks*..a-and..  I..l-love you t-too..

9642,"
   Life says Cross got your brother apparently, but I was just worried about YOU
  ","
  I n-noticed.. w-wait.. you were w-worried about me..? *Reaper blushed a bit* I'll be f-fine.. Love..  *though he ends up coughing a bit afterwards and falls down to his knees*
  "
9643,"
   I was looking for you

  *Reaper now looked worried* I-Is there.. something g-going on..?
  "
9644,"
   Reaper?

9645,"
   *exo fires back at gaster aw he likes reaper maybe if alphy isnt brought back he can keep the mini beast lol*
  ","
  *Lol just kidnap the mini blaster beast that works, it's kinda cute Reaper actually has something that likes him xD but it'll end when his Hatred takes control of him again though*
  
  *Reaper looked shocked seeing Exo defending him, he really wasn't used to anyone defending him like this, not just because hes the Grim Reaper and most are afraid to even get near him but honestly Reaper was brought up not to rely on anyone else, it's considered a weakness for a God or at least that's what Gaster taught him*
  "
9646,"
   *Gaster teleports* DEATH!! I need to have a word with you, I heard you not only stole a few of my spells but you haven't done any of your work and forced your brother to take over..you do realize I won't let this go unpunished..*his magic floating hands fire powerful beams of light *
  ","
  Sh-t!! *Reaper wasn't expecting his Gaster to show up and does end up getting hit by the beams of light* Ugh.. there's m-more important.. t-things.. to worry about than.. t-that right now..

   *exo nuzzles him affectionately*

  *Reaper was surprised* Heh, alright your welcome, we should head back *he then teleports back with Exo* you can stay with me until I bring back your Alphys
  "
9648,"
   are you sure you should talk to Life, wasn't she trying to kill you?
  ","
  This isn't the first time shes tried to kîll me..*Reaper chuckled a bit* I'll get around it like I did before

9649,"
   *exo is distressed whimpering. Alphy had been dusted by socket on one of his rampages*
  ","
  *Reaper pets Exos head* Hey it'll be fine, I know someone who can bring her back..since she didn't dîe from Toxin so I can bend the rules a bit and bring her back
  
  *though Reaper won't be this nice when his Hatred comes back*
  "
9650,"
   *the lab was a mess papers and broken glass there is bl00d on the wall that read never again. A lab coat is seen on the floor with a pile of dust.Exo whines sniffing it. He had found what was left of his owner alphy.*

  What the heII..? *Reaper walks over to the lab coat then looks at the broken glass and blœd on the wall, what happened?*

  *Reaper was confused and slowly walks in* Hey, anyone here..?

9652,"

  *Reaper looked around noticing it was all destroyed* This can't just be from the Toxin in this place..

  "
9653,"
   “M-me you should stay away from everyone and rest in bed!”
  ","
  Yeah I can't do that even though I wouldn't mind resting right now, Death never sleeps *Reaper chuckled a bit* being the Grim Reaper means I have to be out reaping Souls

9654,"
   *exo sniffs the dirt before tugging on  reaper's robe directing him to follow.*
  ","
  *Reaper turned around noticing Exo tugged on his robe* What is it..? *He starts following the blaster beast* I'm gonna guess you found where to go?
  "
9655,"
   So Geno's afraid of thunderstorms? Why do I suspect you're going to use that to your advantage as soon as possible, I wonder if he would cuddle when freaked out
  ","
  *Because Reaper so would*
  
  Hey, it's not a bad thing, gives us  good excuse to cuddle~
  "
9656,"
   *nods again he wants to see his alphy*
  ","
  So Gothy was right..alright looks like I'll be making a trip to ToxinTale then *Reaper then takes Exo and teleports to ToxinTale and starts heading off, looking for Alphys lab but he might end up lost since unlike the other timelines everything is completely destroyed in that AU making it hard to tell where he's going*
  
  This might be a problem..
  "
9657,"
   *nods*
  ","
  Okay, I didn't think that place had any blaster beasts..so that's surprising.. do you wanna go back there?

9658,"
   *he chases after it bringing it back to reaper*
  ","
  *Aw**Reaper pats Exo on his head* Good boy, but Gothy told me something about you.. are you really from ToxinTale? You can nod yes or no since I'm pretty sure blaster beasts can't talk
  "
9659,"
   Because that's the timeline it's from I think hes still there
  ","
  ..*Reaper sighs* hold on..tell Geno I'll be right back.. *he then teleports after Goth*

9660,"
   Your son Goth was trying to take that blaster beast to toxintale

  What..? Why?

9661,"
   *exo drops a bone  wanting him to throw it*

  *Reaper was surprised* oh, hey, your that blaster beast I saw a while back ...still cant figure out where you came from *he then noticed the bone* pfft, you wanna play huh? Alright *he picks up the bone and throws it* go get it!

  I don't think I've ever had ice cream.. but if I did I'd say strawberry cause of my strawberry

   “Oh in see... why are you hurt then?”
  ","
  ..Well first someone gave me poisoned coffee then I got into a couple fights..*Reaper sighed* it's just been rough lately
  "
9664,"
   “Hm? What is that, mr reaper?” He really didn’t know. He may of seen one once or twice but he really didn’t know. Emil looked st it curiously although with that fixed expression you wouldn’t be able to tell
  ","
  It's called a IV, a hospital will give you one when your really hurt, if I didn't have this right now I don't think I would be walking around or even talking right now

  Yeah he's a really bad guy.. he hurt me a couple days ago and I ended up with this..*Reaper shows Emil the IV he has hooked up to him*

With a lil nod a transparent but slightly tinted blue sphere appeared around them “here! I’m not sure how long it’ll last but it’s very sturdy!”

  *Reaper nodded* I will be with you here.. I love you

   he's the one person who can get Lust to leave. Probably the only person in the whole multiverse Lust is afraid of

  *Reaper looked down at the ground, he felt ashamed of himself for actually fearing Lust and even showing hes afraid, he fears Gaster but he never shows it* D-damn it.. I'm sorry Love..
  "
9675,"
   ... Reaper what happened?
  ","
  *Reaper looked up at Geno with tears starting to form in his eyes as he spoke*
  
  ..Y-you mean with..Lust..? H-he's why I was so injured earlier..and why I still need this IV now..
  
  *he shivers* I feel sorry for any monster he managed to get ahold of..
  "
9676,"
   What the hell is going on?!
  ","
  *Reaper actually sits down on the ground, hugging his knees as he rocked back and forth, his lone eye shrunk down from fear* ..L-Lust.. I can't let him get near us.. I'll be DAMNED if he touches you or me!
  "
9677,"
   ((It probably won’t work tho lol he’s a human soul)) “lust... whose that?” Emil tilted his head to the side. He was pretty innocent and pure so he didn’t even know what the word lust even meant
  ","
  Let's hope you never find out kiddo.. he's one of the worst things you could run into.. he's a literal monster! *Reaper actually seemed afraid of him*
  "
9678,"
   Aw here I thought you loved our time together~ *Lmao Deaths new weakness, Lust*
  ","
  *Reaper actually screams and immediately teleports himself, Emil and Geno into their bedroom, he gets down from Genos arms and starts barricading their door with everything he could move in the room*
  
  STAY THE F-CK AWAY FROM ME!!!
  "
9679,"
   At least Nova snapped his neck before he could do  more
  ","
  *Reaper covers his skull with his hood in shame* ..I-I still wish it didn't happen..but it would of been worse if she didn't step in... I owe her for that..
  "
9680,"
   “No not at all. While shades are similar they are incapable of human speech and attack humans without reason! The shadowlord is their like leader whom seems to have some human intelligence! And actually resembles one”
  ","
  Oh..so that Shadowlord controls them and has them attack you and hes almost like us monsters but looks human.. I wonder if I could take him down.. I'm the Grim Reaper, most things dîe just from me touching them..
  
  I really wish I used my Death touch on Lust ..*Reaper shivers a bit though Emil probably has no idea what he's talking about*
  "
9681,"
   *Geno blinks* with everything that's happened I actually forgot about my own birthday... well guess I know how Ink feels
  ","
  *Reaper clinks Genos skull* well I'll never forget so I'll always remind you, Goths birthday isn't far after yours either..I'll make sure nothing happens on your birthday, if anyone even tries to ruin it, I'm reaping them..

9682,"
   what makes a guy hot?

  You shouldn't worry yourself that much though Love.. I'll be alright, I should be back to normal just in time for your birthday, I have a lot planned for you tomorrow *he winks*
  "
9684,"
   “Huh? No no no that’s not it at all we got into a battle with the shadowlord and this really powerful shade! Nier got badly wounded during it and Kaine was busy keeping the share in the basement! So I had to freeze her so it wouldn’t break out...”
  ","
  A shadowlord and shade..? Are they like the monsters here?
  "
9685,"
   Give me 20 minutes to calm down then I will be

  ..*Reaper gave him a worried look* Love.. *he then nuzzles Geno since I think Genos still holding him* it's okay..
  "
9686,"
   ((Because they were in his swamp))  “Yup that’s it exactly! I was kinda forced into turning her to stone at the time. You know the saying dire situations call for dire measures”
  ","
  *Lol**Reaper looked a little confused, he's hoping Goth isn't responsible for Kaine being stone too* G-Goth didn't force you to turn her to stone, did he?

9687,"
   *Geno fights through a panic and picks Reaper up telepoting them both home, he then gets a new IV for Reaper, just don't ask from where*

  *Reaper was surprised Geno picked him up though he didn't mean to make Geno panic so much he nearly has a panic attack*
  
  *But once he has a IV back in his Soul, his breathing starts returning to normal and he stops gripping at his Soul*  ..T-thanks..Love.. but are you okay..?
  "
9688,"
   Maybe we should go home for now...
  ","
  *Reaper gripped his Soul as he looked up at Geno* ..T-that.. might.. be a.. g-good... idea.. ..but.. I don't think.. I can get..up now..
  "
9689,"
   ((Yes lol and had a tea party with ponies)) “Yea! Though... I had to become like this to save Kaine and Raven! I can at least look at people without turning them to stone now!”

  *And shrek was there eating some of the ponies lol*
  
  ..S-save..Kaine and Raven..?
  
  ..You mean..you turned ..that girl to stone too..? A-and..being like..t-that.. you saved them..

9690,"
   Are you ok? Dammit this kid puled out your IV, you could have gotten hurt badly since you really still need it

  *Reaper was now breathing hard after Emil got off him, his Soul was hurting from the IV being pulled out like that* ..I-I'll ..be.. okay Love..
  "
9691,"
   ((Shhhhh it’s been over two weeks we can just look past that ;)))) Lmao)) “a-ah Sorry!” And he quickly let him go just floating by his side. Hovering practically. “But don’t you recognise me? Is at least my voice? It’s me! Emil!”
  ","
  *XD they magically met somewhere in a world called equestria*
  
  W-wait..what..?? *Reaper was really surprised* W-weren't you..a h-human..last time I saw you?
  "
9692,"
   Well Emil has but kinda decided that the afterdeath family needed to sort out their ‘issues’ with out him being there. “It’s been so long! Oh I have a surprise for you too! I made friendship bracelets!”
  ","
  *Reaper gave him a confused look, he doesn't recognize Emil as a skeleton but he remembered Emil said something about friendship bracelets before but..this can't be the same kiddo, he was human not a skeleton*
  
  Uh..k-kiddo.. I don't remember if we met..but can you get o-off..me for a minute..?
  
  *Emil was around Goth and Raven as a skeleton but not Reaper*
  "
9693,"
   *Geno glares at Emil, he doesn't recognize him either*
  ","
  *Reaper winces slightly since he still had the IV in his Soul when he was tackled, the stand got knocked down with him and could have hurt him by accident* ..mngh.. ..
  "
9694,"
   Yes, it's very impressive and do any of us have great pasts? I mean I spent most of mine planning to destroy the multiverse...
  ","
  I..t-thanks Love *Reaper blushed even more blue, aw well until he was tackled to the ground by Emil lol*
  
  ..And point taken..
  "
9695,"
   Wait don't you still have that IV?
  ","
  Y-yeah but..that's not what I'm worried about right now..*though he should be, the IV stand did fall over from that and could hurt him*
  "
9696,"
   “MR REAPER!” And he gets tackled by the smol floating skele into a hug
  ","
  *Reaper was definitely not used to anyone hugging him or tackling him like that, usually people avoid him like the plague since Grim Reaper, well everyone aside from Geno and now Emil but last he saw Emil he was a human so this will really confuse him*
  
  What the heII..!?
  "
9697,"
   You know one day we need to just talk about your past, nothing big but little trivia like this, I mean I'm really Impressed you built a house on your own
  ","
  *Reaper looked away for a moment* ..most of it isn't great though..
  
  ...*though he blushed bright blue hearing Geno was impressed*
  
  Really?
  "
9698,"
   I had no idea...
  ","
  Well..I didn't think it was important so.. I never told anyone about it..until now *Reaper rubbed the back of his skull* so next time our house gets broken I'm just gonna fix it myself
  "
9699,"
   You built it originally? *Geno just gives Reaper a questioning look*
  ","
  Yeah.. when Gaster left the house you saw to do whatever the heII he's doing now, there was no way in heII I was staying there so I took my bro and built us our own place to stay.. none of the other Gods wanted to help me so I did it all myself.. and when my bro wanted to move out, I helped build his..
  "
9700,"
   Only took four months
  ","
  Remind me never to rely on Ink to fix our house anymore..*Reaper sighed as he stood up* I was the one who built our house in the first place.. if it gets broken again I'll just fix it myself.. it's not the easiest thing I've done but..it'll get done quicker than having to wait on Ink..
  
  *I don't think Geno knew you built your own house*
  "
9701,"
   The past few days have certainly been something huh? Oh Ink apparently finally fixed up the house
  ","
  No kidding but I'm making sure nothing happens tomorrow..*Reaper says rubbing his eye sockets* so we can finally move back to our house?

9706,"
   Yeah, he's gone.... *Geno is now worried about what might have happened*

   It gets worse Reaper, Goth is responsible for all of this. He also REAPED Silver, who had just been brought back by Life, and he slashed Sorell before shoving him into the lake knowing he wouldn't know how to swim...

   They can take their opinions and go rot with them, I know you're trying it's just lately it seems like the entire multiverse has had it out for us. I'm sure things will calm down eventually and you can go back to overly coddling me *Geno flashes him a playful smile*

  "
10018,"
   What would you do if humans took Geno from you? I mean he's an undying monster with Determination, I'm sure there are labs out there with an eye on him. Please don't reap me, I ask this question so you are prepared for the possibility. It's a warning not a threat.

  "
10022,"
   Mhm most certainly he was worried even though he didn’t know what the liquid he found was. However he picked death up piggyback style. Thankfully he wasn’t too heavy. Although the blood would stain his white shirt since his jacket is who knows. And thus Emil carried him away looking for help
  ","
  *Aw**Reaper still had on Emils jacket but with all the blœd he's lost..his jacket might be ruined now but on the plus side, it was helping Reaper, without it, he would be freezing his bones off*..

   With Emil skittishly crawling on the ground it wasn’t long until he felt the blood from under him. However due to having to have a blind fold on he didn’t know what it was. “M-mr reaper?! Are you alright? What’s going on?”

  *Worringly there was no response from the God of Death..but Emil should be right beside him if he found blœd even though he doesn't know that's what it was*..

Everyone else forgot what you did but I sure as heII didn't! You reaped Dream and got him kidnapped by Nightmare! Now your going to pay for that!

   @WeaponHusbando
  
  so Reaper had to act quickly to avoid them getting hurt, he takes the hit head on and tackles Cross to the ground though with his current condition..that hit caused him unbelievable pain, he couldn't stand it and actually screamed from sheer pain alone*..AAAHH!! F-CK!!!
  "
10026,"
   *pretty much. Exo comes back with the stick dropping it*
  ","
  *Reaper blinks as he looked up at the blaster beast, he wasn't expecting it to bring back the stick he threw, this is probably the first time hes seen a blaster beast actually playing ,well, normally he isn't really around them and the few times he had been, he was used as a chew toy**He pets the beast before taking the stick from its mouth* ..Heh..y-you still wanna play? I s-still..need to ask G-Geno..if your o-one of his..

  *Lol oh God this won't end well*

   Goth is 12, Raven is 10, Shino is 5, and if you hadn't REAPED them Silver would be 17 and Sorell 16. Just don't say stuff like that in front of them, last thing we need is them repeating some of what you say in front of say Dream's kids.

  *Reaper realized he had let that slip and quickly tries changing the subject* N-nothing, its nothing Love, so after we eat, can I have you for dessert? *Seriously..he has his mind in the gutter 24/7 ..*
  "
10184,"
   I'm just going to order you a burger, *Geno leans across the table and clinks Reaper's cheek* I do love you, even if you've done some pretty terrible things. But we're working on that.
  ","
  A Geno burger? I wouldn't mind eating you, if you get what I mean--*REAPER OMG your in a restaurant!**The Death God went silent for a moment and turned bright blue from Geno clinking his cheek* Would it help at all if I told you not all my actions were my own?

10185,"
   Given how much you love Geno would you do anything for him?
  ","
  You know I would

  Kiss me and tell me you love me? *Reaper winks* But okay then, are strawberries on the menu? I wouldn't mind having a strawberry Tsundere~

  Oh great, its you..*Reaper rolls his eye, aw come on, be nice to the Fish*

  Well, there IS one thing I want and hes standing right in front of me~ *Reaper, seriously?*

  Are you being sarcastic? *Reaper raises a nonexistent eyebrow*

  *Reaper then pulled Geno into a hug once seeing he was really bothered by what Reaper said* S-sorry Love.. I didn't mean to upset you..just I worry about you and as long as nobody tries hurting you, I won't need to fight..

10191,"
   I'll keep him in line Grillbz, come on lets sit at a booth before you end up in a pointless fight. *Geno speaks more quietly* Remember these people are my friends, they aren't going to hurt me anyway so there's no need to scare them
  ","
  But Love..*Reapers voice had suddenly shifted into a more serious tone*
  
  ..We both know from experience just because someone says they're your friend doesn't mean it's true..your Frisk said they were your friend and kílled you Love..I'm just looking out for you..

  R: But Love, if everyone is afraid of me they'll be too scared to do anything to you

  R: I'll only be a problem if you cause any problems for Geno

  ","
  Alright, fine..I won't threaten to reap him..*Reaper sighed, you have a feeling he will still make a scene somehow since his social skills are zero*
  
  G: Hello Geno, right? I'm still not used to calling you that..who's your friend?
  
  R: Your worst nightmare! *REAPER!! NO, BAD*

  ..Don't bring that up...I'll behave this time..

10197,"

  Sorry about that Love..I won't do that anymore..

   How bout we go to the surface and do something for our date before you manage to put your foot in your mouth *Geno is smiling as he says this but it's true Reaper does do that... a lot*
  ","
  *Reaper blushed slightly, he was a little embarrassed because it is true, it won't be long before he manages to p-ss someone off or get into trouble, actually I think he's already done that by trying to reap Rora*
  
  ..L-lets just go on our date..after I reap this kiddo first

   HOLY CRAP *Geno has to duck suddenly from Reaper swinging his scythe like that*

  Oh sh-t! S-sorry Love!! *Reaper, you need to be more careful, your still holding Geno*
  
  I can solve that

10205,"
   So? Even Death needs a break once in a while. *In an alternate universe, Reaper would probably be clinging to Swap right now LOL*
  ","
  *I can see him doing that if Swap refused to give him that Starbucks lol*

   That would be My business, not yours.
  ","
  ..Huh, didn't think you would say that, you aren't wrong but thats just not the response I was expecting..

   Maybe I shouldn't 'have' to help you, but I Want to help you. No one can handle everything on their own

  *Reaper then clinks Geno on the cheek* Thanks Love but if they're a God, they should be able to..I used to handle everything on my own before I met you..
  "
10208,"
   I only just got here I wanted to ask miss Life something....
  ","
  Huh..ask her about what? *Reaper was curious since he doesn't really see Dream talk to her very much*
  "
10209,"
   *Geno smiles weakly* Yeah I think I'd like that, let me just ask Life to look after Sorell while we're out. Yes Sorell is staying. Reaper remember we're partners, if you ever need help with anything just tell me.
  ","
  Fine...*Reaper then frowned and looked away from Geno for a moment* and..I know but..I'm a God Love..I should be able to handle more than this.. you shouldn't be having to help me at all.. a-anyways, about that date..what do you wanna do Love?

10210,"
   Agreed, Geno needs more happiness in his life, he's always blaming himself for everything that goes wrong

  *Reaper was startled by seeing Dream so suddenly appear and falls on his back lol, good job Death*
  
  When did you get here..!? But it's true, he does blame himself for stuff that's out of his control..

10211,"
   Reaper, seriously though you need to stop trying to get rid of our kids. Please, they mean as much to me as MY Papyrus did. I don't want to let family dust again *Geno's actually teared up, thinking back on before he was Geno is still hard*

  Love..*Reaper then hugged Geno close, he hated seeing him cry*..I'm sorry Love..I really can't help it..I have this voice in my head that..tells me I need to get rid of them in order to protect you...I can try harder to fight it off..but..*Reaper then paused in the middle of his sentence and quickly changed the subject since he wasn't sure he should be telling Geno any of this* anyway, how about that date? That'll cheer you up, I know you love the surface and this time I won't need to strap you to a bed and drag you with me

10215,"
   Geno said he needed help with his kids, you of all people have seen firsthand what I do to people who hurt Berry and so POOF. Here I am. Oh and I bought you some Starbucks since you look like you need a break. *Awww*

  Is it a bad thing I love you that much I want you all to myself? *Reaper then wraps his arms around Geno* relax Love, I'll get the kiddo out of Underfell AFTER I spend some time with you first~

10224,"
   D3ad!?D3ad..I know D3ad I was d3ad old man..I was eaten alive by a monster in horrortale.But now i'm back.We both got a second chance we both deserve our best shots at living again!

  *Reaper is going to reap poor Rora now that he knows this kiddo died before too, though Reaper was responsible for Silver and Sorells deaths and now he's going to be responsible for Roras, Allura and Horror are going to be very angry skeleparents*

  You know I'm the Grim Reaper kiddo, it's my job to make sure whoever dies stays dead and if your telling me the truth here, your times already been up..but I'll tell you what kiddo, if you really want another chance at life, you can try living in Underfell, let's see how long you last there

   No but it aint cool throwing kids through portals.

  *Reaper takes his scythe and slashes you with it* How about you stay out of my marriage?

10229,"

  ","
  Geno wouldn't of done that, he loves me~
  
  *You DID kíll 2 of your own children and put the remaining 3 in comas..Geno is probably p-ssed and he has every reason to be*

   It's who he is... if you really do love him, then let him be himself.

  Doesn't mean he should..he's in the worst shape out of everyone in this family!

   God forbid Geno have anyone else in his life that he cares about

  He doesn't need anybody else! *Reaper then swings his scythe in order to reap you, someone is angry*

10236,"
   The point of a family is to take care of each other AND HELP EACH OTHER.  You're missing the point.
  ","
  *Reaper just kept his gaze away from both you and Geno, truthfully..with the way he was raised and the fact hes never had emotion before, he didn't know that's what family is about..even if his Hatred wasn't affecting most of his actions, he wouldn't know how to be around his kids, he didn't even know how to act around his own brother or even with Geno*
  "
10237,"
   Hello!
  ","
  Who the heII are you?
  "
10238,"
   *Geno seems to mouth the names, then shakes his head* No the names don't feel familiar at all, whatever you did when you erased my memories of them has really stuck....
  ","
  That's a good thing, means you won't remember them after this..at least ONE of the things I erased finally stayed erased
  
  *Reaper chuckled a bit* You named Silver well Silver because when he was alive, he had Silver colored eyes and you thought it fit him, he doesn't have that anymore now since I reaped him and Sorell you came up with by combining not just our names but Fells too since he was still your adopted brother at the time and you wanted him to feel part of the family..I erased all your memory of them right after you named them and sent them off..and I'm going to do it again here in a minute..
  "
10239,"
   If you ever bothered to actually act like a parent as opposed to me having to do everything then I wouldn't end up in trouble trying to take care of them *normally Geno would have sounded angry or at least frustrated, but right now he sounds just ... empty*
  ","
  Love, I did try to parent them..*by dumping them in Underfell, you even dumped Goth there a few times, good thing Geno doesn't remember that*
  
  I don't think we were ready to have that many kiddos, it's better off they're gone, now we can just focus on eachother without having to worry about anyone else, your upset right now but I know you'll forget all about this later and we'll go back to cuddling~
  "
10240,"
   ... fine... *all of his earlier anger is gone, replaced by what seems like a void of hopelessness*
  ","
  ..*Reaper was now worried, Geno went from angry to upset in just a matter of seconds..if Geno had his magic functioning again though I think he would have strangled Reaper for this**The Death God then proceeds to take Geno back home and lays him back down in bed*..Love, I know you don't like this..but I'm just doing what I can to protect you..those kiddos got you into more danger than anyone else..
  "
10241,"
   *Geno is just staring at the blood and dust; eye wide, he doesn't acknowledge Reaper talking to him... actually it's not clear if Geno even heard him or not*
  ","
  Love..? *Reaper walks up beside Geno and scoops him up in his arms* We should get you back home..come on, I'll get you back to bed..
  "
10242,"
   You did what was easiest for YOU to handle. *because going to the save screen isn't using magic but using his Determination Geno does vanish to the save screen with a snap of his fingers... but when he gets there their kids aren't there*
  ","
  *Geno might think the kids somehow dusted given how much blœd and dust is now scattered across the floor on the Save screen..yeesh, that's going to end badly..*
  
  Love..!? How in the--wait! *Reaper then teleports right after Geno* Love! You shouldn't be here right now! I don't even know how you still managed to get to the Save screen but you should get back to bed!
  "
10243,"
   *Geno is just glaring at Reaper* Death get the hell away from me.
  ","
  But Love, I did that to protect you, we couldn't handle any kids before we had Goth, we weren't ready for it and the 3 we do have now, cause enough heII for us, we can barely handle them let alone 2 more! I did what was best for us..
  "
10244,"
   Why do any of it?!? I get it you're protective of me to a degree you do stupid sh!t but how did any of that help! All you did was make me lose even more family
  ","
  Love, listen to me, it was for the best..the first 2 needed to go, they came along before we even had Goth..we weren't ready for it.. I know I couldn't deal with 2 kids, so I sent them away like I did with Raven and erased your memory..but they unlike Raven, didn't survive Underfell and I ended up reaping them.. *REAPER OMG* I tried getting rid of Raven, Goth and Shino for now so you can recover without anyone bothering you..we don't need those brats causing you to get hurt..
  "
10245,"
   So you left them in the same half alive state I spent an eternity on the Save Screen as??
  ","
  *Mod leaves the building, this is going to get ugly, your on your own Reaper!*
  
  I..well...*Reaper sweats a bit and nervously rubs his skull, he knew this all sounded preeettyy bad* Well, good news is as long as they stay there, they'll be fine..
  
  I knew you wouldn't be happy if I flat out reaped them like I did the other 2..
  "
10246,"
   Does the HOW I know really matter? You do realize you also just admitted that you did in fact reap 2 of our kids and leave the remaining three near dusting
  ","
  F-ck..listen, Love, I know this looks bad but there's a good reason for why I reaped the other 2..and I was going to leave the other 3 on the Save screen so they aren't dead..*but by that statement, that means..Raven, Goth and Shino might dust if moved from the Save screen, they would need healed immediately if they were taken out of there, much like Geno when he first left..yikes..that would really p-ss off Geno*
  "
10247,"
   [[we'll just pretend it got answered]]
