to sleep it off.\n  ","407841":"\n  i seldom wear makeup to begin with, unless i'm going out somewhere and have the patience to put some makeup on. i also do wear less foundation in the summer months anyway, mostly because my face gets tan and i don't feel like dishing out the money to buy a darker shade of foundation.\n  \n  my go-to look is similar to my makeup style in my current profile

techniques without realizing it.\n  ","407846":"\n  yes !! that's a really big deal to me, and i've only ever seen maybe one or two people completely walk away from the machine without cleaning it

isn't anything terrible. although it has been quite a while since i felt this way, lmao.\n  ","407869":"\n  yeah, i'm generally in a much happier mood when i'm drinking.\n  ","407870":"\n  haha, i was already asleep by the time you sent this message. but no, i didn't start answering questions last night until after i got home.\n  ","407871":"\n  yes, i smoke cigarettes.\n  ","407872":"\n  occasionally, but definitely not as much as i do. he'll drink once every few months or so.\n  ","407873":"\n  whether or not i'm seeing my boyfriend that night. if i have plans to see him, then i won't go out drinking with a friend. i would rather spend time with him than with any of my friends.\n  ","407874":"\n  occasionally, yeah. sometimes i'll wake up around 5:30 or 6am and not be able to go back to bed because i'm too awake.\n  ","407875":"\n  no, i normally don't notice it at all.\n  ","407876":"\n  no, i'm not sleeping yet.\n  ","407877":"\n  i don't have an answer to this question, my friend. i'm not an expert in psychiatry or neuropsychiatry.\n  ","407878":"\n  this is a stupid fucking question.\n  \n  unless someone is lucid dreaming, they don't have control over their dreams. anyone with a basic understanding of sleep knows that.\n  ","407879":"\n  is this a serious question? lmaoo.\n  \n  they're out of my control. i can't help but have dreams or nightmares. it's unpredictable and i have no control over them.\n  ","407880":"\n  depends on the day. sometimes i'll have a buttered croissant, or a yogurt parfait, or an egg sandwich.\n  ","407881":"\n  obviously not? lmaoo.\n  \n  that's why they're called nightmares, not dreams.\n  ","407882":"\n  two to three times per day. i normally eat breakfast, sometimes lunch, and then dinner.\n  ","407883":"\n  no, i can't remember my first time. it was either during my sophomore year in high school when i experimented with drinking for the first time or my first year of college.\n  ","407884":"\n  yeah, sometimes. it depends on my mood while i'm actually going to bed. sometimes i'll sleep like a rock, while other times i'll have nightmares.\n  ","407885":"\n  friendships happen naturally, not upon request. i appreciate the acknowledgement but you can't make friends with someone by simply asking to be their friend.\n  ","407886":"\n  uh, drunk. lmao.\n  \n  otherwise, i'm feeling fine. i had therapy this afternoon & then my friend asked me to meet for dinner and a drink, so i complied. now i'm a bit tipsy and going to bed soon.\n  ","407887":"\n  one of my cousins. she's absolutely gorgeous. angular face, dark brown curly hair, and a beautiful figure. she also has a great personality and her husband is just as charming and funny.\n  ","407888":"\n  not at my own house, no. i

exercise every three days, lol.\n  ","407897":"\n  not really. i ate steak and vegetables for dinner and had a few glasses of white wine. i totally missed dessert, lol.\n  ","407898":"\n  LMAOOO. omg.\n  ","407899":"\n  sunday afternoon when i hugged my boyfriend goodbye after i dropped him off at his house after the trip.\n  ","407900":"\n  don't settle for anything less than what you deserve. it's perfectly fine to be picky when dating, and even if you're already in a relationship, you shouldn't be anything less than happy with your partner and your progress together.\n  \n  life is too short to settle down with something that simply feels comfortable. you deserve someone who will not only make you feel at home, but also be a beacon of support, a source of encouragement, someone who brings out the best version of yourself.\n  ","407901":"\n  call an exterminator.\n  ","407902":"\n  haha, no. i find those super annoying.\n  ","407903":"\n  it feels like you're coming home for the first time.\n  ","407904":"\n  yes, they surprisingly get along. my boyfriend doesn't like my mother at all, though, but he plays nice for my sake.\n  ","407905":"\n  no, i don't have any food allergies or anything. i only have seasonal allergies to things like pollen.\n  ","407906":"\n  usually i get on the treadmill and exercise for a while.\n  ","407907":"\n  reading, writing, painting, playing video games, photography, and seeing my friends.\n  ","407908":"\n  no, i have no desire to try that.\n  ","407909":"\n  i wake up at 7:15am every morning.\n  ","407910":"\n  i find the concepts to be interesting, but i'm not sure if i necessarily believe in them.\n  ","407911":"\n  yeah, my parents are notorious for doing that. growing up, my mother in particular always made me feel guilty about my interests, which has led me to clam up about everything i'm interested in or doing as an adult.\n  ","407912":"\n  dark humor, lmao. i laugh at gory movies and i especially love dark comedy movies, like heathers.\n  ","407913":"\n  lol, this defines most of my social experiences. i always get the feeling that no one is actually listening to me but i finish the story anyway.\n  ","407914":"\n  surprisingly, no. all of the bridges i've burned happened a few years ago and i've been content with my group of friends for a while now.\n  \n  however, there is one friend with whom i thought i should cut ties, but i'm still unsure of where we stand. we have a good time when we see each other, but they've royally screwed up on multiple occasions and i'm not sure how many more chances i'm willing to give.\n  ","407915":"\n  honestly? no.\n  \n  it's in our human nature to aggravate conflict. we're creatures of habit, and any form of change is immediately met with hesitation and skepticism. most important figures who are in control of the world are also ruled by greed and gluttony, and if something does not fit their preconceived viewpoint of the world, then they reject it.\n  \n  i don't think we'll see world peace, at least not in this lifetime if the human race is still standing.\n  ","407916":"\n  hello ~~\n  \n  i'm doing well. i'm watching a true crime docu-series, drinking some alcohol, and scrolling through my askfm questions. i should probably be asleep, but i'm not tired yet.\n  ","407917":"\n  the truth is, everything is catered to the male gaze, and even though realistically beauty has no importance to what's significant in life, it's become conventional and standard to place that importance on beauty in order to quantify some sort of worth in society.\n  \n  from early times, women have always catered to men. the idea of a woman's beauty has been deemed as important to further serve the men in their lives. in the current age, that has manifested in different makeup forms, body types, body hair styles, etc etc. women are told \"men won't like you with short hair\" or \"men don't like when women are not shaved,\" and so on. it's become so typical and commonplace to see these standards of beauty and most people don't acknowledge how misogynistic it can be.\n  ","407918":"\n  thankfully, i feel like my vocabulary is pretty diverse, due in part to my studies in grammar and literature while in college. the words come to me naturally, even words that i notice i haven't used in quite some time, depending on the situation and what message i'm trying to convey.\n  ","407919":"\n  while i do have a lot of terrible and depression decisions that made my life worse, for the sake of askfm i'll answer this on a positive note.\n  \n  deciding to stick through with college & graduate changed my life, and for the greater good. i struggled a lot with my grades and juggling assignments, especially with my mental health being as bad as it was, but i knew that if i dropped out then i would feel worse. i stuck through with my studies and ended up graduating with a 3.9 GPA. it's changed my life for the better because i wouldn't have had the job opportunities i've had, had i not graduated.\n  ","407920":"\n  in theory, yes. it's technically fair -- but in application, no. for example, even if your boss looks down on you, in some circumstances you simply cannot treat them the same way otherwise you'll lose your job. and while some people may think that's worth losing their job over, other people can't afford that to happen to them.\n  \n  the reality is, sometimes we have no choice but to deal with being treated poorly by people. however, in most cases we do need to take a step above them and take the higher ground, because by behaving like them you're only stooping down to their level.\n  ","407921":"\n  \"girl interrupted\" by susanna kaysen is perhaps the best, and most important, book i've read to date.\n  \n  it's definitely not a complex novel, but it's an autobiographical sketch of a woman's lessons she learned while staying in a psychiatric ward after being diagnosed with BPD. it was the first book i read that introduced me to the importance of mental health and also was my first insight into depression, anxiety, and BPD. i was able to relate to many of the characters, which was my first clue that i was struggling with mental health myself.\n  ","407922":"\n  i used to prioritize other people's needs & desires over my own. as i've gotten older, i've learned that my own needs, desires, and happiness are just as important as those of others. i'm now acknowledging that i need to prioritize myself moreso than ever these days, because i cannot help others until i ultimately help myself. i'm learning that i deserve happiness and recognition.\n  ","407923":"\n  well, i just got back from the gas station and picked up alcohol, so ask me questions since i'll be drinking & staying up for a while ~~\n  ","407924":"\n  somewhat, yes. i never really responded well to positive affirmations when i was struggling, because it simply seemed unrealistic to me. however, i do appreciate gentle approaches to reality and encouragement. the acknowledgment of the struggles and hardships while also offering sound advice that isn't a blanket statement or falsely confident.\n  ","407925":"\n  seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile, watching the rain outside the window, drinking iced coffee in the morning, spending lazy early mornings with coffee and cigarettes with my boyfriend, positive reinforcement, sleeping well, true crime documentaries, reading a good book, painting, writing something i'm proud of, and playing video games.\n  ","407926":"\n  went to bed early the other night because i knew i needed the extra sleep, instead of staying awake to prolong the night.\n  ","407927":"\n  a meme that i saw on facebook, lmao.\n  ","407928":"\n  very much so, yes. i have generalized and social anxiety, so i'm basically worried about everything and overthink everything.\n  ","407929":"\n  because i'm afraid something could go wrong, haha.\n  ","407930":"\n  there's a mexican food restaurant that i love going to because their food is *always* delicious. you can create your own burritos, tacos, and burrito bowls, and they also have churros and quesadillas.\n  \n  i normally get a burrito bowl with white rice, pinto beans, carnitas, guacamole, salsa, cheese, and lettuce. it's one of the best meals ever.\n  ","407931":"\n  i don't really enjoy swimming in general. but i like being near the ocean, and sometimes i'll wade out into shallow waters and dig my toes in the soft sand. it makes me feel closer to nature.\n  ","407932":"\n  i've always wanted to travel to australia, new zealand, england, and spain.\n  ","407933":"\n  nah, it's obviously much easier to spew bullsh*t onto other people's pages, even though it's perhaps the easiest way to make a fool out of themselves, haha.\n  ","407934":"\n  i've always found that amusing too, especially with you in particular. occasionally i'll get an anon or two who tries super hard to bring you down on *my* page, knowing full well we're good friends.\n  \n  like ... ?? it goes against all common sense, lol.\n  ","407935":"\n  yeah, there are a few shows i binge watch from time to time. they're usually some sort of true crime docu-series. right now, i'm watching the second season of \"the confession tapes\" on netflix.\n  ","407936":"\n  it's interesting how this anon is so dead-set on calling you scared or ashamed when *they're* the one who's anonymous, lmaoo.\n  ","407937":"\n  my boyfriend does on occasion, yeah. it isn't really an unusual thing for couples to do.\n  \n  lmao, which reminds me of a funny story. when i was at my cousin's wedding on saturday, my boyfriend noticed that my cousin grabbed his wife's ass when they were standing on front of the church before pictures were being taken, lmaoo.\n  ","407938":"\n  these messages are hella silly and immature. if you have such an issue with\n  \n   @littlesha_\n  \n  , then express these feelings on her page. they mean nothing to me, so i'm not responding to them from here on out.\n  ","407939":"\n  i think i want to try things like bungee jumping, sky diving, parasailing, and ziplining. however, i'm absolutely terrified of these things at the same time, LOL.\n  ","407940":"\n  \"sleeping sickness\" by city & colour ;\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8rU7WPVcLmQ\n

","407945":"\n  no, i'm perfectly content with the amount of friends i have at the moment. i see three friends occasionally, as well as my boyfriend, and that's enough to keep me busy.\n

usual, and my mental health has been much better this past week compared to last week.\n  \n  i've been trying to put myself on a stricter general schedule\/routine so that my moods can be more even -- waking up at the same time every day, taking my meds at the same time every day, eating at the same time every day, and exercising every two days.\n  ","407948":"\n  why are you asking *me* this question, when you should really be asking\n  \n   @littlesha_\n  \n  ?? lmaoo.\n  \n  i'm not on askfm until at least 6:30pm, and sometimes early in the mornig before 9am if i have spare time before work. i don't know the majority of what is said on my feed.\n  ","407949":"\n  i'm feeling fine -- i'm still a bit tired from the weekend, but that's to be expected, especially considering i didn't get enough sleep last night and woke up twice throughout the night for no apparent reason.\n  \n  right now, i'm drinking some iced coffee and catching up on my questions here (and also listening to music). i really need to wash my hair, but i don't have the energy right now.\n  ","407950":"\n  if the topic hurts you too much to write about it, then perhaps you aren't ready to write about that topic yet. you may still need to do some thinking and soul-searching to come to terms with that topic, or at least begin to accept that whatever happened has happened and you have to try to move forward from it.\n  \n  the words will come in time. sometimes, it helps the healing process. but if you can't muster the words right now, don't force yourself.\n  ","407951":"\n  ???\n  \n  i've never said i was poor -- people have always asked if i was wealthy, and obviously that isn't the case so i always say no. there's a difference between being poor and being in that weird in-between stage where you're not poor, but you're not well off either.\n  ","407952":"\n  (2\/2) consent for you and even a potential boyfriend getting filmed, photographed, and gushed over (and if I'm honest,

honestly, i wrote gay fanfiction too when i was a teenager, lol. thankfully that didn't transpose into my real life, it was just a way for me to practice my writing.\n  \n  however, i definitely

i've learned the hard way, haha. i was never one to really listen to authority when it comes to advice about situations, i always had to experience it myself.\n  ","407960":"\n  yes, i see no problem with that. not everyone is equipped to handle mental illness, but as long as they at least *tried* to understand and didn't discriminate against them for having mental illness, then there's nothing inherently wrong with breaking up with a person because they really cannot handle it.\n  ","407961":"\n  i made a salad, if that counts. lmao.\n  ","407962":"\n  i only follow people whose answers i

yourself and express yourself comfortably, you have to learn about yourself over the course of many years. it doesn't happen overnight.\n  ","407978":"\n  it doesn't represent or affect me, lol. i

versatile and i absolutely cannot get enough of it, haha. i also tried pad thai for the first time two weeks ago & fell in love.\n  ","407983":"\n  no, quite the opposite, lol. i don't really care what other people think about my opinions, and i've always been pretty outspoken about my perspectives when asked.\n  ","407984":"\n  only from my friends. i usually feel uncomfortable if strangers compliment me.\n  ","407985":"\n  yes, definitely. it's a problem when people feel attacked because they refuse to take accountability for their own actions.\n  ","407986":"\n  the only thing that bothers me is that he's a very messy person, lol. he throws his clothes wherever, he leaves empty cups on the table, the garbage doesn't usually make it to the garbage, etc etc.\n  \n  it used to be much worse, so it's gotten better within the past year ever since he reorganized his bedroom. he has more incentive to keep it clean and has learned that he feels better mentally when his living space is organized.\n  ","407987":"\n  usually because they're insecure with themselves or have pent up aggression from experiences (normally at home). people don't bully others unless they feel weak in some aspect of their lives, or unfulfilled. it never comes from a good place.\n  ","407988":"\n  yes, i was bullied a lot when i was in middle school, as well as the beginning of high school. i was bullied for my appearance and my dress style, because i was goth at the time.\n  ","407989":"\n  an experience i had at work this afternoon. on my lunch break, my coworkers and i were outside and noticed a dog running around the parking lot & it seemed scared. my coworkers cautiously walked to the parking lot to see what was going on, and after about 10 minutes, a woman walked out of the office building and basically said, \"oh yeah, that's my dog. did she escape?\" and totally didn't seem phased by the fact that her dog was running around and almost got lost.\n  \n  also, the dog didn't have a collar or identification. the woman left the dog in the car for who knows how long, with the window wide open. the dog likely hopped out of the car because it was dying of heat. :\/\/\n

overview of your professional experiences and goals, and it can be as simple or as complex as you'd like.\n  \n  personally speaking, i've always gone with a more simple, straightforward approach with my resumes for easy reading. i'll list my career objectives, my past work history with a brief explanation of my tasks and responsibilities, and my schooling (with certain achievements, like being on the dean's list or graduating magna cum laude or being published).\n  \n  i also have a section on my resume of my professional skills, i.e. proficiency in adobe, microsoft office, photo editing, customer service, writing and editing, etc etc. at the end of the resume, i have a section that says \"references available upon request,\" and on a separate document i have a few professional references with their email addresses and whatnot.\n  \n  if you need any tips, feel free to ask !!\n  ","407993":"\n  on rare occasions, yes. i mostly drive everywhere i need to go, but sometimes i'll have to take an uber somewhere. i also take the train if i ever go into new york city.\n  ","407994":"\n  haha, yeah. i dislike my next door neighbor. he's a really irritable old man who complains about everything, mows his lawn at 8am on the weekends, and yells at my landscapers. he's extremely rude, and before his wife passed away, i could hear him screaming at her most nights when i would go outside to have a cigarette. :\/\/\n  ","407995":"\n  no, i don't have a swimming pool at my house. my family used to have a pool in the backyard, but it was extremely old. we eventually

there isn't anything wrong with being socially conscious, advocating for the rights of others, and calling out problematic behavior to be more inclusive.\n  \n  however, there's this SJW culture of people who claim to be feminists, but they use it to their advantage to try to justify their own problematic beliefs. it's more of a popularity label than anything else, and people generally don't advocate for what's morally and socially right anymore. it's just an arguing competition online, and in general these people don't transpose their words into actions IRL.\n  ","408002":"\n  when i

of confidence to be attractive -- however, not *too* confident to the point where they're arrogant about themselves. it's beautiful to see a person embracing themselves and being true to themselves

unpredictable personality.\n  ","408004":"\n  my experience with askfm has mostly been positive !! i've met tons of amazing, wonderful people on here -- some of whom i can call a genuine friend.

byzantine tradition.\n  ","408055":"\n  probably !! i think personalized wedding vows are beautiful, and i've actually never been to a wedding where the couple wrote their own vows.\n  ","408056":"\n  no, i've never traveled anywhere by myself. every time i've taken a trip, it's been with my boyfriend or a close friend.\n  ","408057":"\n  yes, i am indeed aware that there is a high divorce rate in the united states. that isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. these days, people are more apt to recognize when a relationship isn't working anymore and they're willing to break up in order to further both of their senses of happinesses, not only for themselves but for the children as well.\n  ","408058":"\n  it's a celebration of the love that exists between two people. obviously there are legal benefits to being married as well, but i've also always been somewhat of a romantic and believe that weddings are beautiful traditions.\n  ","408059":"\n  yeah, i'm sure my boyfriend and i will eventually get married in the future. we're in absolutely no rush either way, it isn't a priority to us.\n  ","408060":"\n  one of my cousins !! he and his bride were absolutely stunning. i posted a

we were both exhausted from the drive.\n  \n  saturday, we went to the church ceremony for the wedding and then the reception afterwards. the reception was at this big, beautiful barn in the mountains of the adirondacks, and it was absolutely gorgeous. we stayed until about 10pm and then left because we were both feeling toasted, lol.\n  \n  today, we left the hotel super early to drive home, which took about five hours. i dropped him off at his house and then went home, and i napped for a little while. overall, the trip was wonderful and well worth the very long drive. :'))\n  ","408063":"\n  i

neutral, probably because of how tired i am. i just want to lay in a bed of blankets in silence for the rest of the night.\n  ","408073":"\n  no, quite the opposite actually. if a man cries, he's simply human -- it's normal, expected and healthy to cry for a variety of emotions & someone isn't less of a man for releasing those emotions.\n  \n  the idea that crying makes men weak is extremely unhealthy and antiquated. it's a stigma used against men to promote toxic hypermasculinity in a society where men are conditioned into thinking that they should never display emotion. it's not good or healthy to suppress yourself like that, regardless of your gender.\n  ","408074":"\n  no, i have no desire to see toy story 4.\n  ","408075":"\n  sure, i probably could be classified as a nerd. i'm a

common these days & it doesn't personally bother me. i wouldn't use it in my own relationship, but other people's relationships don't concern me.\n  ","408077":"\n  i already explained this in more detail below, but in short, my boyfriend and i traveled home from upstate new york this morning\/afternoon. i've been laying down pretty much ever since i got home because the drive exhausted me.\n

any later than 7:30am, even on my days off from work.\n  ","408082":"\n  i normally hit snooze once at the very most, otherwise i know i'll be late for work. i like getting to work at least 20 minutes early so that i don't have to rush.\n  ","408083":"\n  i haven't been in any sort of schooling for six years, haha. i graduated college in 2013.\n  ","408084":"\n  you can see our outfits pretty well in this picture. my dress was all maroon & floral with beige wedges, and he wore a gray suit with blue accents and brown shoes.\n  ","408085":"\n  when you asked me this, i was getting ready to leave for the trip. i logged off of askfm from friday morning until this afternoon, so i apologize that i didn't get to see this message in time.\n  ","408086":"\n  haha, thank you !! i had a fine day -- my boyfriend and i woke up in the hotel, got on the road by 10am, and got home around 3pm. we picked up some lunch on the way home because we were starving, and after i dropped him off at his house, i came home, sorted through my things, and laid down for an hour or two.\n  \n  i'm still exhausted, so i'm probably going to call it an early night. i kinda regret not taking off from work tomorrow.

through new york city was terrible both going there and coming home. it was a five hour ride both ways.\n  ","408092":"\n  partly, yes. i didn't want to go to the wedding with my hair as faded and terrible looking as it was, and i also wanted to color it again anyway. so it just worked out.\n  ","408093":"\n  i love weddings too, they're so festive and full of hope and joy. i don't have the

our interpersonal relationships are what give life ultimately its meaning and substance.\n  ","408303":"\n  ???\n  \n  cadence doesn't even have orange hair, lmao. regardless,even if she did have orange hair then it obviously doesn't mean i want to *be* her. people are allowed to express themselves.\n  ","408304":"\n  nope. i'm absolutely useless when it comes to most car things.\n

the true color of the hair, haha.\n  ","408307":"\n  new hairrrr ;\n  \n  (it's more ginger\/orange in person, tho.)\n  ","408308":"\n  like ... people are spending *real* money on coins ... when we

normally describe things with ease.\n  ","408314":"\n  i believe some people have the capacity to change, yes. we have the ability to unlearn behavioral patterns or thought patterns and adopt new styles of thinking.\n  ","408315":"\n  honestly, i normally call them out on it and ask them why they're blatantly lying to me. i don't tolerate lying in any form of relationships, platonic or romantic. i won't trust you if you lie to me.\n  ","408316":"\n  sushi !! especially spicy tuna rolls.\n  \n  i also tried pad thai for the first time the other day & fell in love.\n  ","408317":"\n

real life, haha.\n  ","408324":"\n  my boyfriend and i switch on and off between big spoon and little spoon, lol. however, we don't usually stay in those positions for very long. after like 10-15 minutes, we usually get hot and retreat to our respective sides of the bed.\n  ","408325":"\n  i honestly can't remember the last time i went to the library, yikes. probably sometime when i was in college, i always went to the library on campus to study and do homework.\n  ","408326":"\n  i usually just work during the summer, haha. however, i've been doing that since i was 29 years old. i've

addiction, i.e. nicotine, caffeine, drugs, alcohol, etc etc.\n  ","408337":"\n  there's smog in new york city, but it doesn't reach where i live.\n  ","408338":"\n  no, there's too much light

nothing to do with karma. investing your energy into something toxic is unhealthy for your mental health.\n  ","408341":"\n  i don't even know what this means.\n  ","408342":"\n  it could be, but only a doctor can make that determination. regardless of whether or not you're mentally ill, if you're having s*icidal thoughts then you should seek professional help. there's always help available.\n

when i was younger as a teenager using the internet, and i don't really remember how i reacted. it obviously didn't dissuade me from using the internet, so i assume it didn't bother me very much.\n  \n  these days, i receive hate messages every so often, but i simply delete them. it isn't worth the energy to give them attention.\n  ","408345":"\n  there's a part of me that says yes, because i'm a vengeful person at times and i only wish that those who hurt me would receive some sort of punishment. however, there's also a part of me that says no, because it's useless to invest your energy into something so negative that will only end up hurting you in the long run.\n  ","408346":"\n  offer to listen if someone is struggling with something in their life. listening to a person's problems goes a long way, it feels nice to be heard and understood.\n  ","408347":"\n  my happy place ;\n  ","408348":"\n  no, i don't believe in love at first sight. you cannot be in love with someone you just met, you don't know their personality or anything about them. what people experience in those instances is lust.\n  ","408349":"\n  i highly doubt it. i feel like we're on the verge of a major pandemic or extinction within the next 50-100 years, haha.\n  ","408350":"\n  i sorta mashed together the latin words for \"poetry\" and \"moon\" to resemble a meaning of \"poetry of the moon,\" haha.\n  ","408351":"\n  no, i don't believe i've ever been in that situation. besides people who have been passed out from being drunk, lol.\n  ","408352":"\n  i'm from the united states. i've never visited any other countries.\n  ","408353":"\n  at first, i'm normally down on myself because i have a difficult time accepting personal failures. i have high expectations for myself all the time. however, talking the situation out with my boyfriend or a close friend usually helps motivate me to do better. they can rationalize the situation and validate my feelings, which inspires me to move on and try again.\n  ","408354":"\n  people are usually racist because they grew up in an environment that was racist, generally in a racist household. it becomes ingrained in them from when they're young. they never unlearned their thought process, and sometimes it gets to the point where they've become so intolerant that they're incapable of changing.\n  ","408355":"\n  uh, i accidentally told my coworker the size of my boyfriend's p*nis, LOL. we were talking about past history and i thought she told me how big her husband was, so i told her how big my boyfriend was. then she looked at me confused and was like, \"uh, i wasn't talking about size...\" LMAO.\n  ","408356":"\n  \"the thing about boxes is that you can open them up. even though they're completely boring on the outside, there might be something interesting inside. so while you're saying all of these stupid, boring things i'm imagining what it would be like to cut you open and see what you've got in there.\"\n  \n  -- i am not a serial killer (2016)\n  ","408357":"\n  i would choose the power of teleportation. it would be nice to magically teleport to where i need to go instead of commuting everywhere, lol. it would take away a lot of anxiety.\n  ","408358":"\n  i don't feel comfortable explaining the circumstances, sorry.\n  ","408359":"\n  yeah, there's one person in my life who i hate.\n  ","408360":"\n  yeah, that sounds pretty unhealthy to me. someone else's happiness shouldn't affect your happiness, and also just because someone gives off the impression that they're happy or fulfilled doesn't mean they actually are. people only talk or post about the good things in their life, never their struggles.\n  ","408361":"\n  when someone has a \"first world problem,\" it's generally referring to a problem that's pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things that would only happen to a person who is privileged to be living in a first world country.\n  \n  like, say someone complains that their favorite brand of bottled water is out of stock at the store. people might say that's a \"first world problem\" because there are countries that don't even have clean water.\n  ","408362":"\n  i think it depends on how long you've been seeing them and how you go about asking the question. there's nothing wrong with being educated about different medication, and if you think a certain medication may help you, then it's a good idea to ask about it. as long as you're not literally demanding for the medication, i see nothing wrong.\n  ","408363":"\n  i won't lie, having a significant amount of money would solve a lot of my current problems.\n  ","408364":"\n  no, i don't believe in karma. life is simply unfair -- people who do bad things seldom receive consequence for what they've done, and good people are rarely rewarded or recognized for their good deeds.\n  ","408365":"\n  i can appreciate both forms of literature, so i don't really have a preference. i like reading the classics because it's interesting to me to see where contemporary works originated from and how the classics set the stage for other forms of writing. there's also something uniquely different and mystical about classic novels, i can't quite put my finger on it.\n  \n  however, i also like modern literature too because there's simply so much creative freedom out there now.\n  ","408366":"\n  yes, i have a bad habit of never finishing any of my creative projects, whether they're paintings or pieces of prose. i also have a lot of video games that i never finished playing, haha.\n  ","408367":"\n  relationships (whether platonic or romantic) shouldn't be one-sided. don't put effort into a relationship if the other person does not reciprocate that same level of effort. people often get taken advantage of in relationships because they're either too nice or too shy and are too forgiving when it comes to the levels of dedication on each side.\n  \n  don't settle for anything less than you deserve. if you're being shorted in a relationship, either try to fix it with the other person through open communication or end the relationship. do what serves you first and foremost, there's nothing wrong with putting yourself first at times.\n  ","408368":"\n  i usually choose a nord or bosmer for race.\n  \n  as for guilds, i always loved the storylines of the thieves guild and the dark brotherhood.\n  ","408369":"\n  yes, you're correct. when the word \"late\" is used before an individual's name or something similar, it means that they're no longer living.\n  ","408370":"\n  i honestly have no clue. i've never left the united states before.\n  \n  i would assume outlet adapters would be hella important, though.\n  ","408371":"\n  oh gosh, i'm so sorry i'm only getting to this now. :\/\/\n  \n  i'm sorry you and your best friend are going through this, i can't imagine the kind of pain you're in right now. to be honest ... i wouldn't know what to do in that situation either. i cannot fathom my best friend or my boyfriend passing away, i would absolutely lose it. can you confide in another friend or family member? perhaps even a therapist?\n  \n  again, i'm so sorry. i'm here for you if you need to talk. stay strong, friend.\n  ","408372":"\n  LOL, wut. i've never come across that before.\n  ","408373":"\n  i most value honesty and a sense of humor in my friends. i don't think i can be friends with someone who doesn't have a good sense of humor or who can't make me laugh, and i definitely cannot be friends with someone whom i cannot trust.\n  ","408374":"\n  i don't really see being rich as a financial thing, because you can be wealthy and still be deeply unhappy with your life. a person is rich when they're happy or content with their life, they surround themselves with positivity and loved ones, they immerse themselves in hobbies and events that make them happy, and they contribute to others.\n  ","408375":"\n  seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile, listening to music that moves me, getting positive feedback and reinforcement regarding my personal life or work, having campfires in the backyard with friends, and immersing myself in nature.\n  ","408376":"\n  i would rather have $50,000 that's clean and guilt-free. at least i won't have to worry about the money being traced back to a nefarious origin and getting in trouble.\n  ","408377":"\n  i would rather lose my money and valuables. you can always make more money as time goes on and acquire new valuables, and generally speaking i don't own many things that are sentimental to me like that.\n  \n  however, i do value photographs a lot. i have a really bad memory, and photos are one of the few ways i'm reminded of all of the good moments of my life. i have a dozen photo albums of various trips i went on with my boyfriend and i'm constantly taking photos whenever i go out with friends, whether it's pictures of us or of the food and drinks or scenery.\n  ","408378":"\n  i'm the shortest person in my entire family, lol. i'm only five feet tall.\n  ","408379":"\n  i've re-discovered my love and passion for music within the past few months, so i basically listen to music non-stop throughout the day. it ranges from alternative rock to contemporary pop to heavy metal to video game\/television instrumentals to lo-fi hip hop.\n  ","408380":"\n  no, that's my natural hair. my hair is past my shoulders.\n  ","408381":"\n  i generally don't shop at walmart because the closest one to me is like 20 minutes away, and it's easier to go to the supermarket or target or the drug store.\n  ","408382":"\n  i decided upon the strawberry blonde with light blonde streaks. :')) my stylist says she *might* be able to do it depending on how much of the blue she can take out, but i trust in her abilities.\n  ","408383":"\n  that isn't reality, though. accept me for who i am or don't bother posting this nonsense. it's unbecoming, a bit creepy, and very unhealthy.\n  ","408384":"\n  say goodbye to the blue hair !!\n  ","408385":"\n  i don't care about looking \"hot.\" i have no one that i wish to impress, and what you just described does not sound appealing to me at all. i'm growing my hair out, i rarely wear makeup, i don't have my ears pierced, and i don't wear tight clothing.\n  \n  having an unrealistic vision of another person is really unhealthy. you need to look at the reality of who i am instead of basing your opinion of me off of a fantasy.\n  ","408386":"\n  STORY OF MY LIFE, LOL.\n  \n  nah, but yeah sometimes i do cry for absolutely no reason, or if there is a reason then it overall makes zero sense and i'm overreacting.\n  ","408387":"\n  i understand how you feel & your emotions are completely justified. death is difficult to process and overcome, especially in the context of a loved one or significant other.\n  \n  however, just because he passed away doesn't mean you cannot date other people. you may find that you'll be ready in due time. he probably wouldn't want you to dwell on the past or prevent yourself from being happy. if anything, he would likely want you to be the happiest version of yourself you can be and find someone who brings that out in you. you deserve to be happy and loved.\n  ","408388":"\n  no, i already think i'm too much to handle as it is. everything about me is exaggerated or grandiose, ranging from my behavior to my emotions and everything in between. if anything, i would like to be less.\n  ","408389":"\n  i don't care about clothing style. i wear what's comfortable.\n  ","408390":"\n  no, i have no interest in local politics.\n  ","408391":"\n  i don't generally eat bananas unless i put them in cereal or yogurt.\n  ","408392":"\n  i think bunnies are absolutely adorable. there are a few bunnies in my neighborhood who roam freely and they love nibbling on the grass in my backyard. :'))\n  ","408393":"\n  i love smoothies. there's actually a smoothie shop on my home from work and i've always meant to stop there after work, but i haven't gotten around to it yet.\n  ","408394":"\n  contemporary top 40 pop music, lmao. i love ariana grande especially, as well as billie eilish. i also have a horrible obsession with \"old town road.\"\n  ","408395":"\n  leigh is a unisex name that means \"delicate or meadow.\"\n  ","408396":"\n  i try really hard not to be a jealous person, but sometimes it comes out of me without me realizing it. it's something i'm continuously trying to work on. jealousy is a toxic emotion, and it hurts you first and foremost.\n  ","408397":"\n  no, i don't dress punk and i never dressed punk in the past. when i was a teenager, i went from being goth to being scene\/emo, haha.\n  ","408398":"\n  thank you, i appreciate it. \u2661\n  ","408399":"\n  he cheated on me once earlier in our relationship, but that was it. he's never betrayed me other than that and he doesn't continuously make mistakes.\n  ","408400":"\n  i would wish for it to be saturday (tomorrow!) so that i can get my hair done. :'))\n  ","408401":"\n  i prefer solitude. i'm not a people person by any means and i'm fairly introspected by nature.\n  ","408402":"\n  not very many, i got rid of a lot of shoes because i simply didn't wear them. these days, i only wear maybe the same three pairs of boots\/sandals, haha.\n  ","408403":"\n  i am worried about something, but it's too personal to talk about on askfm. i honestly hope it blows over, though, i really don't know what to do in this situation so i'm at such a loss.\n  ","408404":"\n  no, i've never been in that situation before.\n  ","408405":"\n  lavender, patchouli, gasoline, fresh rainfall, campfire, roses, and dragon's blood incense.\n  ","408406":"\n  LOL, i guess i did accidentally set it up that way, whoops. thank you, though ~~\n  ","408407":"\n  if i have to make a difficult decision, i normally talk it through with my boyfriend so that i can get a different perspective on the situation before diving in and making a decision right away. he's always been good at presenting different points of view and getting me to see things from different angles.\n  ","408408":"\n  i'm honestly not sure. i've always been self motivated because i felt as if i had no other option but to succeed. i'm terrified of failing at aspects of my life, so that in itself has been my motivation to step up and move forward.\n  ","408409":"\n  no, i honestly haven't paid attention to what new movies are coming out in over a year or so.\n  ","408410":"\n  here, have my profile pic ;\n  ","408411":"\n  out of those options, i prefer to travel by train. it's something i've done since i was a child, so i'm very used to traveling via train and it's actually relaxing to me.\n  ","408412":"\n  uh, probably gas station \"wine.\" i didn't realize it wasn't actually wine until after i returned home and inspected the bottle more thoroughly. it's actually advertised as a \"wine product,\" which is deeply concerning and disgusting. it also tasted horrible.\n  ","408413":"\n  not generally, no. the only opinions that are worthwhile to me are those of my boyfriend and close friends.\n  ","408414":"\n  i would have lunch with chester bennington. he was a resounding influence on my life when i was a teenager, and i've always wanted to thank him for inspiring me, for motivating me, and for allowing me an outlet when i was going through really dark, difficult times. i'll forever be in his debt.\n  ","408415":"\n  i always shower before i go to bed at night. i value my time sleeping & it's difficult for me to wake up in the morning as it is. i can't fathom waking up any earlier than absolutely necessary, lol.\n  ","408416":"\n  it makes me uncomfortable when i'm in a situation where i'm alone with someone and have no idea how to pass the time without making things awkward between us. i'm absolutely terrible at small talk, and i generally don't enjoy talking to new people to begin with, so when i'm in a position where i'm alone with my friend's friend (as an example), it makes me hella uncomfortable.\n  ","408417":"\n  to entertain myself, i usually listen to music, watch youtube videos, scroll through social media, read, write, play video games, or see if a friend is available to hang out.\n  ","408418":"\n  you asked me this 10 hours ago, which would have made it 1pm. at that point, my day was going fine. i was on my lunch break at work at that point.\n  \n  the rest of my day since that point went well, too. i feel fairly accomplished and i'm just relaxing, listening to music, and catching up on my questions. i spent an hour watching my friend's stream on twitch before, which was hella fun.\n  ","408419":"\n  i like everyone i follow,

doesn't have money. if he doesn't have enough money because of unfortunate life circumstances, but he still puts the effort in to work extremely hard and take overtime to pay for his bills and generally be responsible, then i wouldn't hold it against him at all.\n  \n  however, if someone doesn't have money because they're irresponsible and spend it on useless things, then i have no desire to be associated with a person like that.\n  ","408422":"\n  well, neither option sounds remarkably appealing. however, if i had no other choice, i would choose to be a vampire. at least i wouldn't have to worry about turning into a creature against my own free will.\n  ","408423":"\n  i remember watching dragonball z and thundercats a lot when i was a child.\n  ","408424":"\n  i don't advertise

video games in a long time. however, i enjoy some first person shooters and open world RPGs.\n  \n  my favorite games are skyrim, fallout 4, destiny, halo: reach, assassin's creed: syndicate, the bioshock series, life is strange, the wolf among us, layers of fear, minecraft, and GTA V.\n  ","408437":"\n  i don't pay attention to other couples when i'm out in public.\n  ","408438":"\n  colors aren't inherently gendered, so one color isn't more feminine or masculine over the other. if you like one color, then you're allowed the freedom to purchase a phone in that color.\n  ","408439":"\n  they don't have to match, but they have to at least complement each other. for example, i won't mix patterns but i will wear colors that complement each other.\n  ","408440":"\n  sometimes i do, while other times i just ignore them.\n  ","408441":"\n  no, i don't believe in karma. people who do terrible things don't always have something coming for them, and often people who do good things don't get the happiness or recognition they deserve. life is unfair that way.\n  ","408442":"\n  the only things i do are shower, brush my teeth, brush my hair, and put on fresh clothing. so overall, it probably takes me around 30-35 minutes.\n  ","408443":"\n  i can't really make this sort of call because i don't known you or your friend. but personally speaking, it feels good when someone checks in on me, even if i don't have the energy to respond. your friend might appreciate your messages even though he doesn't say anything. he might also think you don't care anymore if you stop responding.\n  \n  you might want to ask him if you're annoying him with your messages, just so that there's communication there. if he says that he's ignoring you purposely or doesn't want you to message him anymore, then so be it.\n  ","408444":"\n  they all had side effects when i first started using them, ranging from nausea to lightheadedness to insomnia to fatigue and weight gain. but i've been on

","408483":"\n  overall, i was pleased with the final season, even though it *did* have its downturns and questionable moments. the cinematics were beautiful in most of the episodes, but some character arcs took a turn for the worst and it felt as if some aspects of characters' developments and plots were meaningless.\n  \n  the last episode was intense, and honestly the more i think about it, the more predictable it was. initially, i was a bit shocked but after speaking to a few people about the dynamics of some particular characters and their respective personalities, it made more and more sense. overall, everyone who survived ended up getting the ending they wanted or deserved.\n  ","408484":"\n  considering i'm turning 28 and you're only 35 years old, then yeah -- that isn't

along the lines of him hanging out with, for example, his best friend and showing him. it didn't occur to me until this message that you might have meant him sending those photos to random friends of

entirely due to toxic masculinity. men are \"supposed\" to exhibit masculine traits, which over the years has conditioned men into thinking that they have to be these stoic, stone cold figures with no emotions whatsoever. it's extremely damaging to men, and its one of the reasons why there's such an alarming rate of men who have mental health problems not getting professional help. it's still seen as \"weak\" in society.\n  ","408501":"\n  yeah, i've been sitting in the backyard in the sunshine and reading every saturday, haha. i'm significantly tanner than what i was two months ago.\n  ","408502":"\n  i started coloring my hair when i was 12, actually. so i understand why the anon wants to do it, and it's completely safe as long as you do it with a professional and have adequate

honestly don't really have a full understanding of what otherkin is, tbh.\n  ","408514":"\n  you shouldn't stop your medication by yourself, no. that's dangerous. please talk to your doctor about these feelings and you two will come to a conclusion as to what to do, whether to try a new medication or do something else with the dosage.\n  ","408515":"\n  idk, it depends on the individual. some people like having a label on their gender while others don't particularly care.\n  ","408516":"\n  i would marry my boyfriend, haha. i don't have any wild dreams of marrying a celebrity or anything ridiculous like that.\n  ","408517":"\n  i try to do breathing exercises so that my heart rate slows down and the chest pains disappear (easier said than done, lol). it doesn't always work, though.\n  ","408518":"\n  i don't remember tbh. i usually stay away from crowds of people so that i don't have to worry about people talking to me.\n  ","408519":"\n  there's really no such thing as a number of genders, in my opinion. just like there isn't a number of sexual orientations -- both gender and sexuality exist somewhat in a spectrum, and we've just developed labels for things as they come.\n  \n  i think students should overall have an overview of what gender identity is, what's the difference between cisgender and transgender, and how gender identity does and does not correlate with gender roles or expectations.\n  ","408520":"\n  sexual identity ?? like, you mean their sexual orientation ??\n  \n  you're not any less or different of a person if you're gay, and if you're having a hard time coming to terms with your sexuality, then try to talk to trusted friends or family members about yourself and gain their support, if possible. everything is better with a support system, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with being gay. there's so much more acceptance now than there was in the past, and hopefully we can continue down this road until there's universal understanding of sexual orientation.\n  ","408521":"\n  yes, I absolutely believe that gender should be taught in primary and secondary schools. the only way to ensure inclusion and acceptance for our generation and future generations is to teach these things to children early on.\n  ","408522":"\n  a lot of people are quick to reject notions that don't fit into their established square of beliefs and understandings. they weren't taught about trans people as children, for example, so therefore trans people's existences aren't valid or are seen as a phase. many people don't like their beliefs challenged because it makes them question themselves.\n  ","408523":"\n  LOL. nah, if anything it's my lamictal tablet because that medication has helped me most of all.\n  ","408524":"\n  it's existed for centuries in many other cultures. it's just been rejected by mainstream society due to a lack of education (i'm talking about in the united states, i'm not sure about other countries). there have always been trans and non-binary people, but their existence has been oppressed and not accepted much like how gay people have been oppressed and not accepted over the decades and centuries.\n  ","408525":"\n  those damn cops ain't getting our donuts, man. they can find their own donuts.\n  ","408526":"\n  male and female are sexes, not genders. the reason why we were taught about sex and not gender is because trans people in general have *always* been ostracized and discriminated against in society, and its only been within the past few years that people have become more open about gender and gender education.\n  \n  it's the same reason why when we were growing up, we weren't taught about being lgbtq+ either. sex education was barely being taught as it is, and that education was only restricted to heterosexual sex. we weren't taught about sexual orientation either.\n  ","408527":"\n  your gender doesn't change. much like sexuality, your gender is an innate part of you that you discover as you grow and get to know yourself better.\n  ","408528":"\n  no, it doesn't annoy me. their beliefs don't affect or change my gender so it isn't something i spend time worrying about. when people ask me, i educate. what they do with that information is on them.\n  ","408529":"\n  simply speaking, it means not of either binary. in the case of gender, the binaries are man and woman. non-binary means, in its simplest terms, that you're neither a man nor a woman.\n  ","408530":"\n  i find my boyfriend's beard attractive, yes.\n  ","408531":"\n  my face, lol. i wouldn't want a tattoo on my face at all.\n  ","408532":"\n  yeah, i am. it's on my driver's license.\n  ","408533":"\n  i'm a writer\/editor for a publishing company. i enjoy my job & definitely have no complaints, it's something within my field and i'm also treated with respect.\n  ","408534":"\n  regardless of a person's gender, i would advise people struggling with mental illness to not be afraid to seek out help if they're concerned for their own well being. if they cannot afford professional treatment, there are also hotlines, text lines, and maybe even friends and\/or family who will be willing to sit down and listen until you can find a way to be treated by a professional. there's no shame in needing help.\n  ","408535":"\n  what's best depends entirely on the individual, because different medication will work for different people. unfortunately, it's a trial and error sort of situation, and you won't know how something works for you until you try it for at least two weeks.\n  ","408536":"\n  i currently take buspar (in its generic form) and i have a prescription for hydroxyzine for sudden anxiety symptoms.\n  ","408537":"\n  i'm diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder. my diagnoses used to include panic disorder, but since starting anti-anxiety medication, i rarely have panic attacks so i believe that's in remission.\n  ","408538":"\n  no, i haven't. i definitely should have on multiple occasions, though. honestly, my mental health has been terrible this past month and i really did think about driving myself to the hospital two weeks ago, but i don't have the kind of money to pay for a hospital visit.\n  ","408539":"\n  i don't believe i have, no. at least not while i've been in my 20s. my mental health was significantly worse when i was a teenager, so i wouldn't be surprised if i experienced a psychotic episode during those days.\n  ","408540":"\n  yes, i'm on four different medications for psychiatric problems. i also attend therapy.\n  ","408541":"\n  i sought help for my mental illnesses when i was around 25 years old. i have been dealing with depression, anxiety, and s*icidal thoughts since i was a pre-teen, but my thoughts of harming myself & those around me were getting progressively stronger as i got older. at one point, my depression was so severe that i didn't go to work for a week, and i needed a doctor's referral to a psychiatrist so that i didn't get fired from my job. that's ultimately when i decided to seek treatment.\n  ","408542":"\n  i would rather please other people, although i know that i do need to place greater emphasis on ensuring my own happiness as well. i always put other people's needs before my own.\n  ","408543":"\n  of course, i've had my heart broken numerous times. it's pretty difficult to avoid that situation when you're my age, haha.\n  ","408544":"\n  no, i don't believe in this phrase. people change as they grow older, and just because they cheated in the past doesn't guarantee that their mentality will never change. people are capable of un-learning behavioral patterns and improving themselves.\n  ","408545":"\n  i would perish if my body developed an intolerance to coffee. my veins are more coffee than blood, at this point. i don't have a coffee tattoo for no dang reason.\n  ","408546":"\n  i haven't cleaned it in like two weeks, so it looks gross. i need to scrub out the bathtub and shower walls and clean the toilet and sink. it shouldn't take very long, but i've been neglecting it because i've been exhausted after work lately.\n  ","408547":"\n  i'm not sure. lmao. i don't consume dairy products to begin with except in rare occasions, so it wouldn't surprise me if my body developed an intolerance for dairy. i don't drink milk, i'll eat eggs but in small batches, and i mainly use soy milk or a small amount of half-n-half in my coffee.\n  ","408548":"\n  nah, that only happens when i drink way too much coffee (like 4+ cups, which is really rare). it also happens if i choose to have heavy cream in my coffee, which is something i've been avoiding for a while now.\n  ","408549":"\n  my weekend has been good, although not as productive as i would have wanted. i'm going to make up for it today, though -- i just finished my freelance assignments, and after i eat, i'm going to continue doing laundry, exercise for a little while, and clean the entire house (the bathroom needs a serious scrubbing).\n  \n  i took yesterday as a personal day & spent the entire day relaxing, reading, and even had an early afternoon beer when i was tanning outside. however, i feel like i totally wasted my day because i didn't actually get anything done.\n  ","408550":"\n  no, i wouldn't change the time when i met my boyfriend. honestly, he is part of the reason for my recovery. he inspires me to better myself, and when we were teenagers, he supported me through my dark episodes and helped me recover from self-h*rm. i don't know if i would even be in a better place mentally had i not met him when i did.\n  ","408551":"\n  i don't have side effects from drinking coffee. it obviously keeps me awake, but that's caffeine's intention in general.\n  ","408552":"\n  yeah, i notice that a lot too. i wonder if it's due to a lack of education, although even in primary school students are taught about all of the different asian countries, not *just* japan, korea, and china. but a lot of people have the misconception that other types of asian people don't exist, simply because they're not fetishized as strongly as light-skinned asians. any race that's dark-skinned is stigmatized severely in our society.\n  ","408553":"\n  i don't discuss my sex life on the internet.\n  ","408554":"\n  on the weekends, i have three cups in the morning. on the weekdays, i have one cup in the morning and sometimes one cup in the afternoon.\n  ","408555":"\n  ugh, that's horrible. i'm sorry you have to go through that. as for *why* people of your race are fetishized\/objectified, i'm honestly not too sure. i just think it's ridiculous how in a s*xual context, asians are wanted, but in literally any other context, they're discriminated against.\n  ","408556":"\n  no, you're definitely right. even if you look at the p*rn\/s*x industry, there's a high demand for asian clients and videos of asian actresses.\n  ","408557":"\n  people like that have to really look inside themselves and figure out why they even have that prejudice against other races to begin with. realistically, someone's race does not define them and humans are much more complex than their race. so for a white person to say that their \"type\" is solely other white people comes from a racist history, likely because they were raised in an intolerant household and society.\n  ","408558":"\n  i don't know the criteria behind it, but you're essentially right. most doctors don't take all insurances, they only accept certain insurance companies (probably because they have longstanding business with some companies and not others). it's capitalism at its finest.\n  \n  therefore, even if you really want to see a certain doctor because they're knowledgeable and compassionate, it won't matter because if they don't take your insurance, you'll have to pay out-of-pocket for those visits, which is something not many people can actually afford.\n  ","408559":"\n  that seems a little racist to me, yeah. you're essentially rejecting the idea of being assimilated into another culture before you're even given the opportunity to do so, and there's also nothing wrong with dating someone with a different culture from you. it's actually a wonderful learning experience.\n  \n  if it isn't racism, then it's definitely intolerant and close-minded. you're essentially judging someone based on their race without getting to know them first, especially when you consider that not everyone is in tune with their heritage to begin with.\n  ","408560":"\n  i can imagine it's the same in new york if you're not covered with insurance. thankfully, i just pay my co-pay at each appointment so i'm thankful that i found a facility that takes my insurance and doesn't have an extremely long wait list.\n  \n  although, i'm changing psychiatrists and i have the number for a new doctor, i just haven't called her yet to see if she takes my insurance and how long of a wait it will be to get an appointment with her.\n  ","408561":"\n  it depends on a lot of factors, such as what your insurance company decides to cover, what the psychiatrist\/psychologist charges for their services, whether or not the provider even takes your insurance in the first place, etc etc. for some people, it can be expensive. but for others, it may be the same amount of money compared to seeing a general practitioner.\n  \n  i can't even fathom how much money a psychiatrist or psychologist would be without insurance, honestly. i've always been covered (except for three months last year where i wasn't, but i didn't see my doctors during those three months). medication alone is expensive, so seeing the provider would likely be much more money.\n  ","408562":"\n  2mg brexpiprazole\n  \n  30mg buspirone\n  \n  20mg fluoxetine\n  \n  200mg lamotrigine\n  ","408563":"\n  i've been reading the first book in george r.r. martin's \"a song of ice and fire\" series (game of thrones), and it's really fascinating and intense thus far. i don't know if it would be classified as a summer reading novel, but it's certainly good.\n  ","408564":"\n  ... what ?? your metaphor makes no sense and isn't relevant to this question.\n  ","408565":"\n  yes, it's unfortunately possible to still have bad days. i experience bad days every so often, but definitely not as often as they used to be when i was unmedicated. however, they don't exist with the same severity as what you're describing.\n  \n  you should talk to your doctor about it, honestly. you could need an adjustment in dosage, probably something a bit higher or an adjunct medication to \"enhance\" the effects of the antidepressant (that's what i'm on).\n  ","408566":"\n  i plan on finishing my freelance work (i slacked off yesterday, i spent the afternoon reading & tanning outside instead of working). i also plan on cleaning the living room and kitchen, doing laundry, vacuuming, scrubbing the bathtub, etc etc.\n  ","408567":"\n  i do enjoy hearing other people's laughter at times, especially in settings where i'm with a friend and we're discussing something amusing & they start laughing hysterically. i have one coworker whose laugh is very funny and contagious, and every time she goes off, the rest of us can't help but laugh too.\n  ","408568":"\n  no, i keep forgetting to bring it up. this only happened last week, lmao. i do plan on telling him though, the situation was just hilarious.\n  ","408569":"\n  asia

inspiration behind why i wake up & get out of bed in the morning.\n  ","408571":"\n  i'm not sure if this was the funniest, but it certainly was amusing (and a bit embarrassing).\n  \n  my coworker and i were talking about our s*xual past and whatnot, and somehow the topic of p*nises came up as well. something got lost in translation along the way, and my coworker said \"yeah, my husband is number four.\" obviously she was referring to the fact that he was her fourth significant other, but somehow i thought she was talking about p*nis size. so i replied, \"yeah, my boyfriend is a hefty (include inches here).\"\n  \n  so, she paused. and then she was like, \"uh, i was talking about how many partners i had. please don't tell my husband you thought he was four inches.\" LOL. i was so embarrassed, but also hysterically laughing because i accidentally told her how big my boyfriend was, and i still regret it to this day. she laughed it off and whatnot, but i'm still mortified.\n  ","408572":"\n  uh, honestly -- bojack. LOL. the web of self-loathing, substance ab*se, and obvious issues with self confidence are things i can all relate to.\n  \n  i really feel for his character, even though i also believe he's a bit self entitled (despite his confidence issues, strangely enough) and a bit of an attention seeker.\n  ","408573":"\n  LOL. yes, i've only been watching it for a few days now. i didn't realize how many

last night, diane just leaked chapters of her book onto buzzfeed and bojack fired her.\n  ","408576":"\n  i do feel awkward and somewhat uncomfortable, but honestly it's something i'm just used to at this point. i don't want to be discriminated against or questioned if i were to bring it up in conversation and that's the last thing i need in a work-related setting.\n  ","408577":"\n  yes, i would stop being friends with someone if they were homophobic or transphobic. i don't have room for intolerance in my life.\n  ","408578":"\n  yes, i'm not open about my gender in most of my IRL relationships. it isn't necessary for most people to know, in my opinion. it doesn't reflect or change my work ethic so whether or not they know my gender makes no real difference to me.\n  ","408579":"\n  i'm open with my sexual orientation, yes. that doesn't mean that everyone in my life knows about it though, lol. i don't advertise my sexuality in conversation or anything, and i

understanding that i didn't trust him for a while since he knew what he did was wrong. to show me that he was worth trusting again, he became very open about his feelings and showed me respect with my

unfortunately. i believe that being gay is an inherent part of someone, and no one \"turns\" gay or anything. it's just them going through life, having new experiences, and realizing their true nature.\n  \n  him dating girls was an experimental phase and probably the catalyst for him realizing he didn't like women. sometimes people need to experiment with their sexuality before coming to

","408642":"\n  yes, that's actually fairly common !! it's normal for people to question their sexual orientation and then come to an understanding of themselves. i used to think i was gay when i was

apparently, first cousin marriages are legal in new york (which i previously didn't know about). even so, the prevalence of such an event occurring is rare.\n  \n  i don't support the concept, though.

cannot spend your food stamps on drugs because it's only used for food and other goods (which is pre-determined), and you only get a particular amount of money per month.\n  \n  second, denying someone food stamps if they're a user or an addict is essentially denying a person their basic need to eat, as well as their children's needs to eat. it's doing more harm than good, and there should not be laws preventing people from consuming something necessary for their survival.\n  \n  third, it's somewhat classist (and ableist) to suggest a restriction on food stamps based on whether or not a person uses drugs. drug use is more prevalent in populations of lower class or lower financial stability, which is where food stamps are also more prevalent. in addition, these people normally don't have the resources to get treatment and recovery, which further complicates the situation. people who are users or addicts shouldn't be stigmatized and prevented from a basic need.\n  ","408715":"\n

bad for them and try to help them, they make it awfully difficult because they feed off of the attention & sympathy. they exaggerate their symptoms to get a response from those around them as well.\n  \n  it's really a slap to the face to people who struggle with disabilities and don't use their disability as an excuse for bad behavior. it portrays a terrible image of disabled people, because most disabled people act the complete opposite and wish they weren't disabled, and they usually try their hardest to live life as normal as possible.\n  ","408719":"\n  i had a tremendous crush on one of my online friends whom i used to talk to everyday. i wouldn't say that i was in love with her, but i definitely did love her with every fiber of my being and wanted to be with her terribly.\n  ","408720":"\n  i have several favorite movies, haha.\n  \n  i am not a serial killer, the crow, heathers, queen of the damned, the punisher, the lord of the rings, secret window, american psycho, the shining, v for vendetta, django unchained, les miserables, and sweeney todd.\n  ","408721":"\n  for this headache to go away, ugh. luckily it isn't a migraine anymore (i actually left work early because it was so bad).\n  ","408722":"\n  there's nothing in my pocket.\n  ","408723":"\n\n   @lunampoeta\n  \n  is my backup account in case something happens to this account. i like logging in on the weekends and clearing my inbox of questions so that there isn't a backlog of questions waiting for me.\n  ","408724":"\n  sometimes, depending on the person i'm speaking to. occasionally i'll get bad vibes about a person & they turn out to be correct.\n  ","408725":"\n  financial, emotional, and relational stability.\n  ","408726":"\n  i would like to lose more weight before the end of 2019. i already lost some weight (although i haven't weighed myself), so i just have to keep exercising. :'))\n  ","408727":"\n  this sounds materialistic, but having financial stability is the first thing that comes to mind when i think of success. even though realistically success shouldn't be defined by how much money you make, i would personally consider myself successful if i gained more prominence in my job and earned more money.\n  ","408728":"\n  this is a boring answer, but i don't really have any special talents. my talents are in the arts, i.e. writing, photography, and painting.\n  ","408729":"\n  not very often, perhaps once every few weeks. although i do post more pictures on twitter than anything else.\n  ","408730":"\n  traveling more often, tbh. although i never really had the opportunity to travel when i was younger, i don't think i'm able to travel much now unless i had a lot of extra spending money, haha.\n  \n  i'm going to the caribbean next march, though, so at least that's something !!\n  ","408731":"\n  aw, that sounds lovely !! i definitely want to visit, i have a few friends who live in virginia.\n  ","408732":"\n  no, i have no desire to wake up earlier than i need to, haha. i go walking at night after work.\n  ","408733":"\n  nah, i don't use sunscreen. only tanning oil.\n  ","408734":"\n  this is sweet. thank you. \u2661\n  ","408735":"\n  it's simply not realistic. people push the idea of \"fake news\" to basically reject something they don't personally agree with, and it's always used in an ignorant or close-minded manner.\n  ","408736":"\n  yeah, i'm not addicted to technology. three hours for social media per day isn't very much time at all. in addition, that's assuming that i don't have anything else to do in the evenings. when i have plans, then i'm not on askfm either.\n  ","408737":"\n  i just said i find the concept of \"fake news\" to be silly. i don't believe there's any kind of percentage related to it.\n  ","408738":"\n  not really. i'm primarily on in the evenings between 7pm and 10pm. i don't use askfm when i'm at work.\n  ","408739":"\n  most forms of the media are biased to a certain degree, in that they cater to a specific audience. they tell stories from one point of view instead of focusing on the bigger picture.\n  \n  at the same time, however, i find the concept of \"fake news\" to be silly and ridiculous.\n  ","408740":"\n  no, i'm not addicted to technology. i can easily go without most forms of technology if given the opportunity to do so.\n  ","408741":"\n  i think it's difficult to group americans into one category like that, especially considering most americans are a mixture of a variety of other cultures.\n  ","408742":"\n  no, it isn't really something that concerns me. most people are mixed, anyhow.\n  ","408743":"\n  i've seen bits and pieces of it, but i was never interested in watching the show.\n  ","408744":"\n  i feel much better now -- thank you for asking !! :'))\n  \n  i saw my boyfriend last night, so he was able to put things into perspective for me, understand my feelings, and encourage me to continue moving forward. we all have pitfalls every now and again, and i have to learn to be more forgiving towards myself.\n  ","408745":"\n  i always enjoy reading\n  \n   @urlsareshittbh\n  \n  's answers. they're always so educational and he puts a significant amount of thought into each answer.\n  ","408746":"\n  the thought of immortality is curious to me. it certainly doesn't appeal to me, but i'm not afraid of it either. it simply seems like an isolating experience, because you know ahead of time that your time with your loved ones (if you even bother to make intimate connections at all) is fleeting. you will outlive everyone around you.\n  ","408747":"\n  I MET MY BOYFRIEND'S NEW PUPPY THIS MORNING. :'))\n  \n  i went upstairs to leave the house to go to work, and the puppy walked around the corner to greet me. he was timid at first because he never met me before, but when i put my hand out, he immediately walked up to me and started licking my hands. then he jumped up on me and tried to play with me by tugging at my shirt. it was the cutest thing.\n  ","408748":"\n  one year ago, i was in denial about my problems and all around unhealthy coping mechanisms. i genuinely thought i was doing well, when really all i was doing was suppressing my emotions and drowning them out with alcohol and drugs.\n  \n  fast forward to today, i have a better understanding of my unhealthy coping mechanisms and am actively trying to take back control of my impulses. i'm trying to understand and process my emotions more, restraining myself from taking part in risky activity, and working on bettering myself both mentally and physically.\n  ","408749":"\n  yes, i've attended quite a few weddings -- my best friend's wedding being among them !! :'))\n  \n  i'm going to a wedding in two weeks actually. i'll be traveling for it, so my boyfriend and i are making a little weekend trip out of the experience.\n  ","408750":"\n  long island is well known for the montauk monster, haha.\n  ","408751":"\n  yes, i wholeheartedly agree. the human species is an incredibly complex species due to the range of emotions we experience. we are naturally complicated beings, and we always have been. frustrating, on the other hand, may be a matter of opinion, but i do agree with you in the understanding that humans are largely frustrating.\n  ","408752":"\n  for my last birthday, my boyfriend drove me to the local aquarium and bought us tickets to a wine tasting event that occurred inside of the aquarium after-hours. there were drinks, food, live music, and we could peruse the entire aquarium by ourselves. it was absolutely fantastic.\n  \n  honestly, i want to do the same thing for my next birthday. it was so low-key and fun.\n  ","408753":"\n  spirited away. :')) i could watch that movie endlessly.\n  ","408754":"\n  there's no such thing as a real versus a fake man. you're not any more of less of a man by either engaging in a fight or walking away from a fight. your gender doesn't correlate with your behavior.\n  ","408755":"\n  having days off with my boyfriend, so we can spend quality time together by having breakfast, drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, watching silly youtube videos, walking the dog, going to the park or beach, having a bonfire in the backyard, etc etc.\n  ","408756":"\n  no, i'm not an inherently happy person. i've struggled with depression for as long as i can remember, and sometimes it feels as if life is preventing me from actually experiencing happiness sometimes (i.e., something terrible always happens when things appear to be going well).\n  ","408757":"\n  i normally make myself a cup of hot coffee, put on relaxing instrumental music (usually the skyrim soundtrack), and browse the internet so that i have something to distract me from my worries.\n  ","408758":"\n  i'm fairly book smart, but that's pretty much it. i scored highly on standardized exams when i was in school.\n  ","408759":"\n  thank you, i really appreciate it. i'm still struggling to control it, and the urges are almost always there, but i've gotten a lot better over the past few weeks compared to the last year or so.\n  ","408760":"\n  i rarely get bored because i don't have enough free time to be bored, haha. my days are normally spent at work, and then after work i normally run some errands, go home and have dinner, shower, and sometimes i'll see a friend if it isn't too late. otherwise, i watch television for 30-60 minutes and go to bed.\n  ","408761":"\n  brush my teeth, wash my face and\/or put on a face mask, and shower.\n  ","408762":"\n  oh, to be young and naive again. especially to think that 21 is \"old,\" lmaoo.\n  ","408763":"\n  omg, i would be so excited. LOL. i get an hour lunch break at work & i would definitely introduce him to my coworkers (even though he's met a few of them already), and we would sit outside and have conversations with them for the hour. i'm close to three of my coworkers, so we would all chat and have a few laughs.\n  ","408764":"\n  my favorite food is sushi (especially spicy tuna rolls). my favorite drink is iced coffee.\n  ","408765":"\n  game of thrones winterfell music & ambiance ;\n  \n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_N-IREy7C9s\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","408766":"\n  which person are you talking about ??\n  ","408767":"\n  hi friends !!\n  \n  my inbox is empty so y'all should ask me some questions while i wait for my boyfriend to get out of work ~~\n  ","408768":"\n  i wish more people understood mental illness as a whole and how it's affected my life. sometimes others mistake my depression for laziness or my anxiety for an overbearing nature, and my BPD makes people think i'm inherently manipulative when i'm not.\n  ","408769":"\n  i actually find that social media has allowed people the freedom and opportunity to express themselves more. in the past, people's feelings were mostly stifled and it was almost taboo to talk about your feelings. however, it's easier now more than ever to express yourself and get feedback on what it is you're feeling.\n  ","408770":"\n  plagiarism, haha. one of my classmates accused me of plagiarism because apparently my term paper was so sophisticated that she didn't believe that i was the one who wrote it. luckily the professor had no issue with it and believed me when i told him that i did indeed write it.\n  ","408771":"\n  trying to overcome an addiction in order to save a relationship with someone i love.\n  ","408772":"\n  yeah, women in general are stigmatized based on a variety of factors, such as sex, gender, disability, sexual orientation, etc etc. it's more taboo, for example, for women to talk about sexual activity or express openness about their sexual behavior compared to men. there's also a lot of stigma regarding the social placement of women in the home and workforce, as many people still believe in traditional gender roles where women are \"supposed\" to be domestic housewives instead of a working class citizen.\n  ","408773":"\n  i'm somewhat of a materialistic person in that i value photographs greatly. my memory is poor, so often the photographs i take on trips and on other random occasions serve as a reminder of the good times i've had. losing those photos would be losing a part of my life, in a way.\n  ","408774":"\n  i really have no idea, LOL. hopefully a good impression -- i know i can be standoffish at times, but idk if that's people first impression of me or not. i've never asked anyone before.\n  ","408775":"\n  no, not everyone deserves a chance for forgiveness. and this may be an unpopular opinion, but i also believe that in a lot of cases, you're not obligated to forgive someone else, especially in the case of ab*se. if you don't want to forgive your ab*ser, then you shouldn't feel pressured to do so.\n  ","408776":"\n  ask needs to improve their reporting & blocking system. often when you report a question or account, it falls on deaf ears and the blocking system is pretty much useless.\n  ","408777":"\n  something low-key and rustic that's half-inside and half-outside, with only close family members and friends. there would be a band instead of a dj, and the color palette would be all earth tones.\n  ","408778":"\n  i have a tendency to hold grudges, but i've been trying to work on letting go. holding a grudge hurts yourself more than it hurts the other person, so it's pointless to hold a grudge.\n  ","408779":"\n  yes, absolutely. they're better company than humans in most cases.\n  ","408780":"\n  nah, i have too many mugs that i go through to have a specific one for coffee, lol. however, i usually choose my biggest mugs so they hold the most coffee.\n  ","408781":"\n  failure.\n  ","408782":"\n  i'm more of a realist than anything else. i would rather confront challenges and look at things from various perspectives to get a clear idea on it as opposed to having a pessimistic or optimistic outlook on things.\n  ","408783":"\n  it makes me nervous when i ask my friends to text me when they get home (like if we go out to a bar or restaurant together) & they never text me back. it makes me worry that something happened to them.\n  ","408784":"\n  i'd rather have an old phone with fast internet. i haven't upgraded my phone in three years anyway, lol.\n  ","408785":"\n  no, i can't fathom spending that much money on one piece of clothing or accessory.\n  ","408786":"\n  ?\ufe0f\u200d?

lmfao.\n  \n  no, i'm rarely lively or full of energy. quite frankly, i'm an exhausted pigeon.\n  ","408805":"\n  no, i seldom have an appetite. i only eat when i'm hungry most of the time, but sometimes i know i need to eat to keep my blood sugar up even if i'm not hungry.\n  ","408806":"\n  nah, i'm bisexual. not gay.\n  ","408807":"\n  uh, i have a boyfriend. lmao.\n  \n  but no, he didn't. he seldom does anything to anger me, and if anything, he calms me down when i'm raging and destructive.\n  ","408808":"\n  no, i don't typically ask anyone to do me favors at all.\n  ","408809":"\n  people have tried in the past, but it never worked in their favor.\n  ","408810":"\n  i slept for nine hours straight last night and woke up well rested, so i doubt it.\n  ","408811":"\n  i'm all right. i just got home from work and i'm in a bad mood (have been all day). i just want to sleep it off, but i also don't want to wake up in the morning.\n  ","408812":"\n  no, i rarely do that.\n  "}}
