Marriage?What is your thinking about marriage?
  ","
  Other people's validation. It's nice at times but you matter the most. You don't always need it.
  
  Marriage.. if with the right person, effort, same hopes and dreams, compatible s*xually,  isn't a loveless marriage. Understanding, knowing the person fully, the quirks, small and big things about eachother, dedication, working on it every day, actions over words, the same love languages would be a bonus. Communication.

  Sleeping with one person doesn't make you a wh*re

  Not using protection doesn't make you an awful person. It doesn't mean you wanted to be a parent either. (Also never mentioned if protected or not.. people can STILL get pregnant with taking precautions)
  
  Abortions and miscarriages are wicked different.
  
  Getting told you are pregnant when you aren't isnt cool. Nor is holding the past against someone.
  
  Being told you are ugly or whatever term is an opinion, not facts. Someone out there will love you regardless of looks.
  
  Hurt people hurt people.. need to stop that shit and love yourself instead of projecting everything onto someone that doesn't deserve that mistreatment.

   My brother's pregnant girlfriend was rushed to the hospital today. She fainted while at work. They've been their since about 11:30 this morning.

  ","
  Pasta?  If you mean money then that's not me, fam. I could careless if someone was rich or not. I wouldnt be with someone because of their society status. That dont impress me much. The actual physical person would.
  
  I'm not desperate nor am I throwing myself at every guy because of some ""biological clock"".  Some people aren't ready to have their own kids. Baby fever can be real but the responsibility would be a totally different story. Both the female and male should be ready for that type of commitment. I do want it but at the same time it can wait.. I'd rather know the person instead of just being all *bam pregnant * like that can wait.. ya know?

  They should ask for the help then? Not everyone knows what is going on in someone's life or how/what they need help with. People can be fu.cking stubborn too. Or in denial that they even need help.

  Would be nice. Both parties would need to be on the same page though.
  
  Healing any past hurts. Doesn't just need to be relationship wise. Understanding, compassion, knowing what you desire and deserve, trust, communication, chemistry, be open minded, don't settle, have self-love/care first, be selective in who you let in, the right intentions. Dont do it just because you are lonely. Learn about yourself and also the person you seek to be with. Stand up for yourself. Set boundaries. Take a leap of faith.

  Hello

452894,"
   Did you use to get advent calendars as a kid? What kind? Do you still get one for yourself? If not, what kind of advent calendar would make you change your mind? 🤔🎅
  ","
  I got the Christmas socks one last year :) makeup or other goodies would be cool.
  
  I rarely got the chocolate ones. Feel like the US doesn't do those as much???
  
  We have an old Avon calendar where you move the figurine to each day growing up. I was always in charge of moving it :)

   In light of new Government restrictions about alcohol being served in pubs, what do you personally class as a 'substantial meal'??

  I suppose vomit.
  
  I don't like blood

452902,"

  ","
  I'd block you if blocking system totally worked.
  "
452903,"
   How can I get a girl to love me ?
  ","
  Know what love is, love yourself first, not play with people's emotions and other dick-ish things. Common sense. Get to know them. Don't be selfish. Be yourself. Do nice things, for yourself as well. Treat them how you want to be treated. Have confidence with yourself.. don't be a cocky shit.
  "
452904,"
   What do you think is crucial for a good night's sleep?
  ","
  Actually sleeping.
  
  I like it dark and quiet. Ceiling fans don't bug me much though.

452906,"
   Is there something you remember from your childhood that no one else seems to remember? {examples: TV shows, commercials, toys / games, etc?}
  ","
  Nope. My sister and I watched the same shows.
  
  We had turkey and the brother-in-law wanted the wishbone which made us think of the show.
  "
452907,"
   Have you ever had a dream that seemed related to a future event? {example: When I was a kid, I had a dream where I found the headband that I'd lost. In the dream, I went downstairs to check this stack of stuff on my dad's counter. When I woke up, I looked there and sure enough IT WAS THERE}
  ","
  Yes. More so related to friends having kids and whatnot.
  "
452908,"

  "
452917,"
   Why do people insist that suffering is a choice when the reality of it is that it just comes naturally?

  ","
  Idk just do. Had a moment earlier while walking past the mirror and then was like fuck that 🤷🏼‍♀️
  
  Maybe count the good things you have going on (dont say none! :p )
  
  Count to a certain number before feeling better
  
  Breathe
  
  Know you can do better tomorrow
  
  Say nice things to yourself
  
  Imagine other people who have it ""worse"" and still keep their head up.
  
  Surrender those feelings to the Universe, god or whatever else you believe in
  
  Do a QUICK analysis of why you feel that way.. dont let it linger for too long. You can always change the attitude/mindset. Dont let one thing drag you down.
  
  Know change doesn't happen overnight
  
  Probably other ways but yes.. very circumstances based and individualized advice when it comes down to it.

   Have you or anyone you've ever known taken a 'hit' of Vodka straight through the eyeball instead of the mouth? 😮 If so, how did that work out? Not gonna lie, absolutely itching to try myself but the medical 'experts' all say big no, no 😫 so looking for honest feedback from regular people... 🙂

  What about a holiday in general? 😂
  
  Nah. I don't even know. I'm not focused on Christmas right now. I don't know what items I want yet or anything like that. I think of that stuff in November/December. I go for sentimental and practical gifts as well. Things I'd actually use and need at that time.

   Have you ever had a friendship that ended for of a stupid reason? What was that reason?
  ","
  Both moved but overall it was because she was boy crazy with her ex at the time and put him before anyone else. We connected again a few years ago. Everything is good with that now.
  
  One person I'm not really sure what happened. It seems like everything has to be about her and whenever she wants to reach out instead of being normal? Like I wrote a huge personal message to her and got nothing in return. She got engaged which is awesome, happy for her.. and she liked the congratulations I sent but still not talking to me or even replied to the message that I wrote. She was even in my dream last night before I got woke up.. not even sure what I dreamt besides that part where she was in it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I still consider her a friend but its def weird, ya know? She even checks my IG but yes.. radio silence type thing.
  "
455902,"
   Do you think a man is a less of a man if he cried at something
  ","
  No. Crying shouldn't be a weakness. Feel those emotions. It helps in the end.
  
  Should be a good balance. Wouldn't want someone that cries 24/7
