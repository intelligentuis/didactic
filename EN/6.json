And why aren't you dead!? *Reaper continues to wallop the leader of the anons with his scythe, not giving any f-cks that it's only dealing one hp worth of damage*\n  ","6774":"\n  Of course it hurt, she killed you *Reaper shakes his skull* Kiddo, do you remember anything about where you came from?\n  ","6775":"\n  What the f-ck!? *Reaper immediately starts stabbing you repeatedly with his scythe XD*\n  ","6776":"\n  *That question seemed to bother the Death God, he takes out his scythe and reaps the anon* ..\n  ","6777":"\n  A lady hit you, huh? That's all you remember?\n  \n  *Reaper with his terrible parenting skills trying to talk to a small child like Shino, this ought to be good lol*\n  ","6778":"\n  *Reaper facepalms lol* Yes kiddo I'm Death, that doesn't explain how you got here though..\n  ","6779":"\n  *Reaper honestly has no idea what to say at this point, being he's well the embodiment of Death itself, what can he say? It's not like he's in any position to give a lecture even if he wasn't the Grim Reaper his poor parenting skills make him not able to say anything, I mean he's locked up his children in a closet for a week straight* ..I think they should learn not to talk to every stranger they meet..\n  ","6780":"\n  I guess I can't really say anything when I kill for a living..I kill anons and humans when I'm p-ssed off.. just.. try not to kill kiddos like Shino next time..okay?\n  \n  *Should I ask why the mod was in a bad mood or..?*\n  ","6781":"\n  H-hey it's nothing Love, calm down, everything's fine..*Reaper was kind of surprised Geno could tell that easily that something bothered him*\n  \n  A-anyway.. what was I saying..? *\n  ","6782":"\n  *Nova just appearing like that had spooked Reaper and he gets defensive on instinct, spreading out his wings to cover Geno with his scythe appearing in his hands, he lowers the weapon when realizing it's Nova though* When did you get here?? And..that's really the only reason why you killed her?\n  ","6783":"\n  Uh..should I even ask why Nova murdered the kiddo?\n  ","6784":"\n  *Reaper completely ignores Genos question and just keeps nuzzling him* Forget about it, it doesn't matter right now, what does matter is your still here, you up for watching a movie or something?\n  ","6785":"\n  *Reaper just stays clinging onto Geno, nuzzling his skull into him* Unless you plan to leave on vacation..but you better bring me with you\n  ","6786":"\n  What? *Reaper was startled to see what looks like a little talking puff ball in his house and not even knowing what Death is* How do you not know what Death is? Your in Deaths house kiddo, what even are you??\n  ","6787":"\n  *Reaper just hugs his Tsundere, not letting go for even a moment and clinks his cheek repeatedly, he's being far more cuddly than usual which I didn't even think was possible* You better not ever leave me..\n  ","6788":"\n  ...*Reaper sighs, that seemed to work and he loosens the chains around Socket but not enough to where he's able to get free, just enough so that it's not choking the kiddo* ..Look, kiddo, I took you out reaping cause I was trying to fix the problem..I thought if you were out killing in a different way that it would make you not want to go around attacking your family and all her friends.. but it didn't work now did it?\n  ","6789":"\n  I..I don't know..I think he's okay but he's staying in bed for a while..just in case..\n  ","6790":"\n  That's besides the point..*Reaper sighs as he rests his skull on Genos hand* you nearly killed yourself doing it..\n  ","6791":"\n  I thought your name was Geno, not tired *Reaper chuckles a bit as he tried to joke with him* you know..you really shouldn't of done that..\n  ","6792":"\n  I can make this feel like a dream if you want~ *Reaper looks up at his Tsundere and gives him a wink*\n  \n  How you feel Love..? You okay?\n  ","6793":"\n  *Reaper was seen plopped in a chair with his skull laying at Genos bedside and blue magic chains were seen covering their door, he stayed up the whole night making sure nothing happened to Geno* Love..? Your awake?\n  ","6794":"\n  *Reaper blushed and smiled a bit before sitting at Genos bedside, keeping a close eye on his Tsundere, that honestly scared him seeing him nearly collapse like that*\n  \n  ..Geno.. you better not do anything like that again..\n  ","6795":"\n  You might get past Geno by saying that sh-t but not me.. I'm not as nice as he is..*Reaper then tightens the chains around Socket* I know your not capable of being friends with anybody, not even with yourself..\n  \n  *If Socket wasn't a complete psychopath I would feel bad for him XD*\n  ","6796":"\n  Let's just get you home..okay Love? *Reaper gives\n  \n   @LoserSkeleton95\n  \n  a glare before teleporting away with Geno back to their home in ReaperTale, once back he sets Geno in bed and places a plush beside him, it was a plush of Reaper holding a giant upside down heart with letters that spell out \"I love you Geno\" * I didn't get a chance to give you that yesterday..I think I dozed off before I could.. you look like you could use it right now\n  ","6797":"\n  *Good point XD poor Nova has a ghost haunting her for all eternity*\n  ","6798":"\n  ..Love..*Reaper then scoops Geno up in his arms and just nuzzles him, he was really worried about his Tsundere*..I don't wanna lose you either.. don't use that thing anymore..you hear me?\n  ","6799":"\n  *I can't tell whose more f-cked up Socket ot XChara xD*\n  \n  *Reaper then summons his blue magic imbued chains that wrap around Socket and pin him down* How about we watch this certain kiddo get his face smashed in?\n  ","6800":"\n  L-Love!? *Reaper crashes face first onto the ground but quickly gets himself up and rushes to Genos side* Hey, you okay? You didn't need to use that thing if it hurts you!\n  ","6801":"\n  *Reaper sighs in relief and just flops on the dragon with his eyes now closed* ..Thanks Love.. guess I can add flying dragon to the list of ways you saved my @$$ *he was half heartedly joking*\n  ","6802":"\n  SH-T! *Reaper quickly tries to bat his wings to catch himself from falling into the core but his wing snaps on him, causing him to plummet, I hope Geno doesn't end up dusting you Paps* ..F-CK!!\n  ","6803":"\n  Oh great..your here too? *Reaper sighs* remind me to keep myself awake next time..why are you here!?\n  ","6804":"\n  *Reaper stares up in utter shock at the blaster dragon, he's never seen Geno use that before and it honestly shocked the heII out of him* Love..? Since when can you..?\n  ","6805":"\n  Geno! *Reaper reaches a hand out for Geno as he squirms in Papyrus's arms, he doesn't want to dust him but it's getting very difficult for him not to do it especially when he just lost his scythe* Damn it..I don't even know, I got tired, passed out, woke up and this guy tries to rob me and your brother kidnaps me..\n  ","6806":"\n  *Oh sh-t not good!**Reaper might be without a scythe for a while* F-ck!! No!! How am I gonna explain this one!?\n  ","6807":"\n  Your that Papyrus that steals.. I thought we made up already!? Didn't we have a talk about how I was corrupted with Hatred? I've explained that's why I was \"causing trouble\" like you put it.. I thought we were past this!\n  ","6808":"\n  H-HEY!!! You can't just steal my scythe!! I'm the Grim f-cking Reaper!! *Reaper then summons his blue magic imbued chains to trip the snatcher and take back his scythe or at least try to*\n  ","6809":"\n  *Aw**Geno might need to hurry, Reaper isn't sure if he should reap Paps to get himself out of this situation or if he should he try something else, he knows Geno really cares about this Papyrus which is making it really difficult for the Death God to go through with reaping him*\n  ","6810":"\n  *Reaper throws his scythe at the Snatcher lol* What was that again!?\n  ","6811":"\n  *The Death God started regaining conciousness due to hearing Paps talking and Geno calling out his name and he just looks completely dumbfounded and confused seeing Papyrus carry him* W-what the heII..? Papyrus? Wait...your not my Paps..he's still in the hospital..who the f-ck are you..!?\n  ","6812":"\n  *OMFG that escalated quickly*\n  ","6813":"\n  *I'll answer on the third one Reaper is K.O'd currently so..*\n  ","6814":"\n  *Reaper however was seen laying unconscious on the ground, he's been pretty off lately, at least him and Paps won't have any problems if he's out cold*\n  ","6815":"\n  I would ask how you got here but I don't think you even know how you got here.. but..how are you doing that? *Reaper points to the books that are levitating around her head*\n  ","6816":"\n  *Reaper had gone from laughing to being upset within mere minutes upon being asked this question* .. .. I would ask..why he stayed with me..\n  ","6817":"\n  That isn't your fault though kiddo, it's not like you can control whatever they do, if the at jack@$$ is still after you, you tell me..I'll give him a reason to fear Death..\n  \n  *If you can't tell, Reaper really hates Cross and I honestly don't blame him*\n  ","6818":"\n  *Reaper immediately goes back to laughing at Cross lol*\n  \n  Can we all dress up like cows?\n  ","6819":"\n  Yeah, throw a literal cow at him! *Reaper then wipes his tears, he actually had tears from how much he was laughing at Cross, well it serves him right for making fun of Reaper with his fear of dolls*\n  ","6820":"\n  How's it your fault? You told me they're after you because of that king of theirs, King Wra I think? Didn't you say he wanted to eat you?\n  ","6821":"\n  *Reaper lits her up and sets her upright so she isn't rolling around like a actual ball lol* You need to go on a diet, you won't be getting away from bounty hunters like that\n  ","6822":"\n  Yeah turns out the so called multiverse destroyer is afraid of cows! We could of stopped the X events by throwing actual cows! *The Death God is legit laughing his butt off, Oof\n  \n   @CrossingOutNames\n  \n  get ready for revenge Cross XD you made fun of Reaper for his fear of dolls now its payback time!*\n  ","6823":"\n  *Poor Neo, the Death God just laughs* I thought you said that was all fur kiddo? Were you wrong?\n  ","6824":"\n  Don't worry Love, it's not a \"udder\" problem! Pfft! Hate to have you throw a cow! *Reaper can't stop himself from laughing and just hugs Geno* What looks like a cow and is afraid of his own kind? Cross!\n  ","6825":"\n  H-hey Love! Snrk! *Reaper tries to calm his laughter but seeing Cross afraid of cows of all things was hilarious, he can't say sh-t about Reapers fear of dolls now*\n  ","6826":"\n  *That got Reaper to burst into laughter and he ends up accidentally falling off the bed and knocking into poor Geno, so the Tsundere falls out of his chair and lands on top of the laughing God*\n  ","6827":"\n  *Reaper just noticed he was hugging Genos arm and a bright blue blush spreads across his skull lol* Uh..wait..what happened yesterday? How'd..? *he then looks up at the still sound asleep Geno and can't help but smile* I'm guessing you took us back home, huh Love? What would we do without you? *probably die XD*\n  ","6828":"\n  That doesn't explain why your here..*Reaper doesn't trust the guy but he does feel bad for what he's went through*\n  ","6829":"\n  *Reaper then leans back against Geno with his eyes now closed* I'm starting to see why everyone hates anons.. but thanks for that Love.. you know, I really do Love you no matter what happens\n  ","6830":"\n  ..How's this for a answer? *Reaper then summons his scythe and flat out reaps you though afterwards he winces and sets down his scythe, gripping at his shoulder* it's just a wing..damn it..\n  ","6831":"\n  ..Why the f-ck are you here? Just to annoy us on Valentines day? *Reaper gives a glare at the Snatcher* For someone named \"Snatcher\" I don't think your snatching any love either..\n  ","6832":"\n  *Reaper just sighs with a hand resting on his skull* Look, it's okay, this wasn't your fault.. I behaved the same way when I had Hatred.. and I'm still sorry I attacked you when I had it..but I really couldn't control myself..the only thing that went through my mind were these voices telling me what to do.. I just wish your boyfriend would get past it already..\n  ","6833":"\n  *Reaper just looks unbelievably confused, he isn't exactly used to receiving presents being well, the Grim Reaper* Uh.. okay... thanks..? I guess..um.. I'll just give these to Geno and the kiddos..\n  ","6834":"\n  *Oh.. :v well everything needed censored then lol Reapers too graphic as is anyway XD*\n  ","6835":"\n  *Reaper just looks beyond confused* ...A what?\n  ","6836":"\n  *They don't mean the same thing? :< *\n  ","6837":"\n  Aw.. you embarrassed Love?~ *Reaper then clinks his teeth* Your being a strawberry again~ But I won't tell anyone about it this time~\n  \n  *The proceeding events have been censored for the sake of everyone's sanity, a couple hours later the Death God was hugging his Tsundere* I love you~\n  ","6838":"\n  Oh..right.. I should probably do that now before I forget *Reaper sets Geno down on the bed full of plushies so he can lock the door, most people would have used flowers to decorate the bed for Valentines..Reaper used his mass collection of Geno stuffed animals.. I don't know if that's cute or disturbing..maybe both*\n  \n  And I won't tell anyone this time if you really don't want me to~\n  ","6839":"\n  *Reaper can't help but laugh* Now that's the Geno I'm used to, the strawberry glitch bunny~ *he then scoops Geno up in his arms and takes him to their room where he sees over a dozen plushies of himself covering their bed, yeah that's totally normal..seeing your husband have millions of plushies of you*\n  \n  I was thinking..maybe.. you'd like to have fun?~\n  ","6840":"\n  ..I... I think he has more than just my tongue..~ *Reaper shoots back in a attempt to turn the tables so Genos the one blushing lol*\n  ","6841":"\n  *Geno does manage to fluster the Death God, not only does his skull turn blue but he even starts fumbling with the strings dangling off his robe, if anything he was expecting Geno to be annoyed with the decorations then Reaper would swoop in and start flirting with him, well that's how he thought it would go lol* I-I ..uh.. I love you too Love..um.. *he was actually at a loss for words*\n  ","6842":"\n  *I didn't even recognize it was you XD the eyes are so perfect, like you drew perfect anime eyes! I thought you were someone else until saw the hashtag, your very good at drawing humans girl :0*\n  ","6843":"\n  *Reaper hands Geno the flowers before getting himself up* Maybe it's better if you don't remember.. when I got there, the only person in the room with you was a anon..so I figured they were behind it..\n  \n  Anyway, I spent the last few days planning stuff for us to do today so..*he then opens the door to the living room which was entirely decked out in Valentines decorations, paper hearts dangling from the ceiling, fake rose petals covering the floor and several huge stuffed animals filling the entire room, no wonder he was knocked out, there was a giant stuffed bear almost blocking the entrance to their house*\n  ","6844":"\n  *Reaper was surprised to hear a sudden knock on their door and goes over to answer it*\n  \n  Who is it?\n  ","6845":"\n  *Reapers eyes flick open after he heard Geno and he starts scrambling to his feet with a bright blue blush appearing on his skull out of embarrassment* Dah--I-I uh..this wasn't how I was picturing today to start off.. I might of but uh.. *he then holds up the bouquet of Life flowers* H-Happy Valentines day Love, I would of got you normal flowers but..I tend to kill them, you uh..doing okay?\n  ","6846":"\n  *Reaper had actually dozed off while waiting on Geno to wake up, it was the next day by the time he was up and the Death God was seen laying on the floor with one foot sticking straight up against the chair he was previously sitting in and he appeared to be drooling with a bouquet of flowers in his hands, hard to believe that's the Grim Reaper isn't it? Lol*\n  ","6847":"\n  *Aw**Reaper then clinks Genos cheek* I'll be waiting right here until you wake up.. you can't see anywhere to go without the light..\n  ","6848":"\n  Love..*Reaper can't help but place his hand ontop of Genos and give a faint smile though nobody was around to see it* ..heh.. you know..I know you can't hear me but.. your the only person I'd be happy to walk through heII with.. it might sound \"cheesy\" but I guess that makes me a cheese lover.. your what lights up my day..and I hope you can wake up and light it for me again..\n  ","6849":"\n  Geno?? *Reaper was relieved he had some sort of sign he was still alive though and just rests his skull beside Genos as he sat in a chair by his bedside* ..You really know how to scare people to Death..you know that?\n  ","6850":"\n  I'll take that as you don't believe I'm a idiot anymore~ *Reaper says in a teasing voice just to irritate Error before he leaves*\n  ","6851":"\n  I still kill them if I feel like they'll cause trouble..*Reaper then mumbles a bit to himself out of anger* at least we can agree on killing them..\n  ","6852":"\n  *Reaper was surprised to see Error and even jumps back a bit due to being startled* I didn't LET it happen! I didn't even know about it until Geno texted me..I just left the house for a few minutes and that happens..\n  ","6853":"\n  *Reaper is already on it like Donkey Kong lol*\n  ","6854":"\n  Uh..given how mad he is with me right now.. I can only imagine..\n  ","6855":"\n  *Reaper is currently just flopped on the ground outside their house* I really don't know.. I could probably head back to reaping.. or check on Asgore..\n  ","6856":"\n  ...A couple centuries maybe? The only time I've really gotten any sleep in is when I married Geno, I had a good excuse to stop reaping as often and actually got a few breaks in here and there\n  \n  I used to be forced to reap until I dropped\n  ","6857":"\n  *Omg XD that fits!*\n  \n  *Reaper looks embarrassed and folds his arms, looking away from you* I-I already have something planned for tomorrow thank you very much! But maybe a poem isn't a bad idea..not that one..\n  ","6858":"\n  So if I do this *Reaper then pokes her on the side to roll her over lol* you'll be able to get back up kiddo? It is just fur, right?\n  ","6859":"\n  *Reaper just nuzzles Geno* Hey, I'm sure he's fine Love\n  \n  *Truthfully he's worried too since the only time Reapers ever been sick is due to his magic failing him, so something must of happened in Underlust*\n  \n  Just give him a few minutes of sleep and he'll be back to normal\n  ","6860":"\n  Hey, I'm sure he'll be fine Love but if your that worried I'll stay with you\n  \n  *Reaper then wraps a arm around Geno* not sure how he got sick in the first place since he is a reaper but..\n  ","6861":"\n  I wonder if that's why everyone left you alone in Underlust, you look like a walking beach ball *Reaper chuckles to himself poor Neo XD she's still cute though*\n  ","6862":"\n  *Reaper gives you a glare* Oh shut up anons, he didn't kick me out and everything is fine now\n  ","6863":"\n  Well when he wakes up we can ask him but until then *Reaper then clinks Genos cheek* how about me and you just relax and watch some TV or something?\n  ","6864":"\n  Sorry Love..*Reaper then lays his skull on top of Genos* maybe nothing happened.. Gothy didn't call us or anything so..\n  ","6865":"\n  *Well booting Reaper out of the house for a while would definitely make it clear this was a huge f-ck up though Reaper doesn't want to leave Genos side and will try to stay by him*\n  \n  *he continues to hug his Tsundere and tries to calm him down, laying his skull on Geno's shoulder* Hey, Love, it's okay, we can figure this out, you don't need to get too worked up..I thought for sure he would call if anything went wrong though..\n  ","6866":"\n  I thought he did.. he's always on it talking to that friend of his, Palette I think?\n  ","6867":"\n  ..Hey, Love? *Reaper grabs a hold of Genos clenched fist* sorry I sent him there..I just thought it was a good way to scare him, I didn't think about anything else..\n  ","6868":"\n  That..probably wasn't one of my better ideas now that I think about it..*Reaper then rubs the back of his skull* I was only trying to scare Gothy though.. I figured if anything went wrong he would call one of us.. I would reap anyone that tried to harm him or Geno\n  ","6869":"\n  *Reaper is very surprised* Love? Hey, I know your mad at me and you have good reason to be but I know you don't really want me to leave, how about we kiss and make up?\n  ","6870":"\n  *Reaper shakes his skull as he gets back up* You know normally I like when you hit on me~ But I don't like when your this mad at me, Love, you know I wouldn't let anything  happen to Gothy *he then wraps his arms around Geno* besides if anything went wrong he would of called us\n  ","6871":"\n  *Which doesn't help Reapers case..at all, he's practically digging his own grave at this point*\n  ","6872":"\n  Hey, nothing can happen within a couple of days, besides he was hiding out in a dumpster, what could of happened? *Just hand him a shovel lol*\n  ","6873":"\n  Hiding from what..? *Reaper tilts his skull slightly* I get why Gothy was there hiding out but I don't think anyone in Underlust would bother a tiny alien, honestly you look more like a baseball than a alien now\n  ","6874":"\n  *Reaper was very surprised as he gets lifted up, he was honestly not expecting that* Hey, calm down Love, I'm sure nothing happened it's only been a couple days\n  \n  *Oof for his sake I hope nothing happened*\n  ","6875":"\n  *Reaper sweats a bit since he knows mama Geno is p-ssed*\n  \n  Have I told you how cute you look when your angry?\n  ","6876":"\n  I sent him to Underlust to give him a scare, didn't expect him to be playing around in a dumpster *Reaper shrugs* he should be fine besides his clothes being dirty\n  ","6877":"\n  *If Reaper were drinking coffee right now he would have done a spit take* I didn't know aliens could be cannibals.. how the heII..?\n  ","6878":"\n  ..He's just covered in dirt, he'll be fine after we get him cleaned up anyway, now to get back to my Love~\n  ","6879":"\n  I don't really pay any attention to kiddos..*Really Reaper?

Better not be my cookies..\n  ","6880":"\n  *Reaper just noticed poor Neo lol* Hey..mind telling me what you both were doing inside a dumpster?\n  ","6881":"\n  ...*Reaper then takes his scythe and reaps the anon--hey! Why'd you reap them?*\n  \n  You want reaped too mod?\n  \n  *..Nevermind..*\n  ","6882":"\n\n   @DontcallmeSans\n  \n  I thought it was Love at first sight, who else do I call Love?~\n  \n  *That joke was awful*\n  ","6883":"\n  Uh..to timeout? *Reaper sweats a bit once seeing the rolling pin lol* I'm pretty sure rolling pins are used for baking pies and not for hitting skeletons..unless you were Geno then I wouldn't mind you hitting on me\n  ","6884":"\n  But did he say which kids? *BAD Reaper!* You too mod? Come on, he deserved a little scare..\n  \n  *but you didn't just scare him..you sent him to UNDERLUST*\n  \n  He needed some sort of punishment\n  ","6885":"\n  *Reaper then clinks Genos cheek* You know your really cute when your angry~ Anyway, you just stay in bed a while okay Love? You made sure I got some rest now it's my turn to make sure you do\n  ","6886":"\n  ..Not even a little? *Reaper says it as  if it's a joke but he was honestly serious*\n  ","6887":"\n\n   @DontcallmeSans\n  \n","6888":"\n  *Reaper sits on the bed beside Geno and wraps a arm around him* you want me to talk with the kiddos?

O-okay.. I guess.. I can rest for a bit.. I-I mean..I'm not gonna say no if you want me to stay..\n  ","6913":"\n  ..I ran off somewhere..?? ..*it then clicks* Oh.. sh-t.. that's right.. I was supposed to be reaping.. ..wasn't I..? *Reaper then tries to push himself up into a sitting position but Genos hand just resting on top of him was enough to keep him down, he had zero strength right now* ngh..!\n  ","6914":"\n  ..L-Love..??

I'm having to go around reaping them all over again.. Life decided to revive everyone.. she knows what she did was wrong though.. and allowed me to do my job and reap them.. and you didn't answer if you were okay or not..\n  ","6941":"\n  What about it?

That's not okay you were attacked..what timeline were you even in..?\n  \n  ..I thought you abandoned ReaperTale..\n  ","6943":"\n  Asgore..?? *Reapers lone eye widens as he really didn't expect Asgore to come back, he pauses in the middle of his reaping and lowers his scythe*..wait what happened to you??\n  ","6944":"\n  That's a nice offer but while I'm away, I'm gonna need someone to watch Geno and our kiddos, think you could do that for me? It's better if he has a close friend of his staying with him\n  \n  *Reaper gives a soft smile*\n  ","6945":"\n  *Reaper just pulls Genos chin up to his and clinks his teeth* Don't worry about it Love.. Death follows you wherever you go..remember? I'll still be with you\n  \n  *The Death God then lets go of his Tsundere and gets up with his scythe in his hand* I have a skeleton of work to do..

I'm not sure.. I can reap all the monsters and humans from Lifes garden again with no problem but the monsters and humans from the Underworld.. they're a different story.. I don't know how well that's gonna go..I might be gone a while.. ..\n  ","6948":"\n  *Reaper then pulls Geno into a hug*\n  \n  I needed to talk to you.. Life undid all the work I did..basically every Soul that me or my bro have reaped... is actually alive now like everyone said.. which is really bad Love.. this could really f-ck up everything..\n  ","6949":"\n  *Reaper then sets Geno down on their bed and clinks his cheek* I'm gonna go talk to Life, you wait here and keep looking like the adorable strawberry bunny I know you are~ I love you Geno~ *he says shortly before teleporting away*\n  ","6950":"\n  Yeah..I kinda thought I was dreaming..*Reaper rubs the back of his skull* I'm still not sure this isn't some kind of dream.. it still kinda seems..unreal.. are you really here right now?\n  ","6951":"\n  Y-yeah.. I know it's not a dream now so.. *Reapers face was now a dark blue color as he felt embarrassed about his actions* ..um.. sorry about..earlier.. I really thought I was dust so..I mean.. it just..seemed too good to be true to hear you were fine and that neither one of us were dust..\n  ","6952":"\n  Uh..*Reaper then puts his robe back one and quickly goes to Genos side, scooping up his Tsundere in his arms* How about you let me handle this?\n  ","6953":"\n  Wait... ..Nova..?? Why the heII would--this..isn't a dream..is it? There's no way you would be in here.. but that means.. Life really..?\n  \n  *Yeah and you ripped Genos pants off in front of numerous people..*\n  ","6954":"\n  OOF!! *Reaper wasn't expecting that but he pokes his skull back up over the side of the bed after being tossed overboard lol* You know I find it so hot when you play hard to get~ My adorable strawberry bunny~\n  \n  *What's worse is he's trying to make love with Geno in front of about 10 people lol*\n  \n  You know you want me~\n  ","6955":"\n  *I didn't even see that post*\n  \n  *Reaper then rips off his robe and tackles Geno back onto the bed OMG* Let's make lots of babies first~\n  ","6956":"\n  ..That just proves we're both either dead or in a dream right now..so there's nothing to worry about Love~ or well, my dream Love, your not really here right now.. otherwise you would still be probably smacking me for trying to have fun time in front of everybody.. and there's no way you wouldn't be in any pain right now either..even if I wish it were true that you weren't.. also I know me and Life don't get along that well anymore but I can tell you, I know she wouldn't break the rules like that under any circumstances.. bringing back all the Souls of the dead in any timeline especially ReaperTale is forbidden.. it screws up the balance of Life and Death and f-cks up the balance of the entire multiverse..\n  \n  ...Your pants are still down by the way~\n  ","6957":"\n  *The Death God looks a bit startled as he was suddenly hugged though he pats the Wendigo on the head in return* Hey kiddo, wonder why your in my dream right now..\n  \n  *Reaper believes he's either still asleep or in some purgatory state, he doesn't believe he's talking to the real Wendy or Geno or anyone there right now as he finds it that unbelievable that his family is okay and that it was due to Life breaking the rules of ReaperTale*\n  ","6958":"\n  ..Okay..this confirms I'm dreaming.. there's no way this is happening..\n  \n  *Reaper then sits on the ground and folds his arms, refusing to move*\n  \n  ..I'm not doing anything, I don't believe any of this is real, I don't believe your here, I don't believe Life would break the rules like that and for the record, the only person I would let inside of me is Geno! If anyone's gonna enjoy anything, it'll be me, making love to the Love of my life.. you can go away now\n  ","6959":"\n  *Reaper was honestly shocked to see Ver appear in his home, it scared the God enough that he fell off of Geno* W-what the heII..!? How and why are you here..!?\n  ","6960":"\n  ..Nah that can't be happening..that proves this is a dream, your not really here, your in my head, I probably dusted or I'm still asleep, either way it also means I could do this without any consequences! *Reaper then tackles\n  \n   @DontcallmeSans\n  \n  to the bed and starts pulling off his pants RIGHT in front of Chara OMG REAPER NO*\n  ","6961":"\n  ..If I remember right..I was starting to dust when these came out.. *Reaper taps on the IV stand which he still has connected to his Soul* So I guess I dusted.. that would kinda explain everything.. but I don't get why I would have this still stuck to me..if I'm dead and this is my fantasy world.. shouldn't you be dressed as a angel? Or maybe a nurse?\n  ","6962":"\n  ..Your right..my dreams don't usually go like this.. I usually have you tied up in a chair on the beach wearing a maids dress and angel wings ..unless. this is the one where it's reversed and your the one tying me up to a chair..*What the f-ck Reaper!?*\n  ","6963":"\n  *Reaper then gets up out of bed to check himself and there was a large amount of dust seen covering his robe..*\n  \n  ..Well, maybe I did die and were both in my head right now.. but your not wearing a nurse's outfit ..or at least not yet~\n  ","6964":"\n  ..Your not dead..are you? *Reaper immediately jumps to the worst case scenario*..Or did I die??\n  ","6965":"\n  ..Did something happen while I was out? *Reaper honestly looks completely confused though his confusion is soon replaced with worry when he remembers how bad of condition Geno was in prior to this* ..Are you okay..!? Should you even be up right now!?\n  ","6966":"\n  ..Are you drunk anon..? *Reaper rubs his eye sockets as he sits up in bed, looking around the room*..Wheres..Geno..??\n  ","6967":"\n  *Reaper would freak the heII out if Geno had even attempted to share magic with him especially when he's still running low on it.. although the Death God seemed to be doing no better since..in that brief moment of time.. after Geno had gotten Reaper set back in bed..he may discover his hands were covered in a dust like powder.. Reaper would have died right then and there without the IVs supporting him*..\n  \n  *I warned that these pranks could go badly especially when pulled on someone who is recovering..*\n  ","6968":"\n  ... *Reaper was seen laying completely unresponsive on the floor with his IVs disconnected..this didn't seem good.. as karma for causing this to happen, the anon gets mauled by all 20 of the blaster beasts, they honestly deserved it >:v*\n  ","6969":"\n  *Reaper was trying to prevent Geno from hurting himself and he ended up being the one to hurt him on accident by cuffing him..he's going to feel horrible when he gets himself together..or if he gets himself together, the Death God let's out a pained groan as he laid on the floor gripping at his chest, he may have gotten hurt*..\n  ","6970":"\n  *Reaper starts screaming bl\u0153dy murder as he falls off the bed knocking over his 2 IV stands in the process*\n  \n  *You really had to do that?*\n  ","6971":"\n  *Reaper shakes his skull* I'll be fine..and even if I'm not, you need to stay in bed a while.. if you still manage to leave bed.. I'll get the God of Magic involved..\n  \n  He can seal away your magic so your not able to use it..\n  ","6972":"\n  Oh, I'm still using chains *Reaper points down to the magic chains still wrapped around Genos torso although they have a few cracks running through them* but just in case they give out..those handcuffs work too.. kinda glad I held onto them..\n  ","6973":"\n  Remember the time we pretended to be a officer and prisoner? I sort of kept the handcuffs from that..just in case we ever decided to try something like that again~\n  ","6974":"\n  ..*Reaper sighs in relief* Good.. to make sure you stay put.. *he pulls out a set of handcuffs from his robe and actually handcuffs Geno to the bed which doesn't seem necessary when he still has Geno being pinned down by chains..and the fact he could teleport out of the cuffs*\n  ","6975":"\n  ..Whatever happens..just stay in bed.. i know your worried about me but.. I'm more worried about you.. i don't want to lose you Love..\n  ","6976":"\n  *Reaper just gives a slight nod* ..You didn't even know I was still in the room with you.. ..heII you didn't even know you were IN a room.. Life even stayed the night to keep a eye on you.. and your Gaster sent extra blaster beasts.. we have like 20 of them here now..

I'll be back in a few minutes Love~\n  \n  *you sure that's a good idea?*\n  ","7168":"\n  It's just a human?

I still don't know how Bill found out about it..or how a anon found out and told you..  I've never told anyone cause..I was taught not to.. *he then holds Genos hand* ..\n  ","7184":"\n  .. ..W-well.. it would be kind of hard getting to know someone as terrifying as the Grim Reaper..*Reaper makes a small smile through his tears before resting his skull against Genos in return* I'm still surprised you weren't afraid to look Death in the eyes and tell him off..\n  ","7185":"\n  ..*Reaper was honestly shocked, he looked over at\n  \n   @DontcallmeSans\n  \n  for a moment* Did..did you tell everyone about my brithday..? I..I don't even know how anyone found out..I kept it secret.. cause I was taught ..that you shouldn't celebrate mine..being..well.. I stand for Death.. and Death isn't exactly something you should celebrate or want to celebrate.. ..Gaster told me that.. he said it would just make everyone angry and spiteful if they were forced to celebrate something so.. awful.. I just..I really don't know what to say here.. *he pulls down his hood as he went from just having tears to full on sobbing* ..\n  ","7186":"\n  *Yeah that was because someone told Life that Reaper corrupted Chara that day, otherwise Genos birthday would have went much better than that, Reaper usually makes sure that Geno has a good birthday*\n  \n  *Reaper then buries his skull into Geno* ..You know..it's kinda ironic.. your the only person that doesn't hate Death..\n  ","7187":"\n  *Reaper gets back on his \"feet\" and pulls Geno into a tight hug* I-I can't help it.. that's just.. the nicest thing anyone's ever d-done for me on my birthday..\n  \n  *That's..pretty sad actually..*\n  \n  But more than that..I'm happy your okay.. you scared me half to..well..me ..\n  ","7188":"\n  *Aw**That honestly made the Death God start to cry, there were tears just streaming down his eye sockets while he stared up at Geno*.. L-Love..\n  \n  *I've done the same to Geno so--lol*\n  ","7189":"\n  *Reaper immediately pushes himself up into a seated position after he hears Geno lol at least nothing actually happened* L-Love..!? N-nothing.. happened..? Your okay?? *he doesn't notice the coffee just yet as he's still a bit panicked*\n  ","7190":"\n  *Reaper immediately starts flipping out as soon as he realizes Genos gone even falling out of bed due to panic* Oof!

It's really cute cX*\n  ","7196":"\n  Huh..so your basically saying your really in another dimension but your mindscape allows you to communicate and interact with people outside your dimension? And I don't think you can top the Underworld.. that's pretty much the worst place you can end up in..\n  ","7197":"\n  ..I know I'm asking a lot but... I don't think ..I can walk..or float right now.. I might need some help..*Reaper then lays his skull against Genos shoulder*\n  ","7198":"\n  *Yeah Reaper would usually take any chance to flirt with Geno XD I could just imagine if he got added in Underverse, he would be busy flirting with Geno while Cross was killing other Sans*\n  \n  *Meanwhile Reaper just stays laying against Geno with his arms draped over his shoulders* ..Love..?\n  ","7199":"\n  That would be nice ..*I'm surprised he didn't take that chance to flirt with Geno, instead all he's doing is laying against him*\n  ","7200":"\n  *Reaper then drapes his arms over Genos shoulders* You better not..we made a promise for that too..remember? Til Death do us part.. I never gave the okay to split up\n  ","7201":"\n  ..Love..*Reaper sighs* ...yeah... I know.. I did say that.. and technically I haven't left the house, Bill just barged in and..*he then leans against Geno* I do need you right now..\n  ","7202":"\n  I'm the God of Death so yeah I do and I believe I can kick his a$$ before he gets the chance to do anything..\n  ","7203":"\n  Can you also explain why my scythe had no affect on him?\n  ","7204":"\n  Okay..now I get why he constantly makes deals..so unless someone strikes a deal with him, he's harmless?\n  ","7205":"\n  So a place thats basically like the Underworld..? And..your saying our minds connect to it..so you can see us and we can see you but you can't harm us and we can't harm you, right? *I don't think Reaper is fully understanding it*\n  ","7206":"\n  Better question..why the f-ck are you asking me that?\n  ","7207":"\n  Remind me what the mindscape is again..?\n  \n  Not only me but my mod forgot about it too..\n  ","7208":"\n  What the f-ck..? *Reaper pauses seeing his scythe somehow not being able to affect Bill* How..!?\n  ","7209":"\n  ...*Reaper is now p-ssed and summons his scythe, swinging it at Bill which is probably a bad idea* How about you get the f-ck out before I destroy you like the rest of the ancient pyramids!\n  ","7210":"\n  ..*Reaper honestly looks confused* Not really..I mean.. I've never celebrated it..since.. you know.. Death is a horrible thing that nobody wants anything to do with.. and being the Grim Reaper, the guy everyone holds responsible for all the death in the world.. why would anyone want to do anything for his birthday? At least that's what I was taught..if anything I'll just end up with a angry mob after me..thanks for the happy birthday though..that's..the first time anyone's ever said that to me..*Reaper blushed slightly*\n  ","7211":"\n  Hey, I'll be fine..

You can't kill Death besides it's the least I can do to repay you\n  ","7212":"\n  *That shocked Reaper, he stares up at Geno with his lone eye wide* How did you find out--?\n  ","7213":"\n  ...I don't know what to say here..*Reaper was definitely not expecting a anon to do that for them after the sh-tty morning they've had so far, he was honestly speechless*\n  ","7214":"\n  ..My offer still stands for scaring them to Death\n  \n  *Will admittedly is cute unlike Bill*\n  ","7215":"\n  H-huh? When did you get here? *Reaper looks up at Will with a surprised look on his face* but I could of been better.. how about you?\n  ","7216":"\n  *Reaper spreads out his wings and covers himself and Geno with them to avoid being sprayed with water* ...Figures.. ..Love..? Can you help me up..?\n  \n   @DontcallmeSans\n  \n","7217":"\n  ..*Reaper then looks up with a eye socket slightly open* ..just him being here with me is plenty..
