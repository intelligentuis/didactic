i listen to my family , geno was just worried but i told him there s nothing to worry about and he trusts me . . um . . you allowed socket to wield a scythe that s just nevermind","6131":"not bad but it doesn t look like you have any tricks to use , what if one spotted you ? try this . . reaper then picks up a rock and chucks it , hitting one of the monsters in the back of their heads and when they come towards reapers direction to investigate , the god hides behind a pillar and pops out to reap them","6132":"your pretty good kiddo . . which is concerning but watch this reaper then summons a few chains dangling from the ceiling in front of a couple monsters , it confused them for a few minutes but in those minutes , reaper sneaks behind them and swings his scythe , nailing both of them in one shot think you can top that ?","6133":"knowing socket he would probably nail reaper when his guard is down . . geno told him this was a bad idea and he didn t listen reaper then heads out with the literal tiny monster and teleports them both to the underworld okay . . these guys don t know they re alive right now so it should be easy to reap their souls , all we gotta do is sneak up on them and strike them , think you can handle it ?","6134":"reaper doesn t seem to know how to respond with geno being brought up . . does he honestly think geno would be happy without him after all they ve been through together ?

tbh i m shocked socket didn t murder you on that trip . .","6143":". . did reaping help at all ? reaper was genuinely curious if reaping was a better alternative for him or not , he might hate socket but he knows it wasn t totally his fault for how he turned out and the fact that allura loves him despite all the sh t he s caused and that she s a very close friend to geno , makes him willing to try and help him","6144":"reaper just sighs in relief and lays his skull on top of genos good . . and . . i m sorry about how i treated the kiddos . . i just went with what i know . . those punishments are the same things my gasters done to me and i just thought it was normal . . you say it s not and that it s considered ab se and everyone else says it too , even smacking me with rolling pins over it . . but that s all i know to go off of with the whole parenting thing . . . . . i might hate my gaster for all the stuff he s done but he did get me to behave when i was younger . . i was too afraid to do anything around him . . reaper need to quit being stubborn and read those books opal keep throwing at him","6145":". . reaper just sighs listen kiddo . . alphys might have f cked up but you can fix it , look at me , i m supposed to be this cold hearted killer but i found geno and even started a family with him , if death itself can do it , maybe you can too . . you just need to find something to do instead of murdering everybody . .","6146":"i m not even gonna ask when you got here . . but heii , i was made in a similar way , guess that means i shouldn t exist either . . that s actually true , reaper and painless were both made by gaster just so the other gods wouldn t have to be the ones responsible for reaping souls , they re all capable of picking up a scythe and running off reaping , even geno could do it if reaper loaned him his scythe , they all just don t want to , it s immoral for them to do it so they created reaper and hate him for what he was created for , irony","6147":"kiddo , the difference is . . i don t like all the carnage , i don t even like reaping . . but i do it cause i was made to . . i don t know how to do anything else . . reaper then looks away you weren t made to be a killer were you ?","6148":"b but a anon said you aren t hurt . . ?

what s he planning to use that for or you didn t pay attention to that part either ? that means they would need reaper , his hourglass isn t functional on it s own , it s like inks paintbrush , it only works when ink has it since it s powered by his magic , reapers hourglass is powered by his magic , on it s own it s just a normal hourglass , good luck getting him to co operate though","6191":"i m gonna give them trouble in a minute . . reaper then summons his scythe they picked a fight to the death . .","6192":"okay what the f ck anon ! ?
