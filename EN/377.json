on social media to post about s*icide prevention, mental health awareness, and advocacy, ideally this should be *every* day. i'm thankful that there are such strong individuals sharing their stories; however, we need to face the facts.\n  \n  -- 800,000 people d*e by s*icide worldwide each year\n  \n  -- s*icide is the second leading cause of de*th for 15-24 year olds\n  \n  -- lgbt youth are 3x more likely to attempt, compared to youth who are straight\n  \n  -- black, latino, native american, and asian people who are lgbt attempt at *much* higher rates\n  \n  -- s*icide is 4x higher in men than women, and this is largely due to toxic masculinity and the de-emphasis of mental health awareness in men\n  \n  in addition, mental health advocacy and s*icide prevention isn't *solely* about raising awareness of stigma and various disorders. we also need to enact affordable, accessible behavioral health care. there are so many people who struggle because they cannot get help, whether it's because they do not have access to care or they cannot financially afford care. this has to end.\n  \n  s*icidal ideation does not discriminate, it holds no prejudices, and it can afflict anyone.

all.\n  ","404587":"\n  it doesn't matter if the younger person seeks the older person out. it matters that the older person doesn't have the sense to deny that younger person's advances, considering

should do? im embarrassed to tell him now.\n  \n  --\n  \n  honestly ... it's best to be totally honest with him, especially if you two are becoming close and you see this going further (whether in a friendship way or otherwise). explain to him how you were feeling and that you were insecure with yourself, and you felt the need to make yourself more interesting to capture his attention. that maybe he wouldn't have been as interested in you if you were just being yourself. it's important that you do apologize and tell him that you know what you did was dishonest, but you don't want this to change his opinion of you.\n  \n  i understand your fear, though. i would feel the same way if i was in that situation, but if i'm thinking about it from his perspective ... if you explained the reasoning behind your actions and acknowledged that they were wrong, i don't see why he wouldn't give you another chance at furthering the friendship.\n  ","404598":"\n  no, bullying is generally very harmful towards children and decreases self-esteem and confidence levels. it teaches children that they're \"not good enough\" or that they should conform to societal or gender norms just to fit in with everyone else. efforts toward self-improvement come from a place of understanding your own boundaries and being motivated to be better for yourself, not for the benefit of others.\n

since i started smoking at the age of 17, lol.\n  \n  it's been almost 11 years that i've been smoking. i can feel the effects of it on me already, and it's only going to get worse with time. i also don't like the fact that my boyfriend can smell smoke on me, which means so can other people, and i think it's inconsiderate.\n  ","404605":"\n  cigarettes are really unhealthy, and even though i do enjoy smoking, i want to see if i can move into the new house and be smoke-free. kinda like a fresh start.\n  ","404606":"\n  so i think i'm going to try to quit cigarettes completely. i smoked the rest of my last pack around noon, and it's currently 5:00pm & i haven't had a cigarette.\n  \n  however, i *am* vaping every 2 hours or so. i know vaping isn't very healthy either especially with all

emptiness since i was a teenager.\n  \n  and no, my boyfriend and i are still together.\n  ","404611":"\n  most religion is corrupt in my opinion, not just christianity. most religions except maybe for eastern philosophies are pretty intolerant, and those following those scriptures usually interpret things according to their own benefit.\n  ","404612":"\n  yes, i wholeheartedly agree. i know people who have turned to religion to teach them healthy coping mechanisms, but it is by no means a cure for mental illness.\n  ","404613":"\n  i suppose you're correct in that you can believe in god while discounting the corruption of organized religion. regardless, believing in a higher being isn't a cure for mental illness.\n  ","404614":"\n  totally, because a corrupt religion is going to cure my mental illness. lmfao.\n  ","404615":"\n  quite often, especially lately. i've been feeling empty almost every day.\n  ","404616":"\n  it depends on how old the child is, in my opinion, and whether

believe it's wrong for parents to still check up on their children if they're over the age of 18. but if they're a pre-teen or a teenager, then i don't see the problem in doing it in moderation and within reason.\n  \n  children do deserve some bit of privacy, but to give them complete freedom will only hurt them and expose them to dangerous situations.\n  ","404617":"\n  the simple response is

they're not for some ulterior motive.\n  ","404620":"\n  graduating from college. i know it doesn't seem like a massive achievement, but for me it was a proud moment because i struggled a lot with my

the relationship will not last long or at least be genuine.\n  ","404624":"\n  i believe that children are entitled to *some* privacy, but definitely not complete privacy because that's just a recipe for the child to get into hazardous activities. at the same time, however, too little privacy can be extremely overbearing for a child and leads to them acting out of rebellion because they feel constricted and caged, so to speak. there has to be a healthy balance, and you must also trust your child to a degree as well.\n  ","404625":"\n  i normally like all answers to the questions i ask to acknowledge that i read their answer, even if i disagree with their opinion.\n  ","404626":"\n  i don't really think of these as political, personally. if they were political opinions, i would be

done with trying to appease others whose presence isn't productive or helpful to my life.\n  ","404671":"\n  yes. i would much rather be hurt by the truth than be blissfully ignorant.\n  ","404672":"\n  they're equally important to me. i don't think i would get along with someone who doesn't have the same sense of humor as me, especially because i love laughing at stupid sh*t and comedy makes me feel better. i also find it's easier to connect and relate to people when you have similar interests, whether it's through television shows or movies, hobbies, their idea of fun, topics they're interested in, their passions, and what they're looking for out of life and the relationship.\n  ","404673":"\n  i don't want anyone knowing more about me anymore. the more that people know, the more vulnerable it makes me and i'm tired of people thinking that my business is their personal business.\n  ","404674":"\n  honestly, i like my current workplace. i always have something to do to keep my mind occupied, the work is easy and comes naturally to me, and i don't get bothered by people or have to interact with people very often, unless it's through email.\n  ","404675":"\n  the internet and a cloud network. the cloud network makes saving my files at work much easier because i can access them from any computer in the office, as well as from home through a remote login. it's a good backup system if case the system fails, since IT can recover lost files.\n  ","404676":"\n  absolutely. there's nothing wrong with gay or trans characters being played by people who know the issues and situations best.\n  ","404677":"\n  i don't have any particular song stuck in my head because i'm listening to the halo 3 ODST soundtrack at the moment, haha.\n  \n\n

never heard of that before.\n  ","404687":"\n  i try to limit my consumption of meat and dairy as much as possible, as well as recycle plastic, glass, and cardboard. i don't use water bottles or disposable straws, and instead i have refillable thermoses and reusable straws that i can simply wash.\n  \n  i use regular gas in my car, though. i wouldn't even know where to get used gasoline.\n

usually have some sort of ulterior motive behind their actions that benefit themselves while they give off the impression that they're helping someone else. these tendencies are normally apparent to

to par with my expectations, haha. i had three text message threads in a row where that was the last text i sent.\n  ","404709":"\n  i have a savings account, if that's what you're referring to. i don't plan on buying land or building my own house, though.\n  ","404710":"\n  morbid, lmao. my humor is very dark and find comedians and other humorous things to be hilarious when they're able to turn a sensitive issue into something relateable.\n  ","404711":"\n  secretly commissioned a local artist (who's a friend of mine actually) to paint a collage of everything from my favorite video

don't like going due to the bad memories i've had at them.\n  ","404719":"\n  children crying, lmaoo.\n  ","404720":"\n  is psychology considered a science (perhaps a social science)? if so, then psychology is the most interesting to me. i've always enjoyed learning about the ways our brains control our behavior, as well as deeply-seated influences of our childhoods on our behavior as adults.\n  ","404721":"\n  opportunities to have a cup of coffee or a drink with my boyfriend and\/or a close friend; seeing cute animals when i'm out driving or running errands; finding new music to listen to; and waking up in the morning with the knowledge that i have no immediate responsibilities.\n  ","404722":"\n  i listen to alternative rock, indie, hip hop, classical music, and some pop

that's my specialty. upsetting men worldwide just makes me stronger.\n  ","404730":"\n  being attention seeking isn't necessarily a bad thing -- everyone craves attention to some degree, whether it's from friends or family or loved ones or even strangers. the only thing that would be bad is if people went about it in a bad way.\n  \n  regardless of all of this, i don't see how responding \"no\" to

addictions. perhaps the smoker got into smoking initially because of peer pressure or they were looking for a quick \"escape,\" but nicotine is one of the most addictive chemicals out there and quitting cigarettes is very hard for most people to do.\n  \n  coming from the perspective of a smoker myself, i like the relaxation that cigarettes give me even after all of these years. i've slowly been resorting to vaping, though, because smoking cigarettes is an expensive habit and i'm not ready to 100% quit yet.\n  ","404746":"\n  personal independence, financial stability, and emotional stability.\n  ","404747":"\n  i prefer sparkling water over still water, but only if it's flavored sparkling water. i don't drink enough water to begin with during the day, so i've gotten into the

and dangerous than marijuana.\n  ","404759":"\n  it depends on the nature of my friendship with them, what they said, the context in which they said it, etc etc. it's difficult to really make an overall determination on whether or not i would forgive someone because each scenario is different.\n  ","404760":"\n  i don't hold any negative views about open relationships at all, only as long as

for one bedroom studio apartments for myself a while ago, hell even basement apartments, they averaged around $1200-1300\/month. at least now with the house i'm renting with my friends, i pay *much* less than that since we're splitting rent three ways.\n  ","404800":"\n  my boyfriend. i tell him everything that bothers or upsets or angers me, and he's always been a terrific support system. he

cigarettes to food items and hygienic care. i've never lived in another state before (besides massachusetts, but i was a student), but from my understanding, the prices are inflated here more than

really shouldn't wait for the beginning of a new year to begin doing it. if you have the ambition and drive, you should work towards it as soon as you're able to do so.\n  ","404828":"\n  i don't think there's anything wrong with sharing your past history with your partner, as long as both people are comfortable with that knowledge. i know all about my boyfriend's past, and he knows about mine. it doesn't change our opinion on each other.\n  ","404829":"\n  there's a space in between. that's really the only difference.\n  ","404830":"\n  compromising my own well being for other people's satisfaction when they didn't deserve my kindness.\n  ","404831":"\n  i'm all right, kinda angry today but other than that, i'm fine. i'm going to play some skyrim later since i started a new game last night and i forgot how much i loved that game.\n  ","404832":"\n  it's only boring if you don't follow people with interesting answers, or have entertaining questions being asked to you. i find askfm quite enjoyable.\n  ","404833":"\n  no, i don't like watches.\n  ","404834":"\n  this text, lmaoo.\n  ","404835":"\n  i'd rather spend it with my boyfriend if i only has the option between the two. otherwise, i would prefer if he was there along with my friends.\n  ","404836":"\n  LOL. no, i don't even sound like her either.\n  ","404837":"\n  i'm honestly not sure. i'm turning 28 in november, so it's not as if it's a milestone birthday or anything. i'll probably just go to work as usual, and maybe see some friends in the evening when i get home.\n  ","404838":"\n  i don't have a spirit animal because i'm not native american.\n  ","404839":"\n  lately i've been listening to the entire halo 3 ODST soundtrack on repeat.\n  ","404840":"\n  to some degree, yes. honestly, most of my better writing was written when i was in a bad mental place. morbidly, pain has always inspired me and writing has also been a major outlet for me when i'm hurting.\n  ","404841":"\n  no. honestly, my intuition is pretty spot on. if i have a bad feeling or vibe about something, then i normally trust that feeling and it turns out to be true.\n  ","404842":"\n  i like halloween the most.\n  ","404843":"\n  the bahamas !!\n  ","404844":"\n  terrible. i only know how to cook simple meals, haha.\n  ","404845":"\n  i don't really care where i go. i just want to go somewhere where i can relax and do absolutely nothing for a week straight. where every day is unplanned for the most part, and i act on whatever i feel like doing in that current moment. where i have zero responsibilities or obligations.\n  ","404846":"\n  sometimes i'll have a buttered roll, although most times i have yogurt with fruit and granola. i try my best to eat healthy for every meal.\n  ","404847":"\n  yes, the current state of the environment is extremely worrisome at the moment. we all need to take an active step in helping the environment and slowing down the process of climate change.\n  ","404848":"\n  other people's opinions and feelings towards me. when i was younger, i was too concerned with what other people thought and adjusted myself accordingly in an attempt to appease them.  however, i learned that you simply cannot change a person's feelings towards you if they're dead-set on their views, and the only thing you can do is learn to simply not care and live your life according to your own needs and desires.\n  ","404849":"\n  i think it depends on the reason why they're against the idea in the first place. sometimes we don't realize that something is a bad idea until another person talks to us about it from their own perspective. you may think it's a terrific idea, but viewing it from other people's points of view is helpful in ultimately making a decision.\n  ","404850":"\n  deciding to come home after my freshman year of college after living in massachusetts for a year. even though i enjoyed the freedom, i was in a really dark place mentally and ab*sed substances constantly and failed out of two classes. my boyfriend was also struggling with his life as well, and after some tragic events happened, i decided to come home to support him and his family during a rough patch in their lives. it also helped with my own mental health, and i enrolled in a local university where i could commute to school to get my degree.\n  ","404851":"\n  yeah, that's exactly my thinking as well. i mainly get the overwhelming urge to drink because she gets under my skin, and i go out as a means of simply not being home. by living on my own, i won't have that stressor in my life anymore.\n  \n  thank you, though -- i appreciate it.\n  ","404852":"\n  sitting alone in my room with mellow music playing; having the first cup of coffee of the day; listening to the rain and thunderstorms outside; sleeping in until at least 9:00am; seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile; having deep conversations with friends; being in a clean room after spending time cleaning and organizing it; and writing something creative and being proud of it.\n  ","404853":"\n  \"you used to captivate me by your resonating light. now, i'm bound by the life you left behind. your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams. your voice it chased away all the sanity in me.\"\n  \n  -- \"my immortal\" by evanescence.\n  ","404854":"\n  my mother and i got into an argument yesterday morning. she claimed i drank too much alcohol (even though i severely cut down my drinking from a few months ago), and she said that she doesn't want me to move out because then she won't be able to keep an eye on me and know when i'm drinking.\n  \n  it really angered me, mainly because i'm a grown adult and she doesn't need to keep tabs on me anymore. i can make my own decisions, but she's trying to exercise control over my life at any possible moment.\n  ","404855":"\n  i would have no qualms over cutting off my parents completely from my life. my father isn't terrible, so i would likely stay in contact with him, but my mother has ab*sed me my entire life and i have no reason to remain in contact with her.\n  ","404856":"\n  i would rather have perfect abs, haha. i have no desire to be noticed by anyone besides my boyfriend.\n  ","404857":"\n  virtually anywhere, haha. i want to visit my best friend in new hampshire. i want to go camping in upstate new york. i want to take a cross-country road trip and visit yosemite, redwood national park, and the badlands. i want to see europe (particularly italy, spain, and croatia) and visit new zealand and australia.\n  ","404858":"\n  peaches, mangoes, and raspberries.\n  ","404859":"\n  yeah, definitely -- as long as they obviously take care of those dogs properly.\n  ","404860":"\n  no, i cannot stand any sort of heels. i can't walk in them and they're very uncomfortable.\n  ","404861":"\n  depends on their tone of voice. if they say it in a nasty way, then yeah i take offense to that. however, if they're saying it in a concerning way then i don't mind it at all. sometimes i do forget to take my meds and it makes my depression worse.\n  ","404862":"\n  i drink at least 2-3 cups of coffee every day.\n  ","404863":"\n  i just like wearing flip flops or flat sandals.\n  ","404864":"\n  yes, the total of maybe five times i've had a cheeseburger or hot dog this year obviously is the reason why i'm fat. lmao.\n  ","404865":"\n  yeah, i have a smart tv.\n  ","404866":"\n  no, i've never done that before.\n  ","404867":"\n  no, not at all. it's simply an expression of their religion.\n  ","404868":"\n  i normally try not to judge by appearance, but i will have some sort of judgment towards you if i know you have the capability of dressing nicely and you forego your physical appearance and\/or hygiene. obviously this isn't the same case as when someone is struggling, though.\n  ","404869":"\n  i really like cozy, autumn styles -- with big, soft sweaters, striped and plaid cardigans, ripped skinny jeans, knee-high boots, scarves, beanies, etc etc. i like the colors and patterns of autumn clothing the most.\n  ","404870":"\n  i'm not sure if this is an unpopular opinion or not, but i'm against circumcision. i think it's the equivalent of female g*nital mutilation and it's completely unnecessary in most cases. parents do it for cosmetic reasons and there are so many risks involved.\n  ","404871":"\n  idk if this is strange or uncommon or not, but i always dip my french fries in ice cream and eat hot dogs\/cheeseburgers with potato chips in them.\n  ","404872":"\n  i like pinks and purples on myself.\n  ","404873":"\n  honestly, i've been better. i'm going through a rough patch right now, but today has been a bit brighter. i did three loads of laundry and cleaned, so at least that's something.\n

different.\n  ","404877":"\n  when someone has clout, it means that they have power or influence over someone else or a group of people.\n  ","404878":"\n  i don't really agree with the reason why they work like that, but i do still think that it can be productive for their own health and sanity.\n  ","404879":"\n  not really, no. i've been stressed at work so i guess that hasn't really been helping though, haha. mainly family stuff and i'm stressing out over the things i need to do for the move.\n  ","404880":"\n  yes, i believe it's a productive use of their time and it gives them something to focus on while they're serving their sentence. being idle for too long is unhealthy for you, both physically and mentally.\n  ","404881":"\n  i like most kinds of music, depending on my mood. lately i've been listening to lo-fi hip hop, rap, alternative rock, indie rock, nu metal, and some top 40 pop music.\n  ","404882":"\n  yes, i'm almost *too* good at lying because it comes so easily to me. particularly when it involves my own feelings.\n  ","404883":"\n  idk, i think it differs for each person. i think it's difficult to decide whether or not to part ways with someone or something that you genuinely love, but it's toxic for you.\n  ","404884":"\n  i'm still not feeling the best. there's a lot of sh*t going on in my life rn, and it's gotten me feeling rather discouraged and down. i feel a bit better today than i have in the past week, though. i'm just trying to take each day at a time.\n  ","404885":"\n  i don't use the term \"loser\" because i'm not 12 years old.\n  \n  to answer your question in a serious manner, though, it depends on why they're living with their parents. every situation is different, and some people need to live with their parents for emotional, financial, or physical reasons (sometimes related to health). however, if someone is living with their parents and they're not contributing to the household or actively looking for ways to move forward, then i think that is a bit concerning.\n  ","404886":"\n  lately i've been focusing more on the future, but i do think about the past on occasion. i try to live in the current moment, but sometimes it's difficult given my anxiety and whatnot.\n  ","404887":"\n  i like questions that are personalized to my own life, such as questions about my education, my career, my hobbies, my relationships, my mental health, etc etc.\n  \n  i would like to receive more questions related to those subjects because answering generalized spam can get boring at times.\n  ","404888":"\n  i don't really have an opinion. i think he should do what makes him most comfortable. even though it's just wisdom teeth surgery, he could be feeling a lot of anxiety over the situation since the dentist freaks a lot of people out.\n  ","404889":"\n  the only thing i do to my hair in the morning is brush it to get the knots out.\n  ","404890":"\n  just because i don't remember most of my childhood doesn't mean i don't know what shows i watched. i remember random bits and pieces here and there, and the majority of life events are completely lost to me.\n  ","404891":"\n  i mostly use askfm, instagram, and facebook.\n  ","404892":"\n  i remember watching dragonball z and sailor moon.\n  ","404893":"\n  the entire experience is exciting to me, haha. the pain isn't so great obviously, but the minute the tattoo gun turns on, i'm so amped and in the zone.\n  ","404894":"\n  i definitely wouldn't sabotage the training, haha. i would want to give that person the best resources to do their job correctly and efficiently. it would only hurt me in the long run if i didn't train them correctly.\n  ","404895":"\n  i'm in control of the entire magazine project, from editing the features to keeping track of clients and their revisions that they send in. right now, we're in the pre-production stages of layout and the graphic design team just finished laying out the pages. i have to go through the pdf on monday to check for any mistakes.\n  \n  in addition, i have a writer who works beneath me and writes the magazine features (in the past, i was the one writing the features beneath the previous senior editor). i've been training her for two weeks now.\n  ","404896":"\n  i don't tend to hold grudges because they wind up hurting me more than they hurt the other person.\n  ","404897":"\n  i like going down to the bay, listen to live music, and watch the sunset.\n  ","404898":"\n  i'm doing a little better today than i have been this past week as a whole. i'm just learning to take each day at a time, set small goals for myself, and focus more on self-care.\n  ","404899":"\n  if i adopted a black dog or cat, i would want to name them \"nocturne.\" if they were white, then \"luna.\" i don't know what i would name them if they were brown or spotted or whatnot, though.\n  ","404900":"\n  i usually go out for food & drinks with my friends.\n  ","404901":"\n  my bills, lmao. particularly my health insurance and my student loan.\n  ","404902":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree with you. you're not a bad person if you don't reciprocate feelings, you're just simply looking for something or someone that isn't the person asking you out. it isn't usually anything personal, but those who advocate for the friendzone make it super personal, like it's a personal insult to them and they view themselves as irresistible.\n  ","404903":"\n  i try to give off the impression that i'm an open-minded and tolerable person, someone who can be trusted and is always willing to talk when necessary.\n  \n  instead of that impression, i usually accidentally give off the impression that i'm awkward af because i don't know how to behave in social situations. lmao.\n  ","404904":"\n  no, i don't have emotional attachments to my clothing or even most of the items that i own. i routinely clean and throw things away or donate them because i don't like having junk.\n  ","404905":"\n  i don't believe the friendzone exists, tbh. it's just a term salty people use when they're rejected by someone they're interested in, and they can't let go of the fact that not everyone is either looking for a relationship or not everyone wants what you're offering.\n  ","404906":"\n  money, pls.\n  ","404907":"\n  self-reassurance and the knowledge that one's power comes from within. once you realize that you're the only person stopping yourself from achieving your goals, you're unstoppable.\n  ","404908":"\n  i don't really agree with the concept -- we're all human beings, we all have things that make us strong and vulnerable, and it's unhealthy to put people up on a pedestal like that.\n  ","404909":"\n  no, that seems unnecessary, lol. i'll probably light a candle the first night, though. i want to buy a pumpkin pie candle, lmaoo.\n  ","404910":"\n  i don't really understand what true crime has to do with gossiping, haha. the two aren't related.\n  ","404911":"\n  an accent wouldn't deter me from visiting a country, lol.\n  ","404912":"\n  the scenery !!\n  ","404913":"\n  i've always wanted to visit new zealand. it looks absolutely gorgeous there.\n  ","404914":"\n  i prefer the ocean, although admittedly it does scare me a bit. i only ever swim in calm waters because i don't want the current to grab me and cast me out to sea.\n  ","404915":"\n  i trust my boyfriend the most. whenever i have a problem or if i'm struggling with my mental health, he always knows what to say in order to make me feel better.\n  ","404916":"\n  other people's goals, ambitions, and passions. i think that you can truly get to know someone by discussing those types of things, and everyone has a different perspective of what they want to accomplish in life.\n  ","404917":"\n  i listen to more male singers than anything else. although there are a few female-fronted bands that i love, like florence and the machine, in this moment, and otep.\n  ","404918":"\n  i think it is rather important to maintain some degree of positivity in life, yeah. i believe that people should have realistic approaches to situations, but having positive thoughts definitely helps others work towards and succeed in their goals.\n  ","404919":"\n  i would eradicate all forms of oppression and discrimination (i.e. homophobia, transphobia, ableism, racism, sexism, etc etc).\n  ","404920":"\n  i like psychological thrillers, dark comedies, and gritty action movies.\n  ","404921":"\n  i don't like either because i'm not a big fan of chocolate. i prefer vanilla.\n  ","404922":"\n  depends on the severity of what someone did to hurt me. i've forgiven people in the past, but these days i'm much less forgiving toward people who have hurt me.\n  ","404923":"\n  no, not everything happens for a reason. i don't believe in destiny or fate, and i believe some things happen simply because it was a domino effect or just coincidence. to say that everything happens for a reason discounts the traumatic experiences that some people have, as well.\n  ","404924":"\n  it depends on the individual, because some techniques work for some people and not others. personally, i like laying down in a cool, dimly-lit room with calming music playing.\n  ","404925":"\n  lol, thank you !! :'))\n  ","404926":"\n  aw, thank you ~~\n  ","404927":"\n  yeah, luckily i'm on my laptop so i have a few old photos saved, haha.\n  ","404928":"\n  i just explained it. i don't shower in the morning, i shower at night.\n  ","404929":"\n  i don't like it when it's freezing outside, but i can handle 30-40 degree weather. my favorite is when it's in the 50s and 60s.\n  ","404930":"\n  lol, that's great !! i've lost a concerning amount of weight in the past week alone because of stress and anxiety. :\/ i just don't have an appetite when i'm feeling this way and i've only been having one meal a day, usually without carbs.\n  ","404931":"\n  oh god, i would be so uncomfortable and angry, LOL. i absolutely *hate* the hot weather.\n  ","404932":"\n  some of my tattoos don't have a particular meaning. i have two friendship tattoos, a tattoo dedicated to my passion for love, a yin yang dedicated to my passion for music, and a band logo to represent how much that band has helped me, among others.\n  \n  most of my tattoos weren't terrible painful, except for the back of the calf and my ribcage. those were pretty bad, haha. the easiest tattoo was the one on my shoulder blades and my forearm wasn't bad either.\n  ","404933":"\n  LOL. definitely having the first pee of the day.\n  \n  i don't shower in the morning, i shower at night before bed. i can't wake up early enough to shower before work, i would much rather sleep.\n  ","404934":"\n  no, i wouldn't consider myself to be immature. i believe my maturity level is average compared to other people my age.\n  ","404935":"\n  ugh, yes that's the absolute dream rn. it's currently 75 degrees fahrenheit where i live, which isn't terrible because it was up in the 80s and 90s only a few weeks ago. but i do love when the temperature is in the 50s and 60s, especially when it's a bit cloudy.\n  ","404936":"\n  i don't really know about it being completely free since i'm sure there's some labor that goes into making a passport for someone. it should be more affordable, though.\n  ","404937":"\n  i'm not entirely sure, but i know it's over $100 because of the application fee. :\/ i think that's ridiculous.\n  ","404938":"\n  i mainly wear hoodies during autumn, but i also like wearing loose blouses with comfy cardigans, skinny jeans, and knee-high boots.\n  ","404939":"\n  i normally switch to hot coffee, whereas in the summer i mainly drink iced coffee. i also drink more peppermint tea during the winter and hot chocolate on occasion.\n  ","404940":"\n  i don't have anything that i'm really looking forward to in september, i don't have any spectacular plans. i do need to begin packing, though, and i want to get my passport.\n  ","404941":"\n  in the beginning of august, i got a promotion to the senior editor position for my company's magazine. :'))\n  \n  then last week, i signed the lease on the house i'm renting !!\n  ","404942":"\n  i don't really consider any of my \"makeovers\" to be crazy, particularly because i don't really like the use of the term crazy to describe ordinary things -- it's stigmatizing towards those with mental illness.\n  \n  however, i think the most drastic change was when i cut off all of my hair into a very short pixie cut during my senior year of high school and bleached it to a very light blonde. before that, my hair was to my shoulders and it was brown.\n  ","404943":"\n  i wasn't very young at all, i only started shaving my head maybe 3 years ago. that would have made me 24 years old.\n  ","404944":"\n  that my office decided to close for labor day tomorrow, haha. my office is always open on holidays (except thanksgiving, xmas, and new years day), and the only reason why i go in on holidays is because i earn time-and-a-half for the entire day.\n  ","404945":"\n  idk, i'm pretty unmotivated rn. i do want to get some laundry done, but i'm really not feeling up to it.\n  ","404946":"\n  lol, for real. and this conversation all started because an anon (idk if it was the same one or not) said it was gross to have to clean a bathroom that other people have also been using.\n  \n  like ... i've been cleaning my bathroom for years, and i share that bathroom with my parents and in the past with my brother too. after a while, it doesn't phase you anymore.\n  ","404947":"\n  i understand this completely, and i do sometimes feel the same way. however, even though there are *some* genetic components to those mental illnesses, it's also a product of a person's environment. if or when you have children in the future, if you provide them with a loving, understanding, and open home then that decreases the chance that they'll develop mental health problems. give them the life that you weren't given when you were growing up.\n  ","404948":"\n  yeah, when i was house-hunting there were a few houses that had 1.5 or 2.5 bathrooms (the 1\/2 being the en-suite you just mentioned), but they were super expensive. there's really no reason for us to get a house with more than one or two bathrooms, considering there are only three people living in the house and we're all never going to be home at the same time.\n  ","404949":"\n  i'm middle class -- the houses where i live usually have one or two bathrooms. the houses with 3+ bathrooms cost more than $500,000.\n  ","404950":"\n  i literally don't know a single person who lives in a house with three bathrooms (at least where i live). it's normally just one bathroom, or two if it's a bigger house with more bedrooms.\n  ","404951":"\n  this just proves my and\n  \n   @HeartOfStitches\n  \n  's point. lmao.\n  ","404952":"\n  what would you like to know about them?\n  ","404953":"\n  drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, and skin-picking.\n  ","404954":"\n  people can do whatever they want to do with their facial hair, it doesn't matter much to me. some people are more comfortable with having a beard, while others prefer a shaved face.\n  ","404955":"\n  an easier question would be what *doesn't* make me cry, lmao. i have a terrible habit of crying over the silliest, most insignificant things. however, i notice that i don't seem to cry when major events happen until much later after the fact. :\/ i've never cried at a wake or a funeral, or even when i was in the room when we had to put down my boyfriend's dog. it always occurred when i was alone a few days later.\n  ","404956":"\n  for real, man. i grew up in a household with four people sharing the same bathroom. when i'm at my boyfriend's house, i share the bathroom with 3-4 other people. when i was in college, there was a bathroom with stalls in it for everyone on the same floor.\n  \n  it's ... just a bathroom. and as you get older and begin cleaning your own bathroom, you don't get phased by the gross sh*t you see. obviously if the situation is extreme and i find my friends pissing all over the place, that's a conversation that needs to be had, lol. but otherwise, it's a normal part of life and living with other people.\n  ","404957":"\n  this is a ridiculous notion in my situation. i've known my friends for 10 years and i trust him with my life (and he feels the same towards me). if i wasn't comfortable with the situation, then i simply wouldn't have signed the lease. in addition, it says a lot about your friendships with people if you don't trust them not to assault you.\n  \n  furthermore, assault is never the victim's fault, so to place blame on a person by saying they're \"inviting\" the event is extremely toxic and problematic.\n  ","404958":"\n  i've been sharing bathrooms with people for my entire life, it isn't really something that phases me.\n  ","404959":"\n  if i'm depressed, sad, or unmotivated, i honestly just try to sleep my feelings off and hope that i wake up in a better mindset. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, depending on how severe my mood is. i've also found talking to trusted friends is helpful when trying to sort out why i'm feeling a certain way, and hanging out with someone offers a distraction from my thoughts temporarily.\n  ","404960":"\n  yes, the house has three bedrooms & one bathroom.\n  ","404961":"\n  no, that seems unnecessary and also dangerous. if something happens where my friend needs to wake me up, having a locked bedroom door could be detrimental to the situation.\n  ","404962":"\n  depending on what the situation is, i normally go to my boyfriend or my therapist for advice regarding the situation. they both offer me objective perspectives on situations and help me make a decision on what to do.\n  ","404963":"\n  lately i've been thinking about the future, particularly with respect to moving into the new house i'm going to be renting with friends. i'm in the midst of planning what i need to purchase before the move, how i'm going to organize my belongings, and also what sort of phone calls i'll need to make in order to lower my monthly payments on other bills (so that i have more money to put towards rent).\n  ","404964":"\n  a *very* old photo, but i've always felt proud and confident in this picture.\n  ","404965":"\n  i woke up from a nap about an hour ago, and i had a dream that i owned a bearded dragon and a yellow monitor lizard. they were both the sweetest little creatures.\n  ","404966":"\n  team work, patience, and creative thinking.\n  ","404967":"\n  seeing my boyfriend laugh and\/or smile; having a campfire with friends; waking up to the sound of rain or freshly fallen snow; drinking the first cup of coffee in the morning; having a clean bedroom after a day of cleaning and doing

you. if you're satisfied with the job and you can live off of that sort of paycheck, then you don't necessarily *need* to find a new job. however, if your job pays you either less than you deserve or you cannot live off of your paychecks, then it may be time to look for a new job that will pay you an adequate amount.\n  ","405016":"\n  i'm sure some people find it offensive, yeah. obviously not

addicted to food because they're using food to mask deeply-seated issues within their own psyche. it isn't so much about the food itself, it's moreso about the feeling it brings them that helps them \"cope\" (i use that term loosely) with their circumstances, feelings, etc etc.\n  ","405019":"\n  ugh, i understand this all too well. particularly the chronic emptiness, which goes hand-in-hand with my depression as well. my feelings of emptiness have gotten better over the years, but they still occur occasionally when i'm in the midst of an \"episode\" and my emotions are a roller coaster everywhere. i'll go from feeling everything at once to feeling nothing at all at the drop of a hat.\n  \n  i also struggle with anger, but it's more internalized than external, if that makes sense. i direct my anger towards myself and self-destruct, rather than explode on other people.\n  \n  as for how to handle anger and emptiness ... honestly, it's useful to learn mindfulness and grounding techniques. it won't be an overnight transition obviously, but there are books you can buy regarding mindfulness and how to apply DBT to your life if you can't see a therapist. i've had one book in particular in my amazon shopping list for months now, \"the dialectical behavior therapy skills workbook\" by dr. matthew mckay. it has really good reviews.\n  ","405020":"\n  yeah, that's normal for

very expensive at all considering the area, and it would certainly be much more expensive for us to have to purchase those appliances ourselves and have them installed.\n  \n  the current residents were not there when we visited the house, no. the real estate agent purposely scheduled a data and time when the residents wouldn't be home so that we were free to walk around the house and inspect all of the rooms and the basement and garage and whatnot.\n  ","405036":"\n  yeah, that sounds like an anxiety response. if you're comfortable putting that foot forward, i would recommend bringing

an anxiety disorder.\n  \n  anxiety symptoms vary wildly from person to person, but generally anxiety is characterized by excessive worrying, excessive fear, feelings of \"impending doom,\" insomnia, restlessness, heart palpitations or feeling like you can't slow down, lack of concentration, etc etc.\n  \n  feelings of anxiety in unwanted or stressful situations is completely normal. however, it doesn't \"become\" a disorder until the feelings of anxiety are disproportionate to the impact of the event at hand.\n  ","405039":"\n  i struggle with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder, although lately my panic attacks have been less frequent and more manageable.\n  \n  i cope with my anxiety disorders through medication and therapy. i take anti-anxiety medication twice per day, and

starting to \"stabilize\" now, and it's already 6:00pm.\n  ","405040":"\n  the family who's currently living at the house isn't moving out until around september 30th. then the landlord wants around

island before.\n  ","405042":"\n  tbh all stigmas against mental health should be abolished.\n  \n  however, i believe the biggest stigma that exists is this notion that all mentally ill people are a danger to society and should be treated with hostility and caution. particularly when it comes to complex disorders (i.e. personality disorders or psychotic disorders), there has always been a tremendous stigma stating that these people are \"dangerous\" or capable of doing harm to another person.\n  \n  however, studies have shown that mentally ill people as a whole are more of a danger to *themselves* than anyone else, and most mentally ill people could never imagine hurting another person in their life, friend or stranger. the stigma that we're all dangerous is extremely hurtful in itself and further pushes mentally ill people away from obtaining the proper help they need.\n  ","405043":"\n  i've only ever used the laundromat on a few occasions. but uh, you do know that laundromats have dryers too right. lol.\n  ","405044":"\n  yeah, from my understanding the \"strength\" of coffee is determined by the ratio of coffee grinds to water during brewing. for example, if you're making a pot of coffee, if you want a stronger pot then you'll put more grinds into the filter instead of less grinds.\n  ","405045":"\n  i'm terribly sorry that you're going through this. :\/\n  \n  have you sat down and talked to him about this yet? it's definitely a conversation worth having, especially considering you were under the impression that you two were exclusive to one another. you deserve to know the truth, and to be perfectly honest, i wouldn't want to personally be with someone who isn't honest enough to tell me about them developing feelings for another person before they go ahead and act on those feelings. that's a pretty sh*tty thing for someone to do.\n  ","405046":"\n  oh wow, that's terrible. :\/ as if your medical conditions have any factor on whether or not you're a good student. i know plenty of people who completed college despite their medical conditions, both physical and mental, and just because you're diagnosed by a physician with a disorder doesn't mean you're not qualified to be a student.\n  \n  in this case, i suppose you have no other choice but to disclose your mental illnesses to your potential schools. however, depression and anxiety are extremely common disorders, so i honestly don't see them giving you a hard time about them. and if they do discriminate against you because of your medical history, that isn't a school you should want to be affiliated with anyway.\n  ","405047":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","405048":"\n  yes, i was the toxic and bad person in other people's lives a long time ago. i was a party animal, insatiable, and completely and utterly selfish. i did things that aligned with my own desires with little regard of other people's feelings, and a lot of others got hurt along the way. after i grew out of that phase of my life, i lost a lot of people.\n  ","405049":"\n  perhaps buy an aisle seat instead of a window seat so that you can walk around when necessary. you may also want to talk to your physician regarding prescribing you a small amount of medication that will help you relax on the plane.\n  ","405050":"\n  i text one of my close friends the most, actually. i was initially going to say my boyfriend, but we talk on the phone more than anything else.\n  ","405051":"\n  yeah, i log on every afternoon when i'm bored to answer questions here and there. it's a good way to waste time, lol.\n  ","405052":"\n  i prefer saturdays, considering i don't work on saturday (except for my freelance work at home).\n  ","405053":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree. relationships are difficult on their own, so to throw depression into the mix just makes it much more complicated. but i don't believe relationships are doomed to fail if both partners have depression, though.\n

myself in drama at all because i think it's stupid, but i can't help but admit that i do like remaining aware of what's going on, haha.\n  ","405058":"\n  this is a very difficult question to answer, haha. 2019 has been a roller coaster of a year for me, and terrible things have happened but also really great things have happened as well. it's hard to say whether or not things got better or worse since 2018.\n  ","405059":"\n  i have a tendency to cry over small, meaningless things and clam up and become distant over large, meaningful things.\n  \n  for example, i've cried over perfectly happy songs before. i've cried over my coffee spilling on the way into work. i've cried over situations that don't even pertain to me but because i could empathize with the other person. however, it's extremely difficult for me to express emotion with \"big\" events, like at funerals and such. it takes me about a week to process those emotions, which makes me feel like a sh*t person because everyone else in the room is crying and i'm sitting there emotionless. :\/\n  ","405060":"\n  my only plan for tomorrow is to successfully make it into work (which is probably going to be a feat in itself, considering i'm exhausted but still seeing a friend tonight). i don't even care if i don't get any work done tomorrow, i just need to show up. lmao.\n  ","405061":"\n  in-person. i'm not a big fan of texting, so i'll text in order to make plans instead of text in order to have a conversation. i would much rather have a face-to-face conversation instead.\n  ","405062":"\n  i don't have any plans this weekend, besides perhaps doing some freelance work on the side for extra cash. i mainly want to sleep, do laundry, and have two days where i have no real obligations or responsibilities.\n  ","405063":"\n  i'm not afraid of people, no. however, i seriously dislike most people and actively try to avoid them at all costs.\n  ","405064":"\n  i wouldn't personally color my eyebrows in (when i do makeup, i lightly fill them in but that's all). however, i don't care about what other people decide to do with their makeup. if it makes them happy and more confident, then more power to them.\n

amount of stress i've been going through, i must be thrashing myself in my sleep or something.\n  ","405067":"\n  i don't foresee myself having children tbh.\n  \n  but to answer your question, if my hypothetical child was caught bullying someone else, then i would have a serious talk with them regarding why they thought that behavior was appropriate. i would question if they're upset about something in their life that would cause them to act out in such a hurtful way. and i would discipline them accordingly, but also show them that i'm here for support. most bullies out out of a need for attention to fill a void in their life, so i would want to understand what my child needs psychologically in order to prevent future bullying behavior.\n  ","405068":"\n  yes. when i was like 14-15 years old, i met the members of linkin park. :')) they were having a meet-n-greet right before their concert, so i was able to shake their hands and talk to them and get their autographs.\n  ","405069":"\n  it varies depending on the individual. for some people who are mentally ill, having a healthy diet and exercising does improve their mental health as a result (there are also studies showing the inter-connection between your \"gut\" health and mental health). personally speaking, i do feel better when i'm on a routine, and if i'm somehow off of that routine, then i struggle as a result.\n  \n  the same cannot be said for everyone, though. just because a few people's mental health is aided by diet and exercise and positivity and whatnot doesn't necessarily mean it will work for everyone who is mentally ill. each person is unique, so treatment modalities will differ depending on each person's background, resistance to medication, openness, past experiences, support system, etc etc.\n  ","405070":"\n  eh, it depends really on company policy and how your relationship dynamic is. a lot of companies out there forbid coworkers from dating, but there are also some that don't mind as long as both partners keep their personal life separate from their professional life.\n  ","405071":"\n  i got bullied when i was in middle school and early high school. i don't remember how mild or severe it was, though. i unconsciously blocked out most of those moments from my life.\n  ","405072":"\n  i honestly didn't even know that miley cyrus was married. obviously i pay zero attention to celebrity news.\n  ","405073":"\n  i have a splitting headache, and i'm stupidly doing nothing about it (and probably making it worse with the iced coffee i'm drinking).\n  \n  other than that, my friend wants to hang out with me and my boyfriend tonight, so i'm in the middle of planning that.\n  ","405074":"\n  hoodies, skinny jeans, and boots. i've also been known to wear tee-shirts, cardigans, scarves, and beanies.\n  ","405075":"\n  i've never read the book, unfortunately (although i do own it). i absolutely love the movie, and i've always wanted to see the musical.\n  ","405076":"\n  i do have joint pain, but i'm not sure if it's from my medication or not. i started working in an office about a year or so before i began treatment for my mental health, so by the time i got started on medication, i was experiencing joint pain. therefore, i'm not sure if my pain is due to sitting down at a desk all day or because of my medication (or maybe both?).\n  \n  perhaps ask your doctor? i never heard of joint pain as a side effect, but anything is possible.\n  ","405077":"\n  i don't personally know of anyone who was in that scenario when i was in high school (i knew *of* people, but i wasn't close with them or anything). but in most cases, it stems from a dysfunctional home life so i sympathize with most of those cases. occasionally, you'll see a student who really has no excuse for their behavior at all but there's usually a deeply-rooted, underlying issue for why children party, flunk classes, and get kicked out of school.\n  ","405078":"\n  no, definitely not. if i was pregnant, i would get an abortion.\n  ","405079":"\n  i think it depends entirely on the individual animal. i've met some really smart, and also really stupid, cats and the same can be said for the dogs i've met as well. i'm not sure if it's accurate to make a conclusion about intelligence based solely on a species.\n  ","405080":"\n  yeah, i'm hella flab.\n  ","405081":"\n  i go out weekly or so, but it's always with the same one or two friends. i have a close-knit circle of few people i can call my friend, and i prefer it that way. i would much rather have a small circle of people whom i trust as opposed to a larger circle of acquaintances or people i otherwise don't care much about.\n  ","405082":"\n  i just finished putting the groceries away, and now i'm relaxing in my bedroom, drinking coffee, and listening to music.\n  ","405083":"\n  i've honestly never heard of a school (i'm assuming college or university?) asking about medical conditions. i don't recall any of the colleges i applied for asking about my medical history, so idk if it was simply those colleges or it wasn't a thing at the time.\n  \n  this involves privacy laws and HIPAA and whatnot, so i don't know the answer to your question. i can only assume that you're under no obligation to disclose your medical history, physical or mental, but this is something you should discuss with either a law professional or a school counselor.\n  ","405084":"\n  depression is not a character flaw, so no -- a relationship is not doomed to fail if both partners have depression. i believe that in some cases, people might be toxic for one another if they're not actively trying to help their own mental health and are using it as an \"excuse\" or a \"crutch\" for bad behavior. but in most cases of couples with mental illness, it just fosters understanding and empathy.\n  ","405085":"\n  no, i haven't played video games in months. :\/ i just haven't had the motivation to play lately.\n  ","405086":"\n  most of them don't really have deep meanings, lol. i have two friendship tattoos for my best friend and i, a band logo as a tribute to their music and how

met, he was in a long distance relationship with someone else for about a year or two. after we began talking routinely, he developed feelings for me and broke up with his girlfriend in order to ask

done with a person, i move forward from them without looking back. i only really cut people out of my life if they've proven themselves to be toxic or bad people, so at that point then i'm already finished with them.\n  ","405211":"\n  i haven't really done any fun or extraordinary activities this summer at all, i've been mainly focusing on work, making money, and taking steps toward bettering

in a really long time, i just don't have the drive or attention span anymore.\n  ","405218":"\n  i disagree to an extent. i think having high self esteem is a good thing, and it doesn't necessarily

appease the masses by being something that they're not.\n  ","405234":"\n  i actually have seven tattoos & i'm planning on getting my eighth tattoo sometime during the winter months. my first tattoo

just turned 18 years old.\n  ","405235":"\n  i don't believe that's acceptable, no. your partner should not have the authority to dictate what you can and cannot do in your life, including which friends you choose to keep. in rare cases, such as in the case of having friends who are ab*sive or just bad people, i think it's fine for the couple to talk about why they don't want their partner to be friends with them, but overall if it's just the partner exhibiting controlling or manipulative behavior, i don't believe that's right at all.\n  ","405236":"\n  cigarettes, ugh. i've been trying to

people are, it isn't a conscious choice to overthink situations. if that was the case, then most people certainly wouldn't purposely choose to think the worst of situations, lol. for myself personally, my anxiety disorder causes me to overthink and come to irrational conclusions. for others, it doesn't necessarily have to be a mental illness thing, it could just be part of who they are as a human being.\n  ","405345":"\n  if someone is expecting the worst of a situation, that means that they expect every negative outcome to happen. for instance, if a person develops a cough and they have the tendency to expect the worst, they may actually convince themselves that they're sicker than they actually are, maybe with bronchitis or pneumonia, instead of just thinking it's an insignificant cold.\n  ","405346":"\n  no, depression mainly affects my actual mood and the way i view myself. if i'm looking at the negative aspect of other things, it's generally due to my anxiety and my anxiety's way of expecting the worst out of every situation.\n  ","405347":"\n  well, yeah. depression is a disorder and it isn't just a state of mind, so that will always override my own will to live if i'm in a wave of depression.\n  ","405348":"\n  no, i'm not an inherently happy individual because of my longstanding history with depression.\n  ","405349":"\n  yes, this has happened to

ever joined a few contests on social media, and i did win one once !!\n  ","405421":"\n  that's basically a middle schooler dating a high schooler. that seems disturbing.\n  ","405422":"\n  you're correct -- it isn't different from others in a general sense, but considering what we've gone through, it would most definitely tear some other people apart. that's just realistic.\n  ","405423":"\n  yes, i'm currently in love with my boyfriend and i believe it to be true love. we've withstood significant struggle together that normally would tear some other relationships apart, but we've only grown stronger.\n  ","405424":"\n  somewhat, but i don't invest as much faith in them as some others. i find researching star signs and astrology in general to be very interesting, but i don't really believe in that sort of thing.\n  ","405425":"\n  my boyfriend's house. i feel at home there, at most peace with myself and my surroundings. there's no criticism or judgment there and i can be myself 100 percent.\n  ","405426":"\n  uh, have massive panic attacks and breakdowns, stumble into a drunken stupor, and obliterate myself completely until i have enough sense to reorganize myself and try to build myself up again.\n  ","405427":"\n  yes, i'm quite an ambitious person (when i'm not going through a depressive episode at least). i normally surpass whatever goals i set for myself.\n  ","405428":"\n  no, i'm not superstitious by any means. i find them to be interesting though, especially with respect to their historical contexts.\n  ","405429":"\n  no, i've only ever been on a flight four times (two to get down to austin, texas, and two to get back to new york). it happened within the same week, lol.\n  ","405430":"\n  no, i don't own those.\n  ","405431":"\n  upstate new york (catskill mountains).\n  ","405432":"\n  lol, no. at least not for me personally. it may happen to other people, but personally speaking the thoughts are simply subdued because i'm living in the present moment. it has no bearing on their intensity after i've sobered up.\n  ","405433":"\n  the way i behaved towards certain people in my past, the harm i inflicted on them cannot be undone and i've already come to terms with the fact that i'm the villain in a lot of people's stories and will not be forgiven.\n  ","405434":"\n  the only cartoons i like are adult-oriented cartoons, like bob's burgers, bojack horseman, rick & morty (although i've only seen a few episodes), and big mouth.\n  ","405435":"\n  the act of doing a good deed isn't meant to be remembered eternally. you should be doing good deeds to help people in their current moments or for their future, for *them* to remember and feel thankful during the time that they're alive.\n  ","405436":"\n  it can be for a variety of reasons, tbh. some people's thoughts scare them or they're toxic to their well being, especially in the case of mental illness.\n  ","405437":"\n  no, i like remaining cognizant of my surroundings. i only get fuzzy-minded when i'm *too* high or *too* drunk.\n  ","405438":"\n  it's different for everyone. for me personally, because of the strain i smoke, it happens gradually and my anxiety eases over time and i become quite content with my life and where i am in that present moment. my feeling of mindfulness increases and i'm valuing my time at that second as opposed to worrying about the future or dwelling on the past.\n  ","405439":"\n  yeah, definitely. when you're too busy doing things throughout the day, whether they're your chores or your work or whatever else, you don't have time to be alone with your thoughts.\n  ","405440":"\n  i wouldn't smoke marijuana if i didn't like the feeling of being high, lol.\n  ","405441":"\n  i think one of the biggest stereotypes that are actually true is that new yorkers are *always* in a rush. we don't stop to talk, we just do what we need to do and move on to the next thing we need to go. and if something is going slower than planned, you're going to have a lot of people complaining about it.\n  ","405442":"\n  only when i'm high.\n  ","405443":"\n  sometimes, yes. for example, i can't stay up past like 1:00am anymore

around those who live in new york.\n  ","405445":"\n  lol, no. i'm not physically attracted to much of anything these days.\n  ","405446":"\n  i think it varies depending on the individual. some people find it easier to revert back to a platonic relationship than others, and not every relationship is the same. there will always be some relationships that cannot exist outside of a romantic context for one reason or another, and instead of remaining friends, it's better for both people to remain separate.\n  \n  generally speaking though, it is definitely possible. i loved my best friend in a romantic context while we were dating as teenagers, and even after we broke up we remained close friends.\n  ","405447":"\n  personally, i don't think it's very important. i believe it's more important to have a substantial impact on others in a positive light while you're still alive.\n  ","405448":"\n  are you talking about someone's face versus someone's body? lol.\n  \n  in that case, i would probably go with face. i'm more attracted to people's faces than their bodies to begin with anyway, and the face expresses a lot more than someone's body does. however, i've never really put *too* much emphasis on someone's physical attraction and what i find attractive is varied depending on the individual.\n  ","405449":"\n  for the most part, yes. i recycle whenever i can and i use refillable bottles instead of plastic bottles.\n  ","405450":"\n  i listen to music on the drive to work and on the drive home from work, so that equals out to roughly 2 hours per day. i also sometimes listen to music when i'm home for about an hour or so as well, but it isn't every day.\n  ","405451":"\n  no, not particularly. i just believe in chance and coincidences.\n  ","405452":"\n  it isn't something i particularly care about.\n  ","405453":"\n  yeah, i feel like i'm misunderstood a lot when i try to discuss something that's on my mind. i can't express myself verbally very well, so often what comes out of my mouth isn't necessarily what i mean to say. in addition, some people find it hard to follow my thoughts because they're usually bouncing all over the place.\n  ","405454":"\n  no, my life hasn't been very easy (however, there are obviously people out there whose lives are much harder than mine). i've always tried to make the most out of what's been given to me, though, and i've always persevered regardless of what i've endured.\n  ","405455":"\n  if i hated my boss and my coworkers, then i wouldn't be at this job anymore, lol. i'm actually very close to my supervisor, and there are 2-3 coworkers whom i care about a lot.\n  ","405456":"\n  i don't have embarrassing dreams. lately i've been having nightmares more than anything else.\n  ","405457":"\n  yes, i own a few colourpop products and i like them a lot. i have a decent number of their lippie stix and a few eye shadows.\n  ","405458":"\n  i haven't tried their products since i was 20 years old, but i don't remember liking milani very much. their products were cheap, not pigmented at all, and didn't stay on very long.\n  ","405459":"\n  yes, i'm fine. i cried again 10 minutes ago too. :\/\n  \n  long story short, my boyfriend has been raising two big tanks of fish for the past 2-3 years. he has no choice but to give them away now and his heart is hurting because those fish are his babies, and he needs to find them a good, reliable home. i cried because i feel so terrible and at a loss at what to do for him. i wish there was some way i could help, so i've been asking everyone i know to see if they know trustworthy people who can adopt fish. i haven't had any luck so far. :\/\n  ","405460":"\n  lol, no. i'm a hygienic person, so there's no reason for them to complain or make remarks.\n  ","405461":"\n  no, i don't usually feel that strongly towards a person (except for maybe two individuals in my life). if i don't like someone, then i don't involve them in my life at all.\n  ","405462":"\n  my day was fine. i was training a new employee all afternoon, so that took up a majority of my time. i was extremely nervous to meet and train her, but she seems like a very intelligent, kind person. also, her writing is excellent which is a nice change from what i'm used to seeing when i have to train new employees, lol.\n  \n  i'm a bit sad now, though. i just received some disheartening news and i'm at a loss at what to do.\n  ","405463":"\n  thanks, much appreciated.\n  ","405464":"\n  i prefer taking selfies over other people taking photos of me.\n  ","405465":"\n  usually only 10-15 minutes. all i do is get dressed, take my medication, freshen up in the bathroom, pack my lunch, and leave the house.\n  ","405466":"\n  lol, no. i entered my relationship before tinder was developed.\n  ","405467":"\n  \"can you get me an iced coffee?\"\n  ","405468":"\n  tonight, haha.\n  ","405469":"\n  i've struggled with depression for most of my life.\n  ","405470":"\n  spicy tuna roll !!\n  ","405471":"\n  lol, in middle school & early high school, i was goth. then i was super scene\/emo throughout the rest of high school.\n  \n  then i went through a hippie stage where all i wore was floral dresses and maxi skirts with patterns on them. these days, i just dress for comfort. i wear mostly skinny jeans with boots and long flowy shirts with cardigans.\n  ","405472":"\n  i've never heard of that before. would that be similar to a guidance counselor?\n  ","405473":"\n  dude, we were literally 19-20 years old and in college, lmaoo. god forbid we have sex in the house we were living in.\n  ","405474":"\n  uh, like where? lol that was the only place where we somewhat had privacy.\n  ","405475":"\n  i knew i should have deleted the question smh. y'all are gross.\n  ","405476":"\n  lmao, yeah. my boyfriend's \"bedroom\" was actually just a corner of the basement at one point, and his bed was essentially at the bottom of the basement stairs. i can't tell you how many times his father knocked and immediately opened the basement door without giving us time to respond, lmaoo.\n  ","405477":"\n  none, as far as i can

communication. if i'm doing something wrong or i'm hurting others, i want my friends to be real with me and tell me what i'm doing. i don't want to befriend people who will sugarcoat the truth or put on a facade around me. i also value deep communication in that we can have stimulating conversations without judgment or fear.\n  ","405482":"\n  my boyfriend and i broke up during my first year of college for a few months. i went on a date in that time frame upon the suggestion of my roommate. the date started off well, but as i began to realize how i still loved my boyfriend, i became more upset to where the other person noticed. i ended up breaking down and venting about the issues that were going on between me and my boyfriend, lmaoo. i still feel bad for the dude.\n  ","405483":"\n  i overthink my interpersonal relationships and i'm constantly asking people if they're mad at me, lmaoo.\n  ","405484":"\n  settle for something less than what i deserve.\n  ","405485":"\n  yeah, although i'm not a great swimmer.\n  ","405486":"\n  fresh pots of coffee in the morning, sleeping in on lazy sundays, autumn days, seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile, laughing with friends until my face hurts, being complimented on something i'm proud of, cute animals, thunderstorms, and sitting in my bedroom with ambient lights on and music playing.\n  ","405487":"\n  not at all. it's actually becoming increasingly common for parents to have children when they're in their late 20s or 30s or even 40s in some cases.\n  ","405488":"\n  no, it's all in good fun.\n  ","405489":"\n  haha, i did some research on my number neighbors and one is the number to a cleaning service and the other one is an older woman who probably has no idea what a number neighbor is.\n  ","405490":"\n  i agree with you. that's what i said in my first post.\n  ","405491":"\n  exsanguination.\n  ","405492":"\n  i really value the painting my boyfriend commissioned my friend to paint for me. it's a collage of various people and objects from fallout 4 and it came out absolutely magnificent.\n  ","405493":"\n  there's always been this societal expectation for people to begin experimenting with sex from a young age. it's basically normalized in society at this point, even though there have been studies done on how it's detrimental to a child's health since they aren't properly developed yet both physically and mentally.\n  ","405494":"\n  \"good as hell\" by lizzo ;\n  \n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/SmbmeOgWsqE\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","405495":"\n  yeah, i agree with that for the most part. however, it's fairly unrealistic to expect kids not to have sex until they reach 18 and the best thing we can do is provide a lot of education on safe sex practices for when they do decide to begin having sex.\n  ","405496":"\n  i always feel terrible if i get absolutely no sleep -- it wrecks havoc on my body, between being exhausted and having a headache and having a stomach ache and being sore everywhere. i would much rather have at least a few hours of sleep, i normally wake up at my alarm anyway.\n  ","405497":"\n  bring it up to HR immediately and see that the

both used to work in construction and various trades, particularly plumbing and carpentry and HVAC.\n  ","405502":"\n  i'm sorry that you don't have much trust in your friendships and relationships.

friend?\n  \n  my boyfriend is handsome imo. my boyfriend's best friend is average to me, he isn't really my \"type.\"\n  ","405507":"\n  this may be true for some relationships, but not mine. my boyfriend and i trust each other and he encourages this next step in my life. he's fully supportive of me moving in with his best friend, he's honestly so excited.\n  \n  it comes down to trust, and believe me when i say there has never and will never be anything going on between myself and his best friend, lmaoo.\n  ","405508":"\n  ???\n  \n  it's still cheating regardless of a person's gender. just like i would consider it cheating if he slept with a man outside of our relationship.\n  ","405509":"\n  statistics are irrelevant in this scenario, lol. if i wasn't comfortable moving in with my boyfriend's best friend then i simply wouldn't do it.\n  \n  y'all also forget i'm bisexual, it isn't only men i'm attracted to. if i moved in with a woman then there's just as much \"opportunity\" there.\n  ","405510":"\n  like i just stated, y'all must have no trust in your relationships.\n  ","405511":"\n  ???\n  \n  why would that be suspicious? lmaoo. we both need a place to live, we're good friends and have been friends for almost a decade, and there's nothing wrong with two friends moving in together. y'all must have no trust in your relationships.\n  ","405512":"\n  he's my boyfriend's best friend, lol.\n  ","405513":"\n  he's very responsible so i don't see any issues with living with him. he also works two jobs so i'll probably hardly see him at all. we've known each other for eight years.\n  ","405514":"\n  first, i would pay off all of my debt. then i would purchase a house to live in, a new wardrobe, brand new furniture and decor and paintings to furnish the house, and adopt a lot of pets. i would also like to donate money to various charities, like JDRF, the ASPCA, and the national alliance on mental illness.\n  ","405515":"\n  most people are rude to others because they're insecure with themselves and feel threatened when faced with any sort of disagreement or opposition. instead of accepting other people's opinions for what they are or opening their mind to new possibilities, they seclude themselves and act out harshly and irrationally to preserve their own sense of pride.\n  ","405516":"\n  ingesting large amounts of coffee and alcohol in

his father while he was on vacation, lmaoo. it was just for one day, and then we drove back home at night.\n  ","405518":"\n  i'm not sure why some people get angry or annoyed, it seems like an awfully insignificant thing to get mad about. i use the terms women\/men to refer to adults, while boys\/girls are reserved for children and teenagers.\n  ","405519":"\n  talk about a blast from the past, LOL. that song came out when i was in high school.\n  ","405520":"\n  just be yourself. the right woman will come along, and if you act like yourself then they'll begin to like the real you. you don't have to worry about behaving out of character and you can be completely comfortable with being who you are all the time when you're with her.\n  ","405521":"\n  my first instinct is to pay off all of my debt, but it would be lovely to use that money to travel the world.\n  ","405522":"\n  no, definitely not. not everything happens for a particular reason, and most of the time things happen simply because that's how the dominoes have fallen. there's no rhyme or reason to it.\n  ","405523":"\n  i thought someone i cared for had died because they overdosed on drugs in the bathroom of the hotel room we were staying in. i was trying to wake them up with everything in me, and they wouldn't budge for at least 15 minutes. finally, they came to but they were extremely groggy. but those 15 minutes were the scariest moments.\n  ","405524":"\n  no, i believe obtaining closure and moving on is the ultimate revenge. when you show someone that you've moved on with your life when they haven't, it puts them in their rightful place and shows them that you simply do not care anymore.\n  ","405525":"\n  i'm doing well -- quite optimistic for the future, but also nervous at the same time. while i'm comfortable with change, i can't help but feel anxious over everything that could possibly go wrong, lmaoo.\n  \n  i just got back from my doctor's appointment, and now i'm back to sitting on my laptop and drinking coffee.\n  ","405526":"\n  the silence of the night after the first snowfall, the crackling of a campfire, classical piano and violin melodies, my boyfriend's laughter, and the sound of the coffee machine brewing (lol).\n  ","405527":"\n  i think it varies from individual to individual. there's no set time frame where you can get to know someone deeply, because some people take years for them to open up while other people are open books from the beginning.\n  ","405528":"\n  the book girl interrupted by susanna kaysen had the biggest impact on me

aquarium and see all the fish and sharks while sampling wine, beer, and vodka, which was a lot of fun.\n  ","405569":"\n  i really want to get back into reading, but my attention span is basically nonexistent at this point and it's hard for me to even get through 20 pages in one sitting.\n  ","405570":"\n  i don't meet new people, haha. the last new people i met were from my job. i'm pretty close to 2-3 of my coworkers.\n  ","405571":"\n  for me personally, i always love spending vacations either in upstate new york or somewhere else like the north fork of long island or montauk. i love the nature environments, from forests and mountains to the beach.\n  ","405572":"\n  depends on my mood. i like alternative rock, indie, hip hop, and classical music the most.\n  ","405573":"\n  no problem at all !! like i said, if they're a nice person then they'll understand completely. there's nothing wrong with taking time out to focus on yourself outside of relationships.\n  ","405574":"\n  yes, that's perfectly fine !! if someone asks you out, you're not obligated to say yes. if you're not comfortable dating yet, then there's nothing wrong with turning down a date. if the person is a genuine and understanding individual, they'll completely understand. if they don't, then they're not the type of person you want to really be talking to anyway.\n  \n  honestly, the best way to turn down the date is to simply be honest. say something like, \"i appreciate the offer but i'm not ready to enter the dating scene yet\" or whatever you're most comfortable saying.\n  ","405575":"\n  coffee, pls.\n  ","405576":"\n  no, i don't believe there's anything wrong with being shy. not unless you're so shy that you're allowing everyone to walk all over you, at least. but there's a difference between being shy and not being assertive enough to stand up for yourself.\n  ","405577":"\n  i'm not different from anyone else on this earth.\n  ","405578":"\n  no, i've been through too much sh*t in my life to have those sorts of feelings. humans are mortal creatures and we all have an expiration date. we're all vulnerable to something.\n  ","405579":"\n  that's something that the parents would have to work out among themselves, regarding who has what responsibilities in terms of childcare. if the mother lives with the child and the father doesn't live with them and only sees the child occasionally, then i don't believe that could be an \"equal\" effort.\n  \n  if the parents took turns in watching the child, for example, then that would be more of an equal effort because the child would spend equal time with both the mother and father.\n  ","405580":"\n  grilled salmon.\n  ","405581":"\n  i thought that by this time in my life, i would have my sh*t together already.\n  ","405582":"\n  i read online articles to obtain my news instead of reading the newspaper or watching television. it's easier and better to find the news online from different sources instead of basing your knowledge of something off of one media source.\n  ","405583":"\n  -- publish a book.\n  \n  -- travel to alaska.\n  \n  -- go ziplining through a forest.\n  ","405584":"\n  i would probably quit my job and go into massive debt by spending money to travel without having a viable source of income.\n  ","405585":"\n  anxiety, LOL.\n  \n  i've been panicking about this stupid work party all morning and afternoon, ranging from what to wear to how i should wear my hair and my makeup, to what color i should paint my nails, to the daunting aspect of showering, etc etc. my face is breaking out in pimples and blemishes too, which is driving me wild.\n  ","405586":"\n  getting a promotion & a raise at work this past week. :'))\n  ","405587":"\n  i don't really know what you mean by a \"philandering situation.\" you'll have to be more specific.\n  ","405588":"\n  if i had a dollar for every time this was said to me, i would be rich.\n  ","405589":"\n  i'm all right, just a bit tired (but that isn't out of the ordinary). i'm getting ready to go to a cocktail party my job is hosting tonight, it should be fun but i'm extremely anxious about the entire situation.\n  ","405590":"\n  my dream is to live in a grand house with my boyfriend and our prospective pets, which will consist of many puppies, a few cats, lizards, guinea pigs, and lots of fish.\n  ","405591":"\n  uh, was this supposed to go with the other message thread re: the 27 year old man? lol.\n  \n  if so, then you're welcome and i'm sorry that things didn't work out the way you anticipated. try not to think about it as wasted time as much as it can be a learning experience for you both. :'))\n  ","405592":"\n  yes, i especially love hot vanilla chai.\n  ","405593":"\n  i speed walk on the treadmill, lol.\n  "}}
