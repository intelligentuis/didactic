   1. Okay so for the past couple of weeks I've been getting upset easily by the things that my girlfriend does and ik she doesn't do it on purpose but it seems like she does and act like she doesn't care and every time I tell her about it she would just say sorry but do something else that upsets me..

   Do you ever feel like you don't have a voice. Inside your family, friends, or even in your own relationship? When you feel silenced, what do you do to fight back? Do you ever feel like your opinions are unheard and dismissed because others tell you you're wrong and they're absurd?
