  When a guy hits 13 is when they become sex thirsty. That goes away when they reach about 26-30. Women do not get the hormonal change and sex drive till their 20s

  Hormones. Boys are like that  till their 30s and girls come into the sex scene around 20.
  "
870233,"
   Ahan so why everybody is looking for sex??
  ","
  People are desperate and believe that is the only way to be in a relationship and keep it together. But loyalty, respect, and trust is what keeps a relationship together. If you HAVE to have sex to keep the fire going, then the relationship isn't for you. A relationship should be able to thrive without sex. Sex is something that happens yes but it isn't a necessity for a relationship

  I do. But you cannot have sex your entire life. If you say life begins at conception then it is impossible as you are not born. Even if you are born it is pedophilia if that happens and not a lot of people do it anyway. The normal age for sex is 15 to 19. Do you need more scientific facts?

   What does DDLG entail? Do you just act like a kid and have your boyfriend pretend to be your dad or something?
  ","
  Not really. The 'daddy' is a caregiver. As a little i have this thing called little space that i sink into when i get anxious or upset. The caregiver helps keep you safe. They are basically your keeper and owner, hence the bdsm entailment. Most punishments for disobeying rules involve spankings, time out, no dessert--basically what little kids get when they are in trouble. These rules are made prior to the agreement to enter into this type of relationship. I mean the sex if you have it is rough and the caregiver is the dominant. But if you Google it then you will learn more. :)

  Oh man. Okay. So they have to be nice and caring of course. I'm not a very sexual person so they have to realize that. I am also very sensitive and easily upset. I tend to withdraw from society so that's another thing. They also have to be willing to hug and kiss me whenever they can. I get lonely so I need texts alot. They have to be dominant. Not a switch Because I can try to be dominant but I can't. So I will always be a little. They also have to be cuddly and always there. Since I'm genderfluid they have to love me for me and respect that sometimes I'm Kammy and not Krissy. Just stuff like that.

   Which movie do you think is overrated?
  ","
  heheheh finally!
  
  The fault in our stars. it's so stupid. it doesn't follow the book at all because the boy dies and she has cancer. in the book she dies not him. the movie was so boring as well and the premise was stupid as hell. I watched it with my friends and zoned out for half of it. the best part was when the blind guy said ""I couldn't see a world without you"" and my friend Gabby said ""YOU COULDN'T SEE A WORLD WITH US EITHER *bu dum tiss*"" but anyway it was highly over recommended to everyone. it should have never been made

  Never Drink until 21
  
  Never have sex till you're married
  
  Never kill
  
  Never do drugs
  
  Never steal.
  
  PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN WHEN DRIVING DONT TEXT AND DRIVE
  
  You may think this is stupid but to be honest, this will make your life easier. If you have sex, you do realize that you're probably being used. Look it'll make everything better. No drinking means more brain cells and better decision making. No drugs means you actually go somewhere in life. You can wait for sex. I mean babies are amazing but I am saying that you've thrown your life away. Sex is the binding of a good married relationship not dating. This does not apply to lesbians or gay men. Like you're gonna get pregnant from your fingers or having a dick in your ass.
  
  Don't steal meaning pay for everything. Don't lie. People will like you better. Do not text and drive. Do not drink and drive. It could ruin your life.
  "
