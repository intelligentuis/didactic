the worse thing . usually an obsession comes from a need that s not being met or they have trust issues . being obsessive about something has its positives and its pitfalls , deciding whether you are truly willing to go the distance is the hard question to answer . being obsessed with someone , i truly believe is not a healthy way to live life , just all too many negatives .","726196":"it is , but it depends on how you are treating your life . if one cares about what others think about you or trying to please everyone then you will have a rough time . so you can t do that , never feel inferior

controlled by the politics , corporations , news media , even cults . no one should dictate the terms of what you should try and take in life . last but not least , treat yourself . everyone needs

instagram . because my friend ended up getting her account disabled for no reason at all and she s been sending appeals since sunday and hasn t heard anything back . instagram and facebook has some of the worst customer service . takes you forever to hear from someone and you re absolutely extremely lucky to be able to talk to a human on the other end .","726909":"text most of the time , but i call

be .","726919":"no i don t .","726920":"nah , why get kingdom come when i have games like elder scrolls , , and eso . or the witcher , and . or dragon age origins . they are the same game just about

the world has already became used to it .","726933":"star wars","726934":"i reached into the fridge to drink something that looked like coke , turns out someone left a glass of vanilla extract . i had

simple . i was thinking homemade chili on sunday because it s going to get really cold out here we may even see snow falling for once . today will probably be something simple , like a country meal . mashed potatoes , gravy , buttermilk biscuits , fries with chicken strips breaded .","726943":"yeah one time . i had to wash a pair of jeans . i think it was like two or three months , realize money was still in the pocket lol . money wasn t damaged neither .","726944":"i always think about waking up the next morning refreshed and healthy . because you never know what could happen in you re

.","726950":"planet earth","726951":"good things its a very secure job . if you get tired of one nursing job , you can transfer to the other easily . you learn a lot about people . however difficult a shift might be , you certainly don t go home feeling that you didn t achieve anything worthwhile . once you get some experience as a nurse , you re likely to be in demand wherever you go . worse things would be working weekends , exposure to ever germ , virus , body fluids in existence . being used as a punching bag by angry patients and families . following proper nursing procedure and providing customer satisfaction , so much balancing between the two . professional development and lack of control over workload .","726952":"at one point we was not allowed to wear scrubs with pockets long ago . but that was when i was a nurse aide . now i am free to wear whatever i want to .","726953":"tortilla chips with refried beans and salsa .","726954":"it did actually . if anything

rap , that weird kind of music i think they call it synthwave , vaporwave .","726957":"talking about mental health and no one judging you for it .","726958":"i don t care what you post , coke is some delicious soda . you don t know what you are missing .","726959":"a possibility of snow . for once most of the state of texas may have some snow .","726960":"the ice bucket challenge for als","726961":"no we cannot bullet because i saw the things you were saying to one of the people that i follow , she did not deserve that you know . so i suggest you take yourself and your negativity elsewhere .","726962":"water . it s clear , it s very refreshing , it should be like a bluish color .","726963":"that is the first thing that popped up into my mind when you asked me that too

of pissed off though because my best friend s instagram got wrongfully disabled and she s been trying to get it back since sunday .","726978":"racism and misogyny hopefully , its not bad like it was in say , but right now it is widespread because of bad influences religious front i expect to see more atheism , agnostic , or practice no particular religion its growing and i think it will continue to grow , but still to this day they will not accept anyone like that in office , that might change when most of this generation and next passes on into the next life . bullying in schools , will also change . because you see year old s carrying tablets and phones . hell i was lucky i had my first phone and computer to myself when i was . videos and pictures are always taken , so no one will be getting away with that .","726979":"respect","726980":"i only judge people by basis of the conversations , discussions , body language , positivity in sharing and honesty . process of opinion is held while i give the benefit of the doubt . if they screw up then yeah .","726981":"yes you should !","726982":"https www . youtube . com watch ? v sym rjwsgq ab channel tovelovevo","726983":"when i was a
