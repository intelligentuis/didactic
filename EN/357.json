traffic), fun, and noisy.\n  \n  i say fun because when i go down to town, there are dozens of restaurants, bars, and a brewery that i can go to, as well as some shops here and there. however, it's also noisy where i live because the fire department is so close to my house.\n  ","383158":"\n  neither, i've never owned either of those brands.\n  ","383159":"\n  it really depends on how i'm

my friend tonight, though. her birthday is tomorrow and she was having a few friends over, but the anxiety of possibly taking an uber to see her was too much for me and i don't have the energy to be

either care too much or not at all, with nothing in between. when i don't care at all, i realize i can be manipulative and hurt other people, so i've tried to remain more cognizant of my actions and words, especially toward my friends. when i care too much, that tends to hurt me more than anything else because i over-analyze everything my friends say to me, and it makes me believe that i'm a burden to them.\n  ","383175":"\n  i suppose my fears of abandonment and enclosed spaces can be considered irrational fears, as well as my anxiety regarding driving and being in places with a lot of

young college kids was offensive.\n  ","383195":"\n  i'm just providing explanations, obviously not excuses. most of us were raised to act and behave in problematic ways, and it's ultimately up to us

inappropriately towards me or others.\n  ","383451":"\n  eh, probably not, although it depends on what that opportunity is. however, if it's regarding money (i.e. winning the lottery) then i would still work my regular job just to keep a routine schedule and keep myself busy.\n  ","383452":"\n  i've written plenty of letters before, although i can't remember the last time i wrote one.\n

commuting.\n  ","383454":"\n  yeah, we would make it work somehow, whether it's through us learning together how to cook better or just ordering takeout more often.\n  ","383455":"\n  probably the best cook i've ever met, considering i don't know how to cook well at all, haha.\n  ","383456":"\n  thankfully, i do enjoy my job a lot \u2014 it's within my field of choice and i like the actual work

between me and my ex, and my ex lost feelings for me towards the end of the relationship regardless of how much we tried working through it.\n  \n  they just weren't there anymore, and i dont blame him for anything because i know it was out of his control, especially since we did try to work on it as best we could. it just happens sometimes.\n  ","383475":"\n  i mean, chances are they *did* love you & you're not a fool, but you won't know for certain until you two have a civil and mature discussion about it. sometimes people's feelings diminish over time & it isn't necessarily a reflection of us. it also doesn't mean they never loved you during the time you were together either.\n  ","383476":"\n  i've had veggie burgers (boca burgers!) before & at this point, i prefer them over beef burgers. they're so delicious, especially paired with lettuce and tomato.\n  \n  i need to find a good vegan cheese alternative, though. i've just been using real cheese on them.\n  ","383477":"\n

valerian root to help me sleep at night, b12 for energy, and 5htp for anxiety.\n  ","383482":"\n  considering i've been on the opposite end of this, as the person struggling with mental illness, i can assume that your girlfriend is likely aware of this and feels bad about it already, and she's probably unsure of what to do herself.\n  \n  if you haven't tried already, have an open discussion with her about these feelings and see if you two can create a plan for when she's in a bad place, i.e. doing things for her that may make her life easier while she's in an episode or just being there for her and caring when she needs it most.\n  \n  also, if she isn't already doing this, suggest therapy\/medication (if that's something she's able to do). the combination of having medication and going to therapy does wonders for a lot of people with mental illness, especially bipolar disorder.\n  ","383483":"\n  i can agree with this, yes. as you take on more responsibilities, you start to realize what's genuinely important in your life versus what is a bit insignificant in the long run, and you have to adjust accordingly.\n  \n  of course, this unfortunately does not apply to *all* adults as some adults are still quite immature and irresponsible.\n  ","383484":"\n  early 2000s alternative rock, emo, and pop punk.\n  ","383485":"\n  yeah, until they give me a reason not to be nice anymore.\n  ","383486":"\n  the COVID pandemic is definitely the worst thing to happen in 2020, considering the devastating impact it has had on the general population, between people passing away

fund in honor of his late mother.\n  ","383488":"\n  the idea of wearing a mask is that you're protecting other people \u2014 not protecting yourself. therefore, if you don't wear a mask, then you evidently don't care about spreading COVID or any other illness to other people should you have it.\n  ","383489":"\n  no. the \"desired effect\" is what that person who is wearing makeup wants to do. there's no such thing as too much makeup, it's each person's individual decision to make and they're allowed to wear as much or as little makeup as they want.\n  ","383490":"\n  no, i've never tried cutting my own hair because i have zero experience with it & i *know* i would regret it immediately.\n  ","383491":"\n  yeah, i believe there can be multiple special people\/significant others for everyone. i've never believed in the whole \"everyone has only one soulmate\" thing.\n  ","383492":"\n  yes, although i honestly don't think i would do it anymore.\n  ","383493":"\n  i don't think it's disrespectful \u2014 they took the time to think of you & purchase you something as a gift. it isn't the gift that matters in the end, it's the fact that they thought of you and went out of their way to give you something that they thought you would appreciate.\n  ","383494":"\n  askfm, haha.\n  ","383495":"\n  nobody is obligated to talk about anything, on the internet or otherwise, that they don't want to talk about. if someone doesn't feel comfortable discussing religion, then they have the freedom to express that.\n  \n  and just because you're on the internet doesn't mean that you're required to talk about *everything* about your life. some things are private for people & that's perfectly okay.\n  ","383496":"\n  yes, i went camping for the first time back in october !! it was super fun & i would definitely do it again.\n  ","383497":"\n  it's a bit on the warm side, and it was also drizzling when i was out earlier.\n  ","383498":"\n  no, besides the nearly constant back

best way to go about it is through constructive criticism \u2014 which means offering a critique of your work or if you have a problematic opinion, as well as offering a solution on how to better yourself.\n  ","383503":"\n  my friends ask me for advice every now and again, yes. usually related to job things or relationship problems.\n  ","383504":"\n  no, i seldom dance & when i do, it's

failed nanowrimo this year, but that's okay. this is the furthest i've gotten in the past two years i've been participating (i'm up to 10,000 words).\n  \n  i'm trying to get further, perhaps to 12,000 or even 15,000 words, this week but i can't seem to get into the groove right now. i have two unfinished short pieces of creative non-fiction, but because i'm not in the same mindset as i was when i first started writing them, it's difficult to get back into the swing of it.\n  ","383510":"\n  i always let it dry naturally. i never have anywhere to go these days, so there's really no point

lol. i literally know absolutely nobody who has waited until marriage.\n  ","383520":"\n  \"why did i do this?\"\n  \n  lmaoo. this is sorta related to the last question i answered, but usually the morning after whatever activities i took part in, i ask myself why i even thought it was a good idea. then i realize that i didn't care at the time, i deal with the consequences, and then the cycle repeats.\n  ","383521":"\n  i don't need to justify myself in making bad decisions \u2014 i just do them without a second thought. i'm fairly impulsive and do things on a whim according to my own desires at the time.\n  ","383522":"\n  box recipe, lmaoo. i've never made anything from scratch before really, i'm terrible at cooking.\n  ","383523":"\n  i focus on smaller segments that compose of

COVID. a lot of places are flaring up again and going into another lockdown.\n  ","383526":"\n  i can't pick just one, but they're les miserables, sweeney todd, and the lord of the rings trilogy.\n  ","383527":"\n  my friends (mostly ex-friends) and i made it a habit to constantly steal street signs and other government property when we were much younger, especially cones and barrels. we've also stolen the entire street sign including the pole, stop signs, construction signs, and big road signs that say the exit number and stuff.\n  ","383528":"\n  i've only been awake for about an hour, so it's going well. i slept well last night & i'm relaxing with a few cups of coffee before playing video games, probably.\n  ","383529":"\n  no, most of my dreams are nightmares or just flat out bizarre.\n  ","383530":"\n  this is true, yes, if there were significant problems stemming from the person's past relationship (particularly if they were the perpetrator). i was mainly talking about standard relationships, though, especially with respect to people's sexual history.\n  ","383531":"\n  my friend is a licensed hairdresser, so i go to her to cut and color my hair. i've never done it myself before, i don't trust myself doing my own hair.\n  ","383532":"\n  absolutely nothing, considering i've been awake for less than an hour, lol. i made breakfast and coffee \u2014 that's all.\n

while though.\n  ","383544":"\n  depends on your personal views toward sex. some people like pushing the boundaries & experimenting, while others play it simple.\n  ","383545":"\n  no, it isn't necessary. most people, in my experience, don't feel the need to share every detail about their past relationships. it doesn't affect the current relationship.\n  ","383546":"\n  if something isn't my fault, then there's no sense in me apologizing. i used to do that a lot when i was younger \u2014 i would apologize even when something wasn't my fault just to end the argument \u2014 but currently, i'm not willing to do that anymore.\n  ","383547":"\n  all of my years blend together, so i honestly have zero idea.\n  ","383548":"\n  spending time together, personally. some people might choose the

expect my friends to be honest with me, whether it's something they're going through and they feel comfortable enough to speak to me about it, or they feel that i did something wrong or i'm being

never heard of the second one before.\n  ","383555":"\n  i wanted to be the complete opposite from them. i can't remember my actual childhood, but i do remember most of my teenage years, and the

day.\n  ","383556":"\n  i've come close to tears, but i've never legitimately cried out of happiness before (at least that i can recall).\n  ","383557":"\n  gossip about family members, smh. whenever

shoes, to see from their perspective.\n  ","383560":"\n  i haven't watched the movie in such a long time ever since they took it off of netflix here, but i've debated on buying the movie because i

arrows on the floor and keep my distance from others while wearing my mask. i try to get in & out as fast as possible, which lately has been more difficult because the grocery store i go to completely changed all of their planograms, and i have no idea where anything is anymore. lmao.\n  ","383563":"\n  i don't believe i've watched a scary movie that wasn't specifically a horror movie, lol. i also

 i would consider that to be a big age gap, yeah. even though you're legally an adult at the age of 18, you're still very much a teenager and just graduating from high school. someone who's 25, on the other hand, is an established adult who in some cases has already graduated from college with a career.\n  \n  it comes down to where each person is in their life, and generally 18 versus 25, those

his father (playfully, obviously), and they ended up breaking his closet door and a snack table. my one friend went home with another distant friend of ours who just happened to be there, and they hooked up. my other friend started making out with my roommate's dad's girlfriend. meanwhile, i slept through the entire thing. lmao.\n  ","383569":"\n  i would rather hear an uncomfortable truth. most lies eventually are revealed in the long run, and i would much rather hear the truth now as opposed to finding out later, especially if it's through someone else.\n  ","383570":"\n  i think that would be passive aggressive, yeah, because they're not saying it directly to you. for example, if a person was insulting you to someone else with the intent that you will eventually hear\/see it, then that is very passive aggressive.\n  ","383571":"\n  i'm both a cat person & a dog person, or just an animal person in general. i've had cats, dogs, and fish, and several of my friends also have various lizards and small animals like rodents.\n  ","383572":"\n  i believe our physical body perishes, but our souls\/spirits (whatever you want to call it) are transferred to another medium into

underserved communities, and we're still very much a part of nature and the ecosystem in itself. humans aren't inherently bad, and it's mainly major corporations and government entities that are inflicting harm upon the earth.\n  \n  a lot of people push the idea, when they say \"we are the virus,\" that we're almost *deserving* of a new plague, so to speak, and i think that's honestly

medical professional first.\n  \n  there's a reason why doctors go through years upon years of schooling and medical training \u2014 it's all about the cross-examination of symptoms because symptoms of numerous disorders can overlap, and it isn't the responsibility of the layperson to make that determination themselves.\n  \n  this is most prevalent in mental health communities online, i've

than content with staying home and taking part in my favorite hobbies.\n  ","383987":"\n  it could be for a variety of reasons. some people are simply more comfortable expressing themselves online via text as opposed to in person, and more of their personality comes out online via social media compared to IRL.\n  \n  it isn't necessarily a bad thing. you are who you are regardless of whether your presence is online or IRL, and there's honestly more freedom of expression on the internet, which prompts others to be more expressive and honest with themselves.\n  ","383988":"\n  i'd rather be

not sure if they're even going to be open now that the restrictions are being put in place tomorrow, though.\n  ","384047":"\n  i definitely recommend martha clara vineyards and pindar. pindar has some of my favorite wines.\n  \n  as for beer, moustache brewing company in riverhead is ridiculously good, and there are also breweries in nassau county that i love (like south shore brewing company in oceanside).\n  ","384048":"\n  i don't go out very often, but i have seen it on a few occasions, yes.\n  ","384049":"\n  the vineyards out east are the best, and there's so much variety now -- you not only have the wineries, but also vodka distilleries and i think even a moonshine distillery. in riverhead, there's also a ciderhouse if you like cider.\n  ","384050":"\n  tbh, i'm happy i stuck with xbox because the halo series are among my favorite games. i can't afford to have both a playstation and an xbox, and i don't play video games every night anyway.\n  ","384051":"\n  i can only hope that the government will increase unemployment again and perhaps send out another stimulus package. however, i think the idea of lessening the amount of people going out is going to help stop the spread of COVID.\n  ","384052":"\n  YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO MONTAUK?\n  \n  i love montauk, rofl. granted, one of my favorite places there is the montauk brewery because i love their beer, but their music festival was always amazing.\n  ","384053":"\n  no, not really. i prefer xbox consoles over the playstation consoles, but i've never stuck solely to the xbox brand. i've played a few games on playstation in the past, particularly playstation exclusives like \"until dawn.\"\n  ","384054":"\n  i've traveled by the statue of liberty on one occasion, but it was by a regular boat, not necessarily a ferry. i never landed on the shore or went inside of the statue.\n  ","384055":"\n  yeah, i've seen a few. one of my favorites was \"what ever happened to baby jane?\" because of how creepy it was.\n  ","384056":"\n  the N64 gamepad was definitely the most comfortable, although i really do like the xbox one controllers -- they're so much more comfortable than the original xbox controllers, which were basically blocks and were too big for my hands, lol.\n  ","384057":"\n  LOL. i've never been on a ferry before, actually.\n  ","384058":"\n  i'm not sure why there's a crying emoji, considering cases have skyrocketed recently here in new york and it's the best course of action for the state (as a whole) to take.\n  \n  it isn't necessarily a \"lockdown\" -- it's just further restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID. businesses\/bars\/restaurants cannot let patrons in after 10:00pm, including gyms, and we're not allowed to congregate in groups more than 10 people. i'm not exactly sure how they're going to enforce the latter rule, but regardless, it's the best course of action to take right now.\n  ","384059":"\n  send me questions, my inbox is empty ~~\n  ","384060":"\n  uh, i'm definitely not trained in any kind of medicine whatsoever. if you're in medical need, then you should consult an *actual* doctor, not a stranger on a social media

tell you -- if during this process, you need any support whatsoever, i'm here for you. i understand how you're feeling and if you need to vent or anything, my inbox (here and facebook and instagram, whichever) is always open.\n  ","384065":"\n  i went out and bought two six-packs of beer this evening. going to be a liquid dinner, folks.\n  ","384066":"\n  i don't usually have big ideas to begin with.\n  ","384067":"\n  i don't tell people about my ideas, so this doesn't really apply to me.\n  ","384068":"\n  sit down with them and tell them that they're not behaving appropriately, that they're making me feel inferior to them (whether or not that was their intention), and instead of being cocky, they should at least be educating me on the topic with encouragement.\n  ","384069":"\n  i don't normally eat cake. i used to like cannoli cake, but i don't like the taste of sweets anymore.\n  ","384070":"\n  i mean ... i'm no expert on genes, but it's a lot more complicated than xx and xy, for starters.\n  \n  however, it all comes down to your own self-perception and the comfort you feel within your own body. people who are trans and non-binary usually feel as if they're trapped in a body that isn't their own. it's difficult for me to describe.\n  ","384071":"\n  my day has been fine, although i feel a bit sad now. my friends invited me to play among us with them tonight, but i'm not feeling up to it at all. i'd rather just spent the night trying to write and listen to music.\n  ","384072":"\n  yes, i've been in love twice before.\n  ","384073":"\n  male and female are sexes, not genders. your sex is determined by your chromosomes, meanwhile gender is somewhat of a construct that exists on a spectrum. people who refuse to listen to trans individuals regarding gender identity are usually stubborn and close-minded.\n  ","384074":"\n  i used to see a lot of assumptions online that cats were selfish, cold-hearted animals who only cared about themselves and didn't express love toward their owners. prior to owning cats myself, i kinda thought the same thing and preferred dogs over cats. however, after living with cats for over a year now, i've grown to really love them and their unique personalities, and i'm thankful that the cats in this house have all been extremely loving and affectionate.\n  ","384075":"\n  i love him as a friend, but my romantic feelings have dwindled significantly since we broke up. after all, it has been over a year.\n  ","384076":"\n  i wouldn't agree to the proposition because i prefer monogamy over polyamory, and even if we were polyamorous, i probably wouldn't choose to date anyone else so it would be pretty one-sided.\n  ","384077":"\n  i would rather be immortalized with the words i've written, if i ever decide to write a book and become published.\n  ","384078":"\n  ???\n  \n  my ex and i are still close friends. i can consider him a strong person without romantic feelings being involved.\n  ","384079":"\n  yes, i'm always willing to listen to my friends when they're going through a hard time, regardless of how i'm feeling myself. i would rather focus my attention on other people's issues and giving them advice as opposed to my own problems, lol.\n  ","384080":"\n  my best friend and my ex are the strongest people i know. they've both been through a lot of hardship, but have come through to the other side with confidence and renewed strength. they both constantly try to better themselves every day.\n  ","384081":"\n  i don't normally keep up with technology, and i'm also not very tech-savvy. i just upgraded to windows 10 a few months ago, lol.\n  ","384082":"\n  monogamy, for the most part. although i'm fine with being single at the moment.\n  ","384083":"\n  i'd offer them a lending ear and a shoulder to cry on if they needed it. i wouldn't enforce myself on them or anything because people do grieve differently, but i would make it very clear that i'm there to support them in any way possible.\n  ","384084":"\n  i would not want to be immortalized in such a way, even if i did accomplish something great in life. nevertheless, if it *had* to happen, i would probably be situated at a laptop on a desk with a glass of wine next to me while i would be typing fervently.\n  ","384085":"\n  loud noises, a lot of commotion going on including people talking at once, and just basically anything that's overly stimulating where i can't mentally process everything that's going on.\n  ","384086":"\n  i'd rather get away with a crime and live with the knowledge that someone could eventually find out. at least then i'd be able to live my everyday life.\n  ","384087":"\n  i went on a date with a guy when i was a freshman in college while my ex and i were on a \"break,\" and i honestly had no idea what i was doing or why i even went on the date to begin with. my ex was going through a lot of hardship at the time & i still loved him, so while the date with the guy went well in the beginning, it ended up me venting about my ex's situation and how overwhelmed and worried i was.\n  \n  i'm sure the guy didn't appreciate it at all, lol. but he was extremely nice about it and tried to help me.\n  ","384088":"\n  i don't feel comfortable in the majority of public places with the exception of one bar i used to frequent (and only when the bar was empty).\n  ","384089":"\n

","384093":"\n  i don't use any apps specifically for messaging, so i honestly don't know. i just use texting the majority of the time, otherwise i'll sometimes use facebook messenger or instagram DMs.\n  ","384094":"\n  i can't really compare it to being trans because i've never felt 100% a woman or a man, but non-binary has always suited me best because of that reason. it is a bit of a pain, though, because while i present as feminine, people assume i'm cis and call me feminine descriptors\/pronouns even after i've corrected them.\n  ","384095":"\n  i don't go to parties anymore \u2014

them out of obligation on birthdays and holidays. my true support system consists of my friends.\n  ","384115":"\n  i wouldn't go so far as to consider it a red flag, because every situation is different. however, ideally a person should leverage their family obligations with their relationship equally, and understand that there is a place and time for everything. if your family is important to you while you're in a relationship, you have to find a balance.\n  ","384116":"\n  i try not to, but sometimes it happens.\n  ","384117":"\n  i don't think i can give a definitive answer to this question, because it has to depend on a variety of factors -- what those opposites are, whether they complement each other or detract from one another, and how it affects the relationship as a whole.\n  \n  in certain times, i think it's healthy to be in a relationship with someone who may be somewhat opposite from you, because it can introduce new perspectives and make you see things in a different light -- but this might only work if both people are open to looking at new things. it can become a problem if either person in the relationship are too stubborn to look at things differently or try to understand from a different point of view.\n  ","384118":"\n  if you've already talked about this to him multiple times and he hasn't changed, then this seems like something he has to realize for himself. however, i would advise you to *not* apologize when things aren't your fault and stand your ground. perhaps that change of scenery might help him realize that he needs to take accountability.\n  \n  if this continues on and gets worse, though ... i would think hard about the integrity of the relationship as a whole and whether or not you want to continue with it. a person never apologizing for their wrong actions isn't really a good person to keep around (i'm saying this in general though, obviously i don't know the nature of your relationship).\n

LOL.\n  ","384124":"\n  honestly, the only thing i can think of is the \"game of thrones\" series, lol. it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, and it was stressful to a degree, but nevertheless i did enjoy it a lot.\n  ","384125":"\n  this is perhaps the fourth of fifth time you've called me \"miss leigh,\" and i've deleted them every time because it makes me uncomfortable.\n  \n  please stop calling me that. i understand you have fair intentions, but i would prefer just \"leigh.\" i'm non-binary and don't feel comfortable with feminine descriptors.\n  ","384126":"\n\n   @svspicion\n  \n  and i aren't close, but we do talk every so often when i have a question about something that i know she would have the answer to. i give her a lot of credit for helping me through a lot of my mental health stuff.\n  ","384127":"\n  i'm really happy that you've been able to find people on the internet who have been supportive to you like that. i agree, the internet is a great place to meet people with similar interests and common goals as long as you're vigilant about who you're talking to.\n  \n  i started using the internet frequently when i was a pre-teen, and i often visited various discussion forums pertaining to my favorite bands. that's where i met a lot of my online friends who still continue to be great friends of mine, even 10+ years later. my closest friends when i was a teenager were my online friends, since we would talk every day.\n  ","384128":"\n  having my first alcoholic drink after a long day at work makes me happy. when someone says \"we need to talk\" or i have to attend a meeting at work, that makes me nervous. i don't necessarily feel alone most of the time because i have a strong support system, but too much isolation can make me feel lonely at times. as for what makes me tired ... i'm exhausted on a constant basis, haha.\n  ","384129":"\n  when i consider mental health advocacy, i believe that a person can be an advocate if they continue to fight against the stigma that exists regarding mental illness and make it a mission to educate others on mental health on a continuous basis, whether that's in-person or online or both.\n  ","384130":"\n  i believe it's important for people who struggle with mental health issues to develop a routine because it can be guide, in some ways, for them to live out their days and life without it feeling like it's devoid of meaning 100% of the time. whether that routine is something like going to school or working a job, or just having a regular routine at home if you're not in school or working, it can improve a person's mood just to have a schedule (especially if it's flexible).\n  ","384131":"\n  this can happen for a variety of reasons, sometimes due to disagreements especially if someone is already in a sour mood.\n  ","384132":"\n  no, i don't do that in general and especially not right now.\n  ","384133":"\n\n   @CourtneyUwU\n  \n  is one of the loveliest people i know, and i'm so grateful for our friendship. she's probably one of the people i'm closest to that i've met from askfm. :'))\n  "}}
