and that fire and love doesn t fade away","820825":"i think it can be a beautiful thing if you find the one you want to spend your life with and grow in love with them a little bit more as each day goes by and to make sure they feel the same way about you . and that feeling that you felt when you first met shouldn t go away . the love should keep growing every single day and not fade away . but in this society and generation marriage is a scary thing because what if one day they decide they just don t love you anymore and leave like that . it s scary .","820826":"no it s not how it works lol","820827":"but you re not linkin park","820828":"i would say to distract yourself honestly with things you enjoy doing like watch your favorite movies shows , go on walks to clear your mind ,

appreciate it very much . i hope you re doing well and staying strong as well !","821024":"hahah a bad spam ?","821025":"thank you !","821026":"all of my relationships were actual relationships so thank you anon","821027":"indeed i do !","821028":"haha awh thank you ! i actually loved my answer lol","821029":"that s the million dollar question right here . i think most long distance relationships don t work out due to trust and communication . i mean it s very important to build trust with the person you re in a relationship with long distance but it can be hard because you never know what they can be doing . trust is so important to have when you re in a relationship and if you don t have that then there s really no relationship between the two of you . i mean it takes time to build trust by not only their words but also their actions and if they show you , you can trust them then you ll start to slowly be able to trust that person and not have to worry about them doing other things behind your back . but then on the other hand if they show you , you can t trust them due to their actions and how they present themselves to you that s a whole different story . but one factor in to why long distance relationships don t work out is trust . you gotta have trust with the other person and slowly build it . the other factor would definitely be communication . i mean obviously if it s long distance there s going to be different time zones like you might be hours behind and the person you re with might be hours ahead of you but that doesn t mean anything if they really like you , they will communicate with you and talk to you and find the time to do so . no one is ever to busy to communicate with someone they really want and like . no matter how busy someone is they will find the time to communicate with you . people are busy but if they like you , they ll call or text you . we make time for what we want . communication is always key because if you don t communicate with one another the partner can start to overthink and start to worry and you never want that , it s not healthy . it s important to always find the time to message one another no matter what . keeping the communication alive is what is important in long distance relationships even in any relationship . also another factor can be physical and showing affection . obviously if you re in a long distance relationship you can t touch one another or show affection . that would be very difficult to do . many people love holding hands , cuddling , kissing , sleeping next to each other , hugging , etc . and in long distance relationships you can t do that so you can only really use your words to say what you would like to do with one another when you meet . that s also why long distance relationships don t work out . it s craving one another s touch and feeling that affection . i mean don t get me wrong there s many long distance relationships that do work out because they re able to trust one another and communicate and plus build that strong emotional connection and feel those positive vibes off of one another . that strong connection that you can build with someone in a long distance relationship is quite amazing . just being able to feel how strong of a connection you two have emotionally and mentally is always great .","821030":"yes i have celebrity crushes !","821031":"we aren t together anymore anon .","821032":"nope , i become very stressed out actually","821033":"when someone remembers the small details i tell them when someone treats me with respect when someone goes out of their way to communicate with me and tell me about their day and how they re doing when someone shows me how much they love me and care about me etc . .","821034":"no i ve never fallen in love with a guy that was in another relationship . that hasn t happened to me","821035":"i mean everyone has a different taste in music that makes them unique and interesting and that s what makes it fun getting to know someone , learning about their music taste . it shouldn t change your opinion on someone though as a person . because everyone likes different kinds of music and that s what s cool . you also discover new music when meeting people .","821036":"yes , absolutely people should pay attention to other people rather then their phones but in this generation we are all glued to our phones and don t pay attention to others or socialize anymore like a normal person would . it s quite sad but in this generation and society that s how it is .","821037":"my own feelings sometimes and the feeling of what someone means to me and showing how much they mean to me , showing that i really care and love them , etc . . i find difficult to convey sometimes .","821038":"honestly when i m faced with a challenge i tend to get really stressed and end up panicking as well . i don t really know how to face them without getting so stressed .","821039":"i don t know where he is anon but i hope he s doing well","821040":"hello !","821041":"no lol","821042":"i would definitely say to go watch a movie in the theater because you should go somewhere where you two can talk and really get to know one another and enjoy each other s company .","821043":"i m not on here . i can t exactly get to all questions i get or receive . so you need to understand that . i try my best to see and answer as many as i can .","821044":"yes , i do !","821045":"it s just easy for me to remember them when i do end up dreaming !","821046":"why thank you !","821047":"i mean there s genuinely some good people out there but it s pretty rare nowadays because most people just have bad intentions now .","821048":"of course you re cool !","821049":"when i do dream , most of the time i remember them","821050":"of course girly !","821051":"it s definitely going , nothing special though . how s your week going ?","821052":"i don t think so","821053":"what even ?","821054":"nope , don
