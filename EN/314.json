and too pushy ?"},"Answer":{"290450":"if someone isn t putting the same effort into a friendship relationship as you , then perhaps it isn t worth continuing . you should respect yourself enough to know if someone is taking advantage of you . life is unfair and things will happen that you don t deserve to happen to you . it s best to simply deal with these situations because if you question them relentlessly , you ll never come to terms with what happened or move forward . your own happiness and tranquility is important and you shouldn t invest time or energy into things or people that do not serve you . take time out of each day for self care and understand that you can only do so much in one day .","290451":"one thing comes to mind , but it s too personal and terrible to really discuss on askfm . it happened many years ago , though , and sometimes i still feel regret .","290452":"eh , for the most part . there are some things i m totally irrational about thanks to mental illness , but it s gotten a lot better over the years .","290453":"i received bad news on friday , but it isn t anything i can t handle at the moment . other than that , i don t really know what has shaken me recently . i try to approach situations from a calm and collected standpoint .","290454":"there isn t really much you can do in that situation , unfortunately . if a person is unwell , they have to want help in order to truly better themselves . you can t force someone to seek professional help if they themselves are not ready to admit that they need help . it has to be on a voluntary basis .","290455":"uh , there s only two but okay . lmaoo .","290456":"yeah , i would never pursue someone if they were racist , sexist , homophobic , transphobic , ableist , etc etc .","290457":"i don t know what it is you re referring to . can you be more specific ?","290458":"personality is more important to me . basing your attraction of someone off of their looks can only take you so far in a relationship , because your chemistry ultimately depends on how well your personalities mesh together .","290459":"i had an inkling that i had certain disorders , but i never outright said that i did have those disorders until i was professionally diagnosed .","290460":"that s partially a reason why i stopped using tumblr and trying to be part of the mental health community on there , tbh . not only did people romanticize mental illness but there was also so much misinformation being shared and people self diagnosing without even wanting to seek professional help for their so called diagnoses .","290461":"without a doubt , yes . there s still a lot of stigma associated with mental illness and mental health in general .","290462":"been cleaning , organizing , and packing all afternoon . i m legit exhausted there s so much still left to do . ?","290463":"tbh probably not . i don t have the time to create a costume and i definitely don t have the money to buy one right now , so i ll just be an onlooker this year .","290464":"i love halloween , but there isn t usually anything i do to celebrate it . this year , i ll just be going to work like usual . people in my office will be dressing up and they re having a costume contest , so that should be fun .","290465":"considering i ve never been pregnant , then it stands to reason that i ve never aborted a pregnancy . lmaoo .","290466":"zero . i ve never had an abortion .","290467":"depends on my mood , haha . lately i ve been eating sushi , pasta with vegetables , and or soup .","290468":"i m not a fan of sports , but if i had to choose one , it would be ice hockey .","290469":"every few months or so . ideally i should be shaving it much more frequently , but i m also lazy and don t care very much .","290470":"i don t wear those either , haha . most of my shirts are loose and the only tight things i prohably wear are leggings and skinny jeans .","290471":"yeah , this happens with most boots that i try on tbh . they re usually too tall and hit somewhere around my knee , which can be uncomfortable .","290472":"i don t like wearing outfits that are revealing or show too much skin . it isn t my style .","290473":"to a certain degree , yes . i wasn t very comfortable in the outfit though .","290474":"at the moment , no . ask me this question in one week , however , and my answer will be

movie yet , so i don t have an opinion . i really want to see it , though ! ! it looks hella good .","290482":"i ve never played darts before . it s never been something that interested me .","290483":"something happened today that really angered me , and this is actually the first time my job made me angry well not the job itself , but one particular person i work with . i ended up talking to my supervisor about the situation because my coworker was essentially undermining her authority and disrespecting her and she has the right to know what s going on .","290484":"the front facing camera is usually always in focus .","290485":"yeah , the whole company votes .","290486":"well , that would fall under the category of being dishonest . that s a problem then .","290487":"depends on what he s saying to his ex , lol . if he s still being romantic with his ex or leading her on in any way then yeah that s unfair to both the new girlfriend as well as his ex . but if he s still friends with his ex because they didn t leave on bad terms , then i don t personally see the problem with him talking to his ex . it would only become an issue , i believe , if he s skipping out on quality time with his girlfriend to talk to or hang out with his ex or generally being dishonest .","290488":"there will always be certain things of which we re unsure , and we may never know the true answers to them . it s just part of life .","290489":"sounds like a natural progression to me .","290490":"i do feel needed by some people in my life , all in different ways and some in bad ways and others in good ways . for those who express a need to have me in their life because my presence enriches it , then that makes me feel comforted and loved . i think whether it s good or bad to be needed ultimately depends on the type of need it is and your existing relationship with that person .","290491":"like i said , communication is key . if you need to know the answer to something and if you re close to the person in that way then it s best to ask them .","290492":"correct me if i m wrong , but i was under the impression that a rebound relationship was one in which someone enters in the effort to make another person jealous . even if the man wanted to end the relationship in order to pursue someone else , if he s not doing it solely to make his ex jealous then i don t think it qualifies as a rebound . he s just being honest with his feelings .","290493":"you could probably ask them about their feelings if you re close to this person in that way . regardless , it probably isn t any of your business to begin with , lol .","290494":"long island pizza and bagels .","290495":"depends on the individual , because it could go either way depending on the nature of both the previous and current relationship . some people have the capacity to be interested in others shortly after a breakup while others don t , so there isn t really a right answer to this question .","290496":"yeah , they were mostly unhealthy thought patterns related to food . i used to deny myself food when i thought i didn t deserve to even eat because of something that i did that day , or i wouldn t allow myself to eat or drink something unless i accomplished something else in my life .","290497":"this defines nearly half of the social gatherings with my family . they re supposed to be joyous occasions , but it normally gets very awkward and tense very fast .","290498":"yes , there are perhaps one of two people who i wish were not in my life at the moment . i normally have no qualms with cutting people off or distancing myself , but these cases are a bit complicated unfortunately .","290499":"in terms of atmosphere , i think tumblr is one of the worst out there . there are a lot of toxic cultures on tumblr who encourage problematic and negative thinking , as well as tons of misinformation , and it can really f ck with the minds of the young , impressionable people who use that site .","290500":"there s nothing wrong with a woman in a relationship hugging her male friends . if that s something that you as a partner would make a big deal over , then you need to look within yourself and figure out why you re so insecure about your relationship and find out how to remedy it .","290501":"i would normally ask do you have a question ? but i get the feeling that this isn t one of those cases .","290502":"yeah , most people in my office are kind and try to make small conversation here and there , including my managers . most people are pretty easygoing , which i m thankful for because it makes for a positive work environment .","290503":"it depends on the day . some days , there is no reason and i see no reason to keep fighting . other days , i survive for the sake of others . sometimes i survive for myself . and then there are other times i survive because i believe in that moment that i deserve to see future moments of my life where i m genuinely happy .","290504":"driving home from work this evening . a song was on the radio that i could really relate to , and it really got me in my feels .","290505":"i sometimes forget to take my medication in the morning because i m in such a rush to get out of the house , ugh .","290506":"depends on what the job being offered to me is . if i know it s something i ll absolutely hate then i would much rather choose to do something i liked with lesser pay . however , there s also nothing stopping most people from doing both i . e . having a job to pay the bills and then doing what you loved on the side .","290507":"i don t really follow any people who actively ask questions , but some people with good answers who are on most days are shehitsback urlsareshittbh kittiemeowsie speakofthefckindevil

she says it s okay .","290512":"she s been answering questions every day , lol .","290513":"in cash .","290514":"i don t remember . that was over a year ago that i got the results back from the test .","290515":"i have to tweeze them , haha . they re not all that thick though , that s just how they are naturally .","290516":"yeah , we actually have a costume contest every year .","290517":"haha , thanks ! ! i can t take credit for that , it s actually a really awesome snapchat filter .","290518":"dead i am the dog , hound of hell you cry . devil on your back , i can never die .","290519":"depends on the kind of mood i m in . both sound pretty appealing rn , but i would be more inclined to go for a quiet walk in the woods because i need the solitude .","290520":"i like earth tones , i . e . mahogany , navy blue , forest green , rusty orange , dark purple , and black .","290521":"exhausted selfie from this evening .","290522":"i ve never heard of this term before .","290523":"ahh thank you . it s actually a really old photo , but i still love it .","290524":"it s always possible , sure . obviously it goes on a case by case basis , though .","290525":"no , but it s supposed to rain tomorrow i think .","290526":"i don t feel like taking a photo . however , i m wearing a sweater , leggings , and knee high boots .","290527":"uh , you re anonymous . therefore , you re not even my friend . furthermore , i m already in a relationship .","290528":"it s a stereotype that most people don t get along with their step mothers .","290529":"it isn t something necessary for me to know , so if that s something they would want to share with me , that s their decision alone . someone s past doesn t necessarily reflect their present or their future .","290530":"no , i m not sure there s many people who prefer loneliness over anything else . there s a difference between solitude and loneliness and loneliness is a negative feeling . you can be alone without feeling lonely .","290531":"i was talking to my therapist last week and i said flesh start instead of fresh start , lmaoo . it wasn t really embarrassing but it was amusing considering we were discussing sex before that .","290532":"most likely my boyfriend , if we re talking about outside of immediate family .","290533":"i m doing well . i had a very productive work day , and now that i m home i m going to focus on packing more of my belongings and doing laundry so that i can pack most of my clothing as well .","290534":"i don t necessarily think it s bad , because if you have a good relationship with your family then they also can be your friend . but i would certainly need other people besides my family in my life , personally speaking .","290535":"nah , i wouldn t want to be polyamorous because it would probably make me insecure , knowing that my loved one has more than one love in their life aside from me . i also don t have the capacity to love more than one person at once . i don t really have strong opinions about polyamorous people as long as their relationships are healthy then i support them .","290536":"i ve played the game from the beginning multiple times , so it varied from game to game .","290537":"i just packed up about half of my bedroom everything looks so bleak and depressing , lmaoo . i took the tapestries off the walls , all of my books are gone , and my entertainment table is cleared off except for my xbox and television .","290538":"err , probably when i lied about relapsing . i didn t tell anyone i relapsed , not even my therapist .","290539":"more than likely , yes ! !","290540":"lol , no . i was still in college in .","290541":"yeah , that s the purpose of breasts to begin with to feed a child . if you have an issue with someone breastfeeding then you re not being forced to look at them . society has sexualized breasts so much over the past few decades , people don t seem to realize that they re not sexual organs .","290542":"happy autumn . ?","290543":"hello do you have a question ?","290544":"i don t think i can make the decision of whether or not it s appropriate , considering i m not indian or spanish . that s something that someone of that demographic can make .","290545":"yes , i see nothing wrong with people breastfeeding in public spaces .","290546":"the camera on this phone is unreal .","290547":"yeah , i would likely fire them at that point and try to find another person , someone more reliable . i m hesitant about the idea of babysitters to begin with , tbh .","290548":"depends on if it s a reoccurring issue or not .","290549":"probably not . if the child doesn t like milk then there are other alternatives to milk that they can drink .","290550":"i don t have a child , but it depends on the nature of how they forced the child . if they were yelling at the child then i would fire the babysitter .","290551":"it s only happened on rare occasions , but no it doesn t upset him if i tell him he s acting irrationally . he prefers me to be honest with him in order to keep him grounded , and i wouldn t want to encourage irrational or bad behavior when i know that he can look at situations from a calmer perspective .","290552":"he s a very difficult person to cheer up because when he s upset or angry , he feels it completely and it s all he can think about . however , i find it s best to just discuss his feelings with him and try to rationalize whatever he is feeling . he sometimes asks if his emotions are valid or if he s overreacting and i m always honest with him . then i offer to play video games with him , which usually makes him feel better , lol .","290553":"yes , his mood definitely affects me although it happens with everyone i m around . if he s upset about something , then i become upset also , and when he s very happy , then i feel totally euphoric .","290554":"on the rare occasion , yes i ve said no . usually it happens whenever i m too mentally or physically exhausted to do something , i can t bring myself to get out of bed , or i m just generally feeling unwell .","290555":"no . i wouldn t date anyone from askfm .","290556":"i m not really all that old , but it s definitely come with age . when i read a lot , i was a teenager .","290557":"in the past , i would have said i preferred reading stories . i was a prolific reader and i have dozens upon dozens of books that i can t bring myself to donate . these days , however , i like watching stories on television because my attention span has greatly dwindled over the years .","290558":"yeah , i definitely think so . i ve already seen advertisements for video games on television .","290559":"i mean , spamming someone with videos would just annoy them more than anything else and they probably wouldn t even watch the videos or read the articles . it s better to talk to them one on one .","290560":"there was one time a few months ago that this account was actually suspended for virtually no reason at all . i never even got a warning , they just flat out suspended my account . so i emailed support and explained the situation , and they thankfully gave me my account back .","290561":"there s so much stigma against men who have mental health problems , moreso than the stigma against women most of the time . due to toxic masculinity , men are conditioned from an early age to suppress their emotions and not talk about their feelings , otherwise they re considered weak . it s honestly a terrible thing to do for yourself health wise and can lead to more problems in the future . one idea that can help is to simply talk about this stigma more and encourage the men in your life that it s okay to show emotions , it s okay to discuss feelings , and if they re struggling with mental illness , it s valid to seek help and there s nothing wrong with that . there s such a high rate of s icide among men in today s society that something needs to be done , it s seldom talked about .","290562":"to preface this , i will say that it s very difficult to change someone s mind about racism if they re racist themselves . often times , they were raised in a racist environment and their feelings toward people of other races is ingrained in them from a young age . one of the best ways to try , however , is to simply educate them . present them with facts and figures , point out their harmful views opinions , and reiterate that you do care about them but you don t want them to be hateful towards others simply because of their race .","290563":"in a little over a week , i ll finally be moving out of my parents house into my own house with two roommates . it hasn t happened yet , but i already know it will be the best thing to happen to me because i ll finally be able to heal from years of ab se and move forward with my life .","290564":"i care too much about people who don t seem to reciprocate the same feelings towards me .","290565":"ultimately , my goal in life is to be content with myself and content with my life , attaining a level of tranquility that it allows me to unleash my full potential . i also want to help other people through my creative endeavors , i . e . my writing .","290566":"kidnap the sandy claws by korn . https www . youtube . com watch ? v poppqmikr w","290567":"honestly , i wouldn t be surprised if there was left over pink orange , because that was the color my hair was before it faded to blonde thank you , though ! ! i m actually thinking of going like a chocolate brown next for the winter .","290568":"first and foremost , the battery doesn t dwindle incredibly fast , doesn t overheat , and doesn t restart by itself . lmaoo . otherwise from the little bit i ve played around with , the camera is absolutely incredible , the loading speeds of apps and web pages is much faster , and nothing has crashed . i also like the edge detail , where you can swipe the edge and come up with your favorite apps as shortcuts .","290569":"i love fall candles the most , so i usually stick up on scents like pine balsam , apple cinnamon , and other woodsy scents .","290570":"samsung galaxy s .","290571":"they re okay . i m not a huge fan of their songs but i know a few of them .","290572":"first semi selfie with the new phone ! ! my hair is so blonde","290573":"i m sure you could use vitamin e oil or cocoa butter to help get rid of them . i ve never tried it myself , though .","290574":"you re asking the totally wrong person , lol . i ve never downloaded movies or anything like that .","290575":"so i finally got a new phone , after my old phone was continuously overheating dying on me ! ! i got the samsung galaxy s , and i m in love with it .","290576":"i love axolotls , but they re apparently very high maintenance pets and i don t believe i would have the time or resources to maintain one .","290577":"usually , yes .","290578":"i think the theory of ancient aliens is hella interesting , and i absolutely love watching that show because it s a great combination of historic facts and the supernatural .","290579":"to gatekeep basically means to take it upon yourself to decide what does and does not affect a community , or what s valid and invalid regarding communities i . e . the lgbt community , mental health communities , trans communities , communities for people of color , etc etc .","290580":"apparently so . ?","290581":"there s a difference between being a perfectionist and having ocd . if something interferes with your daily life , then that s a disorder . being a perfectionist is not a disorder , lol . regardless , i said to some degree . i didn t claim to be a perfectionist all the time .","290582":"i m pretty sure that s normal , i don t think my manager wrote anything down when she interviewed me for my current job . however , i did take a writing test so i think she based half of the interview on my answers as well as the verbal interview .","290583":"i associate warm foods with comfort and relaxation , especially hot coffee and black tea with milk sugar , and tomato soup with grilled cheese .","290584":"the internet ! ! some may say that the internet has been bad for society , but i truly believe it has done more good than bad . there s a plethora of information online that we did not have access to previously , and news spreads much faster and with more accuracy now thanks to the internet than it ever did in the past . people tend to be more informed and educated .","290585":"instead of jumping immediately into the workforce , i would have sought to obtain a master s degree after receiving my bachelor s degree . instead of taking part in questionable and very illegal activities in my youth , i would have distanced myself from that group of friends earlier . instead of trusting certain people with my inner thoughts and worries and personal information , i would have tried to understand their motives sooner and cut ties with them before they could hurt me .","290586":"australia , new zealand , the bahamas , cuba , england , italy , greece , croatia , spain , and russia .","290587":"i have some freelance work that i need to do this weekend , so i m going to start working on that soon . otherwise , i m getting a new phone this afternoon and i have to continue packing my belongings .","290588":"more acceptance and less stigma when it comes to mental health mental illness . even though we as a society have improved somewhat with our perception of mental health , there is still so much progress that we need to do in order to take mental health seriously .","290589":"good morning do you have a question ?","290590":"somewhere between an and a . i m quite concerned about climate change global warming , mostly because most other people who are in actual positions of authority seem to think it s a hoax , and i m relying my faith in activists like greta thunberg and others to actually raise awareness to the right people and using their voice to convince others to implement change .","290591":"i think so , yeah . it s all about setting boundaries with other people . while being cautious around others may be necessary for our own self preservation , you can simultaneously trust someone just enough for them to do what they need to do while setting boundaries and keeping distance with them as well .","290592":"everyone agrees with that too , especially my boyfriend and my best friend and my therapist . they all say this is going to probably be the best thing for my mental health at this rate and perhaps i can finally begin to heal . i m sorry you ve dealt with ab se too and that you can t move out yet , but you should always keep your eyes on that goal because it will happen eventually and you ll be much happier and freer as a result . that s what has always driven me , the idea of freedom .","290593":"i feel the same way as you , and i honestly believe that one of the better ways to go about the situation would be to wait until they have a clearer mind and then perhaps talk to them about your honest feelings . sometimes people have to sleep on it in order to feel rational and calm again , and also sometimes it only adds fuel to the fire when you re being honest with someone in the heat of the moment because they may construe it as you criticizing or invalidating them .","290594":"this is perhaps one of the sweetest messages i ve ever received . thank you so much ! ! while there are still a lot of struggles with my life rn , i also believe that i ve improved somewhat over the past year especially with respect to work and my personal life i . e . finally moving out and quitting smoking . i hope that moving out will finally provide me with a clean slate and i can only improve more from there . i need a sense of independence and not being restrained by my family , and it s going to be amazing to finally live my life without judgment from my family and doing things that i actually want to do without kickback .","290595":"yes , i m sure everyone does this from time to time . for example , displaying empathy for a person just to save face when you know that they re overreacting or being irrational , particularly if you know they ll just get more upset if you express that they re acting so . there s a time and a place for everything , and sometimes people need reassurance instead of the blunt , honest truth from time to time .","290596":"i agree with this for the most part ! ! however , i think that all relationships come with some degree of stress because everyone will have struggles and challenges that they will have to overcome . you re experiencing life with that person by your side , so there will no doubt be times when there s miscommunication and you get stressed or angry with each other . what matters is that you both communicate with each other effectively and resolve issues .","290597":"at work , i was initially a stand in for the administrator of the magazine project while she was out on maternity leave . it was my temporary responsibility , but after she said she wasn t returning to work , it became my full time responsibility . i ve done everything for the latest edition of the magazine , from writing the actual articles to organizing the pages to corresponding with clients regarding their content to proofreading all pages multiple times . when the final layout was revealed before we put the magazine online , my supervisor emailed me and said that she was immensely proud of me for not only taking on the responsibility with dedication , but for carrying on the torch and excelling with it . she said she was impressed with my ability to juggle both the writing aspects and editorial aspects of the project to create a nearly flawess edition and that i surpassed all expectations . i still have the email because i like reading it from time to time , lmaoo . it s a source of pride for me and keeps me going when i m doubting myself .","290598":"art in general , i . e . painting and drawing . i was a great artist when i was a teenager , but because i stopped doing art , my abilities have dwindled greatly .","290599":"right now , i truly need some peace of mind and or a chance to start my life from a fresh slate . i m hoping moving into the new house will provide me with that opportunity .","290600":"i believe i m pretty okay with what people know about me in general . i m an open book for the most part , and i ve always been open about my life because i would like to help others who are perhaps struggling with the same things that i ve struggled with in the past .","290601":"i believe my talents are pretty known by at least one or two people , considering i don t have many talents at all .","290602":"eh , this is a complicated question because while it may be construed as shallow , i also understand it to some degree . in a relationship , there must be emotional chemistry as well as physical chemistry if you re a s xual type of person and feelings should be reciprocated evenly . if you re not physically attracted to someone , then the relationship may not work out in the long run .","290603":"the only thing that comes to mind is that i grind my teeth sometimes at night , which irritates my boyfriend because sometimes it prevents him from sleeping , lol .","290604":"i suppose my biggest responsibility is the project i administer to at work , which is the magazine project . every day comes with different challenges , but because i feel dedicated and proud of the work i do , it comes easily to me so there s really not much i do to deal with it , so to speak . however , i do believe it s important to not take your work home with you , for lack of a better phrase . meaning , it s useless to stress about work when you re not at work , and you should only dedicate your time thinking about your job when you re actually there .","290605":"unstable , creative , and ambitious .","290606":"i trust my boyfriend with my life , yes .","290607":"for the most part , yes . maybe , though , lmaoo .","290608":"the last time i got my hair cut shaved was the last time i colored my hair , lol . i think that was maybe four months ago .","290609":"tomorrow will be one month since i quit smoking cigarettes ! !","290610":"to some degree , yes . i always try to put into the work that i do , and i m not satisfied with something until i feel as if there isn t any possible way i could improve it more . i also feel hesitant collaborating with other people because i can t trust them to do a good job , so in the past , i always hated doing group projects in school college .","290611":"no , my parents are perhaps the only exception . i don t forgive them , but i don t hold a grudge against them either . i ve accepted the fact that what happened to me has happened , but forgiving them for what they ve done would be equivalent to me essentially telling myself that it was okay or acceptable , and i don t believe that to be true at all .","290612":"for me personally , it depends entirely on the situation because every circumstance is different . most times , i do try to forgive forget , but there will always be some situations where forgiveness isn t warranted or expected , and you simply cannot give the person another chance to redeem themselves .","290613":"loneliness doesn t necessarily mean that you re physically alone you could be surrounded by people but still feel lonely because it s an internal feeling of isolation and sometimes hopelessness . it s a feeling of despair , where you feel disconnected from others and solitary in your thoughts . simply being alone , on the other hand , isn t necessarily a negative thing and a lot of people do enjoy their time away from other people . i don t really believe that comfort with being alone has any correlation with the capacity to love , although it may have ties with self love as you re expressing a comfort with being by yourself and doing things in accordance with your own needs and desires . personally speaking , if i m feeling lonely then i try to figure out why it is i m feeling that way and also reach out to either discuss those feelings or at least distract myself from feeling lonely . i rarely get lonely these days , though , particularly because i feel like there s always something for me to do and i have a strong support system .","290614":"idk , i guess a client could choose to sue us . . . that would be one of the worse things that could happen in my profession .","290615":"life in general , but moreso my family than anything else . now that it s less than two weeks until i move out , it feels as though my family is trying even harder to engage me and convince me to stay home by indirectly showing me how much they rely on me for everyday tasks . it s almost as if they re trying to make me feel guilty for leaving , and it s incredibly tiresome .","290616":"i don t really know what i m waiting for , tbh . i feel like i am waiting for something , but i really have no clue what it could be . there s always this feeling of something impending and that i won t know what it is until it eventually happens .","290617":"honestly , i don t care enough to hold grudges anymore . it just ends up hurting me in the end , and it does nothing to the other individual , so why would i hold onto negative emotions when the only person it affects is me ?","290618":"i haven t used birth control in many years , lol . after the patch , i swore off the idea of using hormonal contraceptives .","290619":"i apologized via email to my coworker for a bunch of last minute revisions i had to give to her this week , haha . she s one of our office s graphic designers and she creates the layouts of most of our publications , and there have been so many little but significant changes that needed to be made over the past two days alone .","290620":"i understand your frustration . unfortunately , there isn t much we can physically do to deter our loves ones from resorting to dr gs or alcohol and whatnot , we can simply offer them tips and advice so that if they do decide to try them out , they ll have the knowledge they need to be responsible and safe . it s ultimately their decision , especially considering they re adults at the age of . but hopefully they do have the sense to be safe and not bite off more than they can chew if they decide to try dr gs .","290621":"it s considerate to offer money in order to chip in for gas , but it s not as if you re being forced to do so .","290622":"i was not awake when you sent this to me , no .","290623":"aw , thank you ! ! my day was fine , rather slow actually . however , i found out that my office will be closed between christmas day new years day , which is very exciting . i ve never had an entire week off from work before .","290624":"yes , i was on birth control for quite a few years when i was younger beginning at the age of . my experience was mostly negative , tbh . i was on the pill first , and it caused weight gain and triggered my depression to worsen which is actually very common but people seldom talk about it . after i was tired of the pill , i switched to the patch . the patch honestly wasn t much better it significantly lowered my libido , which sorta . . . defeats the purpose . however don t let this deter you , because everyone s bodies are different and just because i had mostly negative experiences doesn t mean that you will too . unfortunately , you won t really know how your body reacts until you try it first .","290625":"life has been hectic , but good . i m wrapping up the latest edition of the magazine at work after several hiccups along the way , almoo so that should be up and running by next week . i m also continuing with packing for moving day , which is in less than two weeks . i got all of my bedroom furniture delivered , so now i just need to gather the remainder of my things . the only downside of everything is that i haven t seen my boyfriend in a week because we ve both been so busy .","290626":"i ve never been to a music festival before , and tbh i ve never really had a desire to go . too many people , too much sweating , no room to walk or breathe , etc etc .","290627":"my best friend s bachelorette party then her wedding ! ! those were both amazing memories .","290628":"i m not sure if it works that way , lol . i know some people are comfortable with multiple pronouns , but you would have to ask that individual person what they use because everyone is different .","290629":"depends on the situation . i m hesitant to say yes to these types of questions because i simply don t know what s going to be asked .","290630":"i don t believe it should be punishable by law , but it s most definitely disrespectful to refuse to use someone s correct pronouns .","290631":"i have a picture of my boyfriend and i in a frame , two pop figurines one of dogmeat from fallout and the other of cayde from destiny , a wooden organizer with pens , a notepad , and fake flowers , and my mug .","290632":"no , i don t answer unknown numbers . if it s important enough , then they ll leave a voicemail .","290633":"no , i m a realist more than anything else .","290634":"i m reserved around most people , though i wouldn t say that i m shy . i m just private and i keep to myself . however , i m very outgoing around my friends .","290635":"my longest relationship is my current one . we ve been together for around years .","290636":"tbh , i m quite angry rn . however , i m coping with it the best i can at the moment .","290637":"it doesn t much matter to me , he s had both short hair and very long hair and he looked great with both .","290638":"i prefer bacon over sausage , depending on the type of sausage it is . i occasionally make or order bacon , egg , and cheese sandwiches .","290639":"allegedly i got all of my vaccinations when i was a child , so yeah . i just don t get the flu shot , for whatever reason . i don t know if i never got the flu shot but ever since it became my responsibility , i just never got it .","290640":"i think you need an account to participate in the chat , which is why i created one .","290641":"that wasn t why the focus is the way it is , but yeah the photo was taken in my office building .","290642":"lol . yeah , this was a professional photo taken for my company s magazine since i m the magazine editor . i liked the way it came out so i ve been using it on social media .","290643":"use my laptop on an actual desk , probably paint and or draw more often , and idk just be more content because i like having a big space that s organized . it makes my head feel clearer .","290644":"yeah , that s unhealthy af . your partner shouldn t be making you feel guilty in the first place then challenging you to dump them over those feelings is extremely manipulative and immature .","290645":"both , lol . i use wifi when i m home data when i m at work or most other places tbh .","290646":"thank you","290647":"probably mental health advocacy ! ! otherwise , video game and true crime . lmaoo .","290648":"they have the ability to , but i don t really see how the advice may be valid because they re not a parent themselves . they may present themselves in a hypothetical situation but they won t really know unless they had an actual child .","290649":"i honestly have no idea . all of my memories are jumbled up and hazy , and i have no concept of time distinguishing any of them .","290650":"the last people i followed were thebeeskneesgirl , louisarhale , and astoldbyjoanna .","290651":"absolutely not . i don t care if someone is currently non offending . that just means they haven t offended yet .","290652":"i don t know who you re referring to . can you be more specific ?","290653":"a deck chair , haha . i m currently outside vaping .","290654":"when i was traveling upstate , there were barely any toll booths . you needed an ez pass to get through the tolls because they recorded them automatically .","290655":"i already did everything i needed to do today , so thankfully nothing . i can relax and watch television until i fall asleep .","290656":"abandonment by my loved ones .","290657":"i could if i wanted to with mixer , but i don t . i also have a twitch account but i ve only used it to watch my friends streams .","290658":"i like a few of their songs , yeah .","290659":"i think it was for the oil change . i got it done with my inspection the last time , so i m not sure of the exact price . it was quite a few months ago .","290660":"it s going well . i just got most of my bedroom furniture delivered , so i ll be able to transfer it to the new house with the moving truck the day we move in . otherwise , i m in the process of packing my belongings , i . e . my books , art supplies , knick knacks , etc etc .","290661":"no , i don t even know who you are .","290662":"no , if someone is comfortable with their financial situation for example , if their spouse works and there s no reason for them to work , then they re not obligated to get a job .","290663":"my boyfriend s salt water tank . the corals and the fish are so much more intriguing than any fresh water tank i ve seen .","290664":"i hope that someday i will attain a level of personal peace and acceptance within myself . to be content with myself and my life .","290665":"over the years , i ve learned to become more persistent and vocal about my goals and needs . i used to be quite timid in the past , but i realized that i wouldn t get anywhere if i was too afraid to speak out . when something is bothering me , i communicate . things have appeared much clearer ever since i made that transition . however , some things haven t changed very much . i m still anxious as all hell when out in public , particularly in crowded places , and i avoid stores as much as i can . i avoid phone calls as much as i can . i m still very much an anxious critter despite being in treatment .","290666":"if you want something , then do everything in your power to accomplish it . nothing is going to happen and you won t progress forward if you re not actively working toward your goals . it may be frightening at first to take that first step forward , but you must do it if you want to succeed at anything in life .","290667":"i have no desire to talk to any anon on instagram .","290668":"yes , i have both instagram and snapchat . however , they re both private .","290669":"i don t discuss my sex life on the internet .","290670":"i can be quite the romantic person , and most of my poetry is inspired by the tribulations and triumphs my boyfriend and i have experienced together .","290671":"freedom is the idea that an individual has the right or ability to think , act , and or speak without being restrained by oppression .","290672":"well , you ve certainly come to the right website .","290673":"i think it s ridiculous that people are given priority over others simply because of their occupation , especially since she s a former cop . you re not any better than anyone else because you re part of law enforcement , and the amount of favors pardons cops receive in the justice system when they break laws themselves is asinine .","290674":"i think it s ridiculous , because that means that those women don t actually trust their partners if they believe that their partner can be wooed by another woman who s trying to seduce them . relationships are a two way street , regardless of the type of relationship it is . if someone is flirting with you or trying to get into your pants , you have two options accept or deny the invitation . just because someone is into you does not mean you should accept or encourage their behavior . everyone has their own individual mind .","290675":"i m not well versed in the case at all , but i believe the verdict is justified . she went into someone else s apartment which she somehow thought was hers ? and k lled someone . facing up to life in prison seems absolutely appropriate .","290676":"i ve had my struggles in life , much like anyone else , so i don t believe my life has been quite easy or kind to me . even in the present day when things are seemingly better , there is always something that happens that puts a damper on my outlook , as if i can never catch a break . i am quite exhausted , but my only option right now is to trudge onward .","290677":"thankfully , i m not very clumsy at all and i ve only ever broken things on rare occasions . there was one time i almost dropped my ipad , though , and it slammed into the corner of the bed and the screen cracked .","290678":"tbh , i wish i was able to sing well . i would have definitely gone into the music industry if i had a great singing voice .","290679":"i prioritize a sense of humor over physical beauty . physical beauty and general attractiveness only take you so far , and what truly connects you to another being is the intimacy you develop through the meshing of your personalities .","290680":"i never understood why random people think that this line of questioning is appropriate . not only is it incredibly invasive and vile , but you also wouldn t act this way around a total stranger in real life so why do the same thing on the internet ?","290681":"my answer is still no , lmaoo . i have zero desire to be associated with him , and i m glad that he s not on askfm rn because it was irritating to have to delete his messages .","290682":"i have no reason to lie , so no . contrary to popular belief , not everyone is interested in pornography .","290683":"in order to watch interracial porn , i would first have to actually watch porn which i don t .","290684":"lol . absolutely not . not only am i in a relationship already , but even if i was single , i wouldn t even give him a second of my time .","290685":"i disliked gym class and calculus , but i absolutely loved european history and english .","290686":"of course , lmaoo .","290687":"yeah , we re going to the bahamas so that s why i needed to get a passport .","290688":"unfortunately , no . the only language i know is english .","290689":"the british broadcasting corporation , clearly .","290690":"lol , some people love getting worked up over the most insignificant things . can t relate .","290691":"i m feeling all right . lately my moods have been fluctuating between feeling euphoric and then feeling quite sad , but i m going through a lot of transitions in my life rn so it s to be expected .","290692":"hello i m doing well . i got a decent amount of sleep last night , so i don t feel too terrible . my only plan for the day is going to work , haha . i got here super early and i still have another minutes before i can go into the office .","290693":"lol , no .","290694":"i only have a few close friends , and i prefer it that way .","290695":"three things i want to do publish a book . travel cross country . adopt a dog . three things i ve already done graduated from college . signed a lease for a house . met my idol .","290696":"my boyfriend has made some sacrifices on my behalf at times , such as calling out of work or canceling a trip just to be with me because my mental health was bad and i needed support .","290697":"insecurity within themselves , whether they re insecure about who they are , how their life has played out , or their environment . people also have a tendency to attack things that they do not understand , especially if they were raised in a household that had a very strict , narrow perspective on certain issues and didn t allow the children to express themselves adequately .","290698":"yes , i am still learning about who i am . i think most people learn more about themselves as they get older , because we re constantly evolving and adapting to our environments .","290699":"not generally , no . i don t want people to worry incessantly about me , especially considering my s icidal thoughts are usually passive , not active . i often feel hopeless like dying , but i wouldn t act upon it .","290700":"i m not skeptical about them , but i ve never participated in them because i don t really follow accounts that offer contests , lol . i don t have an interest in them either .","290701":"my best friend , and recently within the past two years my therapist .","290702":"eek , i certainly hope so ! ! my day wasn t so terrible , but i know this week is going to feel super long because monday alone lasted forever , lmaoo .","290703":"i honestly don t know . i think it s wrong for a person to tell a complete stranger that they re going to hurt off themselves because it places the responsibility on the other person , and no one should feel responsible for keeping someone alive like that . especially someone like me who already struggles significantly with my own mental health and s icidal thoughts .","290704":"no , i ve never had surgery before .","290705":"most people i help , i do so without expecting anything in return . at the same time , however , i m selective about who i offer my help to because i m wary of putting my name out there in association with someone if i don t think they re a good worker .","290706":"i don t usually feel vulnerable . because i m open about my feelings and my life , it means i m comfortable discussing them and it doesn t put me in a vulnerable position .","290707":"i don t really get embarrassed , on my own behalf or other people s behalves , so nothing i ve been sent has ever been embarrassing . people feel comfortable around me to talk about taboo or gross things , lol .","290708":"if you like the taste of pumpkin spice , then sure . however , it s ridiculously expensive .","290709":"to a certain degree , yes . i m very open about my feelings to a variety of people , and i do have a tendency to over share on social media .","290710":"not as great as i remember , lmaoo . but it s still a warming , fulfilling beverage so i m happy with it .","290711":"when i think of those words , i usually equate complex with matters that are analytically driven , complicated , and or difficult , with multiple steps and layers . on the other hand , i equate deep to matters that perhaps delve psychologically into things , have multiple meanings behind them , and are symbolic .","290712":"i m quite relaxed and serene rn . there were so few people on the road driving home from work because of the jewish holiday , and it was dark and cloudy so it automatically put me in a very slow and appreciative mood . i stopped for a pumpkin spice latte on the way home , so now i m drinking it listening to quiet music .","290713":"it s okay to sit down and rest . it s okay to take a day off of work or school every once in a while if you re feeling burnt out . your body is telling you to slow down , and it s perfectly okay to listen . in our driven society , everyone is always running at full speed and we need to understand that it s normal and healthy to slow down or even stop temporarily .","290714":"there s really nothing that can help when i m in a depressive episode , but i do let people like my boyfriend or close friends know when i m feeling that way just so that they re aware . i don t pretend that i m fine except for when i m at work , i try not to allow my personal feelings dictate my work style .","290715":"nah , people are allowed to like what they like . if someone likes leopard print , then they have the freedom to wear it .","290716":"haha , no . i haven t even heard of that show .","290717":"my mental health and paying my bills .","290718":"hello do you have a question ?","290719":"lol , no . most of my poetry has to do with my feelings and mental health .","290720":"i have no idea what you re talking about .","290721":"i m not fully capable of having kids of my own , lol . i don t have the financial or mental stability for children . plus , i don t even think i want any .","290722":"he s undecided , he likes children but he isn t sure if he wants kids of his own .","290723":"i m fine , although quite distracted from my work and i m very frustrated . there have been construction workers at my house since am , redoing and repainting our chimney it s right next to my window so everything is so noisy . then my mother s friend and her two children came over for an hour , so the children were screaming the entire time . now the children are gone , and the construction workers seem to have taken a break or maybe are done . . . so perhaps i ll finally be able to finish my assignment . lmaoo .","290724":"well , for one i don t believe i even want children to begin with . secondly , other people aren t dumb for having children , lol . if they re a good parent , then who cares .","290725":"this is true , i was only basing it off of my understanding of new york s age of consent , which i believe is . i don t know what most other states are .","290726":"lol , no . i ve always had my own packs of cigarettes when i smoked .","290727":"i ve never heard of that term before .","290728":"you re an adult and can handle yourself , i m sure .","290729":"no , i m drinking coffee .","290730":"i ve surprisingly never felt the need to take a break from social media over the years , tbh . social media is more of a way for me to relax and escape from my everyday life , as well as vent and connect with other like minded individuals . the more that i think about it , if anything the only social media site that was harmful to me was probably tumblr because i followed blogs that were enabling and i noticed it kept me in an unhealthy frame of mind . i haven t used tumblr in over a year , though .","290731":"i can t really fathom an ending to begin with , so i can t make a determination as to whether our ending will be happy or unhappy .","290732":"their food tastes bad to me , lol . they re too greasy and every time i ve had any sort of fast food lately , it s irritated my stomach .","290733":"i can t stop thinking about moving out in two weeks .","290734":"some happy endings do exist , sure . it would be unrealistic to expect one for everything , though .","290735":"i can t remember the last time i ordered from mcdonalds , lol . i don t like their food .","290736":"i ll have to look next time i turn my tv on , lol .","290737":"idk , i never bothered to check . i assume it does because it s a smart tv .","290738":"i ve used both , but liquid soap is just easier and i like the variety of different soaps you can buy from places like bath body works . although , lemon scented soap is perhaps one of my favorites .","290739":"i like soaps with light fragrances , nothing that s too perfume y or overpowering .","290740":"i m in a relationship .","290741":"enforce much stricter gun regulations in the united states , and ensure that everyone in the world has free or affordable health care and adequate access to that health care .","290742":"i have generalized anxiety disorder . worry is my middle name , lmaoo .","290743":"no , i drive everywhere i go .","290744":"most of the time , the generic brand of products work and or taste just as well as the name brand of the same thing , so i buy the generic version since it s usually much cheaper .","290745":"i m sure i have at some point , but it s never been made explicitly clear to me .","290746":"i could be better , but i also could be much worse as well . i don t feel as angry as i did yesterday , but that s always apt to change as the day goes on .","290747":"i don t know what websites you re looking at , but the gender neutral dolls that i just saw were of both white people and people of color . as an aside , i think it would also be great if they expanded the gender neutral options to disabled people as well .","290748":"eh , for the most part i believe that you can simultaneously enjoy something that s problematic while also pointing out that said thing or person is problematic . however , cancel culture has also progressed now to the point where it s a bit ridiculous . i heard on the radio the other day that a reporter investigated a person who was doing a charitable deed and found tweets from when this person was years old where he exhibited racist views , and so the reporter publicized it and suddenly the person s endorsements were taken back just because of a few tweets he sent when he was a dumb teenager . in instances like that , i think cancel culture is ridiculous because we re all done problematic things in our lives . we re no better than anyone else .","290749":"from my understanding , i don t think intersex is considered a third sex because it s more of a genetic abnormality that ranges in characteristics of either male or female internal and or external parts and functions . for example , an intersex person may have both female and male gonads or a different range of chromosomes , and their sex hormones may differ from what s typically seen in those who are male or who are female .","290750":"i m usually fairly blunt and honest , so i ve never had a reason to really be passive aggressive .","290751":"i just looked it up briefly because i never heard about it before , but they seem to be a terrific idea . it s always good to have more inclusive representation , particularly when it involves children , and i like that they re being mindful of children whose gender identity doesn t align with what s stereotypically seen as typical in today s world .","290752":"i honestly don t understand the fear that people have of trans people , it truly gives a new level to the term transphobia . you wouldn t be able to distinguish if the person next to you is trans or cis , and it makes me wonder if this is a genuine concern for cis people that they re afraid they re sharing the bathroom with trans folks . i agree that there should be more gender neutral bathrooms , it would simply make things easier for people , especially those trans people who honestly do not know which bathroom is best suited towards them .","290753":"i understand your concern , but it s focused in the wrong places . a large majority of trans people aren t out to hurt other people , and the bigger threat to children would be cis people going out of their way to hurt them . a trans woman using her correct bathroom isn t an indication that she s out to hurt a child , because that s very discriminatory and transphobic to assume so . in the event that ab se would take place , a simple bathroom sign wouldn t deter a criminal from doing what they want to do . it s not as if a p do is going to look at the women s bathroom sign say well this is the women s room , i can t go in there . lmao .","290754":"i don t have a daughter . i don t really see how someone s stature and muscles have anything to do with their gender , either way . you sound overly concerned with what s in other people s pants , like what i just described . it s a bit bewildering .","290755":"no one asked me about that , so why would i address it ? that usually only happens with cis people anyway , a lot of cis people have a very unhealthy concern with what s in other people s pants .","290756":"whatever bathroom they re most comfortable using .","290757":"sounds like they ve just moved on with their life , tbh . it s incredibly common to not keep in touch with people from school or work after you ve moved on to something else , you re not going to remain friends with everyone you come across in life .","290758":"yeah , i think it s important for parents to encourage their children to chase their dreams and if they work hard enough , then they can achieve whatever they set their mind to . however , this is also coming with the understanding that failure is inevitable and you shouldn t be deterred from your goals if you fail the first few times .","290759":"i really have no idea , lol . i do know that if someone wants to commit a crime then they re probably going to find a way to do it one way or another , though .","290760":"trans men go to the mens room trans women go to the womens room .","290761":"considering they re both capable adults , they re more than capable of cleaning up after themselves , lol .","290762":"no , i ve only driven small cars .","290763":"i honestly have no idea . i never asked them .","290764":"i ve only ever video called my boyfriend once on snapchat , lol .","290765":"no , i was never taught how to ride a bike .","290766":"nope , i could never be involved in a profession like that .","290767":"the name sounds familiar , but i don t think i know who that is .","290768":", because i m turning in november .","290769":"jerk chicken . it came on a bed of pasta with mushrooms and asparagus .","290770":"considering i m only years old , i wasn t alive back then .","290771":"apparently so , it came out in .","290772":"either mario brothers or space invader .","290773":"lol , it was my female coworker and her husband . i don t mind seeing a select few of my coworkers outside of work , although i ve only ever hung out with two of them on the weekends .","290774":"i finished most of my work and grabbed dinner with my coworker . i just got home a little while ago .","290775":"yeah , i listen to the radio every morning and evening on my drive to and from work .","290776":"of course , it s on the radio all the time .","290777":"i m all right . i just tried caribbean food for the first time it was really good .","290778":"a few people come to mind , people in my life who have passed away mostly .","290779":"yeah , a few things have happened today which have really gotten under my skin and bothered me . i thought i would feel better if i took a nap then restarted with a fresh perspective , but i ve been feeling dreadful ever since i woke back up .","290780":"i don t particularly believe that i m a strong person mentally , at least . . . although physically , i m very weak too .","290781":"i can barely get out of bed rn , let alone leave the house and go to the gym . i appreciate the sentiment though .","290782":"i just said , it s because i have zero motivation . lol . i m honestly just sad and frustrated and angry . i just took a nap and all of these emotions came flooding back and i feel terrible all over again .","290783":"you can choose which one you want , i believe . i think i purchased the tb xbox one console a few years ago .","290784":"no , i ve never been prescribed xanax before .","290785":"i m laying in bed , and i have a few things i need to do but no motivation to actually get up and do them .","290786":"i m sure i ve had energy drinks that had ginseng as an ingredient .","290787":"i don t remember much anymore . they all have meshed into one giant blob , at this point ,","290788":"i don t have the slightest idea .","290789":"as far as i m aware , some people still probably use it .","290790":"unstable , creative , driven .","290791":"cold cuts , probably .","290792":"i never saw the purpose of slut shaming because someone else s sex life isn t your business , lol . if someone decides to have casual sex , then that s their decision . if it doesn t personally affect you , then i don t really see the reason to waste time and energy on it .","290793":"i think it s generally a terrible idea , obviously . if you re with someone and you don t want to be with them anymore , you should have the maturity to talk to them about your feelings instead of going behind their back and cheat on them with someone else .","290794":"you have to remember that it was your decision your decision alone not theirs . you have control over what you do with your body , and something as personal as abortion isn t up to the decision of anyone else besides yourself . if someone is judging you for having an abortion , then it doesn t matter what they think at the end of the day . you did what was best for yourself at this time , and that s all that matters .","290795":"i m in a relationship , yes . even if i was single , that wouldn t mean that i was available .","290796":"that s great if you want to day drink as long as you re responsible about it . i won t be participating , though .","290797":"no , i rarely ever day drink unless it s a very special occasion .","290798":"i have zero clue as to what you re talking about .","290799":"no , but i ve been listening to video game soundtracks a lot lately .","290800":"i have no idea what you re referring to .","290801":"i answered this same exact question earlier this morning . however , to sum it up i prefer to plan things , but not very far in advance . most of my current plans have been rather spontaneous , being devised and then enacted within the same day . as for my weekend plans , i ve been working all morning and i m also planning on cleaning , doing laundry , and packing later today . i m probably going to do the same thing tomorrow as well .","290802":"like , do you mean talking to them and making sure they re okay or just checking up on them on social media ? i think it depends on the situation . if you two ended on good terms , then it isn t unreasonable to talk every once in a while . however , this also comes with the risk of complicating emotions again or resurfacing feelings , which gets confusing . missing your ex is normal , unfortunately , but you don t want to hold them back or hold yourself back especially when you know you both can be happier without each other .","290803":"no . nobody is perfect , we re all humans .","290804":"i agree with you . if you apologize without admitting fault and without changing your behavior , then the apology is meaningless . you re misunderstanding me , though . when i was younger , i was fully convinced that situations that were not in my control were still my fault . apologies were demanded out of me , and because i was convinced that i was in the wrong , i berated myself and apologized profusely . it s taken me years to understand that those situations were not my fault .","290805":"i like answering questions , especially when people feel comfortable enough with me to ask me for advice . i also enjoy reading my friends answers and getting to know them better .","290806":"i ve found other people attractive , but i ve never been romantically interested in anyone else while dating my boyfriend .","290807":"kudos for trying to make sense , lol .","290808":"quite the opposite , actually . when i apologize , i mean every single aspect of that apology , even when i m not wrong . it s taken me years to realize that i wasn t actually wrong in those scenarios .","290809":"this makes absolutely zero sense . kudos for trying , though ?","290810":"you re absolutely correct , i ve ascended straight from hell itself .","290811":"unfortunately , yes . i ve been conditioned into apologizing for situations that weren t my fault to simply put an end to the situation entirely because i knew that if i fought back , it would just make things more difficult , even if i knew i wasn t in the wrong . i ve gotten much better at standing up for myself over recent years , but i still have that apologizing behavior instilled in me , and my first instinct to pretty much anything is to apologize profusely .","290812":"talk to your parents about the situation so that they can sit down with the other children s parents and school administrators to find a solution to the problem .","290813":"i honestly don t remember , i m sure i ve had plenty of weird arguments with anons over the years , though . lmaoo .","290814":"it s easy to hide aspects of your personality in person as well . a person will only reveal about themselves what s most comfortable to them , whether that s online or in person . and i personally believe that everyone is a wee bit different in person compared to online anyway , simply because there s a slight disconnect between how someone can express themselves through text versus expressing themselves verbally .","290815":"you don t need to meet a person face to face in order to love them . when you talk to someone often and get to know their personality , their interests , their opinions , and just in general how you two connect together , that isn t something only reserved for people who meet irl . i love many of my online friends and i care about them deeply . just because i haven t met them face to face doesn t make my love for them less valid .","290816":"well , as a friend yes . we don t talk that often anymore , but we do talk via snapchat occasionally .","290817":"the best age depends entirely on the individual , as well as the couple , and there isn t really an ideal age that can be universal for everyone . for some people , it s in their early s . for others , it s not until much later in their lives . really , the best age to marry is the age where you feel most comfortable with your partner and can envision and look forward to spending the rest of your life with that person .","290818":"yes . when i was a teenager , i had an online friend who i talked to every afternoon after school . we began talking when i was in middle school , and i didn t actually meet her in person until my first year of college . we grew to become best friends and i genuinely loved her , even though we didn t meet in person until years later .","290819":"i was very jealous in the past of my friends whose lives seemed more put together than mine was , but eventually i realized that most people put up facades to give off the impression that they re stable when they re really not . you simply don t know what someone else is actually going through so it s useless to judge .","290820":"lottery tickets . i ve never purchased lotto before and i ve never seen the point in playing lotto because there s a high probability that you ll never win , and often it s just a waste of money .","290821":"uh , are you talking about me or the anon ? lmaoo . if you re referring to me , then quite obviously this is not true considering i do love many people .","290822":"i love them all equally . when you re in love with someone , their looks and personality and intelligence sorta mesh into one entire entity and you love them for everything that they are , not just parts of them .","290823":"all of the above .","290824":"i don t make grammatical mistakes very often on social media , although my use of grammar on social media is quite different from my use of grammar when i m writing professionally , lol .","290825":"waking up super early in the morning on the weekend when no one else is awake , making a cup of coffee , and sitting on the patio outside . i love relaxing and listening to the sounds of nature without the accompanying sounds of traffic , lol and not being bothered for a few hours .","290826":"writing , both poetry and prose , is arguably the only skill i have , lmaoo . i ve always prided myself on my ability to write and it s been my saving grace in a variety of instances .","290827":"i ve played a vr game once in my life , and it made me physically nauseous and dizzy so i couldn t continue playing it .","290828":"i m more apt to pick brains over physical beauty , particularly because beauty only goes skin deep and it isn t an indication of how your relationship with a person will play out . you create chemistry with someone over how well you two relate , your shared interests , etc etc . , and that isn t something dictated by beauty standards .","290829":"i believe i would rather continue my life as it currently is . starting over means risking the chance of even worse things to happen , and i m currently in a position that i wouldn t want to risk losing .","290830":"i m hesitant to say yes because i m very critical about poetry and writing in general , so more than likely i ll probably hurt your feelings . i would rather avoid that .","290831":"no , i m fairly non confrontational and i like to resolve situations quickly . if someone is so dedicated to fighting back and proving me wrong , then it says a lot more about them than it ever would about me . having the last word isn t necessary and you need to focus more on your own peace of mind than anything else .","290832":"one of the most fun days i ve had in recent years was my best friend s bachelorette party . we went out east to a wine tasting tour on a big bus with only a few other guests , and everything was all inclusive . we visited three different vineyards , one of which was technically members only but they allowed us in anyway , and then the following morning , we went to the spa . i was with my best friend and the other woman in her bridal party , it was just the three of us and it was a lot of fun .","290833":"sunrises and sunsets . seeing your loved ones laugh , smile , and be happy . cute animals . watching a musician or an artist pour their heart into their craft . acts of selflessness . quiet mornings with cups of coffee . reading what will be your favorite book for the very first time .","290834":"i m not entirely sure . the thought is comforting and interesting , but i don t know if i necessarily believe in it or not .","290835":"no , i seldom get anons who are hateful or purposely trying to get me down these days . and whenever i do , chances are i just delete their messages instead of entertaining their notions . it isn t worth the energy .","290836":"local , state , and federal governments have enacted to ban flavored e cigarettes at a much faster , more efficient rate than they ve ever attempted to do with any sort of dangerous firearm . in new york , the ban was enacted within one week even though more people pass away from actual cigarettes than e cigarettes . when it comes to guns , there have been countless tragedies over the past years yet nothing has been done to remedy the problem . it s disgusting .","290837":"no , it isn t immature , and people have the freedom to color or style their hair however they want regardless of their age depending on their occupation , at least . i have a creative job , and therefore , i m allowed the freedom to express myself whichever way i want .","290838":"i don t remember . whoops .","290839":"i prefer planning things in advance , but not too far in advance . i simply don t know how i ll be feeling on a particular day if i plan for something , say a week in advance . i could very much be into the plan the day we made it , but when that day comes , i could be feeling totally different . most of my plans are rather spontaneous these days anyway , usually happening within the same night as discussed . occasionally i ll text a friend or a friend will text me and ask if i m available that same night , and then we might do something .","290840":"of course it s possible . just because you deeply love someone doesn t necessarily mean that it s a healthy relationship , and also relationships are a two way street . you may love and care for someone deeply , but if they don t feel the same towards you , then a reasonable thing to do would be to break up .","290841":"i ve always wanted to color it like a sea green . idk why i haven t done it yet tbh , but perhaps i ll try it soon .","290842":"the last time i had a home cooked meal was two nights ago , it was brown rice with veggies and steak . i ate take out well , delivery last night from a local hero joint . i don t remember the last time i ate fast food tbh , but i believe it was wendy s . i like their chicken sandwiches .","290843":"i seldom ask myself philosophical questions these days , simply because i either don t have the time to worry about stuff like that or because the topic in itself is meaningless .","290844":"online , people assume i m younger than i actually am and that i m much taller than i actually am , lol . irl , people tend to see me as a bit timid on first glance because i m quiet around people i don t particularly know very well . but once i get to know someone , i m actually fairly loud .","290845":"i give people attention much more often than i receive attention . tbh , i m constantly checking up on my friends and i text a few people almost every day . sometimes i feel weird that i m the one who texts everyone first rarely ever do people text me first to start a conversation , but i try not to think about it very much .","290846":"any sort of emotional and or physical ab se .","290847":"i just purchased some of my bedroom furniture for the new house , actually . it should be arriving within the next weeks . otherwise , i m planning on working on freelance assignments for my job , cleaning , and packing .","290848":"i think i posted this once already , but this is my most recent selfie from last week .","290849":"no , it isn t wrong at all . not everyone has a good family life and it s fine if you love your friends more than your family .","290850":"you mean my phone ? i have a samsung galaxy s .","290851":"nope ! ! that s not me . i would appreciate if everyone reported this account . thanks for bringing this to my attention .","290852":"they get an additional five years time added to their student loan debt .","290853":"i don t have any plans for the upcoming weekend , no . my friend invited me to one of her roommates birthday bash tomorrow night , but it seems like there are going to be hella people there , so i m probably not going to go . my other plans just include working on freelance assignments for my job , cleaning , and packing .","290854":"my day wasn t anything spectacular . i woke up around am , worked for eight hours , and then came home . i ve been home for about an hour i m just treating myself to an iced coffee because my commute was over an hour long .","290855":"i m not a fan of trump , but i m even less of a fan of the people who could potentially take over his position if he is impeached .","290856":"yes , she made a new account last night .","290857":"answering questions to keep the number of questions in my inbox low so that i don t lose track of anything , in the event that someone asks me a somewhat important question or asks for my advice on something .","290858":"yeah , i enjoy the taste of tequila .","290859":"hello do you have a question ?","290860":"not very often , unless it s in breakfast foods like parfaits and whatnot . i eat vegetables a lot more often .","290861":"i hate cleaning the bathroom , particularly when i m scrubbing the toilet down . i would rather do any other household chore over cleaning the bathroom , lol .","290862":"i think it s disgusting . any sort of assault is something that should never be joked about .","290863":"i think it ultimately depends on the situation at hand , as well as who the person is because people handle heartbreak differently . it s hard to compare being a heartbreaker vs being heartbroken , particularly because there are so many variables that go into it .","290864":"i use grubhub and doordash . i don t think i ve ever used ubereats or postmates before .","290865":"everyone follow morgan s new page ! !","290866":"i wouldn t be in a fight to begin with .","290867":"i probably wouldn t have found a job , tbh . i initially went to school for creative writing , but apart from going into teaching , i realized i didn t really know what sort of job i could get with a creative writing degree and i didn t want to be a teacher . if anything , i m much less creative now than i was in my formative years , mostly because i don t have much time to dedicate to writing creatively anymore .","290868":"definitely not , haha . the idea of me being under hypnosis is a bit frightening .","290869":"i m a writer editor for a publishing company .","290870":"depression , anxiety , and borderline personality disorder .","290871":"i m sorta in dbt right now , it s like a combination of cbt with components of dbt with focuses on mindfulness .","290872":"i always sit in the back seat . it s really weird to sit in the front of any of those types of transports .","290873":"not yet . i have a few more weeks .","290874":"i don t think i have one .","290875":"cont . . . mental illnesses are not like this and are very crippling to those suffering from them . and they also used gay r pe etc as a joke and i m like wtf ? they always say a joke is a joke and that i have no sense of humour or take things too seriously . i know no one should joke about r pe , but then for other stuffs i m beginning to think whether i m too sensitive or serious ? i don t get along well with people my age because it seems like i don t find any humour in their jokes . i am funny , and i can make people laugh without bringing all that in , but they can t see it . tbh , it sounds like you re hanging out with the completely wrong crowd of people . you re absolutely right in that jokes about mental illness , the lgbt community , and s xual assault are very wrong . it s detrimental to those communities to use trauma and typical mental health symptoms as jokes or to portray them in a light where people don t take it seriously . i don t really think you re being too sensitive , because stuff like that bothers me too .","290876":"they meant aesthetic , lol . like , your aesthetic is kinda like a theme or a vibe you give off with a social media presence . it s easier to have an aesthetic with social media pages like twitter , instagram , or tumblr . not so much askfm , but i suppose it is still possible with the answers you give and pictures you post .","290877":"cont . . . opposite . this is the reason why i am always very wary or cautious to be honest ! well i m not arguing or anything , just would like another perspective or something ! i totally understand . my close friends don t really have disordered eating habits well , one of them does but it s a bit borderline and complicated , so when they re trying to lose weight , it definitely is in a healthy manner . those are just my close friends , though . i don t really like placing judgment on people with whom i m not close because like you said , you don t really know their intentions , what they re doing , etc etc . if someone comes up to me and brings it up first , then perhaps i ll congratulate them . but otherwise , i don t say anything .","290878":"i don t think i would use either of those terms to describe the idea of treating other people better than you treat yourself . it s almost as if you re cheating yourself out of happiness , so while it can be seen as selfless , it s also self destructive .","290879":"i m at a transformative stage of my life , where i m making big changes and i have to force myself to endure these changes to emerge unscathed from the other side .","290880":"dovbts idk , his anons are like . . . so cute . and i love his artwork and it s like one giant furry community over there , lol . it s really endearing .","290881":"google can be useful .","290882":"i don t agree with ddlg , but everyone is going to have their own opinion .","290883":"i m anti circumcision this is pretty unpopular from my understanding . i don t agree with trans kids getting hormone blockers at such young ages . even though i have a college degree myself , i don t believe college is for everyone and it s perfectly fine for a person not to attend college as long as they do have some other plan in mind for their future .","290884":"i support a person s right to choose whether or not to get an abortion pro choice . i disagree with the death penalty . i support lgbt rights .","290885":"i don t see anything wrong with that , unless you re going into detail and scaring them about what adulthood is actually like , rofl .","290886":"most fetishes aren t bad , no . a lot of people have different fetishes to some degree , but they all have the potential of becoming unhealthy if indulged in too frequently to the point where it becomes an addiction .","290887":"rofl , no . she would never do that , especially considering she s also been in a long term relationship and has been married for two years .","290888":"lol . just because you seem like you re insecure with your own prospects doesn t mean i m throwing my education career in people s faces . there s a big difference between , for example , answering a question and then randomly splurting out oh em gee , i got such a good college education my job is better than everyone else s ! my education wasn t fantastic and my job isn t fantastic . i m happy with them but they could be a lot better .","290889":"lol .","290890":"svspicion and i were never close friends , lol . i m sure her wedding is going to be quaint awesome and i m really happy for her .","290891":"i don t think that s true there s nothing to be jealous of . cc cajundoxyy","290892":"i think i was too young to be in genuine love with them , but i definitely did love them with my understanding of love at the time .","290893":"also you re the only person who answered it so it s possible that it wasn t even sent to anyone else , lol . not to mention the fact that i wouldn t misgender myself , lmaoo .","290894":"i got a notification that cajundoxyy answered a question that mentioned me , lmaoo . perhaps you were the one who sent my link around since allegedly you know when the question was sent .","290895":"i ve been at work since am , lol . i wouldn t have had time to send my own link around nor would i anyway .","290896":"let s be honest , i probably deserve it . lmaoo .","290897":"oh yes , i am perished and am destined to haunt the souls of askfm for eternity . ?","290898":"i wasn t invited as far as i m aware , it s only for her close friends family .","290899":"i don t answer questions for hours and suddenly i m deceased . lmao .","290900":"i don t have any enemies , as far as i can tell .","290901":"yeah absolutely . tbh that describes me to a tee . i have views that align with intersectional feminism but i haven t called myself a feminist in a long time because i don t agree with a lot of the modern movements and the things modern day feminists tend to focus on . you re not expected or obligated to label your beliefs anyway . if you don t feel comfortable calling yourself a feminist then you don t have to .","290902":"no , i don t follow people on request . thanks for the follow , though","290903":"idk , either hummus or yogurt . i have hummus and pretzels baby carrots most days , and i try to have a small yogurt for breakfast most mornings otherwise i ll splurge on a bagel , blah .","290904":"yes , exactly ! ! it s something i ve always known but was too afraid to do anything about . however , over the past few years it s really presented itself to me and i had to make a lot of choices that were albeit difficult , but necessary for my own happiness and progress . it s terrifying to step forward into something and you don t know how it will turn out , but you also cannot stay put because then nothing changes .","290905":"yes , quite a few times . my gut instinct generally tends to be correct even if the person presents themselves as a kind , lovable person . over time , their true colors begin to show . i ve always just had a knack for seeing through people s mask and i can feel their vibe , for lack of a better word .","290906":"i ve always thought that the way i could make the most impact on this world was by advocating for mental health awareness on social media because of the way you can reach thousands of people with just one post . i try to talk about mental health and illness whenever it s appropriate the opportunity presents itself because mental health is stigmatized more people need to talk about it .","290907":"i used to have a real , genuine fear of change not like small changes like hair styles or colors , but major changes like job changes , lifestyle changes , etc etc . over time , i realized that my life wouldn t improve unless i took that daring step forward into the unknown . i couldn t hide within myself for my entire life because that only hinders progress .","290908":"yeah , there have been several major turning points in my life . after my freshman year of college , i had to decide whether to continue in massachusetts or return home . when my mental health became bad three years ago , i had to decide whether to d e or seek help . when my old job filed for bankruptcy , i had to decide whether to stick it through or find a new job . when the opportunity presented itself for me to move into a new house , i had to decide whether to stay home or take the leap and sign the lease .","290909":"whenever i think of being truly happy , i always think about the few vacations my boyfriend i have gone on together where it was just the two of us . we had no responsibilities other than waking up and finding something to eat to fuel us , and the day was open to any possibility . we didn t have to worry about work or family , we took the days each hour at a time , we took mid afternoon naps because we simply could , and we could stay up late without a care in the world .","290910":"uh , does saving their life count ? lol . otherwise , idk i guess it would be all the times i went out of my way to make them feel better , whether it was through skipping work and spending quality time with them , buying them cute trinkets and things that i know make them happy to cheer them up , visiting them in the hospital and sneaking in goodies , surprising them with home cooked food after they had a long day at work , etc etc .","290911":"it s difficult , if not impossible , to change other people . outside of the fact that you shouldn t try to change someone else to begin with , a person won t change unless they realize they need that change in themselves and put the work in to make a difference .","290912":"art is self expression , whether that s through painting , drawing , sculpture , photography , writing , music , etc etc . art is an extension of oneself to where the artist is revealing their vulnerabilities to either release pent up emotions or portray a specific message .","290913":"i prefer to love , because sometimes to be loved feels like the other person is putting you up on a pedestal or they re expecting something of you that you cannot return .","290914":"i really value honesty and humor in my friends . if you can t be honest with yourself or those around you , then you re simply putting on a facade and not portraying your true self , and that leads to insincerity and confusion down the road . similarly , i also like when my friends have a sense of humor and can laugh at themselves or just not take themselves seriously all the time .","290915":"i don t really believe raising self confidence is something you can simply do by following a few steps . it takes years of self realization and understanding your own needs to really develop good self confidence , and tbh , i m not even halfway there yet . i m a hell of a lot more confident in myself these days than i ever was in the past , but i m still insecure about a lot of things and unhappy with some aspects of my life as well .","290916":"let s just have one drink , then we ll leave ! i should know myself better at this point , but that almost never happens . lol .","290917":"my love is unconditional to a certain degree , but i still do have boundaries when it comes to relationships and friendships . although i love my boyfriend unconditionally for the most part , i would not continue the relationship if he was acting ab sive towards me or didn t respect me . you have to value your own needs and well being too .","290918":"ugh , i understand this all too well . sometimes i see people much younger than me who are so much more accomplished , or even people my age who recently received their doctorate degrees , and it makes me feel terrible about myself . however , you have to remember that you are your own individual and everyone s paths are different . just because someone is making an impact at a young age or has a different life that you yearn for doesn t mean that you are invalid . try to utilize these feelings to push yourself to do better , learn better , improve yourself .","290919":"people are beginning to realize that they don t need a significant other to be complete we re already whole human beings without being in a relationship . people are focusing more on themselves and their goals .","290920":"i don t believe i know anyone with seasonal depression just good ole regular depressive disorder . like any other mental illness , the best thing to do for yourself is seek treatment if it s available to you . just because it s seasonal doesn t mean it s less valid than year round depression and you deserve to get proper treatment all the same .","290921":"aw thank you , that was very motivational when i woke up this morning ! ! i m so tired i m excited to finally lay down and sleep even though i slept for a solid eight hours last night . i was going to continue packing , but i can just do that tomorrow . . .","290922":"i don t feel it anymore by william fitzsimmons https www . youtube . com watch ? v r xniltjuw","290923":"i ve never watched macgyver before .","290924":"eh , i don t agree entirely but i definitely do understand where the sentiment is coming from . i compliment people on their weight loss , but only people i know who are trying to lose weight . i m not going to tell a stranger or acquaintance something like you look great ! did you lose weight ? because that could be offensive .","290925":"you can probably find her entire speech on youtube .","290926":"i don t have an opinion of what other people decide to do with their lives . also , if you want to talk sh t about people yourself then at least tag them , lol . cc svspicion","290927":"are you talking about greta at the un ? i made a post about her yesterday . i thought it was inspirational i agree with her .","290928":"what s desirable and undesirable depends on the individual . also , i haven t heard the term body count since like early college when that sh t was somehow still relevant , lol .","290929":"i can t remember the last time i ordered a burger fries , rofl . however , i normally eat the fries last .","290930":"i would choose money . money is always necessary , especially now .","290931":"courrtana ? ? ?","290932":"? ? ? it doesn t really matter to me where someone is from . a person s country of origin doesn t necessarily dictate what their personality is like .","290933":"i ve actually met a select few friends who i originally talked to on the internet ! ! one was one of my closest friends when i was a teenager , we met in person after talking online for years . and then i also met courrtana two years ago ! !","290934":"no . i ve never been to egypt have no intentions of traveling there .","290935":"hello do you have a question ?","290936":"eh , i m fine . i ve been better tbh , but i ve also been much worse . i ve honestly been laying in bed nearly all afternoon apart from when my family was over for dinner .","290937":"i have my essays posted on medium . com . http www . medium . com poetalunam i m not sure if this link will work , it keeps redirecting me back to the app .","290938":"yeah , i used to write a lot of poetry short stories . as i ve gotten older , i ve started writing things that more resemble personal essays than anything else .","290939":"i ve heard of it , but i ve never seen it before .","290940":"no , i have no intentions of making new friends .","290941":"sometimes i question the validity of my own existence , but to answer your generic question , yes i am a real human being .","290942":"as my bio also indicates , i m years old .","290943":"greta thunberg . i heard about her speech at the un and wanted to learn more about her .","290944":". . . did you just ask and answer your own question ? lmaoo .","290945":"lol . i haven t watched friends in years , so i don t really know .","290946":"climate change and social injustice . there are millions of people from my generation and older who simply ignore or even add fuel to the fire of critical issues related to civil unrest and global warming , and it s inevitably putting younger generations i . e . teenagers and younger at risk .","290947":"the people i surround myself with , i . e . my boyfriend and close friends . even when things in my life are going horribly wrong or i m not happy with something , i can always rely on their support .","290948":"i don t believe there s anything that can always make me feel better , because often i get into depressive ruts where all i can do is really wait out the episode . spending time with my boyfriend alleviates some of those feelings , but it doesn t cure anything .","290949":"i kinda like this picture ?","290950":"i believe that s fair in most circumstances that i can think of , yes . just because you were a minor during the time in which something happened doesn t mean that you re absolved of responsibility simply because you were underage . being underage doesn t mean that you don t know right from wrong , the repercussions of your actions , or the implications of doing something bad .","290951":"i think it s usually much better to be forthcoming about your feelings just tell them how you feel about them , be honest and candid , and take it from there . they have the option to either accept your feelings or reject them .","290952":"it would probably bother me , but realistically i know that it technically shouldn t bother me because when two people are on a break , they re essentially broken up and are free to do what they want as a single individual .","290953":"i believe i tried them years upon years ago , from like burger king or something ?","290954":"my go to weapons have always been a combat shotgun or a hunting rifle both modified , obviously .","290955":"uh , depending on my anxiety levels . . . perhaps anywhere between a to an , lol .","290956":"i m the youngest member of my immediate family and

wear heels , i think i ve only actually worn them on one or two occasions before taking them off after like minutes , lmaoo .","290960":"i m addicted to caffeine and nicotine . i have the potential , both in terms of genetics and due to my personality , to develop addictions to drugs and alcohol .","290961":"i m out having a quick drink with a friend to catch up since we haven t seen each other in a while .","290962":"i get addicted to things easily , if that s what you mean .","290963":"i just purchased a new bed for the house i m renting next month","290964":"arguing with your partner isn t a

would just deal with it .","290967":"no , i probably wouldn t take them at all because i know myself and i would probably ab se them .","290968":"yes , i probably should .","290969":"no , i ve never left the united states .","290970":"i do have a fitbit , although i haven t worn it in a while . i think it was totally worth the price because it can be used as a motivational tool . i liked tracking my steps , my calorie intake , and how much i burned throughout the day .","290971":"yeah , i eat them pretty often .","290972":"both ? lol . i fear change , but rationally i know that change is often for the better . we cannot stay stagnant our entire lives , and change is necessary for growth .","290973":"yeah , i ve taken a few of my friendships and my relationship for granted in the past . it wasn t until i almost lost my relationship when i realized i needed to express my gratitude more and overall just put more effort into the relationship .","290974":"cheating on your partner , no doubt .","290975":"i love cooking breakfast food , particularly scrambled eggs and bacon and english muffins . obviously it s one of the easiest meals you can make , but breakfast is my favorite meal of the

campfires in his backyard .","290990":"the sky most nights absolutely astounds me . ?","290991":"i don t really think any of my opinions are unpopular , but i ll post a few controversial ones the vaping ban isn t in pursuit of people s health . the cigarette industry is losing revenue by vapes and so they simply want to make more money . white people cannot experience systemic racism . most diet trends , especially the keto diet , are extremely unhealthy . circumcision is barbaric and is just another form of genital m tiliation . alcohol use is too normalized in today s society . binge drinking until you black out is very unhealthy , alarming , and can lead to addiction down the road . and before anyone comes at me because i drink , i can simultaneously recognize that there s a drinking problem in society while also be responsible with my drinking myself . i m also no exception to the rule .","290992":"nah , he s had the same sort of style for years now . he s casual but has

aware of it before just now , if you re talking about the whole billboard thing that happened earlier this year .","291017":"i m most comfortable with simply telling people how i feel about them and reminding them that i care about them and appreciate their friendship relationship . i think it s important to be forthcoming with your emotions towards people like that because sometimes people need to hear it .","291018":"i mean , lying in general is a bad thing to do regardless of what it is for the most part . i believe you shouldn t lie to your significant other , though , and there ideally should be a foundation of trust and communication between both partners so that no one is compelled to lie .","291019":"no , i don t believe so . i took religion classes when i was a young child and i stopped believing in god when i was like years old , from my understanding .","291020":"i ve never had it before , but it doesn t sound very appealing .","291021":"it s been quite a while , probably a few years or so . i don t have many people in my life to begin with , mostly because i ve drifted away from other people whom i didn t talk to often after college . i only have about four or five friends who i talk to regularly these days , and i m happy with them . the last time i cut someone out of my life , it was because they weren t good for me and they only encouraged my own toxic and unhealthy behavior . i reached a point in my life where i needed to improve myself , and that required cutting people out who weren t productive to my own progress .","291022":"i mean , i ve cooked on the stove as well as in the oven , but they ve always been very simply meals like breakfast foods , chicken cutlets , hot dogs and hamburgers , mixed vegetables , etc etc . cooking is relatively easy , but i just don t have much experience with it .","291023":"to be confident means to be assured in your own personality , your strengths and abilities , and your tolerance to other people s antics . when you re confident , you know your worth and won t tolerate less than what you deserve . to be cocky means to be so confident in yourself that you view yourself as superior to other people , and it goes hand in hand with arrogance . you believe that other people aren t as good as you .","291024":"i don t really know much about children in general , but i do believe that learning how to cook should start early . i was never taught how to cook as a child , and it s something i ve unfortunately brought with me to adulthood . i think by the age of or , a child should know how to cook basic meals . if there s ever an emergency where a child needs to cook because a parent is absent , it s important for them to know how to at least make themselves dinner or possibly do the same for younger siblings .","291025":"politics in general , particularly the united states democratic candidates for the next election . i haven t done any research into who i m going to vote for , and i really need to expand my knowledge on whose policies i most agree with to make an informed decision .","291026":"this is difficult for me to answer because i also struggle with self esteem issues , although they have gotten a lot better over the years . to someone who is struggling , it s important to remember your worth and make sure to focus on your own happiness instead of downplaying your needs to satisfy the needs of others . contrary to what you probably believe , your own comfort and satisfaction is of the utmost importance and you deserve every good thing that will be coming to you . you will have good days and bad , but remember that the bad days do not define you .","291027":"to whom i appreciate i appreciate you because you ve exhibited patience with me during the roughest moments of my life , as well as undying support and the willingness to learn more about me to understand my mental health . i appreciate you because you ve gone out of your way to ensure my happiness and comfort on multiple occasions , and you understand my need to be alone at certain times . i appreciate you because of the trust instilled between us after much trial and error . i appreciate you because you ve continued to give me faith and hope even when times are bleak , and you instilled in me a sense of confidence that i never had before .","291028":"it depends on the individual , because different techniques work for different people . it does take a lot of time , patience , and an ability to find yourself again after exiting a relationship , and that timeline is also different for everyone . focus on yourself first and foremost , because your own well being and needs are most important during this stage of your life . surround yourself with friends and family , work towards accomplishing your goals , and continue doing things that bring you peace and passion .","291029":"most likely , yes . everything affects the way you are due to the environment you were both raised in and continue to be involved with as you get older . if i surrounded myself with different people and lived elsewhere , i would probably be a completely different person than who i am now .","291030":"my responses to stimuli in my life .","291031":"i ve come to understand that it s better to have no expectations when it comes to life in general , because most times you ll just end up being disappointed .","291032":"my father , or they re going to have to hire a maid or an in home health aide . i would hope they would lean more towards hiring a maid because i wouldn t want my father doing all of that work by himself .","291033":"yes , the legal drinking age is in the united states .","291034":"i honestly believe that you re over thinking this . i understand your paranoia and hesitance to trust people because i m the same exact way , but you also have to try to force yourself to look at this situation rationally . if she doesn t exhibit any tell tale signs of being fake other than what your anxiety is telling you , then there s really no basis upon which you could make the assumption that she isn t a real friend . it would be different if you ve caught her in lies , caught her back talking you , or something similar to those things . . . but if your only reason to believe she isn t being real with you is because you just feel that she s fake , without evidence to prove that , then that isn t a sound basis . trust me , it took me years to realize that my own paranoia isn t indicative of how people actually are , but it s an unfortunate truth .","291035":"you can just exchange them for a fuller pack , that s what i did when i worked in the drug store and a customer who was honest and sincere came up to me and explained there were already things missing from the product .","291036":"no , i don t really use sugar unless i go to somewhere like starbucks or dunkin and order regular brewed coffee . for example , i treated myself this morning to a large starbucks coffee with whole milk sugar instead of just making a cup at home , haha .","291037":"hello do you have a question ?","291038":"i just got home from my boyfriend s house , so i m getting ready to eat some breakfast . afterwards when my family wakes up , i m going to start a few loads of laundry , clean the house , and organize more of my belongings so that i can pack them away .","291039":"nah , i didn t do anything special for my th birthday . i just remember taking my very first shot of vodka with my college roommate and her friends , and absolutely hating it . lmaoo .","291040":"i ve been talking about my boyfriend for the last minutes , so yes . lol .","291041":"these days , no . if we re in public we ll just generally hold hands and give each other forehead or cheek kisses and stuff like that .","291042":"this isn t a question so i m not sure how you d like me to respond .","291043":"no , we ll hold hands and hug and generally be close to each other . but it s not as if we ll make out or have s x in public anymore .","291044":"i mean , i m a realist and i ve always been that way . i find no use in optimism but i m also not very pessimistic either .","291045":"haha , yes . we used to do a lot of pda when we were much younger .","291046":"you ll have to be more specific . who are you talking about ?","291047":"uh , i m not entirely sure what this means .","291048":"no , it grew out within two days anyway .","291049":"oh yes , that happened to me on dozens of occasions . mind you , i never fulfilled those returns anything that i previously mentioned . if you re going to be a d ck then i m not going to give you your money back .","291050":"yes , you have found my secret . i m actually from victorian era england .","291051":"half empty or completely bags of food , saying they didn t like it . half used boxes of diapers , saying their child grew too fast . my boyfriend works in a pet store and people have tried returning biscuits . . . that their dog already ate . people are ridiculous point blank .","291052":"i mean , yeah it s a bit silly but i ve experienced much worse .","291053":"nah , i only really use askfm a lot on the weekends when i have free time . i also check it at night during weekdays when i m home from work , but i don t answer many questions .","291054":"nah , i only did a zero once and i didn t like it . usually i shave it down on a or .","291055":"it s longer than how it looks in my profile picture rn .","291056":"i like what i have now the most , although i desperately need a fresh shave .","291057":"i seldom wear gloves because i just can t be bothered .","291058":"well , you just have to keep trying . look up interview tips and whatnot , how to make your resume the best it can be , how you should dress depending on what sort of job it is , etc etc .","291059":"everyone has bombed at least one interview , lol . it isn t unusual and its pretty normal at this point .","291060":"why are we still discussing this ? lmaoo . don t be so hung up on this one interview . instead of feeling sorry and angry , focus your energy on how you can better present yourself for the next interview . everyone has bad interviews during their life , they re not a big deal and there will always be more chances to sell yourself .","291061":"of course . presentation matters a lot in the workplace and if you approach your manager with respect and sincerity , they ll probably be a hell of a lot more receptive than if you ran into their office crying and begging .","291062":"crying and begging are manipulation tactics in an effort to guilt people into giving you what you want . it s always been unsettling to me .","291063":"apparently i have a slight long island accent , lmaoo .","291064":"i ve never been in that position before considering i ve never been in a role where i was responsible for hiring firing people . but honestly , crying for your job back just sounds cringey and immature .","291065":"yeah . if you have no qualms with doing something it means that you have no issue doing it .","291066":"well , part of your job as a manager is to make that determination for yourself . it wouldn t make sense to ask upper management for their opinion because they don t know your workers as well as you do . if someone wasn t pulling their weight and couldn t redeem themselves after giving them another chance , i would have no qualms with firing them . it s just part of the job .","291067":"definitely not . if i noticed someone in the office wasn t pulling their weight , i would ask for a private meeting with just my supervisor to discuss it with her .","291068":"i m not sure if she trusts me with anything specifically that isn t shared by someone else . there are quite a few of us in my office who have similar responsibilities , just with different projects .","291069":"of course , everyone who has had a job has experienced working with someone like that to some degree .","291070":"yeah , unless someone has a valid reason for why it s late like a family emergency or something .","291071":"yeah , i don t work in the office on the weekend . but usually i ll bring work home with me for extra cash and work on it on saturday and sunday mornings .","291072":"there are inconclusive studies on that , but it s certainly not as terrible for you as cigarettes are .","291073":"everything in the vape shop was like off because of cuomo s new vaping ban , so i just stocked up on five new bottles of liquid and a box of new coils for only .","291074":"i ve been on askfm for the better part of or years at this point , and the people i ve talked to on this site have definitely opened my eyes to a lot of things , such as politics , mental health awareness , trans and lgbt rights , etc etc . i have quite a few people to thank for that , and most of them i also have added on other social media because i enjoy their presence . i ve also met a select few people from askfm whom i talk to either regularly or occasionally , and i really value their friendships . one of my askfm friends i ve even met irl twice .","291075":"no , i don t own a gun .","291076":"much appreciated , my dude .","291077":"it s currently saturday , september st at am . i live in the united states .","291078":"here s my profile picture","291079":"i have memory loss , so i barely have memories from before the age of or so . even my middle school and high school years are a blur , at this point .","291080":"i m all right . i have an appointment to hand in my passport application this morning , which i m kinda nervous about because i ve never done anything like this before . i filled everything out last night and i m pretty sure i did everything correctly , and i m like certain that i have all of my necessary documents for the process .","291081":"eh , you win some , you lose some . personally speaking , i don t mind the questions after all , askfm is meant for asking and answering questions . i m only answering them all this morning as you send them because i have nothing to do until am .","291082":"i can never get rid of my nervousness anxiety completely because i have generalized anxiety disorder although my meds do help a lot . however , i try to ease my stress levels by drinking coffee , venting to friends , or just trying to spend time relaxing by watching television , browsing social media , or playing video games .","291083":"no ? askfm is for asking questions if i didn t want to answer a question , i would simply delete it .","291084":"yes , i was born in .","291085":"shopping is a tiring necessity for me , unfortunately . i ve never enjoyed shopping , especially in crowded places . if i have to go somewhere , i try my best to do it either in the early morning hours or late at night .","291086":"november th .","291087":"i have the ability to focus on multiple things at once , and often at work i m jumping from one project to another instead of doing one thing at a time , lol . some tasks require immediate attention , so i have to stop what i m currently doing in order to focus on the new task , and then when that s finished , i go back to what i was originally doing .","291088":"on a few occasions , yes . i don t recall any specific incidents , but they were all minor at any rate .","291089":"my boyfriend . he s honestly been through so much sh t throughout his life , and he s had to express much bravery during those times , otherwise he probably would not have survived or , at the very least , been a severely depressed wreck .","291090":"idk , i ve always believed that people are just naturally introverted or extroverted , or at least somewhere in between . no doubt , their traits may have also been influenced by environmental factors growing up , in which a person is conditioned into behaving a certain way out of fear . but for the most part , i believe it s something innate to a human being .","291091":"i much prefer to be alone when i m not feeling great mentally . i also have a tendency to self isolate anyway , because i don t want to burden people with my sadness or feel as if they re obligated to help me .","291092":"i don t really think it s necessary to let them down easy , if all they do is lie to you . they don t deserve to be let down easy because chances are , they know what they re doing to you and they simply don t care . for most people who do this , it s somewhat of a power trip , and that isn t fair to you . i would personally either call them out on their behavior or just simply cease talking to them .","291093":"those are good too ! ! i usually just order a spicy tuna roll a salmon avocado roll if i m going out for sushi .","291094":"ergh , drunk driving . i m obviously not proud of it at all , but it s certainly the most dangerous thing i ve ever done .","291095":"moving day in a little over three weeks ! ! i also want to go to another wine tasting event at the aquarium , if they re hosting one this year . it always happens around my birthday .","291096":"i dislike people who complain that it s getting too cold in the fall , lol . one of my coworkers who sits next to me said the other morning , it s getting cold , i don t like it . i absolutely thrive on the cold weather , so can t relate .","291097":"i got my first tattoo when i turned years old . it was on my back shoulder blade region , so it wasn t nearly as painful as i was expecting it to be .","291098":"i ve never had a tuna sub before , but i honestly dislike tuna unless it s in a sushi roll i know , it s weird . i only eat tuna in spicy tuna rolls , nothing else .","291099":"my favorite fall activity is drinking pumpkin coffee on my back patio during the early autumn mornings , when dew and frost are still crisp on the grass and the air has a nice chill in it . my favorite fall food is probably pumpkin bread , lmaoo .","291100":"i don t believe so , no . if someone misunderstands something about me then that s on them . i don t care enough about most people to try to prove them wrong .","291101":"i m pretty sure i was already asleep when you sent this to me .","291102":"well , celinem still actively uses askfm . idk who the other person is .","291103":"i don t think i ve ever had indian food before .","291104":"yeah , but i prefer everything bagels .","291105":"uh , get dressed , get ready in the bathroom , pack my lunch , and take my medication . usually i ll stop for coffee on the way there , but i ve been trying to do that less often .","291106":"nah , i ve never interviewed anyone before .","291107":"not at all , i delete them too .","291108":"i m pretty sure they were being sarcastic and poking fun at how i respond to people who ask me bullsh t like that , lmaoo . but for real , it s super annoying when people ask me to follow them , or do that follow for follow thing . it s like we re back in or something .","291109":"there s nothing stopping you from being a better worker besides your own expectations of yourself .","291110":"yes , she trusts my judgment . that s why she entrusted me to train someone to begin with .","291111":"i don t really know what you mean by fail but when i was training the new hire , i would check in with my supervisor every week and give her updates on their progress .","291112":"not generally , no . some people need repetition in order to really grasp something , not everyone learns something immediately .","291113":"it would make me feel hella old , lmfao . i would prefer if they just called me by my name .","291114":"considering i trained someone recently who was a new hire , i suppose so .","291115":"he sounds super manipulative , dude . i know you feel attached to him but this isn t healthy .","291116":"obviously not , rofl .","291117":"went to work , got my passport photo taken , went shopping , filled out my passport application , and ate dinner .","291118":"i love documentaries , especially ones related to mental health , the prison system , true crime , and the environment .","291119":"it s a parent s job to ensure that their chil ren are attending school and doing their best to ensure their education . if a child is skipping class and the parents know about it and don t care , then that s negligent .","291120":"if my child has a job , then clearly they re over the age of so i feel as if standard punishments would be a bit outdated . i would question them and ask why they got fired and simply talk to them , it s not as if i would ground them or something because that doesn t help the situation at all . but i would definitely sit down and have a serious talk about the matter because jobs are important and i would want my child to have a good work ethic .","291121":"i m going to be honest with you he sounds like he s very insecure himself . asking for photos of what you re doing throughout the day is a bit much , and i understand that perhaps he doesn t feel like he can trust you entirely , but i feel like he s taking things too far . you re perfectly valid in not wanting to send full body shots if you dislike your body , and honestly i don t see any reason why he wants to see that anyway when you ve clearly sent him other photos of yourself . the fact that he s being so impatient with this makes me wonder if he has another motive behind it but that s just me , i m a paranoid person by nature . it s obviously up to you if you want to continue your friendship relationship with him . but if he s going to keep acting like this towards you , then that s very toxic and unhealthy .","291122":"i participated last year , yeah . i bought a cheap wood elf costume off of amazon , lol .","291123":"three of my coworkers and i take breaks at the same time , and out of all of us , only one of them smokes cigarettes . the rest of us vape . it doesn t make me want a cigarette , though .","291124":"ugh , yes . honestly , for me the best thing in the world was waking up on a saturday morning with a hot cup of coffee and a cigarette outside on my back patio . it was my reason for getting out of bed in the morning . i actually tested myself two days after quitting by going to the bar with a friend and seeing if i could last drinking alcohol without having a cigarette . i didn t have anything on me except my vape , and i timed my vape breaks to four minutes and i think i only took two vape breaks .","291125":"i would be hella disappointed in myself if i did .","291126":"it depends on the individual , i think . some people function better if they quit gradually or with a smoking cessation aid while others quit cold turkey .","291127":"quitting cigarettes has honestly made me so freaking hungry . i didn t think it was true that people got hungrier when they quit , but for a solid days , i was insatiable . that s why a lot of people gain weight when they quit smoking , since smoking does suppress the appetite .","291128":"money , lmaoo . most of my problems could be solved if i had more money , sadly enough . i think i ll have enough to get by once i start renting , but we ll see .","291129":"i don t feel like a boss , but i certainly feel much better both physically and mentally .","291130":"it was abruptly , but i ve been vaping in the meantime . i just stopped buying cigarettes two sundays ago after i smoked the last of my pack and switched to vaping instead .","291131":"don t get me wrong , i was making excuses for a long ass time . i simply didn t want to quit , but eventually i realized how much it was harming me and how much money i was wasting on it . my boyfriend recently quit too , and i figured if he could quit smoking two packs of cigarettes per day then i can quit as well .","291132":"i mean , it s askfm . i m not really here to have conversations , lol .","291133":"i didn t want to feel terrible anymore , in a physical sense . i was coughing up my lungs every morning , for example . i also wanted to save money because i smoked a pack a day and cigarettes run around pack where i live .","291134":"hello do you have a question ?","291135":"i quit smoking almost two weeks ago .","291136":"i m cold towards most people in my life , and i love my boyfriend close friends to an extreme .","291137":"? ? ? they were asking about my heritage . obviously i was born in america , but my ancestry comes from those countries .","291138":"i m mostly german and italian , but i also have bits of ukraine , ireland , austrian , and english in me .","291139":"absolutely . teachers are overworked and underpaid .","291140":"probably not . my office has a costume contest every year but i don t think i want to participate this year .","291141":"kudos to you for quoting me verbatim , rofl . it doesn t happen often enough for me to put into my bio , it isn t something i care about really plus no one reads bios anyway .","291142":"i have no interest in following new people .","291143":"no , i don t follow you .","291144":"i suppose i look the most like my father .","291145":"it s never too soon for halloween autumn questions .","291146":"is this about shehitsback ? lol . in all honesty , it depends on who the person is and the relationship you have with that person already . it varies wildly so there s really no universal answer to this question .","291147":"i mean , teachers are obviously within their rights to send students to detention and in school and out of school suspension . i don t see what other forms of punishment there could be .","291148":"no , i would never work in new york city . i wouldn t be able to handle the commute .","291149":"i ve trained new hires before , it was part of the job . i was neither tough nor lenient for the most part . i told them what i expected , but i also took my time with them and allowed them the comfort to ask any and all questions .","291150":"i m working non stop all day , aside from my two minute breaks and my lunch break . i don t talk to anyone because i m too busy with my daily tasks , and i m always trying to put in every day . i ve always been extremely meticulous .","291151":"i didn t really do anything specific . i just kept getting promoted because my boss recognized my work ethic and noticed that i was efficient with not only helping customers but also keeping track of orders and learning things quickly . i started out as a cashier , then went on to become a photo technician , photo supervisor , and pharmacy technician .","291152":"no , there was one office for everyone . i worked in a drug store when i was in management .","291153":"no , definitely not . i worked in retail for four years of my life , and i encountered a lot of customers who were wholeheartedly wrong .","291154":"poor customer service can be defined in many ways , but for me personally , i consider customer service to be poor when you can clearly tell that the representative isn t putting any effort into actually helping you and just want the conversation to be over with . they may be a bit rude or seem hesitant to help , and in some cases , they may make your situation worse .","291155":"no , bosses don t owe anyone anything , especially if the termination is within the three month probation period . most people don t particularly care about what s better for their employees or not not saying it s right , it s just the honest truth .","291156":"my plans for autumn don t differ much from the rest of the year , haha . moving day is in a little over three weeks , i still have to obtain my passport for the cruise in february , and i want to definitely visit the wineries out east at least once this fall .","291157":"it all depends on what their opinions are , and there s a large difference between having an opinion and expressing a viewpoint that s oppressive toward others . personally speaking , i wouldn t be able to remain friends with someone if they expressed views aligning with sexism , racism , homophobia , transphobia or ableism just to name a few .","291158":"my favorite flower is yellow roses . my favorite season is autumn . my favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate chip cookie dough . my favorite gemstone is either mystic fire topaz or white opal . my favorite hot beverage is coffee .","291159":"personally speaking , yes my present is much better than my past for many reasons . i m constantly striving to improve myself and my relationships , meanwhile in the past i had no ambition or drive whatsoever . i was overcome with emotions related to trauma however , over time i ve learned to accept what had happened to me and do my best to move on in spite of how it has affected me .","291160":"i ve definitely matured a lot over the past few years , both emotionally and in terms of my behavioral responses to stimuli in my life . i used to be very obsessive , neurotic , immature , insecure , and always looking for an escape from my pain . i would get drunk and high all the time , and i was generally just wasting my life away . these days , i don t really get high anymore except on very rare occasions . i only drink once per week and i don t get blackout drunk anymore like i used to . i ve calmed down a lot and i don t obsess over things anymore , and i ve learned how to accept situations and let them go for my own peace of mind .","291161":"coral that can be found in the ocean that people can also grow in salt water tanks are either aggressive or peaceful organisms . i knew that regular fish are characterized as being docile , semi aggressive and aggressive , but i didn t know that coral that those traits as well until this morning .","291162":"i receive repetitive questions on an average basis , particularly questions that ask how old i am , where i live , what my job is , etc etc . everything that s already in my bio , lol . ideally , i would love to be asked more questions about mental health and illness , my hobbies in general i . e . video games , writing , painting , photography , my relationships , my career education , and my opinions on controversial topics .","291163":"in terms of relationships , yes . there have been a lot of people who i had a crush on but i knew i could never date them .","291164":"eh , neither ? i tend to be more of a realist than anything else . i m not very optimistic because i don t like to be disappointed , but i m also not pessimistic because pessimism only hinders growth .","291165":"it isn t really unusual , but i ve slept in my car before .","291166":"emotional stability , financial stability , and interpersonal stability within my friendships relationships .","291167":"i don t talk out loud to myself very often unless i m playing video games or driving , lol . i talk to myself within my head all the time , though .","291168":"ugh , their food is disgusting .","291169":"any sort of math , particularly algebra and calculus . i knew i was going to pursue a career in english , so the topics were meaningless to me .","291170":"just one english .","291171":"quitting smoking . i feel x better now and i m so proud of myself .","291172":"pretty sure that management can fire you for whatever reason if it s within the three month probation period , but i m not entirely sure .","291173":"it was fine . i m exhausted though . i m probably going to call it an early night .","291174":"i would like to travel overseas one day .","291175":"drive a car , pay my bills , and go shopping . i know that s more than one thing , but i hate them all nonetheless .","291176":"moving day is in days ! !","291177":"who do you think you are ? barging in on me and my guitar . little girl , hey , the door is that way , you better go you know the fire s out anyway .","291178":"spend time with my boyfriend , drink coffee in the afternoons on my days off , grab a drink with friends , play video games particularly skyrim , and sleep .","291179":"a fresh bagel with butter and a large coffee from the local bagel place . there s nothing better than bold bagel store or deli coffee , and the taste of a fresh long island bagel is unmatched .","291180":"i have my recent essays posted to my medium account https medium . com poetalunam","291181":"technically , you don t work there anymore so hr can t really do anything for you . you can complain all you want , but it is your manager s decision first and foremost . and if your manager doesn t think you re working up to par , then she s within her rights to fire you .","291182":"lol , no . he s one of those british rock stars who will probably never die , like mick jagger .","291183":"i suppose the biggest red flag is that their answers are never consistent , i . e . their writing style , timeline of events , saying contradictory things , etc etc . idk , i usually have a keen eye for fake accounts because they just give me a certain vibe that makes me suspicious .","291184":"nevertheless , the legacy lives on .","291185":"winona ryder .","291186":"ozzy didn t bite a bat s head off just for kids to grow up and think that he s an underground artist found by post malone . lmaoo .","291187":"haha , no . i ve

statement about someone else then i m going to delete it , lol .","291194":"depends on the age , but either way i don t think i would be fully comfortable with the idea of them drinking at all . but i would much rather have them be informed and feel comfortable enough to talk to me about them potentially drinking instead of them rebelling and hiding the fact that they re drinking from me , because that only leads to worse behavior and danger down the road . kids are going to do what they want one way or another , so i can only hope that if i have children that they ll feel comfortable enough to come to me because they wouldn t fear my reaction .","291195":"my loved ones abandoning me , particularly my boyfriend . it s irrational because he constantly reassures me that he isn t going anywhere

m ever going back to that .","291241":"yeah , that s pretty much how i used to work . now i m not in a management position anymore , which i m absolutely fine with . it was stressful and i wasn t getting paid nearly enough for what i used to do .","291242":"i basically used to tell them to suck it up , lmaoo . no one likes working , but a job is a job . you re not going to like the tasks given to you , but they must be done . to neglect the task at hand is going to negatively affect every other operation .","291243":"i ve supervised people in the past , and although initially i was uncomfortable with managing others , i slowly became more confident in my role and liked delegating tasks to people and watching my employees succeed .","291244":"i believe it s better to be forthcoming and tell them outright that they didn t get the job , tbh . escorting someone out of the building without indicating why is a bit harsh , unless they were acting out in some way

practically live in flannels during the winter .","291249":"no , i don t watch wrestling .","291250":"like i said , a manager should be strict but also understanding . if a manager is simply strict and will not understand each person s individual situation , then yes that definitely turns people off and severely lowers morale .","291251":"thanks , me too .","291252":"yes , the very least they can do is tell their employee the underlying reason behind why . people rely on their hours for money obviously , and when hours get cut , it can really hinder someone .","291253":"i would be strict , but i don t think i would be unreasonable . however , if someone is chronically late or they re using their cell phone so much that it s impeding on their work , then yeah i would definitely call attention to that and bring up the issue to hr . you have to keep in mind that we re all human , we make mistakes , and no one is perfect . if someone doesn t normally use their phone , but you notice that they re on their phone a lot one day , then they likely have a justifiable reason behind it . same with being late or being absent from work .","291254":"not in my current company , no . first , i wouldn t want to dethrone my current supervisor because she s amazing , and second , the management position for my department deals mostly with upper management i ain t about that life

definitely deteriorated in skill over the past years .","291263":"as long as i could take my boyfriend with me , absolutely . i don t know if i could handle moving somewhere on my own completely without knowing at least one person beforehand .","291264":"whenever i m unsure of something or hesitant to say something , i usually go meep both in text and verbally , lol . it s really silly and

what you re talking about .","291268":"no , i don t generally notice who gives me likes unless they go through my entire page and like answers in a row . even so , i don t check out their page .","291269":"every time you change your hair we should all follow and get the same agree ? it was the same anon . they ve been doing it for ages . it s exhausting and makes me really uncomfortable .","291270":"where was i angry ? i was just telling anon to cut the sh t . i don t like when people idolize me , it makes me uncomfortable .","291271":"yeah , it was pretty exciting when i learned that my office building has an entire cafeteria in it , lmao . my favorite part is that they serve starbucks coffee .","291272":"well , the cafeteria serves pizza . the cafeteria is open for everyone for works in the office building , it isn t just my company there . also , drop the bullsh t . it isn t cute .","291273":"i don t really care what other people do with their hair or bodies .","291274":"i got a slice of pizza from the cafeteria at work , if that counts .","291275":"because of the implication that one partner is reverting back to a childlike , innocent state in order to fulfill a sexual desire . it s concerning and uncomfortable .","291276":"yes , i ve been with the same stylist for about a year now . she s the one who s been coloring my hair purple , pink , blue , and orange . she s so talented .","291277":"aw , thank you ! !","291278":"lol . it was an impulsive decision , but i ve been very happy with it .","291279":"i honestly don t remember exactly how . i started smoking my freshman year of college , i think it was due to stress and my roommate smoked at the time too . i just picked up the habit .","291280":"that s why i said it s inconclusive . vaping has only been around really for years , i think .","291281":"it s pretty inconclusive . all of the news reports about people dying from vaping actually had thc oil in their system , not just the regular nicotine vapes . so people are misunderstanding that left right and assuming all vaping is bad . vaping is a much better alternative , particularly for those quitting cigarettes . there aren t nearly as many chemicals , toxins , and carcinogens if you compare them to cigarettes from my understanding , and you can choose the level of nicotine and steadily decrease as you go .","291282":"i feel that , man . i smoked since i was years old , initially it wasn t many but then i gradually increased to smoking a pack a day . the calming factor deterred me too , that was a main reason why i didn t quit sooner . however , i ve been vaping here and there instead of smoking cigarettes as a transitional thing , and it s been helping a lot .","291283":"i m fine , feeling much more stable today than i felt the past two or so days . i still have a lot of freelance work to do , but i stupidly just keep scrolling through social media .","291284":"it s free for android phones . you ll have to look it up and see in the app store .","291285":"it s called quit tracker .","291286":"one week cigarette free ! !","291287":"good morning texts , seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile , having the first cup of coffee of the day , smelling the crisp scent of autumn and winter , having campfires , receiving positive reinforcement re my writing and ability to work , forehead kisses , and writing something i m proud of .","291288":"i wasn t popular by any means , so i was somewhat of an outsider . however , people still knew who i was because of my artistic background i was actually voted most artistic of my graduating class .","291289":"emotional spiritual pain is much harder for me to deal with . i can handle physical pain just fine because i know most pain is temporary , but because i feel emotions so deeply , i can be in emotional pain for weeks on end with no relief in sight .","291290":"the show it s always sunny in philadelphia . regardless of how i m feeling , that show always has me cracking up .","291291":"i m going to answer this in terms of writing , since i don t really draw or paint much anymore . however , my artistic voice in my writing and sense of style has been developed over the course of like two decades , since i ve been writing from a very young age . what has helped me hone my voice is the adoption and experimentation of other writers voices over time . when i was a teenager , i would read books and try to implement the author s voice into my own writing , and then branch off from there . even now , it s something i actively work towards . although i have a more refined sense of style and voice in my writing as an adult , i do question it sometimes and editing your work is more important than writing the first draft itself .","291292":"let go of things that don t serve you . above all else , your top priority in life should be your own health and wellness , and it becomes toxic to hold onto negative feelings and people , as it hinders your own progress . there s nothing wrong with letting go of people who perhaps once served you in the past , but don t anymore . not everyone is meant to be in our lives indefinitely .","291293":"my day has been fine , considering i ve only been awake for two hours . i m planning on finishing up the work i started yesterday . i was going to go to the drug store to get my passport photo taken , but i m really not in the mood to get dressed and leave the house today .","291294":"it s genetic , actually . my father s side of the family has always had really thick hair it s the italian side of me .","291295":"why would i turn off anon ? that would eliminate half of my question base , rofl .","291296":"people are not obligated to date someone simply because they re interested in them . if you re not interested in dating a person , then you have every right to turn down the date , regardless of the reason why . also . . . the friendzone isn t actually a real thing .","291297":"they don t bother me , tbh . if they re too insecure and cowardly to hide behind anon , then why should i invest my own time and emotions into their responses ? it s pointless and wasted energy .","291298":"i don t remember his first reaction , that was so many years ago . but yes , he did know and actively did try to help me stop .","291299":"i never said i had an eating disorder . i said that i have disordered eating big difference between the two .","291300":"they probably didn t know and or care because that was only one month after i was born , so they were probably preoccupied with taking care of me and my brother .","291301":"i ve screwed up my metabolism because i only usually eat once , sometimes twice , per day on most days especially when i m going through some sort of emotional crisis . there s no routine to my eating habits , and i fluctuate between not eating anything at all and then binge eating .","291302":"actually , yes . i seldom talk about this because i know the topic is very triggering for some people , but if it wasn t for him , i wouldn t have had the motivation to stop shing . he showed me that he gave a sh t , meanwhile others didn t , and my interest in him gave me a reason to recover .","291303":"yes , we met when i was years old . i didn t stop shing until i was or years old .","291304":"yes , i am a baby .","291305":"i wouldn t have started engaging in sh when i was years old . it destroyed the entirety of my teenage years ,","291306":"i believe i have , yes .","291307":"yeah , it s ridiculous . especially those trending videos where people literally purchase food items and then throw them out to show that they re gross . smh .","291308":"i didn t hear about that , i don t know if that would necessarily make headlines in the united states because similar things happen here all the time .","291309":"yes , i gained like pounds over the past two years .","291310":"occasionally , yes .","291311":"half grown out , half shaved .","291312":"thanks ! ! i honestly have no idea where its from , it was gifted to me two years ago .","291313":"i ve never heard of that before tbh . i think it s a safe practice for everyone to get into who are sexually active , though .","291314":"i didn t , there s a filter on that photo too . lmaoo .","291315":"i don t believe i ve ever had an aids test done , no .","291316":"no , i haven t watched the debates at all .","291317":"nothing in particular . my mood has just been low all day .","291318":"i ve tried a pair or two on , but they never fit me quite right because they re usually way too big for me . i m very short , lol .","291319":"i don t believe they should be completely free , but they should definitely be way more affordable . pads , tampons , and sanitary wipes should be less expensive than they are now , and not taxed at all . in addition , things like glasses and contacts and eye examinations all fall under health care , and health care in general should be far less expensive than it actually is . honestly , half of the reason why i haven t seen my eye doctor in almost four years is because the cost of the examination and cost of my glasses and lenses is way too pricey .","291320":"uh , i think around hours ? it wasn t terribly long , but it was long enough to the point where i started hallucinating .","291321":"heathers . it s one of my comfort films .","291322":"thank you , that s really sweet of you to say .","291323":"thankfully , no . lmaoo .","291324":"my day hasn t been so great . the only highlight really was the phone conversation my boyfriend and i had while he was driving home from work tonight .","291325":"depressing and uneventful .","291326":"i don t judge people based on their star signs , lol . i don t really put much faith into those sorts of readings .","291327":"i try my best to be a good friend , and i would like to think that i am . i care about my friends well beings more than i care about my own .","291328":"people have said i resembled her . i just explained this , lol .","291329":"i suppose any of the necklaces my boyfriend has bought me over the years . they re very sentimental to me .","291330":"no , i almost never wear hats . if anything , i ll occasionally wear beanies in the winter .","291331":"people continuously tell me on askfm that i resemble lady gaga .","291332":"it depends on the day and on my mood , haha . i m pretty much an open book , so i like talking about everything from my relationships to my hobbies to music to politics to my education career , and everything in between . i also strongly advocate for mental health awareness , and i enjoy educating people on misconceptions of mental illnesses .","291333":"graduating from college . i went from failing two classes my freshman year to graduating magna cum laude with my bachelor s degree four years later . i struggled immensely during college regarding my mental health , and i surprised myself when i surpassed even my own expectations .","291334":"cont . . . etc ? my psychiatrist says it s normal for people with bpd to feel this way but it still hurts me so . i feel bad for distrusting them but my heart and brain says i can never fully trust anyone . it s exhausting and frustrating to know that the only people you can talk about your deepest feelings are yourself and the people on internet that don t know your identity because that s the best way to protect yourself . i understand how you feel . honestly , i don t believe they re doomed to fail or anything extreme like that , but nevertheless , you do need to work on the underlying causes of your distrust in people and work on bettering your relationships . you re only hurting yourself in the long run because a lack of trust isolates you , particularly in relationships where you should feel comfortable trusting a close friend or partner . you mentioned a psychiatrist , but do you see a therapist ? i believe therapy would be helpful if you don t currently have counseling .","291335":"snapchat selfies from last february","291336":"i went to a comedy show last year to see dan soder , and he had me laughing so hard i was crying . https www . youtube . com watch ? v njy u irg","291337":"tbh i would probably start crying in joy if i found courrtana or misphire at my front door .","291338":"no , i absolutely love the cold weather . the only downside to the snow is when i have to drive in it .","291339":"i very much prefer winter over summer . i cannot stand the heat and humidity .","291340":"it s possible , yes . in fact , it s likely quite common . however , that doesn t mean it s right or okay . most people deserve to be with someone with whom their feelings are shared . a relationship is not balanced or healthy if someone feels stronger than the other , i . e . one partner being romantically involved but the other not being romantically involved . if you re not attracted to your partner romantically , then that s a conversation that you two need to have . you shouldn t settle for your partner if you don t love them on a romantic level , that s unfair to both of you .","291341":"i believe that s completely unacceptable . you should be compensated for the hours you provide to your work , regardless of whether or not a mistake was made . we re only human and mistakes are bound to happen lord knows i ve made a hell of a lot of mistakes during my career . if a mistake is bad enough , then obviously that warrants an hr visit , a write up , a stern talking to , or even termination . but to take that out of a worker s weekly wages is a bit extreme , imo . people need money to survive , and most people live paycheck to paycheck .","291342":"thanks , my dude","291343":"yikes , sorry it took me three days to respond ! ! i have so many questions in my inbox . tbh , i agree with you i understand why she was upset in general at the prospect of the subject matter , but i don t believe that she s all that justified to be upset with him in particular just for answering her question honestly . in addition , just because someone supports an idea or thinks that it might be interesting doesn t necessarily mean that those ideas or events are going to even happen . relationships are a two way street , and obviously she s quite uncomfortable with the prospect of that event happening therefore , it would never actually happen since there needs to be consent from both sides . like i said , i understand why she would be bothered by the idea of it , but in practical terms , there s nothing to be upset over because it won t actually happen . i hope this makes sense . lmaoo .","291344":"i don t support the death penalty . even though i know there are such things as lawful killing and unlawful killing , i believe that for certain criminals , death is simply the easy way out . it would be much more of a punishment to slot them into solitary confinement for the rest of their lives so that they can live alone with their incessant thoughts of the horrors they inflicted upon others every day .","291345":"one bathroom with one shower bathtub .","291346":"i d like to think so , judging by the amount of people i m friendly with in my life . i don t have any enemies , to my knowledge , and i mostly end friendships and other acquaintance ships after we have naturally drifted apart .","291347":"long island in general has an issue with traffic , smh . we re one of the most congested areas in the nation . it s so ridiculous .","291348":"i ve never had octopus before .","291349":"no , that s normal and insignificant .","291350":"working , laundry , and packing .","291351":"i much prefer to be alone . people drain the energy out of me , and i need solitude in order to recharge .","291352":"i prefer showers over baths . i ve only ever taken a relaxing bath perhaps twice in my entire life , and honestly i was bored , lmaoo . it was relaxing for the first five minutes , but after that i just felt gross .","291353":"it s , so not only is it okay for women to ask men out on dates , but it should be encouraged . your gender doesn t discourage you from asking someone out on a date if you re interested in them .","291354":"i m going to be quite frank i don t eat lunch most days . on the weekends , i simply don t get hungry so i only eat a late breakfast and then dinner . on the weekdays during work , i m so caught up in my work that i forget to eat . i would much rather have a light snack than an actual lunch , either way . something like hummus and carrots , or vegetable dip with pretzels , or chips and guac . maybe a small finger sandwich or two . i can t eat substantial meals anymore .","291355":"i don t really remember much about how my hometown was when i was a kid , but from my understanding , the entire area in general has become much more dangerous . it wasn t unheard of for kids to play in the streets and walk or bike to their friends houses , even approaching the night time . i used to walk home from high school all the time without thinking twice about it . these days , that s rare . you don t see children playing outside in the streets anymore unless a parent is with them . you don t see anyone walking outside anymore . i don t know if it s simply because times have changed or also in recognition of the danger that has increased in the area , ranging from things like robberies and break ins to drunk drivers and whatnot .","291356":"it would be lovely if the boss of the company emailed me , told me that this edition of the magazine is the best one they ve released yet , and offered me a raise . lmaoo .","291357":"most of the time , the prospect of having a fresh cup of coffee in the morning is enough to drag me out of bed . other times , not so much . but i feel a sense of obligation to perform my duties , particularly at work , and i know that i would end up feeling even more terrible if i laid in bed and did nothing all day .","291358":"when someone lives on the surface of their life , it basically means that they re just skimming through life treading the waters without actually diving down deeply into what scares them , or what fulfills them , or what makes them happy . they re simply existing just to exist without placing further meaning into their life .","291359":"packing and moving out , getting my passport , paying for the cruise and its excursions , my job responsibilities , my relationships , quitting smoking , etc etc .","291360":"i was raised catholic , but i m an athiest . however , from what i understand about god , being lgbt is forgiveable . also , i ve been watching too much it s always sunny and this anon reminds me so much of mac .","291361":"gay women are just as stigmatized as gay men , if not worse . your view on lgbt relationships is pretty disconnected from reality .","291362":"? ? ? what my boyfriend has done in his past relationships has no impact on our current relationship . especially considering actual sex means so little . it s incredibly homophobic to judge someone for having sex with the same gender or sex as them , and it would also make me hypocritical because i m bisexual too .","291363":"i shop from etsy occasionally , but only for gifts for the holidays .","291364":"lol what . oh gosh , evidently you don t know anyone who s bisexual or gay . someone s sexual orientation does not define how they look , dress , or act . my boyfriend is actually the most masculine person i know , lmaoo .","291365":"i cried a few nights ago . there are a few stressful situations going on in my life rn , and it s difficult to cope with them at times .","291366":"my boyfriend is attracted to men , women , and non binary individuals much like myself . it isn t feminine nor masculine , it s simply a part of who someone innately is . no one chooses their sexual orientation . we have both been in relationships with men and women in the past , and it does not bother either of us and ideally , it shouldn t bother anyone at all . to be bothered by someone s past sexual history if they were with the same sex or gender is pretty homophobic .","291367":"yeah , i would say that s classist of you to believe . someone s work or income level isn t an indication of who they are as an individual , and simply speaking , some people have more privilege than others especially in terms of professional opportunities . a pizza delivery driver deserves just as much respect as a doctor , not only because their profession does not define them , but also because you simply do not know the path someone s life has taken for them to get to that point . the pizza delivery driver could actually be working jobs to keep their family afloat , and you simply would not know it . the doctor could have experienced privilege their entire life and fell into their profession because they were graciously provided a loan and didn t have much trouble affording their career path . not to mention , it s so much more difficult now to afford proper schooling than it ever was in the past . people used to be able to work a summer job and afford college the following semester these days , that s literally impossible . so all of these things have to be taken into account before you pass judgment on someone for having an entry level or minimum wage job .","291368":"yes , i very much have experienced the same thing re my own mental illnesses too . it s difficult coming to terms with the fact that you may be the toxic problematic one , even if those behaviors do stem from having mental illness . however , just because we re mentally ill doesn t mean that our toxic behavior is justified , and we need to be held accountable for ourselves just like
