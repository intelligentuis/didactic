Ugh! This was hard to come to.\n  ","341130":"\n  Wow! Ur out for blood today. I'll say who \"did\". I had an issue that I reported at my church which brought forth more women. And the past leaders did not protect me. Instead they vilified & traumatized me. I removed myself for a few yrs, prayed & didnt gossip. God removed the key perpetrators& placed me in leadership roles. I let God fight as my champion. Humbling & beautiful is the strength & faith I gained.\n  ","341131":"\n  1. People who won't grow. 2. Bad music. 3. Folks who lead every convo with their wallet\/purse or namedrops.\n  ","341132":"\n  There is no life without love & music.

However, Deep feelings eventually grow when 2 people are open & vulnerable. You sound like ur asking me to cliff jump. Daredevil\n  ","341150":"\n  Bwahahahaha. Say what? No. Thats not what I meant.

Frivolous stuff? I'll share it with those I trust.\n  ","341160":"\n  Interesting question. No. I'm in the stage of accepting who I am more so than learning. I can be a wee bit stubborn.

Doctor refused to give me any more antibiotics. I found out that the problem was spiritual. Hear me out. I went to a Christian conf trip. A prophetic word was given over me. He called me out of the crowd & walked up to me, asked why I keep my words to myself? Why do Inworry about everyone else but me? Self-worth was suffering. He said it was harmful. I was literally on my knees on the floor in front of strangers screaming...like in a movie. No lie. Fast forward to a Reiki session at a work event yrs later. The lady put her hands over my throat and said ur throat chakra is closed. U have to talk. They were all right. I chose to be quiet. I didnt like confrontation. I wanted Interaction to be perfect, but that's not real life. Shied away from speaking my truth. Ever since, I've tried my darndest to speak my truth even when uncomfortable for me and the listener.

I ask God for wisdom\/strength & muster thru it.\n  ","341213":"\n  Well as much of a words person as I am. Presence means alot. So for me, I need a whiff of a person...the essence. Touch skin. Hear heartbeat. See nervousness of anticipation thru mannerisms. I want to see that poetry\/dance in motion. Nothing like hearing the true timbre of a person's voice live. Vibes are magical & eyes can be the window & answer to so much. Online isn't for me. But some people.  Have found love via electeonics.\n  "}}
