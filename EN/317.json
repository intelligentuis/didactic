my professional and social lives , and i m just an average adult in their mid to late s who s just trying to get by .","293227":"i usually don t give them a second thought . if someone isn t already my friend or if someone s presence doesn t contribute to my life positively in some way , then i don t think about them or really acknowledge them at all .","293228":"smoking , although i don t think i can t quit smoking altogether . i just don t want to yet .","293229":"i ve never heard either of their music .","293230":"yes , i love tea ! ! specifically jasmine green tea , black tea with milk

move into an apartment , lmaoo . i would definitely need new furniture because what i have is pretty old and some things are broken . i would like everything to be the same color palette because right now they re a combination of black and white , and it bothers me .","293233":"either sushi or burrito bowls . they re both delicious when made the right way .","293234":"black or gray . most of my

.","293245":"surprisingly , i haven t really been into beer lately it used to be my favorite . if anything , i ve been drinking spiked seltzer .","293246":"that s my worst nightmare . lmaoo .","293247":"definitely not . i appreciate the sentiment , though .","293248":"i believe that everyone ultimately has their own definition of what bisexual entails , solely due to the controversy revolving around the difference between bi and pan . it depends on what a person is really most comfortable identifying as , in my opinion . i believe personally that bisexual means you like two of more genders , but not all whereas , pan means all genders . i personally identify as bi because i don t believe i m attracted to all genders , and it feels most comfortable to me . i m also of a somewhat older generation as well , though .","293249":"my good friend texted me a link to an apartment available for rent , and it meets all of our criteria of what we re looking for . he just put in an application for the apartment and included my email address as a reference , since i ll be moving in with him , so hopefully we hear back ! ! it isn t terrible at all , and it s within an amount i believe i can afford on a monthly basis . we just don t know if utilities are included in the price , so we re going to have to find that out before ultimately making a decision .","293250":"exercising is perhaps the only way i push my body s limits , haha . i ve been trying to push myself harder on the treadmill every week or so , which has been increasing my stamina greatly

while . after everyone left , i helped my best friend clean up and then i was home by like pm .","293253":"i don t have an opinion on him . i don t know anything about him .","293254":"considering i m part of the lgbtq community , i m percent in support of gay relationships and marriage . there s no reason why a person should not be allowed to date or marry someone who s the same sex or gender as them thinking that being gay is wrong is an archaic form of thinking that has no place in .","293255":"my healthy daily habits include taking my medication , drinking water , and going to bed at a reasonable time normally getting between hours of sleep .","293256":"i had a pulled pork taco with lettuce , tomato , and shredded cheese for dinner .","293257":"uh , no ? abortion has nothing to do with veganism . abortion is all about the right to choose what occurs within someone s own body bodily autonomy . veganism , on the other hand , is a lifestyle choice revolving around the desire to help the planet and animals by not consuming or using products that are animal derived .","293258":"i normally vent to my friends and or boyfriend about what s upsetting me , just so i can get their opinion and they can comfort me or rationalize my feelings . sometimes they validate what i m feeling so that i feel less alone with my thoughts . i also have a few unhealthy coping mechanisms , but talking to people is perhaps my healthiest .","293259":"that honestly sounds extremely unhealthy . using pain as a coping mechanism isn t good and can lead to further unhealthy coping mechanisms in the long run as well . it could possibly develop into self injurious behavior because after a while , the initial pain won t be enough and the person will crave more .","293260":"i m doing fine , just exhausted from a long day at work and intensive therapy session . i m debating on either staying up and continuing orange is the new black , or going to bed super early .","293261":"i know . i was

sleep , and i felt much better when my alarm went off two hours later .","293267":"my boyfriend ! !","293268":"if the man doesn t take no for an answer after the first time the woman says no , then i would consider that to be harassing . it s disgusting how some people won t accept no for an answer and think that by trying harder they can somehow win a person over . if someone says no to you the first time , then accept it for what it is and move on .","293269":"depends on the type of tea . white and green tea , i take it straight . however , black tea tastes best to me with a small amount of milk and one sugar .","293270":"i usually drink my coffee with soy milk sugar free vanilla syrup or stevia .","293271":"i haven t changed my hairstyle in quite a while over a year or so . i ve been steadily growing the right side of my hair out while keeping the left side shaved .","293272":"when i was in high school , my favorite subject was english . i took ap literature and ap language composition in my junior and senior years .","293273":"i m almost five years older than you . you really need to stop with the wah i m so old bullsh t . it s pathetic .","293274":"pretty much everything , lmaoo . i m not the biggest fan of chocolate .","293275":"i use my debit card on nearly everything . occasionally i ll take cash out , though .","293276":"i shower once per day and wash my hair once or twice per week .","293277":"my best friend . i hugged her last night before i left her party .","293278":"honestly , i m at the point in my life where i just want to stay home , sleep , and relax . i would call out of work with no consequences and just spend the entire day with my boyfriend at his house .","293279":"i literally have zero clue . if anyone finds out , let me know","293280":"i like earth tones , i . e . mahogany , dark blue , dark purple , forest green , black , and gray .","293281":"i keep my appearance very low key , lmaoo . i have nobody that i wish to impress , and i would rather be comfortable in what i m wearing .","293282":"either how old are you ? or what is your job ? both questions can easily be answered by looking at my bio , which people rarely do it seems .","293283":"yes , i used to steal regularly when i was much younger .","293284":"yeah , i used to love arizona tea . i haven t had it in a while , though .","293285":"no , not generally . i m a fairly patient person , depending on my mood . there are some instances where i get fed up easily , but it s rare .","293286":"i was in therapy minutes ago .","293287":"i don t have

.","293295":"the party was fun . i didn t buy him a gift or anything , but i got there early and helped them set up , bought some supplies , helped clean up at the end of the night , etc etc .","293296":"whoever told you that was wrong , lol .","293297":"as i stated before , i m not looking for new friends .","293298":"no . i m not the type of person to do dares , that s extremely childish .","293299":"no ? i m just an average civilian , lmaoo .","293300":"is chump change .","293301":"why am i in a relationship ? perhaps because i m in love with my boyfriend ? lmaoo .","293302":"i m not looking to make new friends .","293303":"my day was good ! ! i spent the morning doing laundry and drinking coffee . and i ve been at a birthday party for my best friend s husband for the past five hours .","293304":"no , if i don t want to do something , then i won t do it regardless of whatever money is involved .","293305":"no , i m in a relationship .","293306":"for the most part , yes . i do eat unhealthy food occasionally though .","293307":"my boyfriend and my best friend both inspire me . they re such hard working and compassionate people , and even though they ve both gone through significant struggles in their lives , they ve never allowed their hardships to define them or hold them back .","293308":"lately , i ve been obsessed with lizzo . her song good as hell is really great . https www . youtube . com watch ? v smbmeogwsqe","293309":"take my medication .","293310":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","293311":"of course . he s known i m bisexual from the very beginning , and he s bisexual as well .","293312":"i can t compare it to any other country s health system because i don t know much about them , but i personally think the american health care system is flawed . a lot of people cannot afford to see doctors or buy medication , especially if they re of a low class status , which only exacerbates their conditions and puts them in greater debt when something terrible happens to their health . it s a backwards system . that s assuming insurance covers things , as well . insurance can choose not to cover something if they don t feel it s necessary , and most of the time they only cover a quarter of the actual cost .","293313":"someone s ethnicity doesn t mean anything to me , as long as we have common interests , goals , and there isn t a culture clash . i wouldn t have any qualms with dating someone of a different ethnicity i mean , my boyfriend is spanish lol .","293314":"if i was rich , i wouldn t still be living with my parents . lmaoo . i don t live in new york city . i would never live there in a million years .","293315":"you can t . i don t advertise my personal social media accounts online , especially on askfm . i don t post pictures of my friends or boyfriend on twitter , and my instagram is private .","293316":"new york city has skyscrapers , yes . it isn t very clean , though .","293317":"my best friend s husband . he turned today .","293318":"i don t post pictures of my friends , partner , or family on askfm .","293319":"i loved my first girlfriend , despite the fact that we were young , and i was heartbroken when we broke up . it took me a while to get over her , and we didn t speak for two to three years . eventually , i became interested in other people and that helped me overcome those feelings because it taught me that she wasn t the only person for me in my life .","293320":"my day is going pretty well ! ! i woke up around am and made myself a cup of coffee , and i ve been scrolling through social media and doing laundry every since . i have a birthday party to attend later in the afternoon , which should be fun .","293321":"i have no intentions of kissing anyone other than my boyfriend .","293322":"the winters aren t that cold , although every year it s been getting worse steadily in terms of snowstorms . here s a photo of a snowstorm we had two years ago , haha it wasn t terrible but it was a pain in the ass .","293323":"i feel much better than i did yesterday , thank you . i vented to my coworker as well as my boyfriend , and they helped rationalize and validate my feelings .","293324":"i respectfully disagree . sometimes our judgments are mild or happen unconsciously . it s innate , and as long as you re not discriminating against people , then there s nothing wrong with it .","293325":"everyone judges others to some degree , i believe . it just depends on whether or not you allow your judgments to overrule your thinking .","293326":"yeah , i have in the past ! ! these days , i keep it at a or , though . my hair grows super fast .","293327":"no , hunter s look like rainboots to me . i just have regular knee high boots , i have one pair in black and one in dark brown .","293328":"i ve had half my head shaved for over a year at this point . i don t remember exactly when i started doing the undercut on the opposite side , but it s been quite a few years now .","293329":"honestly , i don t remember . lmaoo . i suppose it was within the first year , though . i was infatuated with him from the very beginning , but after enduring significant hardship together , we became much closer and i realized i was in love with him .","293330":"i never really thought of it as a matter of bravery . it s just something i enjoy doing because i always hated having regular , brown colored hair . i ve been coloring my hair since i was years old .","293331":"i think that s a bit peculiar , yeah . that man is essentially an established adult with a career , and they re dating a woman who hasn t even graduated from college yet . i find that very uncomfortable .","293332":"depends on how old they are and how young the women they re dating are . if they re a child , then obviously they re a predator .","293333":"yes , i do ! ! her work is amazing , she s the one who also colored my hair pink , purple , and blue within the past year .","293334":"i prefer wearing knee high boots in the winter . i don t even own high heels because i can t walk in them and they re uncomfortable .","293335":"perhaps because older men are likely more mature with their lives put more together . most women , from my understanding , aren t interested in younger men because they have a tendency to be immature and aren t ready to settle down .","293336":"my original intention was orange , so it s all good . i m in the process of growing my hair out , but keeping the sides shaved .","293337":"thank you ! ! it s actually more orange at this point , the red has been washing out quickly .","293338":"i was under the impression that it was always something that occurred , not just recently .","293339":"my boyfriend and i once went on a date to a park on the north shore of long island . it s a long hiking trail that goes through various fields , woods , and eventually leads up to bluffs and a beautiful beach . we spent the day there , and it was absolutely gorgeous .","293340":"i like books with darker themes , particularly revolving around crime , addiction , and death . my ideal book would be one that discusses the importance of mental health within its characters and deals with subject matters such as drug or alcohol addiction , mental illness , the importance of platonic and romantic relationships , underground crime rings , and vengeance .","293341":"the first thing i would do is purchase a house for myself , my friends , and my boyfriend . afterwards , i would want to travel cross country and visit all of the national parks , particularly redwood national park . i also want to see the mountains and lakes of alaska because they look absolutely beautiful .","293342":"i really enjoyed studying the history of world war ii when i was in high school college . i find war history to be incredibly interesting .","293343":"i don t go swimming and don t particularly like it , but if i had to choose between those options , i would likely choose a lake . the ocean is too chaotic for me , and i would be afraid to get pulled out to sea . i ve never liked swimming pools and rivers aren t deep enough for me , lol .","293344":"these days , i m against the notion of seeking revenge . holding onto those kinds of negative emotions hurts you more than anyone else , and it s healthier to try to accept what happened , move on with your life , and try to make the best out of the bad situations . when i was younger , i was completely all for seeking revenge , but that was during a time when i had a lot of anger within me towards basically everyone and lashed out often . i didn t realize until later on that it was unhealthy for my mental health .","293345":"when i was younger , even as a teenager , i was afraid of the dark . i always thought something was haunting me and would attack me in my sleep , and my imagination would go wild . i always needed some form of light in my bedroom at night . these days , i love sleeping in absolute darkness and the darkness doesn t frighten me anymore .","293346":"publish a book . travel cross country to various national parks , particularly the redwoods . adopt a puppy .","293347":"lately , i ve learned that the only person you can genuinely rely on is yourself . if you need to do something , you have to do it yourself otherwise it will never get done , especially done the way you would like it to be done . most people are unreliable . since music is considered a form of art , i ve been listening to a lot of video game soundtracks lately and came to the conclusion that my favorite video game soundtrack is from halo . i haven t really eaten any outstanding food lately besides what i normally eat . however , a few months ago my best friend made me smashed avocado toast with a fried egg on top , and it was absolutely delicious .","293348":"i would reveal whoever sends out anonymous questions , particularly those who send out trolling , inappropriate , and harassing messages .","293349":"depends on my mood , haha . sometimes i ll order dunkin or starbucks in the morning on my way into work , but most of the time i brew my own coffee at home . i just recently bought the wide awake coffee , which is pretty cheap and very delicious .","293350":"i purchased a shirt off of amazon once , and it was coming from china . i was hesitant to buy it because i didn t know if it would be good quality or not . when i got the shirt in the mail , it was paper thin and felt like paper too . i was so disappointed .","293351":"binge watching television shows , reading a good book , and playing video games .","293352":"rpg open world video games thriller novels true crime documentaries conspiracy theories especially aliens surrealist and renaissance art music immersing oneself in nature and the elements and studying psychology , sociology , and anthropology .","293353":"sometimes , yeah . i can t have it too often though , the grease upsets my stomach .","293354":"no , i don t believe in the devil .","293355":"ugh , that sounds aggravating . honestly though you can t take those kinds of opinions into consideration , especially since everyone has a different idea of what attractive is . if you think he s average looking and not ugly , and you re also incredibly attracted to his personality , then your opinion is the only opinion that truly matters . everyone else in your life is going to have to simply accept that . ideally , they should have your happiness in mind .","293356":"looks are somewhat important because that determines your physical chemistry with one another however , what it ultimately comes down to is the meshing of your personalities . if you re dating someone based solely on their appearance and you don t have mental chemistry between you , then the relationship is going to be shallow and short lived . relationships work best when there s communication , understanding , the existence of similar interests or goals , and support encouragement . all of these things tie into people s personalities .","293357":"iceland or alaska would be my first two choices ! !","293358":"probably iced coffee , lol .","293359":"i don t have any enemies .","293360":"personally speaking , no . i don t believe i would be able to be in a relationship with someone who isn t fully over their ex . when someone isn t over their ex and is dating someone new , they re likely going to compare their new relationship with their old one , instead of judging their current relationship as it is . it isn t fair to either person involved , and when you re still emotionally attached to an ex , you re not allowing yourself to put yourself fully into your new relationship . there s going to always be a part of you held back , questioning the validity of the relationship . it might not even be a healthy relationship after a while .","293361":"walking the forest trails and seeing a group of trees leading down to the lake . this was taken in upstate new york .","293362":"i don t like following new people other than the people i currently follow . i like being able to keep track of my feed , and if i follow one random person that means i have to follow everyone else who asks me to follow them . i m content with who i follow now .","293363":"i don t follow people upon request , like i previously said . sorry .","293364":"love . i rarely eat pizza to begin with .","293365":"i m indifferent to them . people are allowed to express themselves however they want .","293366":"hello do you have a question ? ?","293367":"you re anonymous . regardless , i don t follow people upon request sorry .","293368":"hello do you have a question ? ?","293369":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","293370":"drink more water , you stupid f ck .","293371":"i was going to say something snarky , but i really don t want to step on anyone s toes , lmaoo . regardless , you re correct . i ll keep that in mind .","293372":"i m not obligated to give a response simply because people ask , and i m allowed to post whatever i want . a question was asked and i answered it with what made me feel most comfortable . there s no reason for me to elaborate if i m not okay with doing so .","293373":"yeah , i ve been taking them consistently for at least two weeks straight at this point . my anger outbursts aren t really targeted by my medication , though , especially considering my anger is a response to circumstances in my life .","293374":"i was actually thinking about that the other day , lol . yeah , i think that would be cute . it would give people a better range of expression when interacting with answers .","293375":"considering she has an account on askfm , perhaps you should ask her yourself . cc littlesha","293376":"i told my boyfriend that i loved him via snapchat earlier today .","293377":"i m turning in november .","293378":"a damn vacation . honestly , it can be a three day weekend vacation at this point . i ll take anything to escape from my responsibilities for three days because i m getting so burnt out .","293379":"i watched the first episode of season of orange is the new black .","293380":"no , he didn t cheat on me , lol . although admittedly , i would probably feel a bit better if i talked to him rn .","293381":"the same as my physical age years old .","293382":"? ? ? i haven t argued with my parents in years , lmao .","293383":"i wouldn t be on a dating app in the first place if i was single .","293384":"i don t feel like getting into it , talking about it will only make me more angry . and quite frankly , it isn t anyone s business .","293385":"i m normally riddled with anxiety whenever someone says that to me . i assume the worst .","293386":"i m incredibly angry right now , to the point where i m shaking . i m seeing red and it s difficult to breathe . i want so desperately to be out of this house , but i don t trust myself doing anything so i m just going to stay put until the feeling passes .","293387":"no , i don t follow anyone who behaves that way . if someone is lying , i would hope they would be smart enough to at least be consistent with their lies .","293388":"waking up early in the morning , before anyone else is awake , and drinking a cup of coffee by myself outside if it s nice out .","293389":"lately ? anger .","293390":"yeah , i have a select few . most of them don t use askfm anymore , though .","293391":"she s a furry .","293392":"were you tapered off gradually ? ? if so , then that makes sense . your body would have adjusted to not having the medication slowly in increments that you wouldn t likely notice the effects of not having the medication anymore . if you quit them all cold turkey , and you didn t feel any difference at all , then that may be an indication that perhaps they weren t actually helping . however , i m not a medical professional so i don t really know for sure .","293393":"when you re feeling empty , keep me in your memory . leave out all the rest .","293394":"i don t follow you , so you didn t receive my questions .","293395":"i like everyone s responses . i only follow people whose answers i genuinely enjoy i only follow around people , so everyone has unique answers to the occasional questions i send out .","293396":"yeah , when i was younger i smoked pretty regularly . now i only smoke maybe once per month or so .","293397":"i was in two relationships before dating my current partner .","293398":"i normally lie about how i m feeling so that no one worries or inquires about my health , like if i m angry or not having a good mental health day . i ll just say that i m fine and move on .","293399":"i honestly have no clue . i was a child .","293400":"around , most of the time . there are instances where i tell white lies , but overall , i see no reason to lie . it only hurts yourself in the long run .","293401":"this is unfortunately true , although honestly i was under the assumption that it happened more with teenagers than adults .","293402":"i agree . i m used to it though , which i suppose is alarming in itself . i ve gotten much worse questions than whether or not i was spanked as a child .","293403":"i have no desire to talk about my private life with anyone other than my close friends , boyfriend , and therapist .","293404":"honestly , the only type of people who would consider being naive to be cute are predators , because being naive makes a person vulnerable .","293405":"my parents had ab sive forms of discipline , and i m not going to go any further than that .","293406":"no , what s inappropriate to one person may be appropriate to someone else which is what i said in my initial answer .","293407":"nothing is percent certain , so no . however , it s also unhealthy to focus on the future like that in terms of relationships as well . if you re with someone and all you can think about is that one day you ll eventually break up , you won t allow yourself room to enjoy the present day with that person .","293408":"i don t know the nature of your relationship with him , but if there s an imbalance there i . e . he still loves you but you don t return the feelings , going so far as to buy him a gift may give off the wrong impression . you don t want to do something that might suggest that you two are still an item , or give him false hope . however , you can care for someone while acknowledging that the relationship didn t work . you just have to be clear with him that you don t have any intention of dating him again , but you still wish him well .","293409":"just because something is a question doesn t automatically mean it isn t inappropriate , lmaoo . questions can most definitely be inappropriate or intrusive . especially if someone is asking anonymously , it means that they re ashamed to show their face while asking that question since they wouldn t want people to know who they are otherwise . that s an indication that what they re asking is borderline inappropriate .","293410":"no if that were to happen , it would have happened already . the few times a person would find someone who s better than their current partner would be if they re already unhappy in the relationship . if they were happy in the relationship , they simply wouldn t view other people in a dating context like that . you also have to keep in mind that relationships are built off of a foundation of trust . you have to trust that your partner won t run off with someone else , and if that s something you actively fear , it may be an indication that you don t trust your partner as much as you think you do .","293411":"depends on who you re asking the questions to . some people are comfortable answering s xual questions , while others aren t . i consider them to be inappropriate , personally speaking . i usually delete all forms of s xual questions .","293412":"when they re actively doing things to discriminate against other people , and they re well aware that their behavior is wrong but they simply don t care .","293413":"i m not a fan of either band .","293414":"no , especially considering i m in my mid to late s . at that point , it s simply ignorance .","293415":"of course it s possible . there are some people in our lives that we may always have feelings for , regardless of how often we may see them . they may occupy a special place in our hearts in spite of the time that has passed .","293416":"i don t have any specific location in mind . i would rather it happen naturally in a place we re both comfortable , or perhaps a place that s meaningful to us . i wouldn t want anyone else to be there , though . proposals are personal events between two people .","293417":"no , most of the time my medication keeps me on a stable path , emotionally granted i m taking them everyday . if i m feeling sad or borderline depressed , it s usually because of something circumstantial in my life .","293418":"any of the dates i ve gone on with my boyfriend where we visited a park or nature preserve .","293419":"it s hard to tell in the photo , but it s fried eggs on a croissant with breakfast potatoes , lol .","293420":"nobody has ever proposed to me before , lol .","293421":"waking up in the morning , refreshed and ready to start the day . those mornings where you get enough sleep and feel invincible , like you can handle anything thrown at you that day .","293422":"yeah , i m also not subtle when i m checking someone out so it becomes awkward sometimes , lmao .","293423":"just by talking to someone without having the clear intention of becoming their friend . all of my friendships have happened with no ulterior motive behind them , we just began talking and it progressed from there . either way , i m not looking to make new friends .","293424":"ordered breakfast for my family this morning ! ! eating outside is so much lovelier than eating inside . ?","293425":"i almost broke an ipad that my boyfriend purchased me quite a number of years ago , when i was still in college . i went to grab it out of his hands and i ended up smacking the ipad against the table , which somewhat shattered the glass screen . luckily it still worked , but there was a nasty crack in the screen .","293426":"probably lady gaga , since apparently i look similar to her .","293427":"lol . yeah , and at that point the water is stale and gross , so i can definitely understand that . i used to do that a lot , but i ve gotten much better at bringing back my empty or half filled cups of water , simply because i hate clutter now .","293428":"the more that i think about this question , the more that i realize that if i continue to wait , then nothing will get done . there are certain things in my life that i ve been waiting on for the perfect moment , but in reality , we must do what s necessary regardless of the timing if we want to make any real progress . life doesn t wait for you , so we shouldn t wait for opportunities to present themselves . we must make those opportunities for ourselves .","293429":"honestly , i can t envision myself reaching an old age . however , i also couldn t imagine myself reaching the age of , let alone live past it to see almost . life works in mysterious ways .","293430":"i don t believe in the generic definition of soul mates , no . generally speaking , soul mates refer to two people who are romantically made for one another , their chemistry is unstoppable and there s nobody else in the world that meshes with you other than that person . i don t believe in that at all . i believe that there could be dozens of people who fit you , your needs , and are in the same stage of life as you are . in addition , soul mates don t necessarily have to be romantic partners they can be platonic friends , unwavering friendships that provide the utmost support and encouragement in your life .","293431":"before i went to a local college my sophomore year , i attended a liberal arts college in massachusetts and majored in creative writing and fiction . my family used to have a german shepherd for around years . we got her when i was a pre teen and she passed away when i was in college . she was the most beautiful dog . i used to know how to play the guitar , ukulele , and keyboard when i was a teenager . my ultimate dream was to become a professional musician . my first tattoo when i turned was a bass clef symbol turned into yin and yang symbols on each of my shoulder blades to represent the duality of music . when i was in high school , i was a prolific painter . i mainly painted in acrylics , but i also enjoyed oil painting and watercolor . i won awards for my art and my work was hung in a museum and at town hall .","293432":"my first date with my boyfriend was to a restaurant , and then we saw a movie together . i normally wouldn t recommend seeing a movie as a first date because you can t talk and get to know the person you re dating , but the outing we had to the restaurant beforehand was incredible and we really got to talk . on our second date , we went to the beach together . we found an area of the beach that used to be a dock for small boats , and it sorta became our spot . we layed on the beach and listened to music for the entire day , which is something that really drew our relationship closer because we re both so passionate about music .","293433":"give up on my ultimate dream of being a published writer . even though i haven t written anything creatively in a few months , i still cannot envision myself completely giving up on those ambitions .","293434":"ah , so many ! ! i would absolutely love to visit new zealand , though . it looks absolutely beautiful , and i really want to see the shire .","293435":"girl interrupted by susanna kaysen . it was the first book that introduced me to mental health mental illness , especially with respect to depression and borderline personality disorder . a lot of what kaysen wrote about resonated with me on an intimate level , and it was what first led me to question my own struggles with mental health . the book really opened my eyes to what i was dealing with and how what i was feeling wasn t normal or healthy .","293436":"yes , love is one of the few things that i do believe in . love , whether it was among me and friends or me and my boyfriend , has inspired and motivated me to keep pushing forward even when i felt that there were too many obstacles stacked against me . because of my unwavering belief and faith in love , i actually have the phrase amor vincit omnia tattooed on my arm . it s latin for love conquers all .","293437":"i believe the most pressing issue facing the world today is global warming climate change . weather patterns have become increasingly more erratic over the past years , and our summers are significantly hotter and winters significantly colder . it s rising to extreme levels , which is alarming .","293438":"lately , i ve been the one to start conversations first . i ve been having trouble seeing who my friends really are because i noticed that none of them seem to text me first or ask how i m doing , and i m always the one reaching out . it s gotten quite exhausting and i don t know what to think of the situation anymore .","293439":"no , i don t believe i ll ever be happy with the information i know . there s always room for growth and endless opportunities for education , and there s no limit as to how much we know or are educated on . i believe education is so important , and even if someone isn t in school or university , they should find opportunities to expand their mind .","293440":"i would probably eliminate tumblr . it can honestly be such a toxic social media site , especially for young and impressionable kids ,","293441":"cortana from the halo series ! ! i ve always loved her .","293442":"travel alone . i ve always wanted to go somewhere by myself and just exist without relying on anyone else , but i m also afraid of driving to new places alone because of my driving anxiety .","293443":"i believe the body positivity movement started out as a great ideology the idea that we should all love our bodies regardless of societal standards , because most people have unconventional body shapes , scars , disabilities , etc etc . , and we shouldn t be judged on those things . however , in recent times , i also believe the body positivity movement has become jaded because of a lot of rhetoric involving fat positivity . this ideology puts forth the notion that we should accept ourselves even if we re overweight obese , and essentially not do anything to help ourselves . being overweight obese is a major health concern it can cause problems with the skeletal system , it can affect our cardiovascular system , and it can wreck havoc on simply the way our bodies function . it s not healthy to be overweight obese , which is why physicians always recommend diet and exercise to those who do fall into the overweight obese scale . being overweight or obese isn t something that should be glorified , in my opinion . if you re putting your own health first , then you should acknowledge that there s a problem that needs addressing . the fat positivity movement seems to sweep all of that under the rug , from my understanding . you can certainly be body positive while also attempting to lose weight , but the problem with body and or fat positivity is that often those who promote it don t acknowledge that being overweight or obese is extremely risky and unhealthy .","293444":"coffee and or alcohol . i can t say no to either .","293445":"i enjoy dipping french fries in ice cream , if that counts ! ! i don t know if other people do or don t like that , though . i also enjoy putting potato chips inside my cheeseburgers and hot dogs , lmaoo .","293446":"oh man , i feel quite the opposite . if i wake up and i m extremely thirsty , water is the most delicious thing in the world to me , lol .","293447":"fried or scrambled .","293448":"no , i ve only ever ridden a horse once in my life and it was terrifying to me , lol .","293449":"you re anonymous , first off . secondly , friendship isn t something that s forced between two people . it has to happen naturally .","293450":"depends on the nature of the relationship and why how you broke up . it s going to be different case by case . there will be some exes you can remain friends with without a problem , but there will also be others with whom you cannot maintain a friendship whether it might be because of resurrection of old feelings or its just toxic to both of you . if this is a question you re pondering to begin with , perhaps its better if you keep your distance from your ex . at least in the beginning . i find that most people need time to move on and find themselves outside of their former relationship before they can feel confident enough to allow that person back into their lives .","293451":"interesting ! ! i ll check it out . i was thinking of either watching the new season of orange is the new black or re watching the last season of wentworth before season comes out next wednesday .","293452":"a medium starbucks doubleshot on ice with sugar free vanilla syrup and soy milk .","293453":"for the most part , thankfully . besides an extreme need for water , even though i ve been drinking water all day , lmaoo . now that i m awake , i m probably going to watch some netflix .","293454":"i woke up out of a sound sleep with an unquenchable thirst . i feel like even if i doused myself in water , it wouldn t be enough .","293455":"either somewhere in new england , or down south like north carolina or virginia .","293456":"i m a writer editor for a publishing company which is also in my bio .","293457":"no , i m not married . i m in a committed relationship , though .","293458":"yes , i have a number of ages on my person .","293459":"things that can be answered by looking at my bio , like my career or my age .","293460":"well , i m glad that i give off that impression , haha . i simply don t discuss my morals on here , or the experiences i ve had which made me developed whatever twisted moral code i have .","293461":"lmaoo , no . my set of morals is questionable at best .","293462":"initially , it was to protect us from the outside elements . then as time progressed , it became socially standard to wear clothing around other people because seeing the human body nude was interpreted as a s xual thing .","293463":"no , nudity isn t embarrassing it s simply the human body in its natural state .","293464":"ultimately , no . the earth will live on regardless of whether or not humans existed .","293465":"climate change global warming . it s drastically changing the way the earth operates and we re seeing it every season , weather patterns are getting increasingly more erratic .","293466":"i don t like the term insanity because it only increases the stigma against mental illness . people use it without a care and it harms those who struggle with their mental health .","293467":"there have only been a rare few times that i felt insane , and that hasn t happened in years . so yes .","293468":"this is going to sound so stereotypical and cliche , but . . . the notebook . it makes me cry every time , and even the book made me cry . lmaoo .","293469":"i m happiest when i m with my boyfriend , and we ve just woken up and are having a cup of coffee together on the backyard patio .","293470":"social stigma , i suppose . talking to yourself when there are other people to witness is makes someone seem crazy , even though talking to yourself is perfectly common and healthy .","293471":"i didn t have dinner yet .","293472":"hello do you have a question ? ?","293473":"thanks , my dude . i appreciate it .","293474":"this isn t a question . but yes , i m .","293475":"hello do you have a question ? ?","293476":"yeah , i ve heard of it before . one of my friends loves it , lol . i just never watched it .","293477":"no , i ve never watched it before .","293478":"here s another selfie","293479":"that s honestly the only reason why i like using high quality makeup products , they end up lasting for a very long time because you re not layering at all . i usually only have to put one layer on as a base , then a second layer if i want a smokey eye or more dimension .","293480":"aw aw , thank you","293481":"he s a disgusting human being , in my opinion . lmaoo . there s more to people than the money they bring home , i would never date or marry a person simply because they re successful financially .","293482":"they re expensive , but they last for a long time and the colors are very pigmented . i used to buy drug store makeup , but it simply isn t up to par with the other products i ve used , like too faced which as you can tell is my favorite brand , lol . i do suggest colourpop cosmetics as a cheap alternative , though ! ! their makeup is pretty great and they re very inexpensive .","293483":"obviously not .","293484":"there aren t any spots that i enjoy in my neighborhood town . i usually go to other cities in order to enjoy different things , whether they re state parks or beaches or bars and restaurants . there s this one park on the north shore of long island that s absolutely beautiful and i always enjoy going there .","293485":"there s this one club in town that my coworker dragged me to one day a few months ago , and i had a horrible time . the drinks were overpriced and not that great , there were people everywhere to the point where i could barely walk around , and the music was so loud to the point where i couldn t hear people talk . the club scene is definitely not my scene , i would much rather go to a quiet bar or coffee house to see my friends .","293486":"ultimately , happiness . happiness comes from within us , within our joys in life and ability to be grateful and content with who we are and who we surround ourselves with . although we can purchase things that lessen our worries and give the impression of happiness , it s artificial happiness that only lasts for a brief period of time .","293487":"my one virtue is that i m compassionate towards people in need and especially towards animals . my one vice is alcohol i have no self control when it comes to drinking .","293488":"most romantic comedies are stupid and overrated .","293489":"when it comes to tasks that i don t like doing , i normally try to do them first to get them out of the way in order for me to spend my time on the things i actually enjoy . if i put them off until the last minute , then i m going to spend that time worrying about those tasks until i have no choice but to do them .","293490":"yeah , i would say i m rather creative . i like to write creatively , as well as paint and draw and take photography .","293491":"i like dominos much better than pizza hut . although , i ve never had pizza hut other than the mini personal pies that they have at the drive thru , lmao .","293492":"oh boy , you re one of those people . here are two freshly taken photos of my makeup less face , no filters . clearly i look exactly the same , lmaoo .","293493":"yes , obviously i m fake considering my account is verified . lmaoo .","293494":"what am i lying about ? ?","293495":"you re correct , you can see the stars on my head lol .","293496":"aw , thank you ! ! i guess it s a combination of both ? ? i used the natural lighting from my window in my bedroom . i also have really thick natural lashes , i ve always just worn thickening mascara instead of putting on fake lashes .","293497":"i wore converse constantly when i was a teenager , haha . however , i really want a pair of those harry potter vans that just came out the slytherin ones look beautiful .","293498":"aw , thank you so much ! ! have you tried using an eyeshadow primer ? ? i ve never needed it before , but it could help ! !","293499":"people have often told me that i look like lady gaga .","293500":"looks are great and all , but any sort of relationship romantic or platonic are based on the meshing of people s personalities . you can like someone for what they look like , but if that s the only reason you re their friend or partner , then the relationship is going to turn sour quite quickly .","293501":"if i m feeling stressed out , i try to take a night for myself and relax in bed with ambient lights on , my himalayan rock salt lamp on , a candle lit , perhaps a cup of coffee in my hand , and something enjoyable on tv .","293502":"honestly , i view the term as something said in jest or in an ironic manner . i don t believe i ve ever heard someone use the phrase in a serious tone , lol . however , when i hear the phrase uncultured swine i usually think about people who not only are uneducated on matters , but who are also refusing to educate themselves too despite knowing that they don t know what they re talking about .","293503":"my mother got upset with me because i told her that me and my friend have been looking to rent a house together with two or three other friends . she doesn t believe it would be good for me , for whatever reason , even though moving out of my parents house is my number one concern right now due to my mental health . honestly , i think it s because she doesn t want me to move out since i m essentially a caretaker to her , along with my father . she would be losing a person in the house to do things for her that she can t do for herself , and i think that s what upsets her .","293504":"gasoline , freshly cut grass , the crisp smell of the first snowfall , rain , pina coladas , firewood , jasmine , patchouli , dragon s blood incense , and roses .","293505":"i do the same , i don t like using outrageous colors because they don t suit my face very well so i stick to neutrals , like peaches and browns and occasionally black . lately i ve been using too faced s pumpkin spice palette , which has a lot of great matte and shimmery neutral colors .","293506":"i have a lot of favorite television shows , but lately i ve been obsessed with it s always sunny in philadelphia . it s always made me laugh super hard .","293507":"one of my coworkers , a few weeks ago . she had to change her phone number because she was getting riddled with calls and texts from an ab sive ex .","293508":"yes ! ! it smells delicious . i also have their sweet peach eyeshadow palette , which also smells of peaches .","293509":"i ve always wanted to try zip lining , even though the concept sorta scares me . it looks like a lot of fun , though .","293510":"lately i ve been using too faced s peach mist mattifying setting spray . it works really well .","293511":"aw , thank you i don t wear eyeliner , and my mascara is waterproof . i also use a lot of setting spray so that my makeup doesn t budge , lmaoo .","293512":"i woke up from a nap not too long ago , does that count ? ? lmaoo . also don t mind the makeup , i fell asleep in it last night .","293513":"heathers my favorite , american psycho , the cable guy , shaun of the dead , red , seven psychopaths , and fear and loathing in las vegas .","293514":"if i m getting to know someone for the first time , i ll usually ask them basic questions first , like their education and their career . then i ll delve deeper , asking them about their passions in life , what they want to do with their life , and where they see themselves in years time .","293515":"i ve checked the country leaderboards on askfm a few times , but it isn t of much interest to me at all . apparently , i m in the united states . i m also out of the people on my friends list .","293516":"well , i was planning on going to work , having a productive day at work , coming home and relaxing in front of my television . however , i woke up feeling completely sick and didn t have a good sleep despite laying down for hours straight , so i ended up calling out of work . i feel a bit better now than i did this morning , but it wouldn t be worth it to go into work now considering it takes me about minutes to drive there and it s near the end of the day . so i m just on my laptop , listening to music , and drinking a sh tload of water to flush out my system .","293517":"i ve been involved in the internet since i was a young child . when i was a pre teen , i didn t have many irl friends , so i resorted to the internet to find like minded individuals who had similar interests , and as a result , i befriended a lot of people that way . i posted on public forums related to my interests , especially music and writing , and i still talk to many of the friends i made through those sites . social media and the internet as a whole has allowed people to expand their friend pool , finding acceptance and caring people if they re lacking that in their real life . i probably wouldn t be alive if it wasn t for the friends i made online when i was a teenager . they shaped me into who i am and instilled in me a sense of hope and confidence .","293518":"this may sound cynical , but no . we as a human species are prone to greedy and selfish behavior , which unfortunately is what propels most leaders to the top of their field , particularly in politics . the general public also has a close minded way of looking at things , especially in america , and believe that their way is the best way and won t accept anything other than what they think to be right .","293519":"by this time next year , i would like to have better control over my mental health , particularly with respect to my impulsivity and addictive tendencies . i need to develop better self control when it comes to certain things in my life . in the same vein , i also want to establish more self confidence and overall be a better person in my own eyes . i want to get my life in order and accept more opportunities , especially traveling .","293520":"the only thing askfm has done with respect to spending coins is offer these stupid backgrounds to answers , of which i m not a fan . i don t like having backgrounds to my answers , especially considering my answers are on the longer side .","293521":"singing , lol . i used to have a pretty decent singing voice when i was younger , but somehow it dwindled as i got older and now it s absolutely terrible . that doesn t stop me from singing , though . i still belt out songs in the car while driving home from work .","293522":"writing in general , including my understanding of grammar , development of characters , and writing style . i ve finally developed a voice when it comes to my writing and know how to pull a reader in and keep the text interesting while still putting my point across . i can describe things in detail without sounding flowery , which is something i am incredibly guilty of doing when i was younger .","293523":"i don t know any person not just women whose favorite movies are those movies , lmaoo . i ve never seen either of those movies , tbh . i prefer gritty action films , thrillers , and dark comedies .","293524":"i don t trust my parents . i trust my boyfriend and close friends with my life .","293525":"yes , gasoline is one of my favorite smells .","293526":"i have several favorite movies ! ! heathers , american psycho , i am not a serial k ller , les miserables , sweeney todd , the number , secret window , the shining , django unchained , and the lord of the rings trilogy .","293527":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","293528":"oh , you mean coins . right now , i have , .","293529":"uh . . . okay ? ?","293530":"hello do you have a question ? ?","293531":". . . this makes zero sense .","293532":"i m not really in pain to begin with . i have somewhat of a stomach ache , but i wouldn t classify that as pain .","293533":"i ve been drinking coffee and water . i have no problem getting things out , it s just non stop and will probably take time .","293534":"well yeah , i slept for almost hours last night .","293535":"what about it ? ? that s not going to help my nausea . i probably just have to flush my system out .","293536":"i wouldn t have said that if it wasn t true , lol .","293537":"lol , about an or . i m terribly awkward , especially around people i don t know or i m meeting for the first time .","293538":"hello do you have a question ? ?","293539":"i don t really know what you mean by flames .","293540":"no , i ve never taken painkillers before i m assuming you re talking about prescription painkillers .","293541":"thank you , i appreciate it . today s friday , so i have saturday and sunday off . i ll likely feel much better when i go back into work monday morning .","293542":"i have a stomach ache and i m pretty nauseous all the time , and i ve essentially been sh tting my brains out for the past day .","293543":"all kinds ! ! i answer most questions sent to me unless i don t have a straight out answer to them . i also don t answer anything inappropriate , i . e . trolling or s xual questions .","293544":"i ate fast food for the first time in over six months , and it wrecked havoc on my body . i ve been running to the bathroom every few hours . i m beginning to also think that there was something wrong with the sandwich i ate , because i definitely should not be going to the bathroom as much as i am right now , it s been over a day .","293545":"i would like to go to the beach , but that isn t doable for me right now , lmaoo . i don t want to be running off the beach to the bathroom every minutes .","293546":"i m not doing so well . i m still sick from yesterday , so i ended up calling out of work this morning , which honestly makes me feel terrible . i don t like missing work because my assignments pile up and i m terrified that i m going to get fired for missing work , even though i haven t called out in months .","293547":"i told my boyfriend i loved him last night .","293548":"cont . . . if you don t like how i word things , then please try to consider the fact that i follow many people who have to use google translate to answer my question , people who don t speak english as a first language and people from all areas of the globe . but also , i tend to word things however i m comfortable doing so . i m not mansplaining to women if i explain something in a spam question for everyone , i m not trying to be the alpha male if i explain something to a man . i m just explaining things to everyone for the sake of those who have a more difficult time understanding . if there s ever a time where you re uncomfortable with how i send out my spam , it can very easily be arranged for me to unfollow you and stop sending you it . all you have fo do is say rather than being a complete arse about it . i felt like this needed saying bc of some of your answers lately . anyway , to those who understand why i send things out the way i do , thank you for being amazing people and i ll get more spam out to you again soon . but if anyone wants to be unfollowed , now s your time to say bc i m unfollowing people r n . this is a dead site , it s not that deep . i totally understand where you re coming from , which honestly is half the reason why i stopped sending out spam questions to a bunch of random people a very long time ago . i would get aggravated at people s responses or lack thereof , and they would often come at me personally even though i merely asked a question , not gave my thoughts on the topic . it s ridiculous that you even have to make this disclaimer . like you said , this is a dead site it isn t that deep . however , i would really appreciate it if you did continue sending me questions , because i do like your questions a lot even if it takes me a while to answer them since they make me think .","293549":"nah , wendy s .","293550":"most religious people aren t brainwashed , no . they re simply following a set of ideologies that resonate with them because they have faith .","293551":"no , if it was food poisoning then i would be vomiting profusely , lol . i m just not used to eating fast food , with all of the grease and whatnot . i also had cheese on the sandwich , which probably wasn t the best idea because i haven t been able to handle cheese lately .","293552":"i ate fast food last night for the first time in months , probably for the first time this year i really can t remember when the last time was . it was delicious at the time , but now it s wrecking havoc on my body .","293553":"any sort of ab se or neglect , whether it s physical or emotional . especially when it comes to children . i would never be able to forgive someone if they were ab sive towards someone i care about .","293554":"i just answered a similar question a few answers ago .","293555":"because many of them still live at home with their parents , like myself , and we re all looking to move out .","293556":"not so great . waking up with my boyfriend was lovely , but i started feeling sick at work and kept running to the bathroom , so i eventually left early because i couldn t focus on working . i ve just been relaxing and drinking water since i got home . i feel a little better now , and i have plans with my friend tonight to discuss housing options so i think i ll stick to those plans since i feel better .","293557":"i don t really make friends anymore . the closest thing to making a new friend would be when i got friendly with a few coworkers last year . they invited me to sit with them at lunch , and we just started talking from there .","293558":"the new gmod video from achievement hunter let s play ! ! i watched it last night and was laughing a lot . https www . youtube . com watch ? v royyhonlx c","293559":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","293560":"car talk , lmaoo . i couldn t care any less about cars , which is ironic considering all of the men in my life are so enthusiastic about cars my brother is a mechanic .","293561":"i wish i had a large sum of money so that i could afford a house for me and my friends boyfriend to live in .","293562":"that makes complete sense , and i agree with you . it s healthy to refrain from dating after a breakup , you need to rediscover yourself in a way outside of being someone s partner .","293563":"i already have memory loss , so it wouldn t be good for me to lose even more memories . i wish i retained memories better .","293564":"aw , thank you . that s really sweet .","293565":"last night , i had a spicy chicken sandwich with lettuce , tomato , cheese , and ranch dressing , which was absolutely delicious . however , i woke up completely sick and nauseous this morning from it .","293566":"skinny jeans , knee high boots , an empire waist blouse , and a cozy cardigan .","293567":"yeah , although i didn t work out for one week this month so i feel like a failure in that regard .","293568":"lately i ve been having nightmares of my house being set on fire . apparently that might mean that i have strong negative feelings towards someone , or even myself , or that things have been overwhelming me .","293569":"disgusting . repulsive . terribly overweight .","293570":"the best compliments i can receive are compliments on my writing . it makes me so happy when someone likes or appreciates my writing style , especially when they can relate to my words .","293571":"i prefer winter over summer . i like the cold weather .","293572":"i would rather have no internet . i existed with a cell phone without internet access when i was younger , so i could certainly do it again , lol . at least it gives me a way to still communicate with my friends through phone calls and text messaging .","293573":"i m honestly happy with my current car . i don t really care about models or brands of cars or anything as long as it drives well and has good mpg , then i m satisfied .","293574":"apparently she s a crash bandicoot character . i don t remember her in the games , that s going back like years ago .","293575":"my personal experiences growing up and how they ve impacted me and further influence my behavior . no two people are alike because everyone experiences life in different ways , and our thought patterns and behavior are ultimately shaped by our formative and current experiences .","293576":"of course ! ! it used to be one of my favorite video games when i was a child .","293577":"i don t recall directly accusing someone of acting against me , but i definitely have had those thoughts quite strongly and have expressed them to other people instead of the person i think is wronging me .","293578":"no , it s faster for me to type without capitalizing letters words etc etc . i don t care much about my grammar on social media .","293579":"cont . . . they keep saying they ll never love someone else like they love me they ll never be able to move on , they ll always be mine , etc . and i really don t know what to say , i feel guilty . . it s making it difficult for me to move on and making me more attached . i don t want to just cut him off and ignore him forever but i m just unsure what to do . sigh . sorry for bothering you with this . you re not bothering me at all , don t worry about that . i m sorry you re in this predicament , because it sounds awfully difficult especially because you still care about them to a degree and don t want to hurt them which is totally understandable . on the one hand , cutting them off might help them to move on , but on the other hand , it probably will hurt them . especially if they believe you re the only one for them , they likely won t accept anyone else s affection for a long time . in the same vein , staying their friend might also further encourage them to try to pursue you . honestly , time can only tell . i would try to set some boundaries and keep your distance , perhaps keep reminding them that you re not interested anymore . if you find someone else and they wind up knowing that you re dating other people , perhaps it will help them move on .","293580":"witnessing someone i care about overdose on drugs and not waking up until hours later , despite all of my attempts at reviving them .","293581":"log cabins cottages in the woods are my favorite . they re so unique and cozy looking .","293582":"i don t eat donuts , but apple cider donuts i ve tried are delicious .","293583":"not generally , no . which is ironic , because my boyfriend and i met for the first time at an amusement park .","293584":"i don t believe i would want to make anyone immortal . being immortal seems like an awfully dreadful existence .","293585":"sure , i don t see why not . it s a fairly common thing for people to do , myself included . when i m alone and trying to figure something out , or if i m just thinking about something , i ll talk to myself out loud .","293586":"uh . . . when i first started what ? ? i don t know what you mean . i ve never entered a book club and or contest , however .","293587":"curled into a blanket burrito with an iced coffee in one hand a cigarette in the other .","293588":"i stayed in a hotel last month when my boyfriend and i traveled to upstate new york for my cousin s wedding . we stayed up there for the entire weekend friday through sunday .","293589":"i don t know what that is , so i m assuming no .","293590":"not at the moment , no . i just came home early from work because i feel sick , so i ve been going through my questions and determining which ones to answer and which ones to delete .","293591":"i have one older brother , who s technically my half brother . however , we grew up together so i seldom refer to him as such .","293592":"queer and or questioning .","293593":"i have no complaints , although my summer isn t much different from the rest of the year . i still work five days a week . the only difference is that the commute isn t as terrible during the summer , lol .","293594":"i m not afraid of any particular type of person , or anyone in general .","293595":"the only language i understand is english . i know a few words of spanish here and there , but not much at all .","293596":"i m comfortable with anything ! ! what do you need advice on ? ?","293597":"chocolate chip cookie dough is my favorite . i also like mint cookies cream .","293598":"the first thing i do when i wake up is take my medication .","293599":"aw , this is cute . ily too , anon","293600":"no , i don t particularly care about what people do or don t call me .","293601":"no , i ve never seen the twilight zone .","293602":"a buttered croissant at am .","293603":"i forgot to eat lunch today . i was working and didn t realize the time . i had a lunch break , but i usually spend it outside .","293604":"lol . my fresh buzz that i got yesterday .","293605":"i wasn t aware that she did . i just logged on since i just got home from work .","293606":"no , i m not interested in talking .","293607":"not at all . my boyfriend and i have had fish for years and we became emotionally attached to them . i cried when my fish died .","293608":"oh , lmao . no , she deactivated a while ago .","293609":"i m pretty selective , but i do try to answer most legitimate questions . a lot of what i receive in my inbox is spam or trolling messages , which i promptly delete . i also don t tend to answer questions where my answer is simply no and i don t have anything else to contribute .","293610":"depends on the time of year . i normally drink cold beverages in the spring summer and hot beverages in the fall winter .","293611":"i m assuming it s a car .","293612":"i used to be able to draw , but i haven t done anything in years .","293613":"i don t know if she would want people knowing where she lives now , so i don t want to disclose that .","293614":"i don t know if i even want children .","293615":"sushi or veggie tofu burrito bowls .","293616":"unfortunately , there isn t anything going on this year in that i m looking forward to . i don t have any upcoming plans or vacations lined up . my job is hosting a cocktail party next month , but i don t know if i m looking forward to that or not because i m not sure if my boyfriend will be able to come with me .","293617":"i ll be years old in years time . at that point , i see myself living with my boyfriend in a house , being married , and owning a lot of different adopted animals , i . e . dogs , cats , reptiles , and fish . also , i see myself being a more established writer at that point with hopefully something published by then .","293618":"i don t normally eat dessert foods . however , if i m celebrating something like a birthday , i ll normally eat a few cannolis or rainbow cookies .","293619":"i m the most talented at writing , particularly poetry and short essays . writing is a hobby i picked up when i was a pre teen , and since then i knew i wanted to pursue it as a career . i ve been writing poetry , stories , novellas , and essays since i was around years old .","293620":"the first person i always call is my boyfriend . he always knows what to do and how to calm me down if i m panicking , and he s a source of comfort for me during those times where i m in trouble .","293621":"when i m sad or depressed my sadness normally transitions into depression fairly quickly , i don t like being comforted or spoken to . i prefer to isolate myself , because most times i just get angry if people attempt to make me feel better .","293622":"i ve never heard of the first two , but i did have a deviantart account ! ! i was on there for quite a number of years , and i would post my drawings , paintings , and poetry .","293623":"i don t generally need hugs , and the only person i feel comfortable with touching me like that is my boyfriend . i don t hug or get physically close to my friends .","293624":"i m in a bearded dragon group on facebook there are so many posts of ignorant and uneducated people adopting or purchasing bearded dragons without doing their research . they end up placing two bearded dragons in the same enclosure , when that s an extremely dangerous thing to do . bearded dragons are solitary creatures as well , and because of their assertion of dominance or submissive behaviors , it can cause a lot of trouble if they re in the same enclosure . one dragon can steal the heat from other or they could flat out attack each other , even if in the beginning they seem fine . it s only a matter of time .","293625":"i don t care for either brand . i don t own anything from either of them .","293626":"yes , absolutely ! ! could you imagine how much money we would save ? ? lol . no more car payments or car insurance . . . that would be beautiful .","293627":"apparently the last video i watched on youtube was a lyrics video for

. the first time i met an online friend was in when i was visiting colleges . me and a close friend had been talking online for around years , and when i went up to massachusetts to visit colleges , we met up and hung out for the day . i also met courtney who used to be courrtana in person two years ago , and again last year before she moved out of new york ! !","293629":"definitely one it s super aggravating to have to close out of the backgrounds before typing an answer . i hardly see anyone even use the backgrounds to begin with , it s such a waste of time and askfm shouldn t have invested in it .","293630":"i would wish for the power of teleportation . it would be so convenient to simply be able to teleport from one place to another instead of commuting everywhere .","293631":"i have a few hobbies , but unfortunately i don t ever have much time to partake in them . i enjoy reading , writing , painting , playing video games , taking photography , and listening to music .","293632":"i trust my boyfriend the most out of anyone in my life . we ve established a year long relationship where communication and trust has been the foundation , and we wouldn t have lasted this long had i not placed my trust in him .","293633":"i do believe genuinely kind people exist , yes . i have quite a few people in my life who are genuinely kind individuals , and they always want what s best for others with no regard for how it affects them within reason , of course . they don t have any ulterior motives .","293634":"people usually think i m younger than i actually am , which isn t offensive to me at all , lmaoo . i would prefer to look younger than my age as opposed to looking older than my age .","293635":"no , i don t follow any beauty rituals or routines . the only things i do are use a neutrogena facial scrub in the shower and follow that up with a vitamin enriched moisturizer .","293636":"i ve never really been on a formal diet before , so i honestly have no clue . i would venture a guess and say once per week or once every two weeks ? ? i m a bit uncomfortable with the entire notion of cheat days , however . the right diet won t feel like you need to cheat on your diet because you would ideally feel much better on that diet than if you were to eat junk and fast food .","293637":"no , i haven t played any instrument in at least years

found a few memories on facebook where i was talking about how much he and his music has meant to me over the years , and it made me quite emotional .","293647":"i absolutely cannot stand the heat , so being too hot is much worse for me . also , apparently certain ssris decrease a person s threshold for tolerating heat , which could also explain why i cannot stand the heat anymore . i would much rather be cold . it s easier to layer up than anything else .","293648":"i ve never worn either , but birkenstocks look comfier to me and i like the look of them more .","293649":"my natural talent has always been writing whether poetry or prose . when i was a pre teen , i discovered that i had a talent for writing and i ve been trying to improve on it since then .","293650":"depends on what they re saying and or who they re saying things to . if someone is spreading false rumors about me or my friends , then i ll normally step in and set the record straight . however , if they re silly hate messages that are saying how stupid or ugly i am or something else along those lines , then i ll just delete them .","293651":"yes ! ! i ve been to countless concerts over the years , they re some of the best experiences of my life .","293652":"my bedroom ! ! especially now that i cleaned everything up made it sorta like a sanctuary for me . i hung string lights around the entire room and have my himalayan rock salt lamp on every night , so it has a really nice ambiance .","293653":"i ve never been in an earthquake before , no . however , i ve experienced hurricanes and blizzards .","293654":"i much prefer to be behind the camera . i don t feel comfortable modeling because i have low self esteem hate the way i look , and i m much better at taking photographs than anything else . here s an old picture of me modeling for my boyfriend , just for sh ts giggles .","293655":"i usually feel my best when i have hours of sleep .","293656":"he s one of my favorite actors . i love forrest gump , saving private ryan , big , and the money pit .","293657":"crispy chicken fillet , lettuce , tomatoes , cheddar cheese , and ranch dressing on a chipotle bun .","293658":"it depends on my mood that day , lol . sometimes i prefer the daylight , while other times i prefer the nighttime . today , for example , i feel more at peace at night because it s the only time i was able to relax today .","293659":"i don t usually experience cravings for chocolate . i m not the biggest fan of chocolate , and it normally gives me a stomachache .","293660":"i prefer to text my friends , but call my boyfriend . he s the only person i really feel comfortable speaking to over the phone .","293661":"my current relationship is my longest relationship we ve been together for years .","293662":"yeah , when i was younger my friends and i were loitering on an abandoned road where there was a lot of vandalism . we weren t doing the vandalizing , but the police had no choice but to give us all a summons anyway because they couldn t rule us out . i also got pulled over once by a sheriff for speeding on the highway , but i don t really consider that getting in trouble , lol .","293663":"if i m in a really bad mood , then there s usually not much that can actually make me feel better besides time . in those cases , i try to sleep away the feeling and start fresh the next day .","293664":"no , i ve always been afraid to visit a fortune teller psychic . i don t want to find out something that i realized i didn t want to know , especially due to my tendency to dwell on things .","293665":"yeah , i used to be obsessed with counting calories when i was younger . it got to the point where i tried to consume as little calories as possible in an effort to lose weight , keeping myself below calories per day . it was really unhealthy .","293666":"you have to create happiness in your life , it doesn t simply just come to you . if you wait around for happiness to occur , then you ll be waiting for the rest of your life . you need to actively do things that fill you with joy , follow your passions and ambitions , and do things outside of your comfort zone . you need to experience life to its fullest .","293667":"i m generally a money saver . i transfer money into my savings account every month so that i have a cushion in case of emergencies .","293668":"i would like to save it and purchase a house , but considering i have bills to pay , that s been rather difficult . i would also like to get another few tattoos .","293669":"driven while intoxicated .","293670":"you asked me this hours ago when it was am . i was working at that time .","293671":"i m doing all right . i just finished up with a family dinner in celebration of my father s birthday , and i m exhausted . i m just relaxing in front of the television now , watching it s always sunny in philadelphia , and drinking flavored seltzer .","293672":"i love storms .","293673":"at t . i m thinking about changing providers too , i don t get service in many places .","293674":"i don t generally eat fast food , but i like wendy s crispy chicken sandwich .","293675":"like , a trivia night at a bar ? ? if so , then no .","293676":"i was in kindergarten , so i was years old then .","293677":"just be positive . that phrase really angers me , for some reason . it seems invalidating and ignorant , especially in the context of mental health . positive thought patterns have to be re learned through a lot of therapy , so it isn t something people with mental illness can just do automatically .","293678":"i haven t had any really bad injuries . i guess the worst was when i was a toddler , my hand was slammed inside of a door when i was in kindergarten and they had to stitch me up and stuff . i still have a scar on my ring finger of my right hand .","293679":"i don t remember , lmao . it happens on such a regular basis that i lose track of what the instances are .","293680":"yeah , this happens to me sometimes because i have a hard time expressing myself verbally , so words will come out in a different context or meaning than how i envisioned it in my head . i normally try to correct myself right away .","293681":"sitting outside on a cool night with my boyfriend while we have a campfire . listening to music and swapping stories while we sip on either an alcoholic drink or some coffee tea . looking up at the night sky and seeing the moon and stars , as well as the canopies of the trees that are illuminated by the moonlight .","293682":"heathers , the crow , les miserables , sweeney todd , american psycho , the lord of the rings series , the number , secret window , and django unchained .","293683":"les miserables makes me bawl like a child every time i watch it .","293684":"i would definitely be a vegetarian if meat wasn t such a staple in my household . i don t care for meat except steak on occasion , i could definitely live without turkey , chicken , ham , pork , etc etc .","293685":"lmao , i don t eat burgers often anyway . most of the time , i ll order a veggie or black bean burger instead of beef .","293686":"lol , absolutely . except , i don t like bacon on my cheeseburgers . i m not sure why .","293687":"well , the last gift i bought someone was a ufo styled cookie jar for my father for his birthday . i ll be giving it to him tomorrow .","293688":"the girl by city colour https youtu . be ms xdo qm w","293689":"panic disorder . lmao .","293690":"i always like ordering bacon , lettuce , tomato , cheese , and avocado spread on toasted italian bread .","293691":"i guess ? ? i ve never heard the phrase almost r ped before , if that s an actual phrase people use . i would suggest you approach the topic with caution , though . there shouldn t be anything that insinuates that the event was mild or casual .","293692":"no ? if someone doesn t explicitly say yes , and continues that consent throughout , then it s r pe . i . e . , if someone changes their mind halfway through and the partner keeps going , it s r pe . if someone doesn t say no but also doesn t say yes , it s r pe . if someone is drunk and doesn t say yes , it s r pe . if someone is wearing skimpy clothing and doesn t say yes , it s r pe . i can go on and on .","293693":"it s a common symptom , yeah . it doesn t mean that someone has social anxiety , but a lot of people with social anxiety are afraid to talk on the phone to others .","293694":"sweat profusely , my heart starts racing , my anxiety skyrockets , and i m usually swaying or bouncing my leg to calm myself down .","293695":"i don t remember what model i used back then i probably took the photo in or something . i had a point and shoot camera during that time .","293696":"a picture from upstate new york the catskills that i took quite a few years ago","293697":"i don t know much about religion , so i can t determine whether this is indeed true or not regarding free will . you re probably better off consulting with someone who is religious , or who has at least extensively studied religion .","293698":"no , i disagree . triggers are psychological responses to trauma , or things that flash us back to those instances of trauma . they re largely out of our control until you begin to work on your triggers with therapy cbt or dbt .","293699":"just because your religion says that being gay is wrong doesn t mean you have to follow that way of thinking . we still have free will , and we can believe in a god or higher being while also being critical of religion for putting forth such notions as being anti lgbt . i . e . , i have quite a few friends who are very religious but are also very gay . the idea that god accepts and loves everyone regardless of their differences is also prominent in certain religions . being gay and being religious aren t mutually exclusive concepts .","293700":"no , that s quite admirable . alcohol is honestly a terrible thing for people to get into because it s harmful to the body .","293701":"medication and therapy work to a certain degree , but considering my illnesses are chronic , there s more i have to actively do each day in order to maintain stable mental health . that includes developing positive and healthy coping mechanisms , which i previously didn t have because i used alcohol and drugs as a means of forgetting about my problems .","293702":"neither , we just drifted apart . after i stopped partying with a group of people in my early s , i drifted away from everyone involved in that scene and they were one of those people .","293703":"yes , he was the first person to sit me down and tell me how worried he was about my drinking habits . he was concerned for my health and mental well being , because he knew how often i drank and how i was using it as a coping mechanism .","293704":"lol . i don t work a low end job , and the reason why i live with my parents at the age of is because there s no such thing as affordable housing on long island . it has nothing to do with my past experiences , especially considering i don t believe in curses or even karma .","293705":"deserve what , the guilt ? ? absolutely . i don t think about it often anymore , but it s still something that weighs on me time after time . but what s in the past is in the past . there s nothing i can do about it now .","293706":"no , my parents never wanted another dog after she passed away . i m not sure if they simply didn t get over her passing or they thought it was too much work keeping a dog , particularly with my mother being house bound and disabled and whatnot .","293707":"no , i m not friends with them anymore .","293708":"if i wanted to elaborate , then i would have in my initial answer , lol . it s something private that i don t feel comfortable discussing .","293709":"thank you i m over it now , it happened a long time ago and she lived a great life with me . she helped me through a lot of things i endured when i was a teenager . and yeah , she was a gorgeous dog . german shepherd mix , and we think there was some sort of hound in her as well .","293710":"yeah , i did something terrible to a person in my life and i still feel guilty about it to this day , even though it happened years ago .","293711":"it s a tie between askfm and instagram . i update my instagram story every day with various posts and reblogs , as well as music .","293712":"personality wise his hard work ethic . he always puts percent into his work . his passion for animals . his knowledge wisdom of a variety of things . appearance wise his facial structure and facial hair . his tattoos . his back .","293713":"this was my puppy before she passed away . she was nine years old when she passed , i think i was or years old when it happened .","293714":"i believe a relationship becomes more enriched or valuable because of it s depth , how intimate you two are together not in a sexual way and how much chemistry you have . a person could be dating someone for years and not have the same level of chemistry or intimacy as a couple who have only been dating for one year . everyone is different , so each relationship will be different .","293715":"hello do you have a question ? ?","293716":"uh , illegal things that i don t feel comfortable describing on askfm . lmao . they didn t pay off , though . sometimes i still feel guilty about the things i did in my past because of how stupid , reckless , and dangerous they were . but you learn to live and let go . there isn t anything i can do about those events now .","293717":"honesty open communication . if i m doing something wrong or if my behavior has become toxic or unhealthy , i want my friends to tell me . i don t want them to sugarcoat the truth , because i believe that if you genuinely care about your friends , you would want what s best for them .","293718":"i used to love parties when i was younger , but now i don t care for them at all . i ve become increasingly more anxious in social settings as i ve gotten older , and big crowds really overwhelm me . i would much rather have a small gathering than a big party .","293719":"the game of thrones series ! ! i read like pages of the first book , and i put it down about a month ago and haven t picked it back up . i do want to eventually read the entire series .","293720":"i would want to change my weight . i m overweight and it makes me feel like sh t about myself .","293721":"lol , definitely a one . i have a terrible singing voice , but that doesn t stop me from belting out songs in the car .","293722":"haha , aw . thank you","293723":"i have a bachelor s degree .","293724":"it s honestly really difficult these days to afford college , especially if you re choosing to pay for each credit as you go . your best bet is to take out a loan to pay for tuition , that way you can pay off your balance after you graduate at that point , you can dedicate yourself to a full time job and do monthly installments .","293725":"grandson ! ! he has a small following on twitter and instagram , and he s slowly becoming bigger . his music is great , it s a combination of hip hop and hard rock . he s also very political , he reminds me of rage against the machine a little bit he s also collaborated with tom morello .","293726":"i haven t dealt with this in a very long time five years , i believe . it happened a lot when i worked in retail , though , especially when it came to upper management . i didn t deal with it very well because i was afraid of speaking up at the time , i didn t want to lose my job . i just kept to myself and did my job , i didn t question the tasks and simply preoccupied myself with work and doing the best i could do with what was given to me .","293727":"no , i don t have any photos of my shorts . i don t take full body pictures .","293728":"wintergreen or spearmint ! ! i also like cinnamon flavored gum on occasion .","293729":"when i m out , i usually just wear jean shorts . when i m home , i have a pair of pajama shorts that i wear around the house .","293730":"possibly ! ! i still want to get my teeth checked out when i get dental insurance , though . it s always good to have proper hygiene .","293731":"no , i ve never had a toothache before .","293732":"that is a really weird sentence , so i don t blame you for not understanding it . however , i think it means that what you think about yourself is the opposite of how you portray yourself on the outside .","293733":"i don t know any foreign languages .","293734":"it wouldn t surprise me if i did .","293735":"it s so hot and humid outside , and i really don t want to go out and run the errand i need to run . however , today s the last day i can actually go and do it , so i have no other choice .","293736":"zero . to be fair , i haven t been to the dentist in a very long time . i didn t have dental insurance when i was under my parents insurance before i turned , and i have to wait until open enrollment next year in order to sign up for dental insurance at my job .","293737":"i m a full blooded scorpio .","293738":"i discover new music through youtube spotify ! ! spotify in particular has great just for you playlists that has new music that i ve never heard before .","293739":"i don t have many plans at all . i just intend on doing laundry , and i need to run an errand in the afternoon . i might pick myself up some coffee from starbucks as a treat .","293740":"i would much rather be cold than hot . it s supposed to be higher than degrees fahrenheit today , and i cannot handle the heat .","293741":"i ve fallen in love a total of four times .","293742":"honestly , if he wants to break up with you or if he views you differently simply because you re bi , he doesn t sound like someone you should be in a relationship with anyway . that s just my two cents . i wouldn t be able to date someone who won t accept me for who i am .","293743":"i don t own sunglasses , so here are some photos of me from this morning . it s am and it s already degrees fahrenheit outside .","293744":"it s okay ! ! it sounds like you definitely need to have a talk with him about it , just so that you re both on the same page .","293745":"i don t see anything wrong with telling your boyfriend that you believe you re bisexual , as long as you make it clear that it doesn t affect the nature of your relationship . some people may interpret that as you wanting to break up experiment . . . but if you tell him you have no intention of doing that , i don t see what could go wrong . take this advice with a grain of salt , obviously . i don t know you or your boyfriend , so i don t know how he would react to the news . i m always an advocate of open communication and comprehension in relationships , though .","293746":"it s all good . i m always here to help .","293747":"there s always a misconception that someone isn t bisexual anymore if they re dating someone of the opposite sex a heterosexual relationship . just because you re a female in a relationship with a male or a male in a relationship with a female doesn t mean you re not bisexual or pansexual anymore .","293748":"that s no problem at all ! ! i m fairly open about my past relationships , i have nothing to hide and i feel comfortable talking about them at this point .","293749":"lately , not very much . i used to play video games every night , and now i only play once every few weeks or so .","293750":"not at all . i have no desire to be with anyone other than him . even though i m bisexual , i don t want to date a woman because i m already in love with someone and we re in a monogamous relationship .","293751":"yeah , that s a difficult situation to be in . one of my other friends is currently going through the same thing with a man in her life who s also a good friend , and she doesn t really know what to do either . i don t really have much advice for these situations . i ve always just went for it and ended up getting heartbroken as a result , lmao .","293752":"it s a tie between skyrim and fallout . even though both games are relatively old at this point , i still really enjoy playing them . i m always discovering new things .","293753":"i believe i ve loved four people so far in my life .","293754":"i was pretty sad for a long time after the breakup , and we didn t talk for years afterwards . however , we rekindled our friendship because we realized that we were great friends before we entered the relationship . and at that point , i was totally over her and knew i wouldn t develop feelings again .","293755":"sometimes i wonder if we were actually experiencing trauma bonding , but considering we re still friends now she s my best friend now , i don t think that s the case . the relationship was short lived . she realized she was straight , and we broke up . lmao .","293756":"no , we were preserving our own mental health by being private about our relationship . we were afraid our families would have negative things to say or not support us , and considering we were both going through ab sive situations at the time , we didn t want to risk it being worse . i don t have any regrets .","293757":"we weren t open about our relationship , there were only two or three of our friends who knew we were dating . we weren t embarrassed of each other , but we were afraid that there would be negative comments and backlash .","293758":"we did break up during the first year of our relationship , yes . i went away to college and he was attending college at home , and we were also enduring a lot of struggles during that time which drove us apart even more . we decided to break up , which lasted perhaps months before we got back together . we re not married yet because we re not financially ready to be married and have a wedding and whatnot . we also don t live together , and we want to have that independent experience before delving into marriage . we re not in any rush at all , it isn t a priority to us . i don t know if i want children , tbh .","293759":"i knew i was bisexual before i ever entered a relationship with a woman . i simply had the same romantic feelings for women as i did for men . the fact that i did enter a relationship with a woman my first relationship , actually and then found that i also liked men in the same fashion confirmed it .","293760":"lol , thank you . we started dating when i was years old , just after our high school graduations .","293761":"we ve been dating for years .","293762":"i m not sure , haha . i haven t been in the dating game for quite some time . but i think it s natural for a lot of people to be unsure of their orientation , there s nothing wrong with that and it definitely doesn t mean they re looking for attention . they re simply confused , likely because they never had hands on experiences for themselves .","293763":"well , thank you very much . i truly do appreciate it .","293764":"no , i wouldn t be able to handle such a profession . i have a difficult enough time processing and dealing with my own thoughts and behavior , i wouldn t be able to cope with taking on the thoughts and worries of another person . i wouldn t want to feel responsible for their happiness .","293765":"well , i m in a relationship so naturally i want to marry my boyfriend . however , i have no qualms with marrying a woman . like i said , i m bisexual . someone s sex or gender doesn t much matter to me at all .","293766":"yeah , i do want to get married eventually . i think it s an expression of love in a traditional sense , even though there s a lot of legal aspects to marriage as well .","293767":"i find that it s harder to find women who are bisexual or gay , for whatever reason . i think it s because being heterosexual is still seen as the standard , and a lot of bisexual gay women exist but it s difficult to really . . . find them ? ? unless you go on a dating site , or something . but no , for me personally there was no difference . i don t really care about someone s sex or gender , i find a lot of different people attractive .","293768":"i barely got through them , haha . i developed very unhealthy coping mechanisms as a result , i self harmed for almost a decade , and i ve attempted s icide . i still consider myself to be a weak person . however , i appreciate the kind words .","293769":"yeah , although it was mostly online . i never advertised it in my real life , so i never felt kickback from being bisexual . i ve only become more open about my orientation over the past five years or so , but people are much more accepting now than in the past .","293770":"yes , the lyrics are one of my favorite aspects of most songs . they can make or break a song , in my opinion . i have the utmost respect for musicians who are also wonderful writers . i really like the lyrics to grandson s thoughts prayers no thoughts , no prayers can bring back what s no longer there . the silent are damned , the body count is on your hands .","293771":"aw , this is super sweet . thank you i definitely don t agree with the idea that i m strong , but it s something i m actively working on self esteem and such . i ve overcome some obstacles during my life , but i ve struggled greatly with them too .","293772":"i realized i was bisexual when i was years old . i ve dated both men and women since then , which sorta solidified my sexual orientation because i noticed that i felt the same towards them . it wasn t difficult for me to come out , at least to my friends , because many of my friends are also bisexual or gay . i didn t tell my family , i think they at least figured it out while i was still a teenager though . it s never been a topic of conversation in my family .","293773":"haha , no problem . lgbtq rights is something i feel very strongly about .","293774":"considering i m bisexual , no . even if i was heterosexual , i wouldn t judge people for being gay , pan , bi , etc etc . people love who they love , and there s absolutely nothing wrong with that .","293775":"no , he doesn t normally drink . if he does drink , it s once every few months or so and he ll only have one or two beers at the most .","293776":"yeah , i definitely believe that disappointment feels worse than hatred . if someone hates you , then that s more of a them problem than a you problem , because that person is holding onto that negative energy , not you . someone being disappointed in you , on the other hand , feels so much worse particularly when it s a loved one or a friend .","293777":"meeting with upper management at work . i had to go to a meeting with the coo of the company last friday , and my anxiety skyrocketed the entire morning before i had to meet with her . i m always terrified that i m not going to portray myself or my thoughts in the correct way . i m also afraid that they re going to criticize me for my work performance .","293778":"i find that rude people are also very ignorant , so rude people are definitely more irritating since they portray both traits . in some cases , they re aware of their behavior as well , and the fact that they actively choose to be a rude or bad person is aggravating as well .","293779":"not very well at all , haha . i have a tendency to dwell on my failures and find it difficult to move on from them .","293780":"the scarlet letter by nathaniel hawthorne . i had to read in when i was in high school , and it was the most boring and pretentious book i ve ever read .","293781":"i haven t traveled much aside from going , miles away from new york to texas five years ago . i really liked the city of austin , but i don t know if i could live there permanently . i would want to visit other places , especially internationally , before deciding on where to live . i like the idea of traveling to england , though .","293782":"yes , this is true as well . however , for all i know that anon is also dieting . it wasn t something we touched upon in our previous conversation . i eat mostly healthy , but because of my alcohol use in the past and current drinking habits , i think that also put a damper on my weight . there s a lot i need to improve upon .","293783":"general tso s chicken , even though it s probably totally unhealthy for you , lol .","293784":"that s really discouraging , so i completely understand where you re coming from . you have to remain committed , though . i haven t lost weight recently and i kinda plateaued , but i think it s because of my monthly period cycle and i m always going to weigh more before and during my period , probably because of water retention ? ? i m not entirely sure . either way , i hope it works out for you this time around .","293785":"yeah , i experience the same thing . it s difficult for me to lose weight , which is why i ve only lost pounds in two months . you should try to weigh yourself in the morning before you eat , i find that it s most accurate to have sorta a baseline weight . also , you have to remember your weight fluctuates each day as well depending on what you ve eaten and how much activity you did .","293786":"once you start working out , you will be ! ! it takes time , so don t get discouraged in the beginning . every time you attend the gym , you work on yourself little by little . take each day at a time .","293787":"i understand that completely . that was another reason why i was hesitant on going to the gym , i felt embarrassed of my size and how out of shape i was still am .","293788":"i was in denial at the time , unfortunately . it s only been within the past month or two that i acknowledged that it was a big issue .","293789":"i just explained this in more detail below . however , the short answer is no . i have a treadmill in my house .","293790":"i ve been exercising for about two months now .","293791":"i don t feel comfortable taking a picture , sorry . i also haven t physically changed much , haha .","293792":"that s great ! ! i used to go to the gym , but i found it difficult to actually get there and work out because i have anxiety and couldn t get myself to drive there a lot of times . especially after my best friend moved away , we used to attend the gym together and i wasn t as dedicated when i was by myself . two months ago , however , my family allowed me to take the treadmill that we have in the house and move it upstairs so i can work out in peace . it used to be in my parents bedroom , and i never wanted to work out there because my father is always in the bedroom . but ever since i got that privacy , i ve been working out consistently .","293793":"it usually takes me minutes , depending on how fast i run . there are also times where i take breaks and speed walk instead .","293794":"i m working on increasing my stamina because i m so out of shape , so i can really only do two miles at a time . i usually work out every other day .","293795":"i ve only mentioned this briefly in the past because i didn t feel comfortable going into the details of it , but i m in the process of working on an alcohol dependency and decreasing my use of alcohol as a coping mechanism . i went from drinking nights per week to only drinking once per week , and instead of getting blackout drunk like i used to get , i limit myself to three drinks at the most . it s something i m pretty proud of , even though people don t know about it , and i m also embarrassed to admit that it was is a problem . everyone in my life was worried about me and it took me a long time to acknowledge that it was an issue in my life . but i m working towards recovering .","293796":"i would bring my boyfriend . i ve always wanted to travel , and recently he told me that he wanted to travel more often and experience more of the world . he just came back from a four day long camping trip with his friends , and it opened his eyes to the experiences he felt he was missing out on in his youth .","293797":"yeah , sometimes so many things go wrong at once that it feels like something in the world is preventing me from achieving much or being happy . it makes me feel hopeless and at a loss of what to do , and it s pretty discouraging . when i m feeling this way , i try opening myself up to my boyfriend and friends in order to receive support and encouragement . they have a good way of motivating me and making me see the positive side of things so that i can continue moving forward .","293798":"a serotonin deficiency .","293799":"i would try to explain it through emotions different emotions give off the impression of different colors to me . it may be difficult , however , because i don t think everyone experiences emotions in the same way . however , i associate red with anger . blue with tranquility and relaxed . black with dangerous thoughts depression . and purple with joy and enthusiasm .","293800":"i ve been running on the treadmill . i lost pounds so far ! !","293801":"i don t know anyone specifically , but i did find this really

happy .","293803":"i ve never had an interest in being polyamorous . although i do have a lot of respect for my friends who are and have multiple partners , it takes a lot of openness and communication to maintain poly relationships .","293804":"no , i don t need to know if someone liked me to feed my ego . if anything , it s always made me uncomfortable . additionally , i m in a relationship . so that s already an indication that i wouldn t like them back anyway , lol .","293805":"the question asked how i would like someone to tell me if they liked me . i took that in a romantic context , so i responded that it would be useless for someone to tell me that because i m not single . i can see the confusion , though . i honestly didn t even think of the word like in the way you re describing , that s a friendly platonic way of liking someone as a friend . usually when people say they like you , they mean that they have feelings for you .","293806":"i don t discuss my sex life on the internet .","293807":"so ? i m just emphasizing that it would be useless to tell me because i wouldn t be interested in them back anyway .","293808":"yeah , i ve been exercising to lose weight .","293809":"i m the wrong person to ask , my dude . lmaoo . i m extremely insecure about my appearance and have never been able to accept myself . however , i ve slowly been changing my appearance through exercise so that i would be more confident . if there s something you want to change and have the means to do so , then there s really nothing stopping you .","293810":"i ve never trashed feminists actual feminists , but all right then . you re confusing that with my criticism of the third wave feminism movement , which is more for clout than anything else .","293811":"today july th is a day of remembrance for me . a day of remembering the life , wisdom , and music of chester bennington . it s been two years since he passed away , and his influence on my life is always on my mind . i also have to keep mike shinoda and talinda bennington in mind , for helping and guiding the community in the healing process . none of us would have been able to get through this if it wasn t for their passion for the fanbase and wanting to make a difference in how we view mental health .","293812":"no , i don t have a close relationship with my family . at this stage of my life , i don t have a desire to have a relationship with them either . i m pretty much done , and once i move out of my parents house , i don t want to keep in close contact .","293813":"walk around the city

my passport , and possibly find a house to rent with my friend .","293818":"i m in a relationship , so if someone did like me , it wouldn t matter how they told me because it won t make a difference in my relationship status . i m not interested in knowing who likes me or who doesn t .","293819":"i judge people harshly when they don t hold the door open for people if they re going through a doorway . you don t have to stand there and open the door for them , but at least hold the door open while you re walking through so that it doesn t slam in other people s faces .","293820":"i once wrote the beginning of a book that was loosely based on my life . i titled it chasing the dragon .","293821":"lately , i ve been obsessed with ordering veggie burrito bowls , and sometimes burrito bowls with carnitas . i usually get a bowl with white rice , black beans , carnitas or tofu , tomato salsa mild or medium , guacamole , cheese , and lettuce .","293822":"i thought shakespeare s work was a bit pretentious and dramatic , but i did enjoy the process of analyzing his pieces and picking apart all of the metaphors .","293823":"i would much rather learn to play every instrument ! ! i m very passionate about music and it would fulfill me if i knew how to play multiple instruments , especially if i was proficient at them .","293824":"the fact that i m still living with my parents is holding me back from my true potential , my potential to be the happiest i can be at this stage of my life . i m not living for myself right now even though i should be , i m living to take care of my parents and it s been damaging to my mental health . however , my good friend asked me if i wanted to join him and his brother in looking for houses to rent , so i m going to be meeting with him next week to discuss finances and details and whatnot .","293825":"i normally prefer books , even though i haven t had the motivation or dedication to actually finish reading a book in a very long time

.","293828":"neoclassicism is a movement in the arts that was a revival of the classics . with respect to literature , neoclassicism was mostly in the form of essays and satires , as well as poetry . according to my google searches , neoclassicism in literature focused on man being inherently flawed , which is in contrast to the renaissance period of literature , in which man was seen as inherently good .","293829":"if i don t have an answer for something immediately , then i ll usually leave the question in my inbox for a few days . if i find that i don t have an answer at all , or

i m making now . i find it really difficult to wake up and go to work most mornings . i haven t taken a day off in well over a month , which i m very proud of , but lately i ve been really needing extra time off from work .","293834":"i believe my greatest strength is my desire to help other people , especially in terms of mental health . for a few years now , i ve tried to be an advocate for the awareness of mental health issues and support the destigmatization of disorders like depression , anxiety , personality disorders , psychosis , etc etc . ever since i started talking about mental health , i ve had more and more people come up to me and tell me how i ve ever helped them through a crisis or inspired them to take better care of their own health . it makes me feel amazing that i ve been able to reach people in such a way .","293835":"i m proud of graduating from college . high school and college were both difficult times for me in terms of my mental health , and while i knew i was going to graduate from high school , i honestly didn t think i would do well in or graduate from college . even though i ve always been a good student , my mental illnesses got in the way of a lot and i would often skip class , and my tendency to ab se substances overrode my desire to go to class as well . often , i would party at night and skip my morning classes , but i would still do great on my exams and papers so i received mostly as .","293836":"lol , unfortunately that is definitely not that case . my writing is pristine , but my speaking voice , inflection , syntax , and just overall manner of speaking is absolutely terrible and hard to follow . i ve always been horrible at speaking to other people , and i also have social anxiety . i could never work in a secretary or customer service position .","293837":"i can t deny it , i do think about the future very often . it triggers anxiety in me somewhat , but it also gives me a source of hope , knowing that i could potentially be happier in the future and i just need to work towards it .","293838":"i don t remember , tbh . especially since the last creative pieces i ve written happened so long ago the last essay i wrote was in january . however , i think that was sorta the last time i wrote for myself , not for anyone else . i hesitantly shared it on social media even though the subject matter was dark , but it didn t get much attention at all .","293839":"wow , congratulations . this is one of the most homophobic messages i ve ever received .","293840":"it isn t more helpful to me , no . i don t like to think of helping others as a selfish means of helping myself because that shouldn t be the intention of helping other people .","293841":"quite a few hours probably , before text messaging became

respect to music .","293843":"i m not answering specific questions about my first relationship like that . we were years old , so to inquire about how we kissed is disgusting .","293844":"i think it s worthless for them to edit it now as opposed to when they were initially filming the scene . it s been . . . what , two years since the first season came out ? the damage has already been done . they were specifically told not to film the scene in such a way , but they decided anyway despite the advice from licensed psychologists and everyone else they consulted . it s despicable .","293845":"there isn t a universal answer for this question . people leave for a variety of reasons , sometimes because the friendship relationship doesn t serve them anymore , they re looking for something else in life , or the friendship relationship has become toxic .","293846":"we were years old .","293847":"our relationship was fine , but it was short lived considering how young we were at

health these days . if anything , it encourages the maintenance of my mental health because i try to use my spare time advocating for mental health awareness and destigmatization via social media . when i m not in a good frame of mind or i m having a bad mental health day , i generally avoid all kinds of social media .","293853":"i think i do both , honestly . it just depends ultimately on how i feel that way and how much control i have over my own thoughts and actions . i m always thinking logically , but there are a few times where i ve instead acted on my emotions and feelings because they absolutely consumed me .","293854":"yeah , toxic feminity exists and it s not talked about as often as toxic masculinity . toxic feminity is tied into the traits of toxic masculinity , in which the standards of a male dominated system are upheld by women ascribed to that system . this is classically seen in women , particularly white women , who put other women down for expressing themselves via s x and other things that challenge the notion of a subservient woman .","293855":"no , not really . everyone with whom i m in contact are close friends of mine , and there isn t anyone with whom i want to improve contact . if that was the case , then i would make the effort to reach out to them .","293856":"sometimes , but i generally disagree with waiting for something good to happen . if you want something to change or something great to happen in your life , you have to actively seek it out and work towards it . nothing is going to happen if you just wait around and wait for life to hand you an opportunity . you have to make them for yourself .","293857":"being merely alive is simply existing for the sake of existing . it s going through the motions of your life with no real reason , motivation , or purpose you re existing solely because it s easier to stay alive . truly living , on the other hand , is living your life with a sense of purpose , dedication , and motivation to improve yourself and those around you . you take the opportunities presented to you and run with them , instead of just going through the motions . you control your own destiny and do things that genuinely make you happy , whether it s indulging in hobbies or taking trips . you re experiencing life to your fullest extent .","293858":"that person should always be yourself . you cannot rely on other people to make you happy your happiness should come from within , from your own thoughts and behaviors , your own satisfaction with your accomplishments , etc etc .","293859":"i make it a point to not dwell on either thought .","293860":"people talking with their mouth full of food , chewing with their mouth open , making slurping sounds , etc etc . i get so irrationally angry over things like that , lmaoo .","293861":"yes and no . i don t believe there s any ulterior motive behind pain , like the belief that pain solely exists to teach us a lesson . there isn t always a rhyme or reason for things to happen , they just simply happen because we re human and mistakes are bound to be made , tragedies are bound to occur , etc etc . however , we can make a conscious decision to learn from the pain and move on from it .","293862":"not everyone , no . there are some people in this world who don t deserve happiness . they only deserve pain and torment .","293863":"my job , at the moment . i ve been really improving on my daily tasks and understanding of the programs and whatnot , and i ve been told that i m extremely quick and efficient when it comes to my work ethic . one

said in past sessions . most therapists are really in tune with their memories , so they can remember a lot of things their patients have said , even when dealing with a full list of patients on a weekly basis . i ve always admired how much my therapist remembers about me , considering she works days per week with different patients all day .","293866":"compassionate , family oriented , and strong mentally , at least .","293867":"this isn t very awkward , but i figured i would share anyway because it was hilarious . i was at my boyfriend s house last week , and we somehow got onto the topic of wifi i think because with his new phone , he has a lot more coverage . for some reason , i thought he was asking me for his wifi password . and on his end , he thought i was asking him for his wifi password . so we both have our phones open and he says , ok , are you ready ? and i go yes ! and start reading out the password to him . he looks at me with a blank stare and he goes . . . why are you reading me the password ? i thought you needed it . so i went , no , i thought you needed it . and he replies , . . . why would i need my own wifi password ? i live here ! then he checks my phone and goes , the wifi password you have written down isn t even the right password . lmaoo . it was a moment of utter hilarity and confusion , lmaoo .","293868":"i usually consult my boyfriend

number of years now . most recently , i bought light bulbs for my himalayan rock salt lamp , string lights for my room , a mini fridge , and a birthday gift for my father .","293883":"i don t think you re an as hole , but you definitely need to talk to them regarding their messages , because they seem as if they re trying to guilt you into dating them again . you have to tell them that their messages of i miss you and similar things aren t going to change the fact that you two broke up , and they re only putting you in an awkward position because you re not getting back together and you re trying to move on with your life .","293884":"i have absolutely zero knowledge on raising children .","293885":"yeah , i still live with my parents for the time being . i used to live with my boyfriend at his father s house , up until his father got a girlfriend and her kids moved into the house too , haha . there wasn t enough room for all of us .","293886":"i clearly meant this side of

different to me than regular headaches , so yes . in addition , those sorts of headaches are basically the fastest ways for me to get a migraine which is an entirely different type of headache on its own .","293889":"i don t know the particular science behind it , no . i m not a scientist or a doctor , lmaoo .","293890":"trial and error , basically . it s happened often enough to where i can pinpoint the cause of the headache .","293891":"no , i ve never had my wisdom teeth taken out before .","293892":"i ve been wanting to get into reading the game of thrones series , but i only read

those years of my life are a blur .","293895":"drinking coffee , no . but i started consuming caffeine far before i began drinking coffee , lol . i used to drink green and black tea every night before i got into drinking coffee . as for smoking , i knew the risks involved prior to starting smoking . i just simply didn t care because i was young and didn t think i would live very long to begin with .","293896":"there s nothing intellectual about addiction . addiction is a health care concern and a disease .","293897":"going to a psychiatrist isn t a one time thing . you re likely going to have to pay that appointment fee every time you return to that doctor , because most doctors won t refill medications until they follow up with you with another appointment . for example , my psychiatrist prescribes me three month supplies of my medications and i see her every three months to refill those scripts .","293898":"at this point , it just keeps me on a baseline . when i m having nicotine withdrawals , i become very irritable , moody yes , even moodier than normal ! , and anxious . that s what happens with addiction , though you don t continue doing the substance because it makes things better for you , you continue doing them because it brings you back to your normal state .","293899":"get back to my high school weight if that s possible , lol . move into a house with my

caffeine isn t really a big deal the only time i experience negative consequences is when i don t have caffeine , then i ll have headaches which may lead to migraines . my addiction to cigarettes , on the other hand , obviously has a lot of negative consequences healthwise . smoking causes a plethora of health problems , including asthma , emphysema , cancer , etc etc . i ve been slowly cutting

government official what exactly a naruto run was . lmaoo .","293905":"i know i ve come to term with that now . for the first few months , though , i was an absolute wreck . especially considering how

reason , because i had to tell my boyfriend s parents . if i was in the accident with everyone else , no one would have known until hours later . honestly , i did struggle with an obviously very mild case of survivor s guilt because i was convinced the accident wouldn t have happened if i didn t insist on them dropping me home first . if they had gone a different route , then nothing would have happened at all .","293908":"yes , i am quite happy with my boyfriend . he s not only a typical boyfriend , he s also my closest friend and largest source of support and encouragement . even after years together , we still find new things to talk and laugh about , even if it s something as simple as discussing how our days went . i can never get tired of talking to him especially because he

entire ordeal . however , when i walked into her office she was very comforting and enthusiastic , and she wanted to meet with me to tell me that my ideas were great and she wanted to offer her feedback . the meeting lasted only like minutes , i think it was just easier for her to talk in person as opposed to sending an email .","293934":"i m convinced that the bathroom at work is haunted

a potential partner , but it also has its dangers as well . people using dating sites should always be vigilant and careful around the people they re planning on meeting .","293948":"sorta , but i have to walk slowly or else i ll stumble around , lmaoo . i don t ever walk text at the same time , though . i like to be aware of my surroundings when i m walking .","293949":"i went to work from am

generally go to places on my own because i would rather have someone to converse with .","293956":"chances to dance , events to dance at , etc etc . i don t go to parties or clubs or anything , so there aren t any opportunities for me to dance anyway .","293957":"no , i started watching it from the very beginning again , and i don t remember how far i got when i watched it previously ! ! i ll catch up soon enough , lol .","293958":"i have seven tattoos don t feel like describing what all of them are . i believe that there s a photo of them somewhere in my top likes , though . as for what they represent , some of them have deep meaning while others are just tattoos i ve always wanted with no real reason behind them .","293959":"no , there s no correlation between the two . also , my gender is non binary . that s not something i m confused about .","293960":"i like all of the colors i ve dyed my hair , just depends on the mood i m in that day . i also modify my body through tattoos .","293961":"thank you , that s really sweet of you .","293962":"i m not obligated to elaborate on my childhood trauma . it isn t something that s up for discussion .","293963":"simply haven t done it yet . i was going to do green after i tired of the blue , but then i saw a photo of red ginger hair that looked appealing so i went for that instead .","293964":"i don t have any childhood memories , and the snippets of memories i do sometimes have aren t happy ones .","293965":"every color except green , basically .","293966":"i ve unfortunately never left the united states . however , i would really love to visit australia , new zealand , spain , italy , england , and the caribbean .","293967":"there s a local mexican food taco restaurant that serves the best tacos and margaritas . i ve been wanting to go back recently , but everyone i know has been so busy .","293968":"window seat ! ! i love looking out the window , and it also makes me feel less claustrophobic .","293969":"i don t really use slang , except for maybe hella , for real , yo , and bugging .","293970":"thrillers , mostly . i also like some fantasy elements as well , like the harry potter and lord of the rings series .","293971":"i wish i had more time to spend with my boyfriend . we only see each other once or maybe twice per week at this point because our schedules conflict so much , and it really sucks .","293972":"by curling into a ball and rolling away .","293973":"i definitely don t see myself living to be that old . however , just to entertain the question , what would matter most to me would be the relationships i maintained over the years , with friends and my partner and possibly family .","293974":"the first time i flew in a plane , i was extremely nervous . i went to austin , texas , with my boyfriend and we had a layover in dallas . the first two flights were terrifying , but by the time we were set to go home , i actually really enjoyed the ride .","293975":"i normally say it s all good to any sort of inconvenience , and i really need to stop . lmao .","293976":"i ve made a few friends , yes ! ! two or three of whom i talk to regularly . they re all extremely passionate about what they enjoy and believe in , they re opinionated and aren t afraid to speak their mind , and they re kind souls .","293977":"i ve been watching its always sunny in philadelphia obsessively lately .","293978":"i went to the hospital two years ago to see my boyfriend , who was in the emergency room after a terrible car accident .","293979":"i mean , if someone s sex is male then they don t have ovaries or a uterus in order to make pregnancy happen . so yeah , that would be accurate to say that people whose sex is male cannot get pregnant . however , i m not exactly an expert or even a novice at biology , especially when it comes to genetics and chromosomes and whatnot . i know there are several different combinations of chromosomes that determine someone s sex , but i don t know those exact combinations .","293980":"my memory is a bit hazy , so i can t really distinguish between different years of my life , especially the earlier years like when i was a pre teen and teenager . i ve become more content with my life as i ve gotten older , though , and i think that largely has to do with the improvement in my mental health .","293981":"not really , no . i don t have any opportunities to dance anyway , which i m perfectly fine with .","293982":"no , i don t really care enough to go online and give a bad review . if i have a bad experience somewhere , i just won t return .","293983":"ralph lauren s polo black cologne reminds me of my boyfriend during our partying phase when we were years old . he wore it all the time , and it smells of endless partying , reckless decisions , living life in the moment , laughter , and nostalgia .","293984":"seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile , especially when he s had a good day at work or at home . relaxing with a cup of coffee no responsibilities , at least for a few hours . having a deep , personal conversation with friends that bring us closer and come to a better understanding of each other .","293985":"corn on the cob , grilled vegetables , etc etc .","293986":"i felt elegant when i went to my cousin s wedding a few weeks ago , haha . i dressed up fairly nicely for it and my makeup was on point . it also helped that my boyfriend dressed super nice and professional as well , we looked great together .","293987":"sorta neutral not too high pitched , but not deep either . it can get raspy at times , and i don t really have much inflection in my voice either so it can sound a bit monotone .","293988":"cut down on smoking cigarettes drinking alcohol for my own health . i used to drink alcohol times per week , and now i only drink maybe once per week instead . i ve also been using my vape more often at work instead of smoking cigarettes .","293989":"my comfort films sweeney todd , heathers , the crow , the punisher , and lord of the rings .","293990":"i went to and bought myself a large iced coffee for making it through the entire workday without leaving early or crying in the bathroom , lol . i wanted to leave early so badly because i was so overwhelmed , but i felt like i had no choice but to stick it through .","293991":"depends on which day i have therapy , which is usually on monday or wednesday . those are generally my busiest days because i go to therapy straight from work i don t usually get home until pm .","293992":"i normally block people if they re repeatedly sending me messages that i m uncomfortable with , i . e . trying to solicit inappropriate conversation or pictures , praising me , being condescending to me , downright trolling me , etc etc . i rarely block people on social media as it is , but it has happened on a few occasions .","293993":"a baseball bat isn t classified as a weapon since it s used for sports , from my understanding . on that note , i don t believe it would be illegal to keep one in your car . if you wrapped spiked around it or put nails in it , then obviously that s hella illegal lol .","293994":"lately , i ve been listening to the soundtracks from the video games destiny , skyrim , and halo . i also like the soundtracks from harry potter the cursed child , game of thrones , and lord of the rings .","293995":"chewing with their mouth open , or talking over other people while they re in the middle of speaking . both of them drive me absolutely up the wall .","293996":"no , that isn t the case . i would be more receptive if that was the case because i m generally open to suggestions . but this , in particular , is coming from a person who doesn t care about anyone besides themselves and is only trying to dictate what i should and should not do because it gives them a sense of control .","293997":"like . . . on a vacation ? ? if that s the case , then you re not obligated , no . as long as you request the time off beforehand whether it s pto , vacation , or unpaid hours then it shouldn t make a difference what you re doing outside of work .","293998":"what s comfortable to me when i sleep really does depend on the particular night , because sometimes it feels better to be in one position , while other nights it feels better in other positions . sometimes i sleep best on my side with one leg up and the other

gs , was pr miscuous and an underage pr stitute , into ddlg , etc . this entire thing is so fucked up , it s like it s straight out of a horror movie . it s so disgusting and disheartening . ugh , that s terrible . people are human beings regardless of what they do , and absolutely nobody with a few exceptions , lol deserves to literally d e because they were into ddlg or did drugs or was involved in s x work , etc etc . people are always so quick to blame the victim , it s disgusting .","294001":"i m not sure if he k lled her because she was a woman or solely because she rejected him . femicide , from my understanding , normally refers to a gender based crime where someone murders or hurts a woman simply because she s a woman .","294002":"you can probably sell them on ebay .","294003":"these days , virtually everything . especially when it comes to people attempting to dictate how i should live my own life , and in general , butting into my business as if they have the authority to control me .","294004":"cheddar sour cream ! !","294005":"lol , no . i don t believe i ve seen that one yet .","294006":"i love both cats and dogs , but i would probably be more apt to adopt a dog first .","294007":"it depends on the day . i don t really text anyone that often these days , i would much rather have a conversation in person as opposed to over text message .","294008":"i would say something positive , i . e . i m grateful that my supervisor is super understanding of my mental health issues and that hr has never given me an issue if i had to call out or leave early due to depression or anxiety .","294009":"i feel a little bit better today compared to last night , although now i m really angry over a conversation i just had with someone , smh .","294010":"no , my house doesn t have any sort of porch .","294011":"i like earth tones navy blue , forest green , mahogany , dark purple , gray , and black .","294012":"these days , not often at all . the last time i went to a party was mid june for a birthday party my coworker threw for her husband , but before that , i really don t remember when the last time i went to a party was .","294013":"a coworker , who i ve never really met before but have talked to through email , was having a conversation with me in the bathroom . and when i told her my name , she exclaimed oh , you re leigh ! she then proceeded to tell me how thorough , efficient and quick of a worker i am , and actually said that she went up to my supervisor last week to compliment my work ethic . that made me smile .","294014":"lol , yes . unfortunately , i am incredibly loud when i sneeze without meaning to , obviously . i try to suppress it when i m at work , though . there s nothing more obnoxious at work than when someone sneezes super loudly and disturbs the peace .","294015":"yes , my best friend and i have actually been friends since we were years old middle school days ! !","294016":"good as hell by lizzo ! ! it s such a feel good song . https www . youtube . com watch ? v smbmeogwsqe","294017":"this picture has always been aesthetically pleasing to me","294018":"interesting initially i responded to this with which messages ? but after thinking about it , i know exactly which messages you re talking about . i won t respond to them anymore from here on out . thanks for the heads up .","294019":"my day yesterday started off fine , but then ended on a somber note . i woke up in the morning and felt motivated to get through the work day , but then as time went on i began to lose that motivation and my anxiety started acting up . i was sad by the time i got home , which turned into depression and feelings of emptiness . i was in bed the entire time i was home from work .","294020":"i wouldn t mind , but it wouldn t do him any good or serve him or myself in any way . i m in a relationship and don t care if other people are attracted to me .","294021":"yeah , i was fairly good at math back in the day . i hated the subject , but i found the concepts easy to grasp .","294022":"no , i spell things correctly regardless of who my audience is .","294023":"no , i don t really do drugs anymore . i smoke marijuana once every few months or so , but that s it .","294024":"yes , i do drink alcohol .","294025":"somewhat , but not really . i still feel totally empty inside , and i know today is going to be a rough day at work for me . when i m feeling like this , i m totally unmotivated and find it difficult to do even the simplest of tasks .","294026":"thank you , i appreciate it .","294027":"no , i just laid in bed and felt completely numb and empty . i couldn t fall asleep until am , so now i m exhausted .","294028":"just a bad mental health day . if something happened , then it would be easier for me to cope with these emotions but since nothing out of the ordinary happened , i don t know how to make things better .","294029":"i m extremely depressed rn and want to do something , but at the same time all i want to do is lay in bed and cry .","294030":"honestly , whenever i go out with a friend at night , i m fearful to a certain degree . my friend is a bit timid she relies on me to fend men away , and i cannot tell you how many times i ve thought is this going to be it ? after politely telling a man that we aren t interested in talking to them . thankfully nothing has gone wrong yet , i ve never been threatened by a man but i think that s also because i m a regular and i know the bartenders are on my side regardless of what happens . but i ve also had men get so angry that they stop drinking their drink and completely leave the bar .","294031":"ugh , i totally agree with you . it s so disgusting how a community like incels even f cking exists in the first place .","294032":"i m delighted grateful to be the recipient of amazing friendships . i was in a crisis last night , and two people i messaged talked me off the ledge . i m eternally grateful for their love and support .","294033":"the sad truth is that she definitely was not the first and definitely will not be the last , and until we collectively as a society begin teaching young boys and men to respect women , the problem is going to progressively get worse . and before anyone comes at me with the whole not all men sh t just because it isn t all men doesn t mean it isn t an enormous problem in society . the society we live in favors men , it s a violent patriarchial beacon of nonsense , and until more people begin accepting that and realizing things need to change , things won t get better . women s lives are constantly at risk just because they exist and it s horrible .","294034":"steph misphire and courtney courrtana are my two closest friends who i met on askfm . i confide in them with my struggles on a fairly regular basis , and i trust them more than i trust most of my irl friends .","294035":"ugh , this sh t makes me physically sick . rest in peace , bianca . this shows that violence against women is still a huge problem . this is why women are forced to be so hypervigilant when virtually doing anything women are taught to be wary , while men aren t taught that their behaviors are wrong . this is why women are still so terrified to say no to men , regardless of what they re saying no to or why they re saying no . it s absolutely despicable and disgusting that this sh t still happens .","294036":"november th .","294037":"uh . . . wut .","294038":"i have work until pm and then i have therapy right afterwards .","294039":"i trust a few people i ve met through askfm , yeah . most of them don t even use this site anymore , lol .","294040":"no , i only trust like four people in my life .","294041":"you could have non anonymously asked someone in private for your answer instead of sending this to multiple people anonymously . that s just asking to instigate sh t , you probably don t even care yourself and just want to satisfy your own curiosity .","294042":"most internships are unpaid , at least from my experience . i did a summer internship when i was still in college and also worked full time to get a paycheck . paid internships do exist , but you really do have to seek them out .","294043":". i rarely , if ever , have sweets .","294044":"tell him to stop . you two aren t together anymore and there s no need for him to be behaving this way . he has to know that what he s saying and doing isn t appropriate anymore .","294045":"yeah , definitely . internships are great for job experience so you can put it on your resume . it s much better to complete an internship as opposed to not doing one at all .","294046":"poetalunam for both .","294047":"sleep it off . i m feeling so isolated right now , and its driving me up the wall . i feel like my friends hate me .","294048":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company . i enjoy it .","294049":"omg , lol . that s both intriguing and terrifying at the same time .","294050":"yeah , but i only add friends .","294051":"roflll . yes , pls ! ! i shall call him carl .","294052":"lol . omg , that s hilarious . i think the funniest part is that the us government and also the british museum are going to have to prepare regardless , because guaranteed there will be some people who actually go through with it .","294053":"a facebook group created an event that s like let s all storm area , they can t get all of us . and i think around million people joined , lmao . it s actually been reported on by news stations , and because there s a date and time on the event , guaranteed the government is going to have to prepare even though the entire thing is obviously a joke . it s hilarious .","294054":"it s a restricted area in nevada i think ? that s controlled by the government . no civilian is even allowed near it .","294055":"waking up in the morning with my boyfriend , having coffee and breakfast outside on the patio , and then taking a drive out east to a brewery or cider house . we would spend a few hours there , perhaps visit some farms , and then come home and have a campfire in the backyard while grilling some burgers .","294056":"so instead of being a mature adult and telling them in confidence , you spread anonymous messages in an effort to start drama . i should probably have expected this at this point , lmao . y all will do anything to start up drama since drama hasn t happened in quite a while .","294057":"why are you concerned with what tal does ? ? she hasn t used askfm in months .","294058":"my day has been fine ! ! i haven t really done much at all except eat breakfast , drink coffee , and run an errand early this morning around am . then i treated myself to an iced coffee and took a nap , haha .","294059":"probably break up with them . that s incredibly controlling behavior and a red flag for potential ab se , and i would never want to be with someone who felt it was appropriate to dictate my life in that manner . also , it clearly means that they have no communication skills and they also don t trust me .","294060":"lol . good luck , friend ! ! may the battle of area be in your favor .","294061":"video game , television , and movie soundtracks ! ! lately , i ve been listening to the soundtracks from the video games halo and skyrim , as well as the game of thrones soundtrack . from past to present skyrim ost https www . youtube . com watch ? v s sti zbg","294062":"dark humor , especially regarding death and some aspects of mental illness as long as it isn t overly disrespectful . i also have been loving these new area memes .","294063":"not very often at all . i honestly can t remember the last time i ate fast food , although lately i ve been craving a spicy chicken sandwich from wendy s . lmaoo .","294064":"all of the happy moments of my life have been vacations i ve gone on with my boyfriend , whether it s also with friends or just the two of us . there was one trip in particular that was really fun we went to montauk , new york , for the weekend with no repertoire and basically spent two days doing whatever we wanted to do . we went to the brewery , cute little restaurants , down to the beach , etc etc . our hotel room had an amazing outdoor patio that overlooked the ocean .","294065":"my favorite way to waste time is browsing the internet answering questions , lmaoo . when i don t have anything to do on the weekends , i normally use the internet on my laptop and listen to music , particularly in the mornings .","294066":"i treated myself to a french vanilla cold brew with soy milk this morning from a new local coffee shop that opened a few months ago . i ve been meaning to check it out , and it s really cute .","294067":"well , obviously both . however , i only really eat food because it s necessary for my survival and there are only maybe two or three foods that i really do enjoy eating . i mostly drink liquids all day long . sleep , on the other hand , is one of my favorite hobbies .","294068":"i absolutely love peaches and raspberries ! ! i probably eat tangerines the most , though . we always have them in the house .","294069":"spinach ! ! i could eat spinach all day , every day .","294070":"celery , yuck .","294071":"yeah , i would say that i m fairly sensitive thanks , bpd . not so much when it comes to strangers , because in those cases i couldn t care any less , but when it comes to my friends and boyfriend , i m very sensitive to their actions and what they say . i have a bad habit of taking what they say rather personally , and then i dwell on it for a long time .","294072":"on the internet , people always assume that i m tall height wise in person , lol . i m actually incredibly short and petite .","294073":"my boyfriend reassuring me when i m feeling down about myself . he has a way of getting through my outer shell and helping me understand how far i ve come over the years , encouraging me to continue pressing forward even when i ve lost hope temporarily .","294074":"surprisingly , yes ! ! i don t put much credence in astrology at all , but i do have to admit that i relate to a lot of traits of scorpios .","294075":"tbh , i would probably be most okay with losing my sense of smell . it doesn t really affect me all that much to begin with , and it would truly be terrible to lose another sense such as hearing because then i wouldn t be able to listen to music anymore .","294076":"coffee , lmaoo . i don t believe i ve ever said no to a cup of coffee , particularly iced coffee .","294077":"happy international non binary day ! !","294078":"sheer fabric is a clothing material that is semi transparent .","294079":"depends on the material of the clothing . some black clothes are solid black and don t show anything , while other black clothes are sheer and you may need to wear something underneath it .","294080":"i knew you meant clothing , i just don t know what you mean by doesn t show much .","294081":"i don t really know what you mean by this .","294082":"my family owned a desktop computer for as long as i can remember . my father is an engineer , so he needed a computer to do work from home at times . i remember being very young and using his computer to play games , lol . i got my own laptop when i was years old .","294083":"probably black , lmaoo . i have a lot of darker colored clothing because i feel they look best on me , like black , navy blue , dark red , gray , dark green , etc etc . i have a few floral and multi colored tops , but those are also darker in color . i only own maybe one or two white shirts .","294084":"my empathetic nature . my ability to see situations from several perspectives . my knowledge of mental health issues and mental illnesses .","294085":"i consider my biggest achievement to be graduating from college . i was struggling with some mental health issues during my college years because i wasn t in treatment , and i was also dealing with a lot of interpersonal conflicts that made it hard to cope . however , i still graduated magna cum laude with my bachelor s degree .","294086":"pine trees , lavender , dragon s blood incense , gasoline , the first smell of crisp winter , freshly cut grass , and firewood .","294087":"there is an idea of a patrick bateman some kind of abstraction . but there is no real me only an entity , something illusory . and though i can hide my cold gaze , and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable . . . i simply am not there . american psycho","294088":"i discovered that the irate man who was causing a scene in the bagel shop who went viral he s basically become a meme at this point is from long island , and i ve been to the bagel shop he was in on multiple occasions . lmaoo . just a stereotypical angry , middle aged white man giving new yorkers a terrible name . what else is new .","294089":"i m only sentimental about pictures and other things that my boyfriend has given me over the years , especially letters . i have all of his letters saved and sitting on my desk in my bedroom , and i read them occasionally when i m having a bad mental health day .","294090":"chester bennington . when i was a teenager , he and his music were sources of solace and comfort , and during times of crisis , he made me feel less alone . rest in peace , buddy . ?","294091":"yes , you can still consider a place your home even if you don t have loved ones living with you . your living space shouldn t be defined by the people in it , you need to create for yourself where you feel most content and comfortable . there are millions of people who live alone and consider their houses apartments their genuine home because they re comfortable there moreso than anywhere else .","294092":"askfm can be improved if they update and fix the reporting blocking system , or at least took people s complaints more seriously . i ve noticed that the moderators of this site end up banning people who didn t do anything wrong , but accounts who harass other users stay active infinitely .","294093":"for me , my favorite comfort food is a delicious burrito bowl , something warm that satisfies me with various flavors and makes me full and content when i m finished . i like carnitas and tofu as my source of protein , and i usually ask for white rice and black beans . sprinkle that with some salsa , guacamole and sour cream , and my heart becomes full . lmao .","294094":"i m not really spiritual anymore , and i was never religious , even though i grew up in a religious household . however , i will say this i place more faith in the earth and science than anything else , and i do feel intimately connected to the earth and the environment . it s inspired me more than anything else .","294095":"if you re going through hell , keep going . i follow that rule religiously because it motivates me to continue trekking onward even when faced with certain obstacles . you won t be able to emerge from the other side if you don t keep progressing forward .","294096":"i thought that by this time in my life , i would have gotten my life together already , lmaoo . i still have a lot of milestones to accomplish and personal struggles to get over , but i suppose that those things are never satisfied regardless of how old you are .","294097":"i ve always felt the most connected to the earth , even though i m actually a water sign . i feel most at peace when i m surrounded by plains and forests and trees in general , and i find enrichment when i sink my feet into the bare earth or sit down in the grass .","294098":"i wish someone taught me that you can still care about someone and understand that you can let them go at the same time because you recognize that your friendship relationship isn t healthy . i ve held onto too many friendships because i thought that because i cared about them , it meant i should continue being their friend , even if the friendship was unhealthy and toxic to my well being . i would constantly put them first before my own needs and they wouldn t put the same effort into the friendship , which made me feel empty and taken advantage of .","294099":"i would much rather spend the rest of my life living in an rv ! ! as long as all of the plumbing and electricity works , lol . idk , i just think it would be wonderful to be able to travel whenever i want and park the rv in various campsites and whatnot . it would be an enlightening experience .","294100":"i never understood why this is something people feel compelled to know .","294101":"why did you ask me the question of the day ? lmaoo . i don t really have the privilege to experience holidays , both in the sense of a national holiday or a vacation . regardless , i wake up around the same time every morning ,

games with my friends .","294104":"i don t answer questions about my sex life . if this is where these questions are headed , you can kindly leave my page .","294105":"i probably could if given no other option . when something that we think is integral to our lives is taken away from us , we as humans naturally adapt to those changes . it would be weird at first to not have the internet to entertain me , but eventually , i would resort back to other hobbies and adjust accordingly .","294106":"this is the same question as what are your hobbies , which i already answered above .","294107":"uh , wut . lmaoo . just because i watch my boyfriend play video games occasionally doesn t mean that he doesn t give me adequate attention . often enough , we play video games together as well , especially when we play halo on split screen . those are always super fun times .","294108":"i used to own tons of band merch , but i ve donated most of them over the years simply because i never wore any of the tee shirts anymore . they were honestly just taking up space in my wardrobe , and although i felt sentimental about them because a lot of them were from concerts and whatnot , they had no real use to me .","294109":"no , i don t like battle royale games like pubg or fortnite or anything like that . i watch my boyfriend play pubg with his friends , though .","294110":"no , haha . children weird me out and i never know how to act around them , what to talk to them about , etc etc . i never had experience dealing with children when i was a teenager or anything , so now as an adult , i really have no idea how to relate to them .","294111":"oh , i forgot destiny in that previous response . i don t normally play video games online , but occasionally i ll play destiny , far cry , gta v , and ultimate chicken horse with my friends .","294112":"i thought you meant as a response to my answer regarding seeing friends as a hobby . regardless , i m not interested in making new friends regardless of who you are .","294113":"my favorite games include skyrim , fallout , assassin s creed syndicate , far cry , the bioshock series , halo , gta v , minecraft , ultimate chicken horse , layers of fear , outlast , life is strange , the wolf among us , and many more .","294114":"obviously not . you re anonymous , you probably live in a different country , and i have no intentions of making new friends .","294115":"my favorite hobbies include writing , reading , painting , photography , playing video games , seeing friends , and sleeping lol .","294116":"ignorance generally means that someone has a lack of knowledge about a particular subject . it s normally accompanied by a refusal to learn new information or that they re steadfast in their ways and habits , to the point where they won t accept outside help .","294117":"thanks for the recommendation ! ! i ll look it up","294118":"i have an array of different , favorite colors , haha . most of them are earth tones , though mahogany , navy blue , forest green , black , and gray . i also like fuschia on occasion .","294119":"you literally asked the question minutes ago . calm down .","294120":"hello do you have a question ? ?","294121":"i don t remember . that was a really long time ago .","294122":"never heard of it before .","294123":". . . wut .","294124":"stranger things binge watching time .","294125":"i have several . girl interrupted by susanna kaysen the gargoyle by andrew davidson the secret history by donna tartt the shining by stephen king american psycho by bret easton ellis i am not a serial killer by dan wells","294126":"degrees fahrenheit , with clear skies .","294127":"first i try to educate , and if they refuse to be educated or acknowledge that they still have much to learn , then i ignore .","294128":"blink your eyes .","294129":"considering i have seven tattoos , i ll have to go with real tattoos .","294130":"it s been good , fairly uneventful . i haven t really done anything besides sleep , drink coffee , eat , and peruse the internet . i ve been trying to take a nap for the past hour , but i can t seem to fall asleep .","294131":"this right here this is so beautiful to me .","294132":"burrito bowls from mexican food places , oh my gosh . i only splurge on them every once in a while , but they re so delicious and a definite comfort food for me . i usually order them with white rice , black beans , chorizo or tofu , mild salsa , cheese , sour cream , and guacamole .","294133":"i used to love that song , lmao . i remember when get low by lil jon came out when i was in like middle school everyone was dancing to it at the school dance . we literally had no idea what it meant back then , i can t believe the administration gave the green light to play the song .","294134":"friendship means that you have a personal connection with another individual , where you love platonically and support each other through both triumphs and struggles . at the same time , the friendship should not be idolized and each person should feel comfortable enough to call attention to toxic or problematic behavior . i don t have a lot of friends , and tbh , i m questioning my friendship with one friend in particular whom i ve known since i was .","294135":"i normally charge my phone overnight even though i know it s probably terrible for battery life , and then again when i get home from work . on the weekends , i don t use my phone very often because i browse social media on my laptop , so i only usually charge it once per day .","294136":"i have an idea for a book that i want to eventually write . it s going to be called revelations and have themes of a biblical nature , as well as mental health , underground crime , social inequality , addiction , and rebirth transformations .","294137":"i m so sorry you re going through this too . it is discouraging , but the best thing to do is keep trying , because if you stop trying then you won t get the help you need and deserve . it s so difficult to find places that take your insurance , but you should also keep in mind that even if a place doesn t take insurance , they may be able to help you on a sliding scale . also , oh jeez your mother . it isn t a scam , it s honestly because mental health isn t taken as seriously as physical health concerns and there s so much misconception revolved around even simpler mental illnesses like depression and anxiety . the same can be said for basically any invisible illness , too .","294138":"i won t lie it was terrible in the beginning , especially considering how i was feeling during that time and how hopeless i felt because none of the medications i tried worked for me . but my former psychiatrist was amazing , she worked with me and saw me every weeks and even gave me her cell phone number to make sure i was okay . you re right , though it s so difficult to find help and support with mental illness , especially when behavioral health care isn t taking seriously with a lot of insurance companies because they re somehow not deemed as necessary medical complaints . it s absolutely absurd .","294139":"lol , no . that s actually pretty invalidating because that person isn t acknowledging your complaints or actually trying to help you . if they genuinely cared , they would listen to you and support you , perhaps offer some advice or solutions , instead of brushing your concerns off by saying others have it worse off than you .","294140":"in the beginning , i was planning on k lling myself . i went to my general practitioner and they prescribed me an antidepressant and gave me a referral to see a psychiatrist that was in my network . i had to call like different places in order to find a psychiatrist who was taking my insurance , and had availability and taking new patients . eventually after about two months or so , i found a psychiatrist in a counseling center who was taking on new patients and who was affordable because she took my insurance . i began seeing her and she diagnosed me with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder after maybe the third visit or so the first visit was really just an intake evaluation . she prescribed me a different antidepressant because the one my general practitioner prescribed me wasn t working . and it just went on from there since that time , i ve tried perhaps different medications to find a combination of meds that work for me . try not to lose hope . it s worth it to seek out help , and it does suck that it takes a while to find someone who suits you . but your health is important .","294141":"i have chronic generalized and social anxiety , so it s pretty much guaranteed that i m always nervous . lmao .","294142":"it annoys me more than anything else when people talk over me when i m in the middle of speaking , or they end up totally ignoring my statement or question begin talking about themselves . i find it to be incredibly rude and disrespectful .","294143":"i don t know if this is considered historical , but i would have loved to attend the woodstock festival in . seeing musicians like jimi hendrix , jefferson airplane , janis joplin , and joe cocker would have been amazing .","294144":"nah , i m not afraid of heights . i think it s awesome when you re high up and looking at things from a different viewpoint . it can be very humbling .","294145":"no , i dislike most online games . the only multiplayer games i play are sometimes destiny , but only when i m in a party with my friends .","294146":"no , not at all . perhaps some people would be happy solely based on their successful career , but there s so much more to life than work . some people don t have jobs but find happiness in their life because of their interests and goals and the people in their lives .","294147":"controlling behavior , i . e . your partner telling you who to be friends with or who not to be friends with . guilt tripping . manipulation or gaslighting . not respecting my boundaries . expressing that my interests or activities are stupid or worthless instead of supporting me .","294148":"continue to be an advocate for mental health awareness and educate others on mental illness so that there s less misconceptions and stigma .","294149":"unless you have so much money to spend that you don t know what to do with it , i don t see why someone would do that . seems like a waste of money , imo . however , other people s lives and how they live them isn t my concern . it ultimately doesn t matter what i think ."}}
