   Someone has just said to me that the laws regarding the law with underage sex is 'irrelevant' unless the age gap is something like a 13 year old with a 25 year old and that the government can't tell people if they can have sex or not at whatever age.. THOUGHTS?!
  ","
  in my state 17 is consensual age for sex. but even if the person is 18 dating a 47 year old  the parents could press chargers on him for ya know.
