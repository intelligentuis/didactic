adorable when he's drunk.\n  ","412134":"\n  i've never had a conversation with them regarding racism, so i honestly don't know. i don't interact with people who are racist, lol.\n  ","412135":"\n  yeah, i know a handful of people who are racist.\n  ","412136":"\n  i usually just wear sneakers.\n  ","412137":"\n  multiple things make a person beautiful in my eyes -- having compassion for others, including animals; being passionate about their hobbies and interests; being goal-oriented and striving towards that ambition; being confident in themselves and expressing their truest selves; being creative and channeling their feelings in productive ways; etc etc.\n  ","412138":"\n  my birthstone is citrine\/topaz and my birth flower is a chrysanthemum.\n  \n  i always thought that

can trust a person if i've been their friend for a period of time and they've proven themselves to be an honest person, i.e. they've never lied to me or sugarcoated the truth, they didn't spread our conversations to other people, they stuck by their word, etc etc.\n  \n  i have a difficult time trusting people as it is, and it does take me a while to warm up to people enough for me to be able to say i trust them and confide in them with my secrets, past, health, etc. i have a small circle and i'm perfectly happy with that.\n  ","412140":"\n  (cont) ...I think one of the reasons I'm like that is my appearance, I know it sounds stupid and you can't even imagine how embarrassed I'm to admit that, I'm \"average\" looking not ugly nor beautiful just..plain. And I think I'm not supposed to look like the way I look despite beauty or ugliness, when I see myself in the mirror it's like I don't know who that is I don't relate to that person, I doubt if that is body-dysmorphia cuz I know I'm normal there's nothing wrong with me physically. Another reason is that i stress too much about what people think of me i care too much about their opinions and image of me, so you probably know that I hate socializing even if I did socialize I'd get anxious because I'd think to myself that I'm below them and not as good. And this resulted in so much bad stuff, I don't have any friends or a social circle cuz I drive people away from me cuz I don't even like myself, I have no idea what I wanna be or who I am or how to act cuz im lost and u don't feel like a whole person. I don't know how long this going to last I looked up how to get over identity crisis and came with nothing... I also have OCD I either do things perfectly or don't do them at all, I guess this is why I'm like that, I wanna be perfect from all aspects or be nothing. I'm gonna go crazy from overthinking, and going to a shrink is not an option unfortunately.. even if I could I wouldn't go cuz I don't want the shrink to judge.. I'm actually sweating I don't want you to judge me either. I don't know if this is one of the reasons but I grew up in a dysfunctional family and I don't feel stable at all I just don't seem to act like a person...please do ignore all of this if you want to\u2661, I know my problems aren't real problems.\n  \n  --\n  \n  i'm sorry you're feeling this way, and your problems *are* real problems in your own life, and that makes them just as valid as anyone else's problems. not knowing your own identity when you're a young adult is extremely common, and you're not alone in the way you feel. transitioning from a teenager to an adult is difficult, but as time goes on, you'll experience more things and get a better feel for who you are and your relation to the rest of the world.\n  \n  your home life could have an effect on the way you're feeling, but i don't know you or your life, so obviously i can't say for certain. either way, what you're feeling is common and normal, and sometimes it's best to take things one step at a time instead of looking at the larger picture. and if you're unhappy with your appearance, perhaps try changing things up a bit -- a haircut or hair color change, different wardrobe, etc etc.\n  \n  if you

me that i did the best i could do (in most cases).\n  \n  sometimes to distract myself, i'll go out with a friend and have a few drinks, where i'll also talk about my day to them and get their input while also catching up on how their life is.\n  ","412146":"\n  yes. when i worked in retail, i was a photo lab supervisor so i delegated tasks to the other employees and had a larger set of responsibilities compared to them, such as keeping track of photo orders, ordering new supplies for the lab, fixing the machines and printers, making customer calls, etc etc.\n  ","412147":"\n  yeah, i worry about my future fairly often. i try to remain focused on the present moment and be mindful of what's happening now, but every now and again, my worries creep into my mind and it's difficult to really shake them.\n  ","412148":"\n  i'm doing quite well, actually. i just got home from work, and i had an extremely productive day. i feel pretty accomplished, which does absolute wonders for my

-- i could eat tacos whenever and wherever, haha. although i never actually purposely ate tacos on tuesday before.\n  \n  the last time i had tacos, it was on a wednesday or thursday (i don't really remember). my friend and i went to grab tacos and margaritas at a local mexican restaurant.\n  ","412150":"\n  nah, i'm not ashamed of any of the video games i play. all of the games i've played in the past have been really interesting, fun, or challenging.\n  ","412151":"\n  yeah, i've been driving since i was 19 years old. i also took driving courses when i was in high school, but i never followed through with getting my license until after my first year of college when i moved back to new york. at that point, i had no choice but to learn how to drive because i would be commuting to school and work every day.\n  ","412152":"\n  the office !! i tried watching the first few episodes and i couldn't get into it at all. i wouldn't go so far as to say that i couldn't stand it, but it definitely wasn't enjoyable to me.\n  ","412153":"\n  i don't feel compelled to see captain marvel, or any of the new marvel films that have come out recently. i do enjoy them if i *do* watch them, like if it's on netflix or my boyfriend wants to see it when it comes out on dvd, but i've never watched a trailer and said that i needed to see that movie.\n  ","412154":"\n  it doesn't really make a difference to me. my boyfriend has had hair as long as past his shoulders, and he's also been bald before. it doesn't phase me.\n  ","412155":"\n  yes, i've reported both accounts and answers (as well as questions in my inbox). i normally do it if they're harassing people i follow or are posting completely inappropriate things. i don't remember if askfm was receptive or not, i never really paid much attention to the outcomes -- however, i have had accounts deleted before because i reported them alongside several other people.\n  \n  as for reporting it to the police ... lol. unless i felt severely threatened and i knew the anon had private information about me, i wouldn't think the police would even care. most of the things on askfm are harmless.\n  ","412156":"\n  i don't have anyone

then.\n  ","412159":"\n  i'm not entirely sure. i don't get bothered by much, and the things that *do* bother me aren't unusual or not shared by plenty of other people.\n  \n  i think what bothers me the most, though, is blatant dishonesty. people who lie either for the sake of lying or they lie through their teeth despite everyone else knowing the truth. there's one person i know who lies constantly just to stay on everyone's \"good side\" and it's ridiculous because i know it's going to bite them in the ass one day.\n  ","412160":"\n  i think it depends on where they're located and the age of the people using them (i.e. whether they're adults only or children can enter them too).\n  \n  there are places, like saunas, in europe where the changing rooms are mixed gender, which makes sense considering how people use saunas, lol. but those are reserved for adults, so that's perfectly fine. everyone knows what the human body looks like.\n  \n  i think it's different when children are involved because you don't want strangers seeing them in that context, so it would make more sense accompanying them to the room that corresponds with their sex.\n  ","412161":"\n  -- yin

great and all, but we *still* don't know what the hell the coins even mean, lol.\n  \n  i can only assume askfm will allow us to trade in coins for things like premium moods, theme colors, etc etc.\n  ","412165":"\n  i agree !! my reasoning is also a bit selfish too because i would hate myself if my own page was filled with answers like \"idk\" or simply \"no,\" LOL. i like my page to be relatively interesting with at least some substance in each answer.\n  ","412166":"\n  this is an interesting question !! i think it depends entirely on the individual who's sending questions out and what they value when they do spams.\n  \n  (in fact, this question may be better geared toward someone who does send out spams.)\n  \n  personally speaking, i wouldn't feel comfortable sending questions out to someone who's openly transphobic, racist, sexist, homophobic, etc etc. i would feel as if i'm endorsing those qualities about that person and it wouldn't sit right with me.\n  ","412167":"\n  LOL. i do the same thing, except i say \"no problem\" instead of \"you're welcome.\"\n  ","412168":"\n  i always enjoy your questions regardless of what the topic is, lol. although i may not have answers to

i was friends with all of my partners prior to getting into relationships with them, so i really don't know what it feels like to be with someone without having that platonic relationship as a foundation, though.\n  \n  like most other relationship values, it depends entirely on the individual. some people want to be friends beforehand, other people don't really care.\n  ","412174":"\n  i post about the same topics on other social media as i do on askfm -- i don't have any theme-oriented blogs or anything, and most of what i post on other apps have to do with either my life or mental health awareness.\n  ","412175":"\n  i don't honestly think i would do anything different -- mainly because that may affect the outcome of other things in my life, and there are a lot of things in my life that i don't want changed.\n  ","412176":"\n  personally, it isn't so much where i am as it is who i'm with. any vacation with my boyfriend is a great vacation regardless of where we go, whether that's out to wine country or upstate new york or out of state. all of the vacations we've taken together have been wonderful.\n  ","412177":"\n  set my alarm and plug in my phone.\n  ","412178":"\n  i like to plan things because it gives me something to look forward to, but most of my \"plans\" are spontaneous, lol. if i'm seeing a friend, we usually decide a few hours beforehand instead of days beforehand.\n  ","412179":"\n  WTH. i just went to insta to search for it, but i guess amid all of the backlash, she deleted it.\n  \n  i think that's ridiculous. the whole \"love thy neighbor\" in reference to people's race, gender, sexual orientation, etc etc. insinuates that we should love people regardless of things that they cannot choose, something that's inherent to them. to class racism with that -- that's a terrible notion to put forth, because racism is a choice, not something we cannot help.\n  \n  i also believe that the word \"cure\" was used wrongly in this context as well, because that also sorta insinuates that these inherent qualities of people is something akin to an illness ... or at least that's the image she's portraying. either way, the entire post was in bad taste.\n  ","412180":"\n  ???\n  \n  mental illness has no correlation with someone's gender. you trolls are something else tonight, lemme tell ya.\n  ","412181":"\n  his tweets are the evidence, lol. i told you verbatim what he said on twitter. regardless, calling out a cis person for pretending to be trans isn't transphobic, nor is it committing \"acts of violence.\" lmfao.\n  \n  you're just trolling at this point, but your attempts were cute. i have no interest in discussing this topic anymore.\n  ","412182":"\n  no, i never have before. it's located in some neighborhood in amityville,

doesn't take a genius to figure out that he was just pretending, especially considering his other perspectives and viewpoints from what i've read on the internet. he literally said \"i identified as a woman while lifting the weight.\" as a result of this statement and corresponding video, he's received tremendous attention and interviews. it's a publicity stunt.\n  ","412185":"\n  you're clearly missing the point i was making. he was never trans to begin with -- he only said he was trans to break the deadlift record, and then said he was cis again immediately thereafter. that isn't transphobic, that's realizing that a cis person pretended to be trans for their own gain.\n  ","412186":"\n  i vaguely remember playing the recorder when i was in elementary school, lol. i don't know why it was such a universal thing to teach children (if they're still doing it, idk), but i always thought it was amusing how it's an experience nearly everyone has.\n  \n  and no, it has served no purpose in my adult life.\n  ","412187":"\n  ???\n  \n  realizing that a cis person isn't trans because they pretended to be trans to surpass a specific goal isn't transphobic.\n  ","412188":"\n  my favorite way of wasting time lately has been social media, unfortunately. however, social media also relaxes me at the end of the day -- it helps me wind down and it's brainless activity, so it allows me to recoup from the mental energy i exerted throughout the day.\n  ","412189":"\n  singing, LOL. i'm absolutely terrible at singing, but it's something  i thoroughly enjoy, especially when i'm driving. it helps with my anxiety a lot as well.\n  ","412190":"\n  for the most part, yes. i have a tendency to suppress my feelings when i know they're not productive to a situation, which usually results in me being completely overwhelmed to the point where one minor thing could set me off.\n  \n  i've been doing a lot better with *not* suppressing my emotions over the past few months or so, but it still happens sometimes, especially when i'm concerned about someone else -- at that point, i don't believe my feelings matter much because i'm so invested in the feelings of the other person.\n  ","412191":"\n  i was nine years old when 9\/11 happened, so i don't remember anything at all. i was probably in school when it happened, though.\n  ","412192":"\n  this is going in a very transphobic direction, so i'mma have to stop you right there.\n  \n  point blank -- if you're trans, you don't magically revert back to being cis within an *extremely* short period of time. he was never trans to begin with, and the fact that he claimed he \"identified\" as a woman just to break a silly record is extremely transphobic and an insult to those who are actually trans.\n  \n  as for the whole anti-woman thing, he's anti-abortion, allegedly believes that people have abortions for \"convenience,\" believes women should do most of the childrearing, and is against planned parenthood. that pretty much tells me all i need to know, haha.\n  ","412193":"\n  i like moderately spicy food -- nothing too hot, though. i enjoy mild sauces but they don't do anything else for me, and i normally order medium sauces.\n  ","412194":"\n  i would rather never eat meat again. i'm not a big fan of meat to begin with, and it would sicken me to only be able to eat meat for the rest of my life.\n  ","412195":"\n  minor changes don't really phase me at all, but more significant changes do intimidate me sometimes. my anxiety tends to skyrocket when big changes are about to occur, whether it's happening in my personal or professional life.\n  \n  regardless, i also welcome those changes because i know that we, as humans, cannot grow or evolve by resisting change. change is necessary for growth.\n  ","412196":"\n  no, i personally wouldn't reach out to them despite having a dream about them. dreams don't necessarily have deeper meanings to them, and just because they appeared in my dream doesn't mean that they should appear in my life again.\n  \n  friendships end for a reason, most of the time. if the friendship was toxic and it ended for good reason, then i would have no reason to invite them back into my life again.\n  ","412197":"\n  i was busy with work until 5:30pm, then i drove home for an hour. tonight, i'm planning on doing some laundry and cleaning a little bit.\n  ","412198":"\n  LOL WHAT. i just had to look this up to see if you were actually telling the truth.\n  \n  regardless, it's ridiculous. you can't briefly identify as trans and then revert back to being cis just to \"prove a point.\" it's an insult to trans people completely. apparently he's very anti-trans and also anti-woman, so that doesn't surprise me after hearing this.\n  ","412199":"\n  i've only ever taken melatonin when i used to have trouble staying asleep at night a few years ago.\n  ","412200":"\n  i have no idea what any of this means, lmao.\n  ","412201":"\n

that's exciting!! good luck to both of you. :'))\n  \n  i don't really have much exciting news. the only thing i can think of is that my supervisor elected me to take over the administration of another program while the initial administrator is out on maternity leave. i thought it was an honor that they chose me for the task, especially considering i was only trained to control programs a few weeks ago and i'm still relatively new at the process.\n  ","412205":"\n  i don't believe everyone has been bullied, no. i also don't believe that if you weren't bullied then you were the bully yourself. some people go through life without having to deal with that sort of thing.\n  \n  although, the two concepts aren't mutually exclusive. sometimes people who bully others are actually bullied themselves as well.\n  ","412206":"\n  i'm not around young people, so i don't personally witness this happening. although when i was in high school, it was often the case between people who would hook up and then try to use that activity against someone else.\n  ","412207":"\n  i don't do anything to safeguard my askfm friends because they don't need any form of protection, haha. i have

few hours before going to bed.\n  ","412210":"\n  depends on what you exactly need help with.\n  ","412211":"\n  askfm is for answering questions, not chatting.\n  ","412212":"\n  it wouldn't

","412224":"\n  in the same vein, i also want to point out that it's never the minor's fault either. a lot of people are quick to say \"yeah but the young girl sought it out or was okay with it\" -- that means absolutely nothing because they've literally been groomed and was raised to believe that this behavior is okay. in addition, it's extremely difficult for a child to have a say in those kinds of \"relationships\" because it's a power trip for the older person and they want complete control.\n  ","412225":"\n  ugh, it's so sad and disgusting. it's definitely a lot more common than people realize. i have zero sympathy for them too, they should ideally be locked up for the rest of their lives so that they don't have the possibility of interacting with children anymore. also, in prison p*dophiles are basically detested by everyone, so if someone were to take the law into their own hands, i wouldn't be opposed to it.\n  ","412226":"\n  no. as my bio indicates, i'm a writer and editor.\n  ","412227":"\n  you can clearly see my hair in my profile picture.\n  ","412228":"\n  i would say that's because you're a normal human being, but considering you're trying to justify p*dophilia, that isn't really the case here.\n  ","412229":"\n  the idea of attraction basically means you desire to have sxxual relations with that person, so they're interconnected. regardless, we were talking about both concepts.\n  ","412230":"\n  LOL.\n  \n  also, those types of therapies are rarely effective to begin with. we should make it impossible for them to be around children in the first place.\n  ","412231":"\n  i agree, it's absolutely ridiculous and disgusting. it only shows how much society has deemed it okay to sxxualize children, to the point where predators believe that they're actually doing no wrong.\n  ","412232":"\n  yeah, they're still minors. they cannot consent to sxxual activity and have no business being with an older individual.\n  ","412233":"\n  saying something as absolute as \"everyone\" is inherently incorrect. not everyone is attracted to someone who's 20 when they're much older than them.\n  \n  you don't have to believe me, but the only person i find attractive is my boyfriend and he's 28 years old.\n  ","412234":"\n  this is indeed true. it's a power trip for the older individual, which is abvsive in nature.\n  ","412235":"\n  you can believe i'm not credible, but that doesn't change my opinion. i have no sympathy for p*dophiles and \"non-offending\" ones are just as disgusting as offending ones, and it's only a matter of time until they act out on their desires.\n  ","412236":"\n  \"it's science sweaty\" -- you can correct my reasoning without insulting me, you know. lmao.\n  \n  this is true, but it still doesn't make it fine for a 40 year old to be attracted to someone who's barely an adult. they're at two completely different stages of their life and if someone who's 40 wants to be in a relationship with someone half their age, then that's a harsh indication of their mindset.\n  ","412237":"\n  definitions are broad & it's still p*dophilic behavior to be attracted to a minor even after they've reached puberty.\n  \n  the fact that you're trying to justify this is a bit scary, not gonna lie.\n  ","412238":"\n  technically it's legal, but it's still a red flag for ab*se. there's no reason for someone who's 40 to be attracted to someone who's barely an adult.\n  ","412239":"\n  you're wrong by definition, lol.\n  ","412240":"\n  this is true too !! it's rude and disrespectful, as well as creepy. i don't know if it's illegal or not, though.\n  ","412241":"\n  you're welcome !!\n  ","412242":"\n  i'm pretty neutral on this question because i believe it could go either way depending on the individual. a lot of proverbs are relatively commonplace and universally known, so it wouldn't really make someone more intelligent for knowing those proverbs or understanding what they mean. at the

even though she's not a minor, it's still p*dophilic in nature considering the large age gap between the girl and the older man. also, you can't tell how old someone is just by looking at them and

similar-aged girls.\n  ","412244":"\n  i think our dreams have the capability of holding meaning, but it isn't always guaranteed. there will be some dreams that are utterly meaningless & other dreams

shouldn't be praised for being lgbtq+ allies.\n  \n  i recently saw a post on facebook questioning whether people should be rewarded for being allies to the lgbtq+ community, and i thought it was ridiculous because you shouldn't be praised for being a normal, decent human being. it's common sense to support people of different genders and s*xual orientations, and to go to far as to induct cis, straight allies into queer ceremonies is pointless.\n  ","412333":"\n  i don't have a full understanding of the trial or details of the case in general, so i can't really make an informed opinion.\n

details of the plot or characters because i want it to remain a secret for the time being. but i eventually need to work out the timeline and character development before i begin working on the

see the age of 90. regardless, i believe my interpersonal relationships are what will matter most to me at that age because life isn't ultimately about work or making money -- it's about the experiences you have with people close to you that make life worth living.\n  ","412336":"\n  i don't think i consider things to be a red flag which other people don't consider at all. most of the red flags i look out for are lying about where they've been or who they're with, hiding their phone from me, witnessing a sudden change in personality or libido that isn't due to life events or medication, etc etc.\n  ","412337":"\n  financial stability, lol. ideally i want to be making more money than i am currently so that i can afford an apartment, at the very least, and be able to further erase more of my debts.\n  ","412338":"\n  their personality, first and foremost. i think people with beautiful personalities are caring, loyal, passionate about their interests, and compassionate toward other people. i think people are beautiful when they have goals that they work towards and are 100 percent themselves regardless of whatever opposition exists.\n  ","412339":"\n  i would leave my life as it currently is. if i were to re-arrange my life or do things differently in the past, i wouldn't know if i would still be in the same position as i am now because of the domino effect. although there are things i would improve in my life now, i'm still fairly happy with the way my life is headed and i wouldn't want to ruin that.\n  ","412340":"\n  i don't really have a diet, lol. i eat what i want to eat within reason, and i don't naturally eat junk food anyway. i also don't drink soda because i don't like soda.\n  ","412341":"\n  my job requires a reason, but they're fairly lenient as long as you're not calling out *too* often (i.e. at least 3 times per month or so).\n  \n  she's lying, at least in my opinion, because she wants to look good in upper management's eyes. she's already the \"favorite\" of the CEO of the company and she doesn't want to ruin that, so she makes up bullsh*t excuses that seem more than valid instead of letting it be known that she's probably calling out just because she doesn't want to be there.\n  ","412342":"\n  chester bennington is my idol. although he passed away, that doesn't take away from the fact that he helped me immensely when i was a teenager when i was going through severe depression.\n  ","412343":"\n  cold, windy day. \u2661\n  ","412344":"\n  pay off all of my debts, buy a house for my

it moved them so much.\n  ","412356":"\n  i'm not entirely sure. i use my phone as my primary means of communication with my boyfriend and my close friends, and i also use it to save doctor appointments, set alarms, pay my bills, etc etc.\n  ","412357":"\n  i tend to be drawn to people with vibrant, bold personalities -- people who aren't afraid to voice their opinions, who hold strong

there was a big issue regarding the work she neglected to complete about a week ago, where she refused to do the longer assignments and only did the shorter ones to the point where my other coworker found things from october in her pile that she never finished.\n  \n  recently, my coworker who lies said that she left work early because her sister's appendix burst and she had to pick up her children from school, or something. however, i didn't believe that at all because of her habit of lying so much (last week, she called out sick because she had \"pink eye,\" but she never went to the

dreams simply because they perhaps couldn't follow through with them themselves.\n  ","412365":"\n  yeah -- me, lol. i dislike shopping, especially if i have to go on the weekend in the middle of the

sent this to me.\n  ","412448":"\n  i think it's wrong for a person to expect someone else to take care of them solely because they're lazy and don't want to work (assuming they're not disabled, at least).\n  \n  however, that honestly only really accounts for a small fraction of people who don't work. there are a lot of barriers to employment, such as difficulty finding positions, lack of transportation, disability, etc etc. also, not everyone *needs* to work either, which is evident in households where one partner may stay home while the other works and makes enough money for the two of them.\n  ","412449":"\n  i'm fine, although i could be better. today was a long day wrought with emotions, and i'm so mentally and physically drained.\n  ","412450":"\n  i've never been served by a

i've learned that it isn't worth it to be afraid to be yourself around other people. individuals who matter to you won't be bothered and will embrace who you are, while those who are bothered don't end up meaning anything to you anyway. i wouldn't want someone in my life who can't handle me for who i actually am.\n  ","412456":"\n  i don't have an alexa, but my father and my boyfriend do. idk what my father has been using it for besides setting alarms and hearing about the weather, but my boyfriend mainly uses it to listen to music.\n  \n  i don't personally want one, even though they're both obsessed with their devices, lol. i don't have a need for something like that.\n  ","412457":"\n  yeah, that's true. it only gets triggered when there's conflict in any of my relationships.

writing prose that i'm happy with, sleeping without an alarm being set, drinking with friends, having a productive day at work, and positive reinforcement.\n  ","412483":"\n  i agree with it somewhat -- it sorta entails the perspective that your thoughts toward yourself are what matter most of all, and if you believe you're attractive and have confidence, then it could take you far.\n  \n  my

it would be alternative rock, since the genre in itself is quite diverse and i listen to it the most out of any genre to begin with.\n  ","412488":"\n  i just want to be able to live independently with my boyfriend and a few pets while maintaining a full time job to keep myself busy. that would probably make me the most happy and free, at this stage of my life. i'm currently tied down to my

day at work and it made me feel great to be able to get as much work done as i did. i haven't felt this sort of motivation in a few weeks. :'))\n  \n  as for tonight, i'm just planning on eating dinner, showering, and watching the staircase on netflix.\n  ","412546":"\n  gas is around $2.50 a gallon around here right now, so it could be better.\n  ","412547":"\n  i still think this is my favorite selfie ever, even though its more than a year old.\n  ","412548":"\n  yeah, that picture in particular was from my phone. however, i also own a DSLR.\n  \n  i never studied photography, it's just a hobby.\n  ","412549":"\n  i really can't think of anything. i would say mountain dew baja blast, but you can still find the bottles in a few stores and you can always get it at taco bell. i miss being able to buy it from my local gas station, but i figure it isn't something i should be drinking anyway, lmao.\n  ","412550":"\n  sorta, haha. my best friend and i insult each other all the time because we're close enough to each other to know that we don't actually mean the insults at all. we're both really sensitive people, so if another friend were to say those things, then we would probably be a bit angry.\n  ","412551":"\n  i don't want to change the world because i don't believe i'm a significant enough of a person to make a substantial difference in this world. i believe the world needs a lot of changes in general, but i have no special skills or attributes that would allow me to make any notable contributions.\n  ","412552":"\n  i didn't even know it was legal to keep venomous pets !! lmao.\n  \n  as long as the owner is super educated about the animal and knows how to handle them, i don't see any problem. it's always going to come with certain risks, but just like any venomous animal handler, there are always precautions to take.\n  ","412553":"\n  this is one of my all time favorites. i took it perhaps 3-4 years ago when i went upstate.\n  ","412554":"\n  i've never lived alone before, so i don't know which one i would prefer. even when i was in college, i had a roommate.\n  \n  i think i wouldn't mind being alone, but i would be lonely and isolated. i would probably work best living with one other person.\n  ","412555":"\n  i'm usually not motivated at all when i'm going through a depressive episode. the only thing that semi-motivates me is the fact that if i don't go to work, i might get fired.\n  ","412556":"\n  aw, i'm happy someone actually remembers that i used to use this dp !! lol. nah, i just wanted a cartoonish one.\n

 you won't really know what you like unless you take chances and experiment. if you're bored of your current job, then you should try to find a new job that seems interesting to you. if it isn't a

and how i met your mother.\n  \n  idk about movies though. i haven't seen a comedy movie in a really long time, lol.\n  ","412571":"\n  ah, your message got cut off. :\/\/\n  \n  but i agree with you -- unfortunately a lot of addicts don't have adequate support both mentally and personally, so it would be difficult to find someone to designate as their child's guardian like that. even so, the idea of refusing someone their necessity to eat because they tested positive for drugs is so extreme.\n  ","412572":"\n  ah, that sucks. :\/\/ it was a great lineup, but honestly, the entire event was ridiculously expensive. it was in brooklyn, so not only did we pay for the concert tickets, but also train tickets and then whatever we paid at the actual show regarding food and drinks.\n  ","412573":"\n  yeah, i would feel more comfortable in a group too. when i travel next year, i'm going to mainly be with my boyfriend, so i'm thankfully not too concerned about getting lost. we always find our way regardless of where we are, lol.\n  ","412574":"\n  i think alabama's food stamp proposal is ableist -- people still deserve to be able to eat regardless of their drug use, it's a necessity and to deny someone their need to eat goes against human rights. in addition, food stamps are also used for children of recipients and it's incredibly wrong to deny those children food too.\n  \n  as for arkansas' proposal, i also think that's a bit ridiculous. sometimes junk food is cheaper than healthier food, and people are allowed to enjoy things instead of being forced to buy certain foods just because they're not in a position where they can't afford to not be on food stamps.\n  \n  being on food stamps doesn't mean you're a lesser individual. and i think it's wild how there's such a stigma against those who need extra help, solely because the standard and cost of living is too high for most people to afford.\n  ","412575":"\n  i've heard the name before, but never looked into what it was. however, i just googled it -- and hOLY CRAP I NEED THIS NOW.\n  ","412576":"\n  ???\n  \n  i honestly think that's pretty ridiculous. people can call their significant others whatever they want, whether it's boyfriend or girlfriend or person or partner or love, etc etc. it isn't immature by any means.\n  ","412577":"\n  i think my biggest concern would be accidentally getting lost and not knowing enough of the language to find my way back to wherever i need to be, haha.\n  \n  although losing my luggage is another concern of mine too. i've thankfully never lost luggage before, but i know it happens often.\n  ","412578":"\n  the last show i went to was a radio station's holiday show called \"not so silent night.\"\n  \n  the artists were AJR, chvrches, mike shinoda, death cab for cutie, florence and the machine, and muse. it was hella fun.\n  ","412579":"\n  unfortunately, i haven't left my country before (although i'll be traveling next year!).\n  \n  i

absolutely love that song. i think it was also one of the first ones i heard from him years ago.\n  \n  btw, my boyfriend said that the watsky show was the best show he's ever been to. he still talks about it, rofl.\n  ","412582":"\n  \"sloppy seconds,\" simply because i have a lot of good memories attached to that song. :'))\n  ","412583":"\n  racism is defined as the discrimination towards oppressed groups based on their racial makeup.\n  ","412584":"\n  i listen to some classical, yeah. most of it is video game soundtracks, though -- like the skyrim soundtrack and the halo soundtracks.\n  ","412585":"\n  lately i've been listening to alternative rock and hip hop !! artists like grandson, matt maeson, two feet, watsky, and grieves.\n  ","412586":"\n  the collection it's

heavy beers to no calorie drinks.\n  \n  gonna try this out tonight -- i love peach flavored things so i hope it's yummy !!\n  ","412589":"\n  awesome !! my favorite short story by stephen king is \"secret window, secret garden.\" they made a movie out of it, but the story is entirely different from the movie.\n  ","412590":"\n  depends on what genres you're into !!\n  \n  i'll always recommend the hobbit by jrr tolkien if you haven't read it already. it's an easy read and it's fantasy, but it's very entertaining and a good introduction to the rest of the lord of the rings books.\n  \n  my all time favorite book is girl interrupted by susanna kaysen, which is also a pretty easy read. it's about a woman's experience with her own mental health as she lives in a psych hospital.\n  \n  stephen king's collections of short stories are great as well. if you're into thrillers, then i recommend the shining or cujo too, they're a bit more detailed than the previous books i mentioned but they keep you on the edge of your seat.\n  ","412591":"\n  i haven't paid attention to snapchat scores in years. i don't even know what mine is.\n  ","412592":"\n  what's dishonorable ??\n  ","412593":"\n  it only equals out to 50 cents per can.\n  ","412594":"\n  like molasses cookies ?? i've never tried them before.\n  ","412595":"\n  call me a stupid hipster idc, i just bought two 6-packs of peach la croix for $6 and it's my favorite flavor & i'm so happy. :'))\n  ","412596":"\n  i think it's sad that dark skinned people feel pressure to lighten their skin because of expectations from society, which is due in part to what i mentioned before about european features being seen as the \"most attractive.\"\n  \n  obviously i'm not going to judge a person for using those products because to each their own, but the reason why they even exist to begin with seems racist to me.\n  ","412597":"\n  do you still have a question then ??\n  ","412598":"\n  no, i don't. not unless i know who they are.\n  ","412599":"\n  why did you copy the question of the day, rofl.\n  \n  regardless -- no, i don't agree with the statement. love can last years, decades even, as long as both people put in the work to allow the relationship to flourish and have effective communication to make things better.\n  \n  if you view your relationship as a habit, then that's an indication that you don't feel as deeply for your partner as you should and perhaps it's time to move on. you shouldn't stay in a relationship for the mere sake of being in a relationship.\n  ","412600":"\n  depends on whether or not the criticism is warranted. if it's warranted or i'm asking for constructive criticism, then i'll take the opinion into consideration because it's always good to view things from a different angle.\n  \n  however, if it isn't warranted, then i usually just ignore it.\n  ","412601":"\n  yeah, most beauty products in particular are catered toward light skinned people. i only know of a small number of companies that actually have a diverse product range for dark skinned people.\n  \n  in addition, society in general views light skinned, european-looking people as more beautiful. there isn't as much representation of dark skinned people as there should be.\n  ","412602":"\n  perhaps !! i mainly find books online based on recommendations and descriptions anyway. i can't remember the last time i went to a bookstore and browsed the aisles, haha.\n  ","412603":"\n  yeah, i recently came to that conclusion about a certain friend of mine. he only reaches out to my boyfriend and i when he needs something and never takes our opinions into consideration when we tell him that we're concerned about something he's doing. regardless of how often we've told him, he never acknowledges that he did something wrong.\n  \n  it's gotten to the point where telling him again isn't going to change anything, so we've been distancing ourselves from him.\n  ","412604":"\n  yeah, that's another reason why i decide not to say anything -- because i don't want them to think i'm just being nosey, haha. although sometimes i'll offer my ear and tell them, \"if you need to talk, my inbox is always open\" just to let them know that i'm thinking about them.\n  ","412605":"\n  yes, all the time !! particularly when i don't talk to a person often but i'm genuinely concerned with how they're doing. sometimes i'll reach out to them on other social media sites if i see that they're doing bad, though.\n  ","412606":"\n  i haven't painted or drawn in a really long time. it also doesn't help that i have no idea where i put my paint or brushes, haha. the last time i painted was a few months ago, it was a silhouette of a tree with a swing and a sunset background. i didn't like the way it turned out, so i never finished it.\n  \n  i think my creativity does play a role in deciding my outfits in particular because i have a good sense of which colors complement each other.\n  ","412607":"\n  i absolutely love personalized questions that pertain to my life -- questions that ask about my relationships, my career path, my former education, my interests and hobbies, etc etc.\n  \n  don't get me wrong, i also love spam questions as well, but it feels nice when someone asks how i'm doing or how my day is going, as well as things personalized to my life in particular.\n  ","412608":"\n  probably cheeseburgers, LOL. i think a lot of people from other countries think of things like cheeseburgers and hot dogs as american cuisine, even though there are a lot of other cuisines which are catered to american tradition while incorporating other cultures.\n  ","412609":"\n  all of the prayer cards i've acquired throughout the years have the most interesting, albeit sad, stories. they're remembrances of loved ones who have passed away and they contain memories of not only who they were as an individual, but the interconnection between everyone who showed up at the funeral services. everyone came together during a difficult time to support each other.\n  ","412610":"\n  i honestly believe it can be both. social media is a wonderful way to connect with like-minded individuals from across the globe and make friends, and it's often a useful means of communication and socialization for those who don't really do well in real life situations.\n  \n  however, at the same time, it has the potential to encourage real life isolation if a person spends *too* much time on social media.\n  ","412611":"\n  i think it ultimately depends on what those views are. if someone is being willingly oppressive toward a group of people, i.e. if they're transphobic, ableist, homophobic, or racist, then i won't feel comfortable being friends with them because it directly discriminates against a group of people.\n  \n  however, if someone has varying political opinions from me, then i don't believe that's a big deal at all.\n  ","412612":"\n  nah, not really. however, i do think that most bits of information can be useful depending on the situation. even random facts about animals (i.e., a fish will only grow as big as the tank its in) can be useful to people who own animals or are in an industry where they deal with animals on a regular basis.\n  ","412613":"\n  i don't really have any \"guilty\" pleasures because i'm generally not ashamed of what i enjoy. however, i can't help but admit that \"thank you, next\" by ariana grande is seriously catchy. it's nowhere close to the type of music i listen to, but i really like it.\n  ","412614":"\n  lestat from the vampire chronicles (both movies & books) smells, in my personal opinion, like worn leather, tobacco, and spices, with a hint of fresh blood.\n  ","412615":"\n  assuming that i can retain my current age while traveling back in time, i think i would want to visit the 1980s or 1990s because of the music. there are so many bands i would have loved to see perform live that don't exist anymore in today's age.\n  ","412616":"\n  well, my day has just started considering i only woke up about an hour ago.\n  \n  however, the best part of yesterday was seeing my boyfriend in the afternoon and evening. i relaxed with a drink, and we were watching funny videos on youtube for about an hour or so before we switched to some music.\n  ","412617":"\n  i've never used a subscription box before, no. however, i have started with their free trials & then canceled the subscription after receiving the box, LOL.\n  \n  my boyfriend has a subscription box to some website, though. i'm not sure what it is, but they send him a box of gadgets and other things relevant to his interests every month for pretty cheap. last month, he got a really nice knife, a monthly planner, a time-turner, and a few other things. when he first started the subscription, they gave him really nice beard oil, brushes, shaving cream, and a razor.\n  ","412618":"\n  i don't watch commercials, so i really have no clue which one would be the best.\n  ","412619":"\n  that's basically what i meant, lol. i didn't mean \"start my life over\" in a literal sense.\n  ","412620":"\n  i'm not sure if it's illegal or not, but why wouldn't you ... ??\n  ","412621":"\n  i have the \"low battery\" emoji -- because i'm in a constant state of exhaustion.\n  ","412622":"\n  as my bio indicates, i'm 27 years old.\n  ","412623":"\n  that's the general plan for the next few years, yes. i want to move down south and start my life over.\n  ","412624":"\n  i've talked to a few people and it isn't a mistake. apparently it has something to do with trump's tax laws from 2018 -- everyone else i know either didn't get much back at all or owes a lot of money to the IRS.\n  ","412625":"\n  i always return to playing skyrim and fallout 4. they're both my all time favorite games.\n  ","412626":"\n  i suppose, LOL. i mean, i'm happy that i didn't end up owing more money than i got refunded. but last year, i got hundreds of dollars. this year ... $18 ?? am i being punk'd ??\n  ","412627":"\n  yeah, that's how it works. i've claimed the same number every year though, so idk why it's different. unless some new tax law passed that i'm unsure of, ugh.\n  ","412628":"\n  i do them myself using the same program i've always used. i haven't changed anything with my withholdings and my income is exactly the same as it was last year.\n  \n  the only difference is the freelance work, but that only deducted less than $100 from my refund, which isn't a big deal. but i owed money to the state, which is why it only equals out to $18 overall.\n  ","412629":"\n  i'm getting $18 back. that's literally it.\n  \n  like ... did something happen this year or am i just really unlucky ??\n  ","412630":"\n  tax season this year is a fucking JOKE. i'm so angry.\n  ","412631":"\n  criminal minds will always be one of my top favorites.\n  ","412632":"\n  these days, yes. i can tell when a person is trying to manipulate me or someone else. however, in the past, i wasn't as cognizant of the concept as much as i am now.\n  ","412633":"\n  you're anonymous and i have no clue who you are. also, sending this out to mass amounts of people may be seen as needy and irritating to some.\n  ","412634":"\n  i've never heard of it before.\n  ","412635":"\n  lmfao since when.\n  ","412636":"\n  i like both of them for different reasons.\n  ","412637":"\n  i'm already grown up and working in my field of study.\n  ","412638":"\n  as my bio indicates, i'm 27 years old.\n  ","412639":"\n  australia, new zealand, england, spain, the caribbean, etc etc. i also want to see alaska and the grand canyon.\n  \n  they all just seem like interesting and diverse places.\n  ","412640":"\n  i don't have an ultimate favorite song, but lately i've been listening to \"beggar's song\" by matt maeson a lot.\n  ","412641":"\n  my strongest fear is my fear of abandonment. i'm always terrified that my boyfriend or close friends are actually fed up with me and will leave.\n  ","412642":"\n  i have a lot of favorite shows -- how i met your mother, parks and rec, criminal minds, ncis, supernatural, the x files, ghost adventures, etc etc.\n  ","412643":"\n  not very late. the latest i'll wake up is around 9am because that's sleeping in for me.\n  ","412644":"\n  thank you -- and i do wish you luck. i'm sure you'll be able to overcome it once you're in a stable position in life.\n  ","412645":"\n  i normally don't have plans on the weekend at all to begin with, besides sometimes seeing my boyfriend when he's not working.\n  \n  normally i just play it by ear, though. a majority of my weekly plans are spontaneous anyway because i can't guarantee i'll be up to seeing people if i make plans in advance.\n  ","412646":"\n  i like saturdays the best. it's the day where i get to sleep in, and i normally don't have much to do except freelance work and laundry. it's also a productive, yet relaxing day, so i feel accomplished while not being stressed out.\n  ","412647":"\n  by friday afternoon, i'm normally mentally fried and physically exhausted. working five days in a row is a lot for me to handle a lot of the time, especially considering my job makes me exert a significant amount of mental energy.\n  ","412648":"\n  my weekends begin on friday night !! although is it technically still a weekend if i work from home on saturdays and sundays ?? lol.\n  ","412649":"\n  over time, i realized that their words don't hold power over me as long as i remember that i'm more than what they think of me. i'm still in an environment where i deal with emotional harassment from time to time, so it isn't something i'm completely over.\n  ","412650":"\n  yeah, i was in the past.\n  ","412651":"\n  i don't care about other people's opinions.\n  ","412652":"\n  sometimes, but i only usually watch docu-series on netflix.\n  ","412653":"\n  depends on *how* social i have to be, lol. i need alone time after spending time with other people, but i'm usually fine if i'm only around 1 or 2 people at the most.\n  \n  however, if by social you mean being around a large crowd of people, then i would rather be alone.\n  ","412654":"\n  i'm listening to the elder scrolls v: skyrim soundtrack because it helps me while i write.\n  \n  as for my job, i'm a writer and editor for a publishing company.\n  ","412655":"\n  hello -- i'm doing well. at the moment, i'm just listening to music and working on some freelance assignments for my job for extra cash.\n  ","412656":"\n  depends on the outfit. sometimes i roll up my jeans to my ankles and wear short boots, while other times i wear long boots over my jeans.\n

of it.\n  ","412659":"\n  because he yells at everyone and insults them. even though it's amusing on television, it would probably be nerve wracking in real life.\n  ","412660":"\n  boots. i don't

morning.\n  ","412662":"\n  i know it's super early (it's not even 9am on the east coast of the united states), but if anyone is awake, i would appreciate your questions !!\n  ","412663":"\n  i'm grateful for my best friend for sticking my me during my lowest points and being a source of unconditional love and support when my mental health was worsening. i'm also proud of her for persisting through her endeavors, both personal and professional, despite enduring several hardships along the way, ranging from chronic illness to death and everything in between. she's always been a source of inspiration for me.\n  ","412664":"\n  i already have a boyfriend, so i'll just list his qualities that i like ;\n  \n  he's passionate about the things he cares about, he's incredibly hard working and will go above and beyond expectations, he's knowledgeable about a variety of things, he's very open and communicates his feelings well, he doesn't sugarcoat the truth and tells you how it is, he's creative and often paints and writes, he has a terrific taste in music, and we have the same sense of humor.\n  ","412665":"\n  i don't believe it's new, nor is it a trend. when it comes to things like abvse or assault, then you should believe the victims -- up until evidence comes out stating otherwise.\n  \n  if there's factual and scientific evidence proving the contrary, then obviously the victim was lying. but when there isn't evidence at all then it's right to think that the victim is telling the truth, especially considering the small fraction of people there are who are lying about abvse.\n  ","412666":"\n  i guess technically yes -- but who cares ?? if you need help with a game, then you have the freedom to look up how to beat it or get an achievement. i've done that with certain things as well.\n  ","412667":"\n  i don't have a photo of that. it was just things like milk, rolls, butter, and coffee creamer.\n  ","412668":"\n  of course -- honestly, he would probably

by case basis.\n  \n\n   @princess_tal\n  \n  also raised a good point about the mentally ill -- mental illness isn't a terminal diagnosis so i don't believe those with just mental illness should qualify for assisted s*icide.\n  ","412676":"\n  i honestly have no idea. i must have been around 12 years old, so perhaps in 2003.\n  ","412677":"\n  no, i haven't used myspace since high school,

stomach ache and a migraine halfway throughout the day, so i ended up sleeping away most of the afternoon to try to ward them off.\n  \n  i have no intentions of going to a party, and honestly, i can't remember the last time i actually did. if anything, i might be relaxing at my boyfriend's house tonight.\n  ","412680":"\n  in the past, i accidentally would refer to people as their wrong pronouns because i simply wasn't aware of the importance of pronouns when i was much younger. in the same vein, i also try to signify the importance of prefixes, especially when speaking with clients. many of the clients who purchase products through my company are doctors, so it's important to be aware of their credentials.\n  \n  as for my own pronouns, i go by they\/them.\n  ","412681":"\n  what does international women's day have to do with this answer ?? rofl.\n  \n  i can appreciate what women have done in society to advance the progression of science, medicine and the arts without being a woman myself.\n  ","412682":"\n  lol, no. i don't feel bad for teenagers who never experienced that.\n  \n  if anything, it's so much easier to listen to music now with all of the various streaming services, like apple music and spotify. and in most cases, it's also easier to find new artists as well. i think technology has really stepped up in terms of that because it's become so much easier to listen to and share music.\n  ","412683":"\n  neither -- i feel like my actual age. when i was younger, i often felt older than my age because i was more mature than my peers. but these days, there isn't really much more maturity i can have considering i'm 27 years old.\n  ","412684":"\n  i've had a stomach ache and migraine all day, even though i felt fine when i woke up this morning. it got worse as time progressed so i ended up trying to sleep it off -- which actually somewhat helped, lol.\n  ","412685":"\n  sometimes, but i try not to regret actions like those. if i'm doing something nice for someone and they don't express gratitude, then that's a reflection of them, not me. the only thing i can do is continue being the best person i can be, and if someone doesn't appreciate that, then they don't deserve to be in my life.\n  ","412686":"\n  pride, i suppose. i completed a batch of new orders at work last week for the first time (i.e. compiling them and sending them all to

halloween.\n  ","412688":"\n  the only museums i know of are in manhattan. i can't remember the last time i went to a museum, though.\n  ","412689":"\n  i'm honestly not sure. it just allowed me to do

basis for comparison, lol. i'm sure it's undoubtedly more expensive in new york, though.\n  ","412692":"\n  i don't personally see the problem with it. my boyfriend and i share the bathroom all the time.\n  \n  however, not everyone is going to obviously feel the same way. and it ultimately depends on each relationship and what works best for them.\n  ","412693":"\n  on askfm in particular, some anons try to convince me that i'm a woman, even though they clearly don't know me at all or have gone through my experiences which have led me to determine that i'm non-binary.\n  \n  it's silly above all else. if i'm steadfast about something regarding myself then an anonymous stranger on the internet isn't going to lead me to believe otherwise.\n  ","412694":"\n  i don't believe my stance will ever change on abortion. people have the right to decide what to do with their own bodies, and they deserve the freedom to choose what they want to do with an unwanted pregnancy.\n  ","412695":"\n  no, not at all. two years ago, i was severely depressed & svicidal, i was stuck in a job that made me cry nearly every day, and i was friends with people who didn't care about the friendship to the

i prefer coke, simply because they have vanilla and cherry flavors, lol. however, i seldom drink soda as it is.\n  ","412703":"\n  this doesn't happen with all girls, and it certainly can happen with

virtually anything. i don't have a mechanical brain like that.\n  ","412723":"\n  the alexa doesn't set your phone. the alexa is its own separate device.\n  \n  but people use it for convenience, it's a lot easier to set verbal reminders, alarms, music settings, news settings, etc etc., as opposed to manually entering it all into a smartphone.\n  ","412724":"\n  i don't sugarcoat things, so if you're looking for someone to cover up the truth just to comfort you, then i'm not the right person for the job. i tell my friends situations as they exactly are, and when their behavior is wrong. i value honesty above all else and i believe people deserve to know the truth regardless of how much it might hurt.\n  ","412725":"\n  no, i don't believe the dog should be euthanized. the child put a sock over his arm and stuck his arm beneath the fence. the dog didn't know that it was a human arm -- to his perspective, it looked exactly like a toy. in addition, the owners said it was his first bite incident, and normally the dog is incredibly docile.\n  \n  you can't blame an animal for acting on its instincts when confronted with a situation like that. it goes along the same lines as knowing not to annoy an animal, and teaching your children not to poke or prod or climb all over an animal.\n  ","412726":"\n  yeah, you can do basically everything an alexa echo can do with a smartphone. on the phone, it's just manual.\n  ","412727":"\n  you can play music, see the weather for the day or upcoming week, have the news read to you, set alarms and reminders, etc etc. i don't have one personally, so i'm not sure what all of the benefits are.\n  ","412728":"\n  i don't encounter artificial intelligence in any aspect of my life, as far as i'm aware.\n  \n  the only thing i can think of is the alexa echo that my boyfriend and i use when i'm at his house. it's convenient because we mostly use it to play music, so we just have to say the song out loud and it'll start playing.\n  ","412729":"\n  there's no show\/movie\/game\/etc etc. out there that's for everyone. people will always have their different interests and standards.\n  ","412730":"\n  no. that seems rather pointless and impossible, at any rate.\n  ","412731":"\n  this is my current dilemma -- i honestly have no clue. if i had a topic to write about, then i would be writing about the topic at this moment. however, after i've written a significant piece, my brain sorta fries out and i develop writer's block again until another idea miraculously comes to me.\n  ","412732":"\n  the year is still fairly young -- we're only two months into the year thus far. i don't know if i've grown particularly in 2019 at all, but i have developed a better handle on my personal and professional lives.\n  ","412733":"\n  i suppose my other biggest source of advocacy is freedom of expression through art, whether that art form is painting, drawing, music, writing, sculpture, etc etc. the arts have been incredibly important to me growing up and i will always invest my time and efforts into making people realize that those are still noble professions to pursue.\n  ","412734":"\n  i thought \"you\" was a compelling, psychological and thrilling show. it certainly isn't for everyone, since i know a few people who didn't like the show at all. however, i liked the mind-twisting aspects of it -- there were points where you began to sympathize with the main character until you snap yourself to reality and realize, \"wait, no. he's the villain here.\"\n  \n  i'm excited for season two, even though i'm fairly certain nobody knows when it's coming out.\n  ","412735":"\n  i believe that may be a large component of it, yes. some people try to move on from previous relationships without completely getting over their ex, which may cause issues when pursuing new relationships. there's this comparison between their ex and their new date, and sometimes people unconsciously judge their new date based on how their ex would behave.\n  ","412736":"\n  i'm an omnivert -- i'm extroverted in low stimulating environments, but introverted in high stimulating environments.\n  \n  i.e. when i'm alone or with one person, i'm more apt to be social, talkative, and open. however, when i'm with a large group of people or in a crowd, then i'm closed off and quiet.\n  ","412737":"\n  i would probably save my laptop. it has all of my work, writing, and photos on it. i would be devastated if i lost everything.\n  ","412738":"\n  your guess is as good as mine, my friend. while i tolerate myself, i don't believe i can genuinely say that i *love* myself.\n  ","412739":"\n  oof, this is a difficult question. my favorite bands constantly change because i go in phases when it comes to music. i would say that my all-time favorite band is linkin park because of their emotional significance to me.\n  \n  however, lately i've also been listening to grandson, two feet, matt maeson, AJR, grieves, and watsky.\n  ","412740":"\n  i don't eat candy except on very rare occasions. i don't really like chocolate very much, and the only candy i may eat are hersheys cookies n' creme bars or twix bars.\n  \n  as for other foods, i don't really eat anything regularly except perhaps oatmeal, which i have about 2-3 times per week in the mornings. i don't get sick of it because it tastes so good, especially in the winter because it's warm.\n  ","412741":"\n  when it comes to simple this v. that questions like those, i'm not overly opinionated, although i do have my preferences. i can understand why people have their preferences as well and it isn't something i've ever caused issues over.\n  \n  for reference, i prefer: dogs, xbox, coffee, and coke.\n  ","412742":"\n  historically speaking, i've been on askfm since 2013 (at least). however, i've only had this particular account for a little over a year.\n  ","412743":"\n  i don't have a single favorite person, but there are quite a few people whose pages i check occasionally to read their answers because i enjoy them that much and want to stay up to date on their lives and thoughts.\n  ","412744":"\n  yes. on previous accounts, i've received warnings on plenty of occasions. my last account prior to this one was banned.\n  ","412745":"\n  no. i have a small full body mirror in the corner of my room, so there's really no space for me to dance in front of it, haha. i also don't dance.\n  ","412746":"\n  there are a lot of components to the company, and i only specialize in a small fragment of it. there are a lot of processes of which i'm unsure, so i'm assuming some of them are automated without human intervention. however, it's a publishing company with a focus on sales, so most of the work is done by real people.\n  ","412747":"\n  these days, i've been listening to a lot of hard rock, hip hop, and low-fi hip hop instrumentals. however, i also enjoy classic rock, nu metal, classical, and the blues.\n

update it with email, mail, and phone revisions or approvals; etc etc. it's generally the major hub where all of the changes are documented so i know at what stage each client is regarding their feature.\n  ","412750":"\n  yes, i work hard at my job. i don't allow myself to get distracted by the internet or my phone (i keep my phone on airplane mode while i'm working, actually). i've always been quick and efficient in my work, and now that i've been promoted to a program administrator, i've been keeping up to date with all of the emails and spreadsheets on a daily basis.\n  ","412751":"\n  my fashion sense is comfortable, for the most part -- hoodies, jeans, and sometimes sneakers. i also occasionally wear more \"chic\" outfits, i.e. oversized sweaters with skinny jeans and boots. during the winter, i'll also wear scarves and beanies.\n  ","412752":"\n  cool ranch, cheddar & sour cream, and salt & vinegar.\n  ","412753":"\n  work where you go above & beyond what is expected of you, to the point where it may possibly exhaust you -- whether that's mentally or physically.\n  ","412754":"\n  no, not that i'm aware of. there are dozens of famous people who are natives to long island (i.e. billy joel) but i don't think anyone is from my hometown.\n  ","412755":"\n  i don't know anything about either of them, so i don't have an answer to this question.\n  ","412756":"\n  i probably would tbh. i can't really imagine the sort of pain people go through when they're giving birth. i suppose it would all depend on whether or not i can handle the contractions.\n  ","412757":"\n  the only times i go out, if i feel like going out at night, is after 8pm. i don't get home from work until 6:30pm anyway.\n  ","412758":"\n  hey -- nothing much. i just got home from work after an extremely busy day, so i'm about to make a cup or coffee (or two, lol) so that i can stay awake late enough for my boyfriend to call me on his break in a few hours.\n  ","412759":"\n  hello -- do you have a question ??\n  ","412760":"\n  i think it's amusing at this point, but it does anger me somewhat when other people suggest that -- as if i haven't tried that method already, lol.\n  ","412761":"\n  it was a few weeks ago. my friend who i usually go out drinking with went out with one of our friends and didn't invite me, but she was sending me snapchats of them hanging out all night.\n  \n  i know it's probably a stupid thing to be jealous over, or to feel left out over, especially because i don't think she intentionally wanted to make me feel that way, but i couldn't help but feel left out.\n  \n  i didn't do anything to deal with it, i just ended up going to bed. lol.\n  ","412762":"\n  i think that's disgusting -- it's fine to have nudist events with solely adults, but to throw children in there alongside the adults is really poor judgment and could lead to dangerous situations, especially with respect to p*dophiles and other offenders.\n  ","412763":"\n  i don't know enough about the situation to really have an opinion on the topic. i know a documentary recently came out regarding this, but i haven't watched it yet.\n  ","412764":"\n

hypervigilant.\n  ","412810":"\n  i don't like the idea of p*rn because of the implications regarding sxx trafficking and the high rate of r*pe that occurs in the sxx industry in general. also, p*rn

immigrated here.\n  ","412993":"\n  no, they're too old at this point, haha. i desperately need new tattoos.\n  ","412994":"\n  i only speak english, and right now, i don't have an interest in learning another language.\n  ","412995":"\n  no, i'm not *that* old, LOL. i learned how to type on a regular computer.\n  ","412996":"\n  i picked up on the habit of typing y'all on the internet, but it isn't something i say IRL, lol.\n  ","412997":"\n  he makes slightly more money than me -- by one dollar, if even that much.\n  ","412998":"\n  i don't think i would want the highest position in my current job because to be in charge of an entire publishing company seems incredibly daunting. i just got a promotion where i'm the sole person in charge of a specific program, so right now, i'm happy with where i am. if there's something else that catches my eye that i would want to pursue, or if another opportunity presents itself to me, then i would also take that into consideration.\n  \n  as for the financial aspect of my job, i don't really think people make a *lot* of money in my field unless they're in some higher-up corporate position, which is why i feel sorta stuck at the moment.\n  ","412999":"\n  honestly, i don't know if i want children. i've never have a parental instinct and i don't know how to behave around children (i.e. i never know what to talk to them about, haha), and it always makes me feel so awkward.\n  \n  if i *did* end up having a child, i don't know if those instincts would miraculously appear. i know it's possible since people form an automatic bond with their children during pregnancy and at birth, but it isn't something guaranteed for me and it scares me sometimes.\n  ","413000":"\n  everyone is \"wife\" material, lol. you don't have to act or behave a certain way in order to be someone's spouse. the only thing you have to do is love someone unconditionally while maintaining consistency in the distribution of household chores and parenting with your spouse, which isn't dependent on gender.\n  ","413001":"\n  i don't generally make new friends. i'm happy with the friends i currently have.\n  ","413002":"\n  that's the opposite of what i just said, but whatever suits your fancy.\n  ","413003":"\n  i don't generally ask people questions. however, you're free to ask me whatever questions you would like within reason.\n  ","413004":"\n  there are no feminists on askfm anymore, lol. regardless, i always took what the former feminists on askfm said into consideration before creating my own opinions, but i didn't allow their opinions to rule my own thoughts. contrary to what you believe, most of my opinions are rooted in some sort of factual basis.\n  ","413005":"\n  if you're asking me to answer sxxual questions, then my answer will always be no.\n  ","413006":"\n  no, but i'm pretty sure drake was on it.\n  ","413007":"\n  this basically defines my entire childhood, haha. nearly everyone i know in my age group watched degrassi. i saw a few episodes when i was younger, but i wasn't obsessed with the show or anything.\n  ","413008":"\n  this is a prime example of the whole \"bashing other people for their opinions because they have inner turmoil\" that i just talked about. instead of criticizing my weight, which has nothing to do with my opinions, perhaps you should take a critical look at yourself and discover why you feel the need to lash out at a stranger anonymously on the internet.\n  ","413009":"\n  no, because my opinions aren't simply opinions -- they're supported by factual evidence from scientists, psychologists, anthropologists, etc etc. if it was simply an opinion and not based in any sort of physical or scientific evidence, then perhaps i would reconsider my opinions. however, that isn't the case when it comes to gender identity.\n  ","413010":"\n  everyone is entitled to their own opinion as long as that opinion doesn't directly discriminate against people for things that are out of their control, such as their race, sex, gender, mental or physical illness, etc etc.\n  \n  it's always wrong to feel the need to *always* be right about certain things because it simply isn't aiding in your personal growth. and if someone feels the need to bash someone else over their personal opinions, then they probably have some sort of inner turmoil that's making them lash out in such a manner.\n  ","413011":"\n  no, it doesn't make me sad at all. most of the time, the people i'm close with on social media have other forms of accounts on other apps, so i end up talking to them or following them on there instead.\n  ","413012":"\n  i wouldn't say that i *love* hummus, but i do enjoy it a lot. i usually have it with baby carrots or pretzels.\n  ","413013":"\n  no, no one is obligated to share all of their thoughts with their partner. everyone is their own individual and they should only share what's comfortable to them, and that ranges depending on how close you are in the relationship. however, if you're afraid to share things with your partner, then that may be a red flag.\n  ","413014":"\n  i'm not a picky eater at all, and i'll eat almost anything as long as it sustains me. sometimes i enjoy trying new food, but i usually stick with what i know.\n  ","413015":"\n  aw, that's perfectly okay !! i hope you feel better ~~\n  ","413016":"\n  it depends on the situation. if i need help with something, then i'll approach the person first so that we can handle the situation together (it mostly occurs during work, though). however, that's pretty much the only time i ever approach people.\n  ","413017":"\n  i know it's super early on the east coast (it's not even 8am where i live, lol), but if anyone is awake -- ask me questions !!\n  \n  i'll be working on some freelance stuff and enjoying the snow fall outside my window, so i'm up for answering nearly anything.\n  ","413018":"\n  people are constantly growing & evolving. it's only natural for them to lose interest in certain hobbies, and even certain people, because it doesn't relate to them the same way as it is when they were younger. it's a natural part of getting older and discovering what you truly like and value.\n  ","413019":"\n  i think schools should focus more on problem students and how to inspire them to work better for themselves, as well as crack down on actual problems in school like drug & substance usage. by focusing on something as mild as vaping, you're minimalizing the other problems at hand.\n  \n  obviously vaping *can* be an issue because of the nicotine involved, but i simply believe that there are more important matters at stake when it comes to middle schools and high schools.\n  ","413020":"\n  i'm never in situations where i'm around people who are just learning how to speak english, and i don't really have the patience to sit down and teach someone how to speak & write in english. i couldn't be an advisor in that field because it simply isn't something i'm interested in.\n  ","413021":"\n  no, i don't think it's creepy in a general sense. however, it depends entirely on what you say & how you say it as well. the way you approach a person could be creepy, even if the words themselves aren't creepy.\n  ","413022":"\n  australia, new zealand, iceland, the UK, spain, the caribbean, and alaska.\n  ","413023":"\n  sounds like anti-vaxx propaganda to relate something they dislike to something else that they dislike in an effort to radicalize their movement.\n  ","413024":"\n  wow, that's going to be a huge loss on their part. even most debit cards have the word \"visa\" written on them to indicate that they can be used as a credit card, so even if someone doesn't have an actual credit card, they probably won't be able to use their debit card either unless they manually put in their PIN number.\n  \n  i think it doesn't matter which way a person pays, as long as they're obviously paying for their purchase and it doesn't get declined.\n  ","413025":"\n  i've used the phrase before, but not in any sort of nefarious or problematic way.\n  \n  the first example that comes to mind would be, \"you're never too old to have cereal for dinner.\" it isn't exactly immature by any means, but it does bring you back to that childlike state, especially if you're doing something like watching cartoons while you eat, lol.\n  ","413026":"\n  this reminds me of the show chalkzone !!\n  \n  i would rather make things into a reality by drawing them. in that case, i would simply draw money for myself. lmao.\n  ","413027":"\n  ahh, this is a hard question. i think i would rather know the cause of death rather than the date. if i knew my date of death, then i would be constantly worried & thinking about it, and i wouldn't be living my life at all.\n  ","413028":"\n  i'm not a parent at all, but i think it's wrong for parents to willingly humiliate their children as a means of discipline. it's extremely childish and demeaning, in my eyes. the child won't grow up to respect you as both a parent and a human being. in order to properly discipline a child, there has to be communication -- not humiliation.\n  \n  i don't really know if it's akin to having a god like complex, but it's definitely an ignorant way to parent a child.\n  ","413029":"\n  getting down to the root of the problem, which is drug trafficking -- police need to crack down on the drugs being distributed in the streets, as well as provide more health care options for addicts who feel like they need help but don't know where to look, or don't have the resources to get treatment. supply and demand is a large component of drug trades, and if there's less demand for the drugs on the street, then dealers will have a hard time maintaining their clientele.\n  ","413030":"\n  i don't know much about the event besides seeing headlines for it on facebook. but victoria's secret is notorious for discriminating again people who aren't conventionally attractive, who aren't thin, and who aren't cisgender (and i think something happened with them regarding POC but i don't remember).\n  \n  it makes sense why they aren't making any money these days. i still buy from the company because i still fit into their clothing, strangely enough, but a lot of people are disgusted by what they represent and don't want to endorse a company like that.\n  ","413031":"\n  yes, they absolutely should. someone's sexual orientation or gender doesn't determine their parenting skill, and children deserve to have loving homes regardless of what their parents are.\n  \n  there are so many inadequate heterosexual homes that foster or adopt children, it doesn't make sense that people who are gay or trans can't adopt as long as they have an adequate home and can provide for the child.\n  ","413032":"\n  i don't talk to people outside of askfm. however, if you have questions, feel free to ask me here.\n  ","413033":"\n  no ?? you're a total stranger, lol.\n  ","413034":"\n  ... are you kidding me ??\n  \n  i think that's ridiculous. smoking a vape is essentially the same thing as smoking a cigarette, and people shouldn't be accommodated that deeply for their vice when they can clearly just go outside for five minutes. smokers aren't given an extra room to smoke in, so why should vapers be treated any differently ??\n  ","413035":"\n  yes, but my instagram is private. i only accept requests from people i know.\n  ","413036":"\n  hell. freaking. yes.\n  ","413037":"\n  thanks, my dude ~~\n  ","413038":"\n  as my bio indicates, i live in new york.\n  ","413039":"\n  i can't sleep -- does anyone have any questions to keep me occupied ??\n  ","413040":"\n  aahh, i'll have to check it out !! thank you.\n  ","413041":"\n  i haven't !! i don't think i was aware that there was a comic.\n  ","413042":"\n\n   @Courrtana\n  \n  , someone is calling you ~~\n  ","413043":"\n  i still have to pay a remaining balance for my doctor's office & i passed the due date by a week, so i'm nervous that they're going to slam interest on the charge because i haven't paid yet. i want to call them tomorrow to see if i can pay over the phone, otherwise they'll just have to wait for a check in the mail.\n  ","413044":"\n  i think we're mutuals, but we don't talk to each other. although i did message\n  \n   @babycadiexo\n  \n  once a few years ago about my diagnosis.\n  ","413045":"\n  i believe it's both. some people in power profit off of the marginalization of others, while other forms of inequality is an inevitable consequence of the way the government works.\n  ","413046":"\n  LOL, definitely not. there's too much inequality in the united states for it to be such a society.\n  ","413047":"\n  realistically, yeah. but there are a lot of people who equate happiness with wealth in a superficial way. however, at the same time, wealth *can* be equated to happiness because a lot of people may be more at ease if they didn't have financial struggles to deal with on a regular basis.\n  ","413048":"\n  the more money you have = the more power you have, in a general sense. or vice versa. people with a lot of power, especially in the corporate and political worlds, have massive amounts of wealth.\n  ","413049":"\n  because they're greedy & ruled by money. a lot of people only see dollar signs instead of focusing their attention on the relationships they create in life, and the power associated with wealth rules them.\n  ","413050":"\n  lol, i wish i was rich.\n  ","413051":"\n  yeah, animals of all species have their own brand of language much like humans express different languages depending on which part of the world they occupy.\n  ","413052":"\n  to an extent, yes. language is a tool used by people of all cultures, and even in animals, to express ideas and further our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. it's also constantly improving and evolving.\n  \n  not to mention the fact that programming language is a technology in itself.\n  ","413053":"\n  i don't remember. i graduated from college six years ago.\n  ","413054":"\n  my bachelor's degree was in communications and professional writing, so i learned grammar & rhetoric in a very intense manner that isn't touched upon in high school, how to communicate effectively within a group via oral communication classes, how to design and format various media with adobe programs, and other things having to do with business communications.\n  \n  i also minored in english literature, so i studied a lot of classic literature and developed a greater understanding of where language comes from and how it's evolved over the years in terms of literary techniques and styles. i also majored in creative writing for one year, so i was taught how to formally structure a paragraph depending on your audience and the 'do's and don'ts' of writing fiction and non-fiction.\n  ","413055":"\n  certain stocks, i would assume. i know absolutely nothing about economics, though.\n  ","413056":"\n  not really, no. i only have a bachelor's degree.\n  ","413057":"\n  love is a feeling of unconditional infatuation with a person, where you tend to care about their well being more than you care about your own at times, and you consistently want what's best for them before your own needs. their existence in your life is meaningful to you & you feel the most like yourself around them, the best version of yourself that you can be.\n  ","413058":"\n  not really, no. our opinions are undoubtedly influenced by those around us, whether it's from our friends and family or the media in general. even if our opinion is truly our own, it was influenced in some way through a particular source which led us to come to that conclusion to begin with.\n  ","413059":"\n  i'm not really sure what my opinion is on this question. even if people of lower financial statuses are taxed at the same percentage as those of higher financial statuses, more money is being taxed from the wealthy because the amount taken out of their wealth will be larger due to the percentage amount.\n  \n  however, at the same time, i also believe that it's important to distinguish the discrepancies between people of higher and lower classes when it comes to taxes, because often those of lower classes cannot afford to get as much tax taken out as they currently do, which further leads to the disconnection between the 99% and the 1%.\n  ","413060":"\n  no, i don't believe it's becoming more difficult. as long as you're fact-checking your sources and reading articles from multiple news publications, then you can get a general idea of current events from a mostly unbiased perspective.\n  ","413061":"\n  i think it all depends on in what context they're mentioning their ex. if they're complaining about the things they used to do or keep comparing their current date to their ex, then it may be an indication that they're still thinking about them or may not be completely over them. however, if they *do* mention that they learned certain things from their previous relationship, it may be seen as a good thing because that's an indication that they have moved on and are willing to open the next chapter of their life.\n  ","413062":"\n  no, not in my opinion. a 17 year old girl is still a minor, and it isn't her fault that she was groomed and taken advantage of by someone 10 years older than her. the adult in this situation should know better than to pursue someone who's a minor, and they're the one at fault for their predatory behavior.\n  ","413063":"\n  yeah, that's aggressive behavior regardless of whether it's verbal or physical.\n  ","413064":"\n  if you're an adult, you're under no obligation to listen to your family in terms of you moving out and leading an independent lifestyle. they're going to have to accept the fact that you're your own person, and you need to live your life according to your own terms.\n  \n  i know it may be difficult to stand up to your family, but you owe it to yourself to move on with your life and start a new chapter.\n  ","413065":"\n  somewhat, yeah. i'm not as interested in world history as i used to be when i was in high school (i took an AP european history course), but it's still something that interests me from time to time. especially the world war II era and other events like the french revolution or the renaissance period.\n  ","413066":"\n  according to google, teenagers are indeed allowed to get botox injections. i'm assuming they would need permission from their parents first, though, considering they're minors.\n  ","413067":"\n  i self-sabotage more than i'm sabotaged by other people, and it mainly has to do with the use of substances, i.e. drugs & alcohol. i don't have much self control, and often it puts me in difficult positions.\n  \n  the last time i suppose i self-sabotaged was a few days ago when i went out to celebrate my promotion. i got really drunk and i don't remember half of the night, which has always been so embarrassing for me. and even though i keep telling myself that i should ease up, i always give in.\n  ","413068":"\n  probably video games, current events, my personal life and career, mental health misconceptions and stigmas, etc etc.\n  \n  i could never videoblog, though. i'm extremely insecure about the way i look when i speak and the way i sound, haha.\n  ","413069":"\n  i would rather be the most intelligent person in the room, but only really if that meant that you weren't intelligent if you were the funniest person. i value intelligence and education highly, and while it's wonderful to have a sense of humor, you can only go so far with humor in terms of interpersonal relationships.\n  ","413070":"\n  i'm wonderful at writing, but that's basically my only talent. i can express myself well via the written word, and it has always come naturally to me.\n  ","413071":"\n  even though you mentioned gomez & morticia addams already, i'm going to have to repeat that because they're my all-time *favorite* fictional couple !!\n  \n  their love is so surreal, intimate, and real. i've always admired the connection they had, as well as the darkness associated with them, because it very much reminds me of my relationship with my boyfriend (lol).\n  ","413072":"\n  something that can always make my day better is a phonecall from my boyfriend, particularly when he has great news or had a wonderful day at work. it instantly raises my mood when i know that he's in a good place.\n  ","413073":"\n  no, i believe that's completely unfair. however, i'm fairly certain that's how the united states is currently being run, which is disappointing.\n  ","413074":"\n  i would prefer my current boyfriend to be my future spouse, lol.\n  ","413075":"\n  i'm doing well -- i just got home from work, which was very productive because i managed to finished all of the tasks i laid out for myself last night & then worked on completing more of a spreadsheet for the program i'm administrating.\n  \n  after work, i stopped by dunkin and picked up an iced coffee (even though it's freezing outside, lol), and now i'm just sitting down and relaxing at home. i may go back out and run some errands tonight in light of whatever snowstorm is supposed to happen this weekend, but it isn't a priority.\n  ","413076":"\n  someone else's eating habits don't matter much to me, as long as they're not completely unhealthy to the point where it's damaging to their body. i want what's best for them and their health, so if i see that they're eating junk food and other unhealthy items *all* the time, then i would perhaps raise the concern of what it's doing to their body.\n  ","413077":"\n  it appears to be that way, sure. i don't know much about plutocracy besides it's basic definition (\"government controlled by the wealthy\"), but much of the u.s. government is controlled by those who amass great amounts of wealth.\n  ","413078":"\n  pinot grigio wine, fat tire beer, or spiced rum mixed with dr. pepper.\n  \n  i also enjoy blue hawaiian mixed drinks on occasion.\n  ","413079":"\n  \u2727 i am not a serial killer\n  \n  \u2727 heathers\n  \n  \u2727 the punisher\n  \n  \u2727 the craft\n  \n  \u2727 v for vendetta\n  \n  \u2727 girl

everyone is in a rush these days and she isn't different or special because she also has somewhere to be. she should have managed her time better.\n  ","413092":"\n  you would have to google this, i don't personally know the answer to this. i could imagine it being incredibly difficult to get permission to publish fanfiction, though. that's basically their brand on the line and there will

is why i responded to the initial message.\n  ","413096":"\n  there's nothing wrong with putting off certain milestones when you know you're not ready for them yet. there isn't so much pressure on young people to get married and start a family by a certain age anymore. society has learned that there is so much more to life than marriage and children.\n  ","413097":"\n  probably because they're seeking an education, not a life partner.\n  ","413098":"\n  ideally, sure. but it's impossible to really make that into a law because it's difficult to monitor.\n  ","413099":"\n  no, my boyfriend

anxious and overwhelmed mess rn, but i'm hoping sleep will help with that since i'm debating on going to bed super early tonight.\n  ","413101":"\n  no, being \"gay\" for someone is generally used as a term to mean idolizing or just being obsessed with them in general. it doesn't have an automatic sexual undertone to it unless you make it that way.\n  \n  having the \"hots\" for someone, on the other hand, *is* a sexualized term. lol i can't believe i have to explain this lingo, usually it's the other way around for me.\n  ","413102":"\n  i think the song is catchy, but i don't really like
