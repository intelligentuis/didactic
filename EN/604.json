I would throw up constantly and i had np idea why and neither did the doctors. It was because i was in a high stress environment and was going through trauma all over again. I had serious moments where i wanted to die. I couldnt committ suicide though, i needed someone to kill me. But i kept fighting, i kept telling myself \"you are meant to be here, its not your fault. You are brave, you are strong, you are smart. Keep fighting, you dont want to die.\" But i know a lot of people who would have ended it all if they went through 5% of the shit i went through in the last 5 years.
