also feel that the other person can lose feelings and the love for you so it fades away and can t remain in existence . i honestly don t know what to believe but i feel more towards that love can t remain because it fades away once you part ways with your significant other or partner . and you lose feelings and the love you had for them . and love is very painful and difficult to deal with it . there s lot of issues with love and most people don t know how to deal with or they just play and hurt the other ones feelings . love is definitely a suffering painful emotion and i don t believe in it anymore at least for now until maybe i find the right one someday but until then i just don t believe in it anymore .","842392":"no i don t remember","842393":"i mean i don t really like him

re having a good day !","842415":"i made carbonara my favorite pasta dish .","842416":"it s on hulu ! it s really good actually","842417":"i usually prefer doors but i also like door","842418":"i don t usually wake up in the middle of the night because i go to bed when i m really sleepy so in that way i could just sleep without waking up . but if that does happen i usually go on my phone and wait until i get sleepy again .","842419":"when you mention light i think of the sun and blue sky on a nice sunny and bright day in the daytime and i think of someone who is happy and very positive and just has a overall positive outlook on life and someone who likes spreading love and happiness wherever they go . when you mention dark i think of the dark pitch black sky and i think of people who are dark in a negative way like serial killers , stalkers , people who are obsessed with other people negatively , the world we live in today , my mind , other people who cause harm to others just because they get off on it or because they ve lost their minds etc . i also believe the mind is more complex than our visual senses . the mind is a very complex place and i don t think anyone can truly ever really understand it .","842420":"i m not very stressed at all this week surprisingly because i always am lol but thank you girl ! same to you","842421":"my favorite color is blue and pink lol . using blue to describe me big hearted , loyal , understanding , eager . using pink to describe me playful , idealistic , nice and kind lmao","842422":"the same old . what about you ?","842423":"sounds good anon","842424":"you too anon !","842425":"not really actually","842426":"that s how it was with my ex when we dated shortly again in it was definitely one sided and i felt it but yet i still went along with it . i don t know why . but if you feel that way i would tell you honestly to just walk away because you absolutely deserve better then a one sided relationship . you deserve someone who loves you just as much as you love them . so you should definitely walk away .","842427":"yay ?","842428":"lol no","842429":"thank you !","842430":"well i don t think jealously is a good thing even in a healthy relationship because it can lead to obsession and that can become very dark and scary so i believe jealousy isn t a good thing at all even in a relationship that s healthy . jealousy comes from someone wanting to be like another person or wanting what they have and your brain tells you that you want to be like that person and it creates an emotion called jealousy and it s a very dangerous emotion in my opinion .","842431":"many many things tbh","842432":"i ignore you anon ?","842433":"of course","842434":"it s not actually . i just love him as a best friend and so i m showing that off .","842435":"lol alrighty then","842436":"yeah , definitely","842437":"oh my i m still awake","842438":"my friendship with my best friend ?","842439":"sleeping lol","842440":"because i want to go and try zumbo s desserts","842441":"get a room ? lolllll","842442":"well i feel like a man is more mature and has experienced a lot more then a boy has . a man has been through a lot emotionally and physically and a boy hasn t experienced that much and they aren t mature enough for serious relationships and commitment whereas a man is mature enough for a serious relationship and the issues that come from it .","842443":"nopeee","842444":"many things tbh","842445":"yes","842446":"meeting edraegen","842447":"i don t actually","842448":"watching criminal minds","842449":"i ve always wanted to . and i know it s very devastating","842450":"i mean if you re friends with someone there shouldn t be anything off limits . that is if you re really close with that person .","842451":"can i help you ?","842452":"of course i have !","842453":"it s on september th","842454":"i love sunsets","842455":"i m lol","842456":"it s all good","842457":"not really , i don t","842458":"indeed","842459":"honestly no i don t think so . it takes time for you to get someone s heart or vise versa . there s no shortcut . once you get to know them more you can tell that you ve won over their heart but that definitely takes time .","842460":"hmm i d rather not","842461":"sure !","842462":"i have been called that lol","842463":"i do","842464":"selfies and social media","842465":"i m","842466":"nope lol","842467":"i m from california","842468":"that s not a nickname lol","842469":"nikki is the most used one","842470":"no i don t","842471":"it s actually pretty good !","842472":"thank you v much !","842473":"put to rest what you thought of me while i clean this slate with hands of uncertainty","842474":"do you feel cold and lost in desperation","842475":"and in the burst of light that blinded every angel as if the sky had blown the heavens into stars you felt the gravity of temper grace falling into empty space no one there to catch you in their arms","842476":"sometimes both actually","842477":"what ?","842478":"no not really but i end up giving people a thousand chances when they don t deserve it . once they do something they will do it again . it happens every time . trust me i would know .","842479":"meeting you","842480":"honestly just talking to edraegen is something good that happened today","842481":"edraegen","842482":"how do

know that ghosts are real . for example chester s ghost is always around us all and he s spirit will always be here among us .","842508":"nope i couldn t","842509":"actually i don t so","842510":"yes , i think men can be friends with women even if they re in a relationship . i mean if you trust them you shouldn t worry about it because you know that they wouldn t betray you or lie to you so yes i absolutely think it s okay for men to be friends with women when they re in a relationship .","842511":"i don t care about them","842512":"edraegen","842513":"it s okay , i guess really nothing
