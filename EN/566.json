We technically arent all equal. some people are smarter, faster, taller, funnier, artistic, musician, ect.. we all want different things cause we are all different people but we all have a role to play.

Dont assume their end game is anything good and something you want to be apart of unless you want to be soulless. They benefit from the masses being dumb. They benefit from destruction cause it doesn\u2019t do anything but create more power for them.\n  ","608377":"\n  Yeah because my parents are jewish when it comes to their money lol but when I really need something they get it but they threw too much at me when i was younger that i ended up just being an idiot with my money. I have financial issues like just me like IM bad with money but my parents will keep supplying it to a certain degree because im fucking terrible at it lol\n  ","608378":"\n  Sadly, no matter how many times i asked they would never tell me whats their goal.. i think its one of those things you kinda have to be in club to know about the club. You know like fight club ??\n  \n  Its ultimate control but ive been trying to piece together for what personally as well. I was even loaned their book that was written in 1776. My god. Its a scary cult lol but it doesn\u2019t explain exactly what their goal is..\n  ","608379":"\n  No way ?\n  ","608380":"\n  I used to be, im not anymore ?\n  ","608381":"\n  Goddamnit you\u2019re right!\n  ","608382":"\n  For you to come sweep me off my feet \u2728\n  ","608383":"\n  You are so sweet omfg ?\n  ","608384":"\n  Wait, you dont think its real? When they have Free Mason temples all over America? When theres records of them starting it in France way before 1776?\n  \n  Illuminati is just a code name for free masons.. its a certain level of them. All the presidents are in it.. Big Pharma, Corporations, the music industry, the movie industry ect.. like literally everything you see is run by them. ive met a bunch of them which is making me start to question if my parents are in it cause now im realizing they were all my parents friends they brought over..... weird. ?\n  ","608385":"\n  Why do you think that?\n  ","608386":"\n  Ugh, i hate this question cause like im a spoiled brat.

But i assumed just the bites and pieces i say about my life, youd all get the picture ?\n  ","608387":"\n  I think you need a little bit of both to be able handle problem solving. Life is just a series of constant problems that need to solved so intelligent people are able to problem solve quickly and comprehensively.\n  \n  I believe in balance. I dont believe you should measure someone\u2019s intelligence based on their tests scores but i do believe a good education as your foundation. I also don\u2019t believe that one can learn everything just from the street either though because the streets are dark and all about survival. But I believe you need to be exposed to the world you live in and see it for yourself. Feel it for yourself. You will never learn about the world by just reading textbooks. Knowledge comes from being open-minded in all aspects of life. Knowledge comes from comprehending key words and context clues of our society and taking off the color glasses. Knowledge comes from understanding that you should never stop learning and to never stop learning means never stop growing and expanding the mind.\n  ","608388":"\n  Hes a patent attorney.\n  \n  But he does other stuff on the side that have to do with biochemistry, chemistry, astrophysics ect.. pretty much anything to do with science and life.\n  ","608389":"\n  She would murder me for chicken wings. Cats usually dont eat all frantically but as soon as i put a piece of chicken in her bowl for her, it\u2019s already gone..\n  \n  she can smell when i have cheesecake before i even bring it in the house. She just meows nonstop until i give her some.\n  \n  McDonald\u2019s french fries are dangerous to being near her too. She will not let you eat until you give her a tiny piece of fry..\n  \n  god i own a spoiled brat ?\n  ","608390":"\n  If my burps came out as pretty bubbles i would be so happy ?\n  "}}
