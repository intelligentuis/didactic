yes . but i don t really mind talking about any of them . but some people may have went through way worse things than some of us . some people have been raped , abused , practically killed , tortured , etc . . . you just don t know . . . but it definitely depends on how they re going about the situation . because i mean anything could happen . what you re saying has different ways that it could go . but some people just might not be comfortable with talking about it . but definitely just don t assume too much . assuming too much in a relationship can ruin a relationship . there should just be constant communication and trust . maybe ask them what s the reason why they don t want to talk about it . is it because they re uncomfortable ? or is it because maybe they still like them ? i mean . . . it s okay if it s still like them . because that person might have been in a really good relationship with them and the other person just might have threw them out or something ? really sad . . but they don t need to be thinking about them fully like that anymore , they need to be moving on . especially if they re in another relationship with you . i could see why you could be discouraged . best of luck .","41507":"no . . ?
