, calling one another , texting , skyping , whatever ! we are together . we always want to know what the other one is doing in a good way because it just simply infatuates us . we never leave a day untouched without including one another in it . everything i ve ever done he just thinks is beautiful , everything , in every way . and everything he does is just great ! and is the greatest ! he s just so smart ! it s crazy ! i love it ! he s handsome as hell and strong ! he s literally my everything , my best friend . he says i m the only person that understands him truly . we just understand one another fully , honestly . we have been together for five years almost and i don t regret a single day being with him . he s the best person in the world to me . he is kind to me . he knows good people . he takes care of me . i care for him . protects me and wants the best for me . i don t think i could honestly picture a day without him and without him i don t know what i would really do .

able to get their groceries . how did i know it was for them ? because when they went to get their money they said that they had and that it was gone . they knew nothing about the hundred that i found . so obviously it must ve been for them and it happened right after i found the hundred . so i went back to the lost and found and i gave it to them .","53656":"i mean they the questions could be anything . anything to what they like ? or to what they like to do maybe ? their favorite things ? what s their hobbies ? biggest fears ? what they can t stand ? you can ask him anything almost . the problem is when asking questions , you don t wanna get too detailed with the questions . people get personal and nosy . you don t want to ask the person like . . . for example . . what street do they live on in the state that they live in ? or you don t ask them where they live in the intentions of going there . unless of course it is consented by that person , and that it is ok for you to go to that location . there s nothing wrong with someone being interested in another person , but before you actually let it be known , check out the person s profile , their bios and just find out more information before asking questions , look at the basics . people forget these extra things that are there . they tend to not care , are lazy , don t look and so forth . when someone obviously looks like they are in a relationship or are married , don t interrogate them with questions and intention of being interested in them . does that make any sense ? just common courtesy . i m not talking
