out of the water as fast as i could . that s why so many people don t like to go swimming because their parents make things like that happen to them . they should have been right next to him and he should have have floaties on and he should not have been anywhere near the three or four feet area . the little boy was literally maybe three . you may be ft tall if that . it really angered me and i

you have experience and research to actually figure out what is going on in the certain location that you re in . it s not easy and it s not always what it really could be but you trying to use all of the theory and facts that you have researched to break down what you are experiencing and seeing . it takes lots of investigating and figuring out but like i said you really have to know what you re talkin about and know what you re doing today was actually tell what you re dealing with in a home . because there are many different levels of the paranormal . i mean many different . some things are really evil some things are just spirits that passed on and are stuck and some sort of a ghost loop . sometimes it s just a really angry spirit that is seeking revenge or is in denial of their death . or they don t even know their dad . some people die unexpectedly and quick and don t even realize that they re dead . and sometimes they need help moving on . those are the really sad stories . but i have dealt with really good cases and i have dealt with really evil and scary cases . cases better unsolved and can t help the people . those are the ones that are hard to walk away from . but like i said it just all depends on what you re dealing with . i have been doing paranormal research is for almost years now . i have dealt with so many different types of cases it s crazy . interesting . intriguing . and just different . i tried to answer any questions that people have .","25022":"i just wanted to make sure all of you know how much i love all of you ! and appreciate all of your

word . . . then say . . . all the sudden you get a phone call you go ahead and do their speaker installations and make it really cool and give them a card and have them spread the word out and maybe give them a discount to just spread the word for you you start your business out cheap at first and try to brag and show your experience as much as possible and show that you really can get the job done . you really have to know what you re doing now if you re going to get a little arrogant about it because that s the whole point you re supposed to seem like you really know what you re doing because you do . so you won t be able to see your work so they can spread the word because if your work is really good they will do that .","25155":"yessss . love my mom . i m not sure exactly what i

pizza with stuffed crust thin crust in the middle","25179":"kool and different types of researches .","25180":"yeah ? i bet . pets are a blessing .","25181":"why do you mean what s my favorite casserole to make ? or something ? i m not really understanding the question sorry . but i will answer it with that . my most favorite casserole to make would have to be either a cabbage casserole . a tater tot casserole . frito casserole . and more . i like to make those .","25182":"oh okay . very good . srry .","25183":"no . not really .","25184":"followed you back ! thank you so much for the

they demanded and they re not going to get it . they most definitely have to earn it . or just be nice in general . even if you haven t earned my respect if you re just nice i will talk to you like a person and with respect . if you think about it being nice is respect","25195":"spicy . i like spicy stuffs .","25196":"my samsung maybe ? i m not sure all i know is it was old","25197":"hello . i am

get what i need done regardless . thanks for caring because i absolutely it s stupid that people are like that and it s totally uncalled for . but that s just how some people are down here and it s ridiculous","25199":"the bad part was it was the manager that was treating it that way . it s sad when they put people like that in charge . i should have actually really nice and we knew her really well but something just made her change and we don t know why people lie . and they believe people that lie","25200":"yeah there are two or three different people on here that have made thousands of accounts and they continue to do it today . just to talk b races and more . people are really strange and have nothing else better to do with their lives . and yes i agree i wish the site would be a little bit more lenient with banning people permanently by their ip if they re going to continue to do these types of things . especially scams and continuous harassing trolls","25201":"considering i don t live near them i still try my best to text or call and tell them i love them and check in with them","25202":"twice a day . i just got done brushing actually a few minutes ago considering it s in the morning and i m about to go to work","25203":"the only reason why they re treating us like that is because one time i came in and their computers messed up and technically took the money off our card for the groceries that we had but they wouldn t give us our stuff because they re saying it didn t go through properly or something ? even though the money left the card and said that we paid for the stuff . that infuriated me because we actually needed food in the house and they would not let us get it . so now every time i come in it seems like they remember us and want to be rude to us still even though their machines messed up . that wasn t the first time that has happened to me . one time they charged to my card when i was trying to buy one belt that costed maybe dollars . . . and then i had to sit around for almost an hour trying to give my money back and they gave ot back to me in cash and i was actually on vacation out of town . absolutely ridiculous . and then they want to treat me bad after they messed up ? it just doesn t make any sense . this was walmart by the way . they always seem to mess everything up . i can t stand that store . every time i go and they want to do something to us to accuse everyone else but not themselves .","25204":"whenever i have time and money .","25205":"yes and no . they didn t apologize . and i wasn t even stealing . i was trying to find a toy for a little girl turning . it was for a party . and idk why they kept sending people over to our lanes to look . maybe it was for someone else ? ? idk but all i can say is i reeally dought that i am gonna steal a dollar play doh set . . . people just think they can do whatever they want and thibk it s necessary . it really made me mad tbh . my conscience is way too much . i would feel like sh until i returned it or paid for it . so i couldn t steal . my conscience would eat me alive . and no . they didn t apologize . they think they are the best for being like that . a shame . should be ashamed of themselves and go actually worry about people that are really causing problems .","25206":"i don t . i like my height . would be strange if i was taller . haha .","25207":"pretty chill and happy this morning . i got to see another day so yeah . everyday that i get to wake up to another day is always a good day .","25208":"o . o","25209":"i m doing great how about you i m about

i didn t live with another person i would have took all of them and probably would have raised him a little bit and just gave them away because they were giving them away for free but they were neglecting them and i don t think they re going to make it if they didn t give them away soon . they had fleas all over them they had wounds all over them they were shaking cold they look really hungry and they were just terrified . i felt really bad i wanted to take a little boy and a little girl home but i just don t have room for them","25222":"yeah . i hear ya there . i like both dogs and

which i have already done before it literally kills my battery within an hour or so . not good for my phone and also i need my phone some days out of the week hours a day because i am at work and i have to call certain people . so yeah this is the only reason why my notifications are not all on . some on this app are","25227":"i spent today with jason on his birthday . we had alot of fun . good day . but today we woke up we went to one of our favorite places to shop and then we went out to eat and he had tons of surprises there he got presents he got a few gifts prior to the weeks of his

to them . they apologize though . i think they realize that they really messed up and didn t understand what they were doing . and they didn t like beat me up they just hit me once . they were trying to joke around and make it seem like they were going to hit me and they accidentally did . but it still doesn t make any sense . you could literally be doing absolutely nothing wrong to somebody and get attacked the only reason why i didn t do anything back to them is because i thought they were crazy for randomly attacking so i was thought to myself get away from them because maybe they re insane and they just might not have anything to live for . there are certain people you just do not react to and you get away from . it was a guy and in that instance i just wanted to get away from him because i was totally caught off guard . was totally confused to why he attacked me for no reason and i didn t even know him . it just goes to show you how i m saying this world really is . this was a really long time ago . this was like years ago .","25260":"i prefer walking into a cold room when it is scorching hot outside . i like the heat when it s cold too but i actually love the cold

and cheap hobbies to get into by the way love painting things for people because then in the end there smiling in are happy because i painted something for them and i work so hard on it and did my best . and then again same with cooking . you sit there and perfect a recipe and or a dish and then you let someone try it that doesn t even like the food that you cook like the type . no you you and your food . doesn t like the kind of food you are cooking . but they try it and then you at that moment then have changed their opinion on it ! that is awesome ! i literally made a shrimp and corn and

upset . i stated that above . i don t find it necessary just to pick on people whether they like something or not like something . and i m not talking about you i m talking about trolls because there are trolls on this app . that s why i avoid certain controversy on social media . it s nothing personal towards anyone is just i have already tried to talk about certain controversial type things on here and it has ended badly . extremely badly . so i already have my experience what has happened after talking about certain controversial type things","25300":"no you re fine it was literally just because someone asked me anonymously . now that i know it s you i feel more comfortable with answering it . i hope that you are not upset at me . the only reason why i asked you did that way it s just because i thought it was another troll trying to ask me a controversial question . don t ask me a question and then judge me for my answer whether it s right or wrong . and that s annoying . but i know that you wouldn t do that . i do believe evolution but it s really hard to explain honestly . but i believe in different forms of it . i hope that you respect my answer and understand that i was

exercising and getting a healthy breakfast is a good way to make your life so fresh and start off the day with good energy . this is a good self improvement a lot of people don t go to bed on time and wake up early . nor get the amount of sleep that they are supposed to get . try that . it is nice . remembering that you are beautiful inside out . you have to tell yourself that . doing random acts of kindness and paying it forward . just trying to keep the environment around you and your self clean . that is a really good self improvement thing to do if you don t do these few things . exercise

meet them . it just goes to show that i am here for them and i could take care of them and even spend my own money on them . but don t get too carried away because that s what will make me lose your respect easily . if you get grady and you re only there for the money and the things i have to offer . cuz that s not what i m there for it s just me showing you that i can care for you and that i am here for you and that i don t mind spending my own money on you . greed jealousy and envy will make me not want to be friends with you . i like people that appreciate things and don t take things for granted as well . don t waste day . if i see that you make some food and then you all the sudden don t want it and throw it away that makes me very upset . i was grew up and taught to not waste . i also grew up not the richest and i m okay with that . because it taught me certain things that i needed to know in life . i think everyone should grow up like this sometime in their life . being in

face thing . so my apologies there . but i will say this . . . your partner shouldn t be sending someone any type of hearts and that other person should not be sending them any type of hearts because hearts symbolize love and if that s your partner and they re sending love symbols to someone else that is inappropriate and uncalled for in a relationship . me and my husband don t do that . we don t even do it without thinking we just only talk to one another . we don t have a reason to speak to any other human being in the way that we speak to each other because we are married and love one another and want to speak to each other and only each other like that . that s how it should be . the way that you to talk should be a secret and only in between the two of you . you should not tell other people or things that you to do because that would ruin how special it is . and we allow each other to be friends with other human beings even of the opposite sex ? absolutely . there s no reason to get angry at someone for wanting to be friends with other human being . but only friends . and make that clear and don t talk to them because then it looks like you re doing something

get up and leave unless a manager or restaurant owner got it taken care of immediately and if they touch me i m going to defend myself . i m not going to do anything i don t want to do . if i wanted to protest then i would already be out there with them . i m just really trying to have a bite to eat and you re in here screaming at my face . i d probably call the police and tell them that they re making a disturbance and then they would come take care of them but i would still leave because i m not about to sit there and have a situation on my hands to where it s going to possibly get violent because i didn t do anything wrong but measly walk into a restaurant and get a bite to eat .","25352":"sent done","25353":"trying to understand what you exactly mean do you mean like people ask for you to do too much at once ? or maybe answer something that s a little too personal but you do it anyway . because if it s the first one i just try to tell them you re going to have to wait because i m not able to do all that at once and i take my time and i do each thing until i get to them and then i helped them out . the second one it just depends on who i m talking to because if it s something extremely personal that i don t want to tell you because that s my business and it s uncomfortable for me to talk about . only depends on who you are .","25354":"i like it because you can communicate with people from all over the world whenever you want . this is a very big boom in our generation now . but i think that people should be more aware of their surroundings when they re online because there are literally more people on line that lies and what you think telling the truth . you also need to be careful so no one steals your identity and tries to be you online . giving too much information out is not safe on the internet and you should honestly keep your circle small and only trust certain people and make sure that your parents meet them especially if you re young or under the age of . because you just never know how gullible you think you are and so you actually meet a true catfish online .","25355":"i m really not sure but i heard it s supposed to rain eventually this week but i m not sure . i thought it would rain yesterday or the day before but i guess not . i honestly wouldn t mind a little bit of rain because we haven t really gotten much","25356":"from what i remember yes i cannot remember how high and when i did this i think in my younger ages but yes i did it and of course it s terrifying but most definitely fun","25357":"thanks . i hope that you have a great day too ! and same back to everyone else that rates this ! i hope each and every one of you have an amazing day !","25358":"not that i know of no","25359":"i like both but to be honest i really enjoy water slides","25360":"i m just not really a fan of the spice cinnamon . so anything that cinnamon is in i m not a fan of eating and you re fine you can send as many questions as you want","25361":"jason s voice so lovely .","25362":"i m online . just chilling . playing modern warfare with the husband","25363":"nothing really . other than the fact that it s starting to get to that time of the year that i love the most . my husband s birthday is in a few days and i really want to do something great for him . i ve already got him something for his birthday but i m definitely going to try to get him something else and take him out to eat . i m thinking about taking him on a flea market spree . basically it s a antique spray . basically we just go looking around at different flea markets and try to look for neat and unique items . it s really fun because you never know what you re going to find . that s what i m thinking about doing for his birthday plus he went swimming with me yesterday and that was also a part of his birthday and he got chocolate chip cookies . he helped making by the way .","25364":"growing up i always used to remember going fishing with my mom and her teaching me anything and everything she could about fishing . or at least what i could when i was paying attention . but i really enjoyed fishing with my mom . i also remember going to visit my great grandparents and my grandparent s folks and family members , putting flowers on their graves . i remember driving an hour to two hours away and sometimes getting car sick but we would get to this place where we had pretty much a family reunions and we d have all of these pies and there was just so much food i remember , but we would have so much fun and there was a playground and everything and i got to play with so many kids . at the end of the day i had a really good time . i m just mentioning all this because i remember the old days i miss them . i also remember going to a family member s house where she had ducks everywhere and i wanted to hold one so bad chasing after them . again these were the good days . still good today but these were definitely the good days . i miss my grandparents .","25365":"people that work inside of hospitals and people that help elderly people and just people in general at homes . people that come out during hurricanes and tornadoes and just really dangerous weather at fix the electricity . because honestly we don t really need electricity but they go out of their way to fix it for us so we can see and be comfortable in our own surroundings when they re not comfortable and dangerous weather fixing something that we don t actually need . but there are people that do need it because they have certain health conditions such as needing an oxygen machine or a cpap of some sort so yes and some sort of ways we do need electricity and ways of what i m saying we don t need it is like wi fi and tv .","25366":"to visit the great smoky mountains national park . go to the bass pro shops pyramid . visit the graceland mansion . visit dollywood . visit the tennessee civil war trails . parthenon . valley railroad museum . while in tennessee you must go to knoxville . you can go out to eat and visit many different places in knoxville . honestly you would have to go for a week just to probably adventure the whole place . i m sure . considering how popular it is . can go to lookout mountain . the titanic museum . craighead caverns . bell witch cave . oak ridge . virginia falls pocket wilderness . crystal shrine grotto . gatlinburg tennessee . chattanooga . these are all really good places to go in tennessee but to be honest this doesn t even scratch the surface of tennessee . there are many hikes and trails that you can go on but i would definitely not recommend on going by yourself i wouldn t even recommend going with two people . i would recommend bringing about four to five people going on these trails to make sure that you were safe and bring lots of water and first aid kits . but to visit tennessee it s amazing . it s a beautiful place . wonderful people and good food . i would definitely go out to you a few times also and don t forget the amazing fun bars .","25367":"thanks for the compliment . i try . these answers come from the heart . this is really what i feel . i think . thanks .","25368":"extremely . i love the holidays . to be honest with you sept jan . is my most favorite time of the year . because it starts to actually become the season that i love the most . fall because i love seeing the plants and grass change colors and winter because you don t have to cut the grass and then . . it s cold out and you can actually enjoy yourself outside without being extremely hot and sweating . and i love the cold . i honestly don t even have to turn the heater on . because i just like the cold . you can keep your doors open as long as it s not too cold and it can keep the house cool without having to turn the air conditioning or the heater on . you can conserve more electricity that way . one day i ll be able to redo all of my windows in the house and make it to where i only open the windows and not turn on any lights so we can conserve even more electricity .","25369":"like . . . being scared what people are going to grade you as ? like judge you ? or what people may think of you ? or what you look like ? and grade you based off of that ? nope . everyone has taste . different taste . eye of the beholder i say . people have no need to open their mouth if there s nothing nice to say someone . especially if there s nothing wrong with them and they look completely fine . especially if they feel comfortable in their own body . and they feel happy and confident . no need to say anything to them at all . leave them be . i understand if someone smells a little strange or maybe their hair is a brushed just right or something . . or maybe they re wearing a dress that s a bit too short in your opinion . . . or maybe it s a guy wearing tight jeans . . . to be honest . . it s better just to mind your own business and keep your mouth shut . let people do them . because at the end of the day that s them doing them and it s not affecting you . but say for instance there s nothing wrong with a girl and she s just sitting there and you just think that maybe her feet are a little too big . so you take it upon yourself to go up to her and tell her that . just keep your words to yourself that is totally uncalled for and to be honest her feet probably aren t even that big to other person . just to you it might be . shallowness is definitely a thing . you need to look at a person from the inside . not more from the outside because to be honest you could fall for someone that s totally beautiful but they have a horrible attitude . i would not want to be with someone that has a bad attitude regardless of how fine they look . i want someone that actually wants a future . someone that has confidence is extremely determined and is ambitious and have a wonderful future that they wish ahead of them . that is a wonderful person . someone that has all of their priorities straight and is excited to make a family and make themselves into something . that is a nice personality and that is hot to me .","25370":"i like a hot fudge shake and then in it i like snickers .","25371":"well if it was used in a murder case i would just come forward . there be no reason for them to come in my house for a pistol because i m allowed to have a pistol and i wouldn t say where it would be because then i would be revealing where it would be . all i know is any human being that doesn t live in my house would not be able to find it other than my spouse","25372":"i mean i always am trying to make sure that i m making the right decisions so that tomorrow can be easier . for instance i don t want to just have kids randomly i want them to be plans so i know for sure that i can take care of them . you know . . you need to know whether or not you can take care of yourself first and then another human being a k a boyfriend girlfriend husband and then you have to be like can i take care of a third individual . those are the questions you have to ask yourself .","25373":"my love he s a doll .","25374":"don t really matter to me","25375":"i m sure hundreds of people have made diss tracks on her . she s actually pretty known you should check her out online and on youtube . especially her videos when she was being a brat on dr phil","25376":"me neither .","25377":"probably danielle bregoli considering she literally at the beginning of her fame got famous off of being a brat . she ll never admit to that though because of how she is . she ll probably always say that she got famous off of rapping but she actually never got into the rapping industry but maybe a year or longer after she got famous for being a brat . she got famous for going on dr . phil and bragging about stealing cars beating the crap out of people including her own mother . regardless of what your mother is doing to you unless she is trying to kill you you do not beat the crap out of your mother . what an inspiration . she also contradicted herself because she made fun of the kardashians for being famous for no reason but yet on she got famous for no reason more or less getting famous for being a brat on television and disrespectful to an actual doctor . again what an inspiration . and she doesn t really exactly irritate me , it s just like what has came to the world to make a brat , literally a convict famous .","25378":"burnt food old tea and a seared on both sides raw bloody hamburger . i didn t eat it though i didn t realize it was like that until i took a bite in it and then i yeah just was not pleasant . this was recent . like within the last to weeks .","25379":"thanks . i try my best . i appreciate your compliment .","25380":"it s definitely a wild dog but i i m not sure if you can breed it with a regular dog could you ? but all i know is if you were to see the dog you would definitely say the dog looks like in between a dingo and a fox . she s a cutie","25381":"hours ? ? probably longer .","25382":"try to come up with a plan to get the remote without moving . tie some blankets together beg the sibling to do it call neighbor lol jk i just get up but i don t really watch tv so that s not really a problem in my life","25383":"one day in school when i realized that not all teachers and adults are heroes . when i was getting harassed by a teacher for no reason . or one day when i heard another adult talking about another adult that was doing me or someone else wrong . i always looked at adults as heroes . that day they were not to me anymore .","25384":"lol what can i say . i am extremely goofy . i am always trying to just be funny and make people laugh . i do have my moments when i know to take things seriously though . and then my hair is almost ft long and it has gold in it . and i love to take care of my hair and make sure it gets as long as i can get it as healthy as i can get it . and then i guess i could save my eyes . and then i love kissing . that s something that i adore doing . enjoy being creative and different .","25385":"right off the top when you first see and meet me i m extremely goofy and i have a really long hair and i take very good care of my hair and you can tell","25386":"that s what i said the dog is not literally a dingo she just looks like a dingo

something but it s usually random like one or two days and then a couple weeks later a few days and then a couple weeks later maybe a day or two . we honestly don t get a lot of cold weather down here i wish we got more . i love the cold weather . sometimes i wonder how i grew up in the south . but i love the south . so i could never leave the south . and to be honest with you last years winter was feeling like a summer . it never felt like we had a winter","25399":"we are just baking a few things that are already cooked . a few chicken nuggets , fish sticksb tater tots and pizza rolls . lol

come off anonymous if you can receive my questions i will do so . i do not mind adding you to my ask . that s what we re all here for right ? another way to get popular on this site is to make shoutouts . when you make shoutouts , you discover new people every time . sometimes you send it to the same people but most of the time the shoutouts will be sent out to randoms . and more randoms and different randoms every time . if you like there answers , you can follow them and start sending them questions and eventually they ll start sending you some back , but not all of them will send you questions back , but some of them . and again you can ask people if they can send you questions . i don t feel that anything is wrong with that . after all that s what we re here for right ? to ask people stuff and for them to answer .","25410":"depends on what kind of change you mean because if you mess with human nature too much it can mess with everything . too much change in the cycle of life can mess up other species . if you re meaning it like that . saying like if we d make all the mice disappear it can really screw up the chain of cycle with animals . a lot of animals that eat mice would disappear . unless you re talking about changing human actions . and how we do things . we should change because people need to just be more kind . there s nothing wrong with having a little bit more kindness . not completely just kindness because then that would mess up the world there has to be bad eggs somewhere for people to be able to learn .","25411":"yeah . being addicted to

different ways that they filter water where it s from and what s in it and what they do with it and sometimes what measures they go to get it . and more . water dirty at first and goes through a cycle continuously . the same cycle . it has to be cleaned for you to be able to drink obviously or you re just drinking bacteria water and pee water . and just nastiness . some water is less clean that other water and some water has minerals in it some water goes through different types of chemicals some water is just straight purified some waters from aquifers groundwater they have water with salt in it which honestly isn t the greatest for people that have high blood pressure and can just cause you to be more thirsty and defeat the purpose . water such as dasani and aquafina . if you read the back of the bottles they will soon as they contain salt . doctors will not recommend that water to people that have high blood pressure issues . for it is not good for them . i also don t like crystal geyser water because it tastes like they put some sort of chlorine in it and it s really gross . sometimes nestle water can be nasty too because i think it comes in batches or something maybe ? wherever they get the water i don t know . also you can t leave bottled water warm too long or the oils condensed into the bottle and can cause cancers . be careful with your bottled water . because it does matter . it can affect your health . do your research and you ll find what i have","25537":"they are most definitely awake but more like cousins because i like waffles more than pancakes .
