That's why I don't answer these questions. Plus I don't really get into the politics anyway much here in America because it just always leads to arguments and drama. I was raised to not even talk about political views because that's all it ever did was a ride arguments. Especially in today's age nobody knows how to have a proper conversation with real based facts and then not get offended and just respect persons answer they just want to get angry and tell them they're wrong about everything. That's why I just don't talk about these types of things especially on the internet to people that I don't really know 100%. Because you're just going to get label into a group based off of your answer because they don't know you. They're just going to mention the obvious or what they think is the obvious. Every year I get mom or dad with questions like this and I just don't answer them. I have never really gotten into the political system. I don't want to. Because once again it just causes arguments.

Try to understand what's going on and why it's there. What kind of entity is there. And just try to give people answers to unanswered questions.

But you really have to know what you're doing you can't just go into it blind.

I would like to comment on a few things I have been seeing.\n  \n  I think it's funny when people ask why I spend so much time on here but my late post under this one I am answering now says, \"12 hours ago.\" Last time I was on was 12 hours ago. Half a day away. I was asleep.\n  \n  And then I worked everyday this week. Actually I worked almost 12 days in a row. I work anywhere from 5 in the mornings till like 6 in the afternoon. I might get on and say good morning and answer a question or two if I get the chance. Because I am busy at work or doing something at home. Like cooking or cleaning or just doing something important. But from 5am to 6pm in the afternoon is again almost 12 hours. A full half a day. I only really get to come on one good time in the afternoon on here and I don't always have time to do everything.. Like both answer and send questions out, because I follow so many people. But it's the fact that I came on is all that counts.\n  \n  I know there is a few jealous and no lifey people on here that wanna ask mean or stupid questions... Like.. Why are you on all the time? When in fact I'm not. I can't be. I would like to come on maybe more. But I will say, I am daily active. But just like with any other app other people choose to get on everyday. I choose this one. This is a little hobby\/journal of mine. Instead of paper. I choose this as my paper. And again like any of app you or someone may choose to get on alot on. I choose this one, though I am not even able to get on but every now and then throughout the day, when I can, that is all that counts. And is fine.\n  \n  If you don't like me. Idky but you don't have to follow nor talk to me.\n  \n  Here's a question for you.\n  \n  Why do you sit on apps and ask people that aren't bothering youstupid useless questions for no reason?

Ever since I lost my grandmother in November 2019 since that it seems like everything is just been getting worse and not better. Everyone has been going through a lot and it's really hard to get through a passing of a family member especially someone very close to you. The best thing I could say to you is try everything you can remember the good memories about down and not to forget them and to remember that they're in a better place and that they're not suffering. As I said before it's not easy to get over a death in the family at all. If anything you never get over it it's always there. Again the best thing to do is to remember the great things. Only time can heal such... I will pray for you and send positive vibes your way. And sincere condolences to you and your family and their family. For this is a sad time for all of you.. \u2764\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude14\n  ","29299":"\n  Thanks! I'm super excited!\n  ","29300":"\n  I mean mostly in schools and that work this kind of thing is regulated. If you're at home or on your own walking in public as long as you're not taking it too far and you're being appropriate a kiss or a hug or a hand holding isn't really that bad. Even cuddling and holding each other close while walking isn't that bad of course the whole covid-19 and social distancing is important but if you're always around that person anyway and know where they've been and who they've been around honestly there some sort of a loophole for that person with you. Spanish always remember that there's kids probably watching and that you shouldn't be too inappropriate because they could be seeing your actions. Some people say I don't care sometimes kids don't understand that stuff and it's better for us to try to be appropriate about it and keep it at a minimal especially in school because they're trying their best practice social distancing and it being safe from getting sick of covid-19. They don't know where you have been but all they know is you are around a lot of kids in which you don't know where they have been and you don't realize that you could be getting sick and not even know it. So it's better to just try to space ourselves out and social distance anyway and try not to show any sort of PDA in school towards anyone\n  ","29301":"\n  Srry. That's sad. Praying for ya. You'll get through it... Honestly... Just this year has been just all around hard.. For anyone. 2020? Yeeaah... It's just seems that it gets worse and worse. Cheer up dollin'.... After losing my Maw maw in Nov. Of 2019 till now... it just don't seem like it's gotten any better. Been 1 year in a month since she's been gone. It has been so hard... :( It's all good though. She isn't hurting anymore and she's with my Paw paw, so I know she's happy. For sure.\n  \n  But yeah... Keep your head up. For this year has just been nuts.. Srry your going through some stuff. Hope it starts to get better. Positive vibes going your way and lot's of prayers.\n  ","29302":"\n  It hit around us. Like came up here. But it wasn't that bad once it gor to us.

Sometimes people mess with things are not supposed to and sometimes they need guidance and I have been researching for over 14 years and I have a lot of experience and knowledge in this field to be able to try to guide these people and help them. Sometimes people get themselves in the wrong positions and mess with the things. Sometimes people need things explained to them a certain way so they understand the severity.\n  \n  A lot of the time it's a learning experience and you see different things. Witnessing the things. Being able to see them first-hand and proved that something's there and the evidence is showing. It's really hard to explain because there's just so much to it. I've been doing this for like ever.\n  ","29590":"\n  This is wood burning. When burning is when you use a tool that is a little hot and it's in the shape of kind of like a pen and there are many different types of pens you can use for different effects. When it gets really hot it burns the wood and you can create art with it you can also do wood carving and carve out certain things. This is one of the pieces that I did. For me and my husband. But wood burning is a really easy and simple hobby you can get into the kits are only $10 to $40 depending on what kind you want to get it and how many pieces you want. But I have wood burned quite a few different pieces. It's very enjoyable. Of course it can be a little dangerous but honestly just don't touch the burner and your fine.

I also sing game and love to woodburn.\n  \n  We clean even more than we did before and we have to wear masks continuously and apply sanitizer a lot to ourselves and to a different surfaces even more than we already did before.

If you haven't remembered the Ariel Castro incident you really should go and look it up and watch a few videos on it and what happened. I find that documentary extremely intriguing and crazy. I feel so horrible for the victims that were in that whorehouse. Here is a summary of what I am talking about. Basically three people were kidnapped at honestly a pretty young age. One being 14 one being 17 and the other being 21. They were taken and held captive for as long as 12 10 years. They were lured into this house by this predator and were then on tortured and some of the most craziest and horrible ways you could ever imagine. If you are very sensitive to certain situations and stories I would not recommend you looking up the story. But just to hear it and prepare yourself for some of the craziest things that happened in the world I recommend looking it up. It is crazy will you here in these girls have went through. As crazy as one of them giving birth to the Predators child. Check it out. After 12 years 10 years they escaped and made it out.

Out on the Levee wall in Louisiana and I was looking at some barges and we were talking about the barges as he was getting the ring ready and getting down on one knee and then he asked me right there but the reason why he asked me right there is because that was my grandfather's favorite place to walk back and forth with my grandmother and so that spot was very special to me and my grandfather used to watch the barges go back and forth and I always said I wanted to get married right there so we pretty much kind of did if you think about it in a way but it was funny because we were looking at a metal garbage barge and then right after you asked me and in which it was sweet and funny\n  ","29755":"\n  Cake batter\n  ","29756":"\n  Sorry I'm late but thank you!

There will be a bedtime. And it would be understandable. It wouldn't be like 6 PM. It would be like 9 or 10 p.m. where everyone has to lay down and be quiet at least. Nobody has to go to sleep but if you're going to be loud that is not okay. You are welcome in my house but you must follow the basic rules of being in anyone's house. And that is being quiet when the Sun goes down because others may be sleeping. Just because you're not sleeping doesn't mean others aren't. So no if someone was to have their kids over at my house and they would be loud I would not allow them back over unless they told me for sure that their kids would listen to the rules.

But at the same time be able to express themselves and be unique in their own ways.\n    \n    And then keeping an open mind about things. Letting people do them in minding your own business.

And it really makes you feel good when you complete certain tasks especially ones that took you weeks or even months!\n  ","29835":"\n  It can...\n  \n  Just depends.\n  \n  They always say you're supposed to stretch before you workout. Like if you lift weights or go for a jog.\n  \n  They always say you stretch for about 10 to 15 minutes and you should stretch every part of your body before going and working out and picking up heavy things.\n  \n  You should stretch your back out your legs or arm your neck all of that if we're going and working out. Especially if you haven't worked out in a while. And they say even after you're done working out to do the same stretching methods that you did before when you worked out before starting.\n  \n  Sometimes you can pull a muscle on accident or even irritate a nerve.\n  \n  You really have to be careful sometimes with working out you don't want to just go into it hardcore. If you start working out say for instance do you want to do push-ups maybe start off with just doing 5 and the next day doing 10 and then the next day doing 15 and then the next day doing 20 you might even want to start out with doing less everyday like 5 push-ups for a whole week straight and then the next week start with doing 10 for 5 days straight.\n  \n  Picking certain days to work out your legs and certain days to do heavy pickups with your legs and heavy pickups with your arms and then working on your chest area and stomach.\n  \n  It's really complicated but you can look up certain YouTube videos to follow.\n  \n  You can even work on different dieting while you're working out.\n  \n  Hope I helped.\n  \n  It's never easy getting back into working out but it's always the right thing to do regardless.\n  ","29836":"\n  I think you should do whatever you want but don't stress. Go with the flow but at the same time if you really want to complete certain things in your life there's nothing wrong with doing that and setting goals\n  ","29837":"\n  I do like to bake and I think the last thing that I begged was either some food or if you're literally meaning baking foods I made some muffins\n  ","29838":"\n  If you go from lifting weights to not lifting weights if you were start lifting weights again it might actually hurt. But that's the best way I can answer this question because I know from experience. I used to lift weights and if I stop for a few days or a week and got back onto doing it again it would actually her a little bit. Like I would just be sore for a few days after but it would be okay.

If I wouldn't have jumped in that water I think you wouldn't have made it sadly. I guess regardless of the fact of what they would have said to me I still did it because I didn't want the little boy to go through that. I wanted to hurry and get him out of the water as fast as I could. That's why so many people don't like to go swimming because their parents make things like that happen to them. They should have been right next to him and he should have have floaties on and he should not have been anywhere near the three or four feet area. The little boy was literally maybe three.

It takes lots of investigating and figuring out but like I said you really have to know what you're talkin about and know what you're doing today was actually tell what you're dealing with in a home. Because there are many different levels of the Paranormal. I mean many different. Some things are really evil some things are just spirits that passed on and are stuck and some sort of a ghost Loop. Sometimes it's just a really angry spirit that is seeking revenge or is in denial of their death. Or they don't even know their dad. Some people die unexpectedly and quick and don't even realize that they're dead. And sometimes they need help moving on. Those are the really sad stories. But I have dealt with really good cases and I have dealt with really evil and scary cases. Cases better unsolved and Can't Help the People. Those are the ones that are hard to walk away from. But like I said it just all depends on what you're dealing with. I have been doing paranormal research is for almost 14 years now. I have dealt with so many different types of cases it's crazy. Interesting. Intriguing. And just different. I tried to answer any questions that people have.\n  ","29888":"\n  I just wanted to make sure all of you know how much I love all of you!

We will say this... you do it for someone or maybe a friend for free to show them your work and have them spread the word... then say... all the sudden you get a phone call you go ahead and do their speaker installations and make it really cool and give them a card and have them spread the word out and maybe give them a discount to just spread the word for you you start your business out cheap at first and try to brag and show your experience as much as possible and show that you really can get the job done. You really have to know what you're doing now if you're going to get a little arrogant about it because that's the whole point you're supposed to seem like you really know what you're doing because you do.
