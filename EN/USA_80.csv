   Why do you like horse?

  Because horses are the best, they listen to you when no one else might be. They never judge you, they’ve been there for me in my darkest and happiest times. They listen to you and won’t even think twice about being there. And I trust them with my life, I managed to hop on Chief completely bareback with no bridle on (so I literally would not have control of him if we decided to take off)

   OK.. ThanQ.. Good means every positive things within us ..

  Yeah.. like if someone close with me wanted me to take a few photos of them or stuff like that I would, but for other stuff I’m good at I like IF I was good at drawing or something like that, I wouldn’t just draw stuff for free if someone random asked. Just using that as an example, I don’t really draw😂

430284,"
   ""If you’re good at something, you must do it for free"" (sorry joker) 

What you get from this type mentality??
  ","
  Just because I’m good at something would not mean I would do it for free, because that’s still a lot of time and effort spent doing it.
  
  When I went to horse shows more, I used to take photos of people from our barn showing and then my mom would print it and give them to them. But that’s Bc I’m close with them and they used to help us out with stuff similar :)
  "
430285,"
   What annoys 😒 you the most?
  ","
  When someone attempts to guilt you to try doing something you don’t wanna do at all, (like send photos, or send money)
  
  This is an Example, someone actually send me this to try and keep money in my bank account Bc he was having “issues” with his🙄
  "
430286,"
   There's an old saying about money but honestly atm I'm not able to remember how it goes...
  ","
  Yeah no clue what it is
  "
430287,"
   I feel you but it pisses me off when people think they don't have to pay anyone back and let things go to their heads and they end up using people and end up being selfish
  ","
  Yes!! Like I’ve borrowed money from my mom, but I pay back when I’m able to get the money!! I hate when people are like “oh it’s only $___ much money, you don’t need it!” Like no, I didn’t give it to you, I want it back. So now I don’t let people borrow money🤦🏻‍♀️thanks Rikkii (I found her on Facebook lol)
  "
430288,"
   are you good with money
  ","
  Oh yeah, for sure! I try not to spend much unless it’s on my horse lol
  "
430289,"
   Not really because it is to be expected... But lending money is the one tried tested and true way to keep someone away.
  ","
  What do you exactly mean by that?
  "
430290,"
   like i said before, i don't blame you at least you'll have more money for yourself
  ","
  Yeah definitely!! And it’s not like we owe anyone an explanation why I won’t give them money, it’s like I earned it and worked hard😌
  "
430291,"

  ","
  Lol thanks! But yeah that sucks:/ karma will get back at them for taking the money. But I won’t let people borrow from me anymore!
  "
430298,"
   the only person that i loan money to is my mom cause at least she pays me back
  ","
  Well that’s understandable! :) I just wont lend it to friends and such
  "
430299,"
   I understand, i would never let anyone borrow 100 buck cause they definitely will never pay you pack...make sure you never let anyone borrow that much of money unless they tried to pay you back
  ","
  It was about $20 at a time $40 once, then it added to over $100 so I don’t let people borrow money anymore Bc I’m not just giving it to anyone:/
  "
430300,"
   Are you more of a dog person or a cat person?
  ","
  Definitely dog!😍
  "
430301,"
   Do you think a person should cut ties with a friend even if the friend takes too long to pay them back for the secound time?
  ","
  A “friend” I worked with a couple years ago, I don’t talk to her anymore and I don’t regret it. She borrowed over $100 and never paid me back, so I stopped letting her “borrow” money, I never got it back and never talked to her again. So I feel that that would be accurate.

  ","
  Yesterday, Olympia
  "
430487,"
   When it comes to relations (friendships or otherwise) do you think we should avoid secretive people? Why?
  ","
  Depends on what you mean by secretive. Secretive as in sneaking around, looking like they are up to something. I would avoid.
  
  But if they are quiet, more secretive they might just not like telling everyone everything about them and not being open. Those I would still talk to☺️
  "
430488,"
   Is everything possible with the law of attraction?
  ","
  Some things are!
  "
430489,"
   What makes someone reliable?
  ","
  Being trustworthy and someone that can be trusted
  "
430490,"
   Fair enough 😁
  ","
  Haha yep, I’m close with my sisters and parents though😁
  "
430491,"

  Yes😂 it was a good white wine, they closed down the bar, so that’s all I could drink😂(I already had like 5 mixed drinks and a beer) (then I drank other mixed drinks after that)on top of that I only had a few slices of bread, I later passed out in the hallway after coming out of the bathroom😂😂😂

  ","
  Riding horses: in third grade I had a friend who used to ride, so she took me to a stable where I got started at, but then the mare I was riding she decided to breed, so I had to stop riding, but we found another stable a year later so I’ve been riding ever since and now have two horses🥰
  
  Gaming: I have no clue exactly, but I was super young and I think it was just from my parents buying me a gameboy advance and i upgraded to new consoles and played ever since🥰

   Ladies what’s ur best line you use to get a guy to leave you alone when you know he’s trying to come on to you
  ","
  How bad are they trying to be pushy? Do they keep saying the same thing after you said “no” Bc in that case, I pretended I was gonna hang with him and pretend to be interested up till you were supposed to arrive at the store😂
  
  My best line tho? I usually just mess with people, but sometimes I’m strong and just straight “I don’t like you” but it might be “go bother someone else” idk😂😂
  "
431332,"

  Honestly? Had to say what, Bc what wasn’t adding up??? And I don’t have to answer that. I have no problem with black people. I literally hate when people use the race card, that is NOT right, not when someone like me doesn’t even bring race into it! And honestly, wth does dating black guys have to do with anything!? That doesn’t show if someone is racist or not.

  Hey, hru
  "
431630,"
   It’s okay I guess I should have known that you don’t like black people you should have just said that from the start that you find out skin disgusting and you want nothing to do with us since your light skin is so beautiful and perfect.
  ","
  Umm what? Dude, do NOT bring race into this. I told you the SAME thing before you mentioned ANYTHING about skin color, so NO, you don’t have that right to say that it’s because of your skin. And you trying to use this to YOUR advantage is NOT working.

  "
431632,"
   You should make the exception because as you can tell you know that I am special and sweet and I deserve to be happy so please just give me what I need why do you have to make things so complicated like I just need someone to care about me and see that I matter.
  ","
  Omfg, I don’t know anything about you and I don’t have to make the exception for you. And I have enough going on in my life, I’m sorry but I don’t have to talk to everyone that I don’t know, saying they need my help, sorry but..
  "
431633,"
   Why do u love to see me breaking down on the floor and crying Im just asking for friendship and you are making it so complicated like why can’t we get 2 know each other and be friends I know my appearance is ugly and I have dark skin but I am so nice and sweet but I guess I am just not good enough😔😭
  ","
  Dude really? This just irritates me when someone tries to guilt someone to do something they already said no too, I’m the type of person that can’t get guilted. I’m not being rude, I told you my reasons on why I don’t friend people on Instagram, why should I make an exception?
  "
431634,"
   If it means that much to you then forget the video chat but yes you don’t know me that’s why we will talk alot. Btw I mean like what do you want to happen to me you want me to be happy or sad because you are holding all the power at the moment and my future emotions and well being are in your hands.
  ","
  My answer still stands, doing what you’re doing makes me not want to talk to you at all tbh, you saying I’m in charge of you’re happiness? Thing with me is guilt doesn’t work on me for that. So my bad. That doesn’t make me want to be friends and “talk all the time”
  "
431635,"
   Okay then forget the video chats then we can do that after awhile for now let’s just focus on getting to know each other than okay like I would not be getting to weird with I just want us to get to know each other and eventually be friends and hangout that’s my dream but what do you want for me?
  ","
  What do you mean, what do I want for you? And like I would never video chat and I still don’t follow people I don’t know.
  "
431636,"
   You know that I am soft and sensitive so you have to talk to me gently and more soft so I don’t get hurt. I am not not asking for a lot just to talk and be close no dating just really good friendship but again I feel like I should have never told you my looks since they changed things between us😔.
  ","
  I’m sorry, but I’m not even being mean.  And how did your “looks” change things between us..? I’ve never talked to you before.. but like I said, I don’t want to get to know someone who I don’t personally know.. plus a lot of guys get creepy with me, so I’m trying to avoid that by not talking to someone I don’t really know.. and you kept saying we had to video chat so you know I’m real? I’m not into that.
  "
431637,"
   Because I feel like we could be really good friends and u would be the first girl to  ever give a dam about me and I was so excited and I thought you were nice but now it’s all falling apart when u will not follow me back and give me a fair chance I am not asking for alot just a lil respect and love
  ","
  I have a lot of respect for people, but I don’t follow anonymous accounts that I don’t know in real life or people who ride or have horses, it’s way easier when I have stuff in common with my friends. And you were saying how we “HAVE” to video chat, I would not video chat and I don’t follow people who I don’t know. And why do you want my love..? It honestly sounds like you want to eventually date me, but idk for sure...
  "
431638,"
   I would share the same interests as u.I will learn stuff about horses and anything else u like just let me no I will try my best and u keep hurting me when you say that u don’t want to take the effort 2 get to know me because I told you my looks and you are disappointed this happens all the time 2me
  ","
  Dude I never said it was because of you’re looks, if you said “I’m super hot” and the same stuff, while on anon, I wouldn’t be interested either, it has nothing to do with looks. How am I hurting you, if you don’t know me? Why do you want to get to know me so badly?

   That’s how you are hurting me and making me cry because you just think I am just another worthless loser anon who is not worth knowing and so if I follow you on IG I am not worth getting to know since I am so pathetic. That’s how you are making me feel right now and I am crying so hard right now😖😭.
  ","
  Dude, I’m not doing anything. I don’t force anyone to follow me, it’s up to everyone. I don’t talk to people who I don’t know or who share the same interest or if I know who I’m talking to.
  "
431645,"
   I am not saying for you to follow back everyone just me because I really want to be friends with you and I would try my best to talk and get to know you better even though I am nervous of you but I just feel like you want to use me and it’s hurting me because I care so much and you don’t give a dam
  ","
  Dude I don’t know you.. I don’t follow back everyone who ask me to, sorry.. how do I even want to use you..? I said it’s up to you, if you follow me or don’t.. plus I’m not really into letting strangers that are anonymous getting to know me.
  "
431646,"
   You obviously know that I want to add you on insta it’s what I have always wanted but you said you will maybe look at my profile what does that mean will you not be liking my pics and following me back and trying to be friends with me and put effort like I would be towards you why r u hurting me🥺.
  ","
  Dude, I don’t follow back everyone that follows me, you can follow me if you want, that’s fine. And idk, I might look into your profile to see if you have content that looks good. How am I hurting you?
  "
431647,"
   I just want to be friends and what do friends do they talk, hang out, are close, trust each other and want the best for each other so yeah again I feel like you are avoiding my question again what happens after I add you?
  ","
  Okay, but like I said earlier, I don’t video call like anyone unless it’s a girl I’m close with or if I’m dating someone, so that doesn’t change. And after you follow me, I pretty much already said. You can follow me if you want, if not, that’s fine. But maybe I’ll look at your profile, I mostly just follow friends I know or horse accounts
  "
431648,"
   And it’s not just about proof you know video calls means we are getting close and that’s all I want so yeah can we start something like you claim my looks will not matter so tell me everything that will happen if I add you on insta? (You still didn’t even say anything about following me back so...?)
  ","
  But what exactly are you looking for?? It seems like you want to be more then friends.. so idk.
  "
431649,"
   That’s so cool!
  ","
  Thank you! :)
  "
431650,"
   Yeah any one can get pics and attach them to a Instagram profiling and I lost money because a girl catfished me before and so i would need proof from now on. Besides you never said wether you would follow me back or anything you just said add you so what am I supposed to think when u avoid it?
  ","

   Do you bangs or no?
Ever had them before?
Would you ever get them again? (Talking about hair)

  I used to but I absolutely hated them on me! My mom would always force me to, then she finally let me grow them out, but in freshman year or high school my mom got me a haircut and I asked about it and she said, “don’t worry, you’ll like it” I literally hated that haircut and was super p!ssed off Bc she got me to have bangs again, without telling me, and then a couple years ago I had side/longer bangs and liked them :)
  "
431653,"
   obviously we would have to video call each other so I can know you are real and then we could make plans to hang out.And also you said that you “may reply” that is heartless when guys like me message you it’s not easy so that is insulting that you “may reply”u have be more considerate with feelings
  ","
  Dude no we don’t have to video call, I have enough pictures of myself on my account, so no. I’m not fake. And why do you want to hang out with me? And honestly? You were accusing me of not responding Bc of ur looks, when I never said that, Bc I don’t respond to every person who messaged me since I always got a bunch of spam.

  ","
  Dude, I hardly video call anyone and definitely would never ever video call someone I don’t know, maybe if I see a message I may respond to it and I really don’t have to explain myself at all to you, I said you can follow me or not, half the time from unknown users I don’t even see the messages till way later.
  "
431657,"
   So you are telling me I can follow you but you won’t follow me back and you don’t want talk to me because of my bad appearance and I am not good enough for you?

  Dude, I don’t even know what the heck you look like, Im just not looking for someone who is appearing on anon to talk to on Instagram. Plus I never brought looks into it, YOU did that.

  Soo this one is more inappropriate, but it happened a few years ago at a shell gas station, I went in to buy something quickly, there was a glass covering by the register, so when he handed me my stuff, he held onto my hands for a second longer and muttered something.

   Why did you quit Taco Hell?
  ","
  Because they treated me unfair, I worked there two years and only got a 25c raise. I left making only 8.50 people came in making way more then me. I got harassed multiple times by one of the store managers, one of the guy managers I think after he got fired because of him smoking in the store harassed me on Facebook asking me a couple inappropriate questions, they hardly ever let me leave on time, even when I told him if I didn’t leave now, I wouldn’t have a ride, he told me to figure it out, I rarely got any breaks. (Even tho I’ve worked 12 hours before), I even had 4 new store managers over a few months if that says anything about them. And a few days before I quit, the new store manager made me go in the store by myself when the store was unlocked all night and my manager was an hour late at that time, so I was in there at 7am-8am with no one in there. And if someone snuck in the store, I could’ve been serious hurt. It wasn’t worth it, I was suffering when I worked there, I’m still friends with one of my managers who worked there. She was the best manager I had there. Sorry it’s so long, but that’s all the crap that happened to me

  My grabbing his arm, pulling him down yelling at the fool and bring him outside and lock the door.

  ","
  Get arrested for being out like that.

  You don’t share that shit! Tf is wrong with you?
  "
432881,"

  I would never want that shit back! That’s gross asf🤮id leave his ass outside without nothing and call the cops.
  "
432882,"
   How did he steal your shit!
  ","
  If he took a thong? That’s stealing because I never gave permission! And you don’t wear that shit that’s nasty as hell and if you ever do that🤮🤮

  ","
  No I don’t😂he steal my shit, he suffer the consequences, I would want the cops to see that fool like that.

432884,"

  "
432886,"
   But its all he's got on
  ","
  OMFG, I would never let some gross ass where my shit! And if I went to the bathroom and came back to that shit? I would grab the fools arm and drag him outside, lock my door, then call the cops.
  "
432887,"
   But not tell he's wearing your thong?
  ","
  IT WOULD NEVER GET TO THAT FUCKING POINT.
  "
432888,"
   But he's only wearing your thong. He doesn't even have a sock on! It's only a thong
  ","
  Like I said that would never ever happen🤮🤮cops would be called, and I would explain what a gross ass he is on social media and expose the dumbass.

  "
432891,"
   But thongs are for girls!! He doesn't want anyone knowing he wore a thong
  ","
  Like I said, the only person to blame is him, I don’t give a shit what he does in his spare time, the moment he interferes with my life, all of that would become public. I never said to do it, if he asked me if he could, I say no, then he does it anyways, that’s harassment and it becomes public knowledge then
  "
432892,"
   What color dominates your wardrobe?
  ","
  Black
  "
432893,"

  Wtf does that have to do with anything? Is this a weird ass obsession you have? I literally think that’s gross and I would never ever be around anyone that would get in a thong in front of me, and if they did, I would leave tell everyone the type of person he is for harassing me and never talk to him again.
  "
432896,"
   But he'd be infront of you wearing just a thong
  ","
  Well I never hang out with just guy friends so this situation would never happen to me. Proved my point why you can’t trust many guys.🤷🏻‍♀️
  "
432897,"
   You'd put his ass in a thong, on social media??
  ","
  Omg I would post what he said. Ain’t no one want to see that gross ass shit. I would post the messaged that were said between us. Jeez.
  "
432898,"
   Who would you tell

  Anyone I talk to? Maybe expose his ass on social media if he wouldn’t stop harassing me like you’re doing.
  "
432899,"

  ","
  But I wouldn’t want him to! And if he did anyways, I’d drop him as a friend. What don’t you get?

  If you get an uncomfortable feeling/vibe or feel like something is gonna go wrong

   Don't be bitter and stop crab mentality, learn to clap in someone's success. Hindi yung sisiraan yung tao. That's bad

  I’m not bitter, I’m happy for my friends when stuff goes their way.

  And I would think that would be gross if someone sent that to me, so he’d be reported and I would show others his username🤷🏻‍♀️
  "
432906,"
   You'd tell?
  ","
  Yes, because guys who send me pics or gross messages piss me off, I’ve sent usernames and someone messaged them back🤷🏻‍♀️

432907,"
   Would you tell anyone
  ","
  Honestly, if a guy was being like that I would tell someone Bc I’m not into those types of pics and I’ve told people when people send me gross stuff
  "
432908,"
   But what if he agreed to wear a thong
  ","
  And I’m not into seeing that kind of stuff? I wouldn’t even be asking anyone to and if they wanted to show me it, I would straight up say no
  "
432909,"
   Why
  ","
  Because I’m not into that stuff and why would a guy just buy a thong and I have to convince them to wear it? I would never do that.
  "
432910,"
   What if a guy agreed?

  Idk, I wouldn’t want to see a guy wear one, so I wouldn’t let them😂
