linked to bad or violent behavior , such as violent video games , bdsm , metal music or having body modifications . in that , they don t directly cause bad behavior and they re not going to turn a person from a law abiding citizen into a criminal . however , i do believe that people who are inherently bad or violent do have a tendency to lean towards violence in the media because it can be seen as an outlet for their aggression . they often fantasize about violence and the media is the only socially acceptable way for them to maintain their interests without them going out and doing those behaviors themselves .","301605":"i do believe casey anthony was guilty for k lling her daughter , yes . i mean , just like my answer to the last question , i don t remember the specifics of the case

think veganism is the future because there are still so many people who either cannot sustain a vegan diet or simply don t want to . i think it s wonderful that there are so many vegetarian and vegan options out now though , it s a lot healthier than eating meat and dairy products all the time .","301608":"i don t remember any lessons my parents taught me . if anything , i was forced to raise myself because my parents weren t good at parenting , so i relied mostly on the advice of my friends to get through life .","301609":"don t trust anyone who has wronged you multiple times distance yourself from them immediately . when provided with an opportunity to prove yourself in order to progress , take that without hesitation . only surround yourself with people who appreciate your worth

birth regardless of reasoning , which is obviously completely false .","301622":"i would inform them that they re not alone in their thoughts plenty of people don t think highly of themselves either in terms of physical attraction . however , that sort of validation must come from within , so in time , they ll learn how to appreciate who they are and find the beauty within themselves .","301623":"well , today has been developing into a good day so far . even though i ve only been awake for an hour , lol . i left my boyfriend s house , picked up coffee on the way home , and now i m going to start working on some freelance writing for extra money .","301624":"not generally , no . the only times i complain are when i m having a bad day at work , and i usually only complain to my boyfriend because i would feel guilty inflicting that upon anyone else .","301625":"no , i don t . to be fair , however , i never looked for their advice or guidance in the first place , even when i was a teenager .","301626":"honestly , all of the anti abortion rhetoric that s occurring lately since new york passed that abortion bill has been so stupid . most of the people who spew ignorant comments about the bill probably didn t even read the bill itself or develop a full understanding of what the bill is actually about , so they re basing their opinion off of false information .","301627":"i m a good person at heart , but i m also willing to cut corners and do questionable things for the people i love .","301628":"i suppose so ? ? i haven t felt the need to label myself as

.","301630":"sometimes , but not usually . i value my alone time and i prefer to be alone in most cases , with the exception of the time i spend with my boyfriend .","301631":"presumably my boyfriend , but we don t have the opportunity to go out on dates very often . we usually prefer to stay home , snuggle up with blankets , and watch television or youtube .","301632":"coffee iced coffee , hot coffee , black coffee , coffee with cream , coffee with flavors , etc etc . i m a big fan of coffee .","301633":"thank you , i appreciate it","301634":"if it does then i m unaware of it .","301635":"no , it s too cold to wear them around the waist .","301636":"that s what it sounds like , for the most part . it isn t so much rage as it is deflection .","301637":"lol . strangely enough , i ve never heard that one before .","301638":"lol it isn t basic american food . i never saw the appeal in it .","301639":"that s probably a large part of it too , yeah .","301640":"i don t

adulthood , sadly enough . my mother enjoys focusing on really small , insignificant things and blowing them out of proportion , where she makes herself out to be the victim even if something has nothing to do with her in the first place .","301650":"lol . there s literally nothing in massapequa . there s a huge mall , but that s literally the only thing going for the town .","301651":"no , apparently the weather is going to be mild slightly warmer than usual next week . the lowest temperature i can see is degrees fahrenheit on thursday , but the rest of the week is within the s and s .","301652":"long island is comprised of mostly major highways and parkways , lol . you re always within a minute drive from some sort of major road .","301653":"i d like to believe that i have a firmer grasp on the english language and grammar than most other people , considering i have a degree in the subject and it s something i practice at work every day .","301654":"i think it depends on the individual , as well as what hurt them in the first place . i believe time heals most wounds , especially with respect to breakups and whatnot , but when it comes to more serious matters i . e . the passing of a loved one , it doesn t matter how much time has passed because the wound will still be slightly opened .","301655":"i personally know quite a few people my age between who don t believe feminism is necessary in modern times . i ve never discussed it with them personally , but i see them occasionally posting articles on facebook about it .","301656":"considering over the past few weeks , i ve been writing a story about the personification of death . . . nothing good is rattling around my head rn .","301657":"sounds like a cultural discrepancy . that s really interesting , though .","301658":"yes , i definitely believe so . my boyfriend is too harsh with himself and he s never convinced that he s doing well enough or doing something just right . he s always looking more deeply into the way things work and trying to fix something further , and he s also never satisfied with his own work .","301659":"idk where you re getting that impression from , but most women i ve interacted with are supporters of feminism . if they don t support feminism , it s because they don t support the white , trendy interpretation of st century feminism that s rampant today .","301660":"for me personally , one of the worst feelings is when you experience that empty , hollow , dropping feeling in the pit of your stomach when you find out something that hurts you through to your very core . even thinking about the feeling makes me feel uncomfortable . it just reminds me of all of the moments where i had that feeling and what was occurring at the time .","301661":"yes , sometimes my self esteem issues affect my relationship because it makes me question his love and commitment to me , due to the fact that i don t believe that i m a very lovable or attractive person .","301662":"the necklaces my boyfriend has bought for me over the years and all of the handwritten letters he s given to me alongside those necklaces . they re incredibly sentimental to me .","301663":"aw , thank you . that s sweet i m doing fine just exhausted , so i m inhaling a cup of iced coffee in the hopes that it wakes me up enough for me to drive to my boyfriend s house tonight .","301664":"my boyfriend if he counts , coffee , cigarettes , alcohol , and sleep .","301665":"probably at the bar , not gonna lie .","301666":"complete utter panic . lol . when someone says those words , i automatically assume i did something gravely wrong .","301667":"anywhere between and hours of sleep . last night , i slept for hours .","301668":"no , i don t watch cable television . i prefer to sit down and binge watch episodes of shows when i have the spare time , lol .","301669":"i ve never tried a corn dog before , so i don t know .","301670":"i would get a hell of a lot less questions , that s for sure . most of the questions i get are anonymously sent for one reason or another , and then the rest are spam based questions from regular accounts .","301671":"i ve only used a hair mask perhaps twice in my entire life . i just use regular conditioner every time i wash my hair .","301672":"i m usually fairly tolerant when it comes to scents , but the one thing i absolutely cannot stand is body odor .","301673":"we have three locks . one lock on the storm door two locks on the regular door .","301674":"my house is two stories my bedroom is on the second floor .","301675":"in the past , i ve donated money to some gofundme s , but that s pretty much it . if i had extra money to spare , though , i would try to regularly donate to mental health organizations , jdrf , and animal sanctuaries .","301676":"today , i completely forgot to take money out of the atm to give to my coworker . she bought lunch for a few of us on wednesday , so i told her i would pay her back on payday . . . and then i completely forgot . smh .","301677":"nothing ? ? watching p rn isn t a crime in itself .","301678":"i literally have no clue . i m clueless when it comes to trends .","301679":"i m seeing my boyfriend tonight sleeping over into tomorrow then i m going home , working on freelance writing , doing laundry , and cleaning . i don t have anything planned for sunday , but i guess i ll just do whatever is left over from saturday if i don t finish everything .","301680":"farted in front of my boyfriend s entire family while sitting at the dinner table . lmao . i was mortified . they still make fun of me for it it happened like years ago . smh .","301681":"no , i ve never heard of it before . however , i just looked it up and it sounds really helpful ! !","301682":"i guess a lot happens when i go to work . go figure . i don t check my page for eight hours suddenly drama blows up , lmao .","301683":"fake leather . i try to be cruelty free whenever possible .","301684":"i don t , lol . i haven t had a reason to pick someone in a long time .","301685":"yeah , i m at work right now .","301686":"life sentence in prison . no question .","301687":"no , i only speak english .","301688":"i feel tipsy .","301689":"yeah , i usually order their thin crust pizza .","301690":"yeah , it wasn t enjoyable for me .","301691":"paid for my friend s tab because they didn t have enough money on hand and their card got declined .","301692":"i prefer pubg . i don t really like the gameplay of fortnite and pubg is really entertaining to watch .","301693":"it s my favorite type of story , haha . most of what i write is on the darker side .","301694":"lol . i m a bit hesitant for people to read it because it s so dark , i just hope no one gets concerned and think it s non fiction .","301695":"would anyone be interested in reading a short fictional story i wrote this week ? ? tw for really dark topics , i . e . death svicide .","301696":"no clue . i have big issues with my self confidence .","301697":"i d rather not be old to the point where a person would have to take care of me .","301698":"i wouldn t want to live that long , lol .","301699":"i smoke cigarettes , i drink alcohol , and i have mental illness . my chances of living to years old are slim .","301700":"i like both , depending on my mood . most of my major trips are planned but i do make spontaneous plans occasionally .","301701":"i m not going to live that long , so no .","301702":"probably not at this point in my life . i don t have the stamina for that .","301703":"it depends on how important love is to that person . some people don t place much importance on relationships , so they don t seek it out , while others desire a relationship and actively search for love . everyone is different , so there isn t a right or wrong answer to this question .","301704":"no , i ve never gone hiking before . however , it is something i ve always wanted to try .","301705":"sounds like a plan .","301706":"the last song i heard was good old days by macklemore and kesha , it was on the radio . i actually do have memories attached to that song because my boyfriend and i used to play it all the time since it reminded us of old times .","301707":"it s difficult for me to make friends at first because i m usually closed off distant , and i don t trust people until getting to know them thoroughly . i don t have an interest in making new friends , either way , so it isn t something that bothers me .","301708":"a fresh cup of coffee , writing something i m proud of , spending time with my boyfriend , grabbing a drink with a close friend , listening to music , positive reinforcement , helping other people in terms of their mental health and relationships , playing video games , reading a compelling book , and spending time in nature .","301709":"i put my boyfriend s happiness first , depending on the situation . if it s a situation that doesn t affect my well being or mental state at all , then i ll gladly put him first . however , if something occurs where putting him first would damage me somehow , then i would talk to him about the situation to see if there s any resolution we can come to where we can both benefit from it .","301710":"uh . . . just message them ? ? it isn t really all that difficult . just tell them what you re feeling , and if they don t respond , then so be it . you tried all that you could .","301711":"i went to work , came home and had a cigarette , made myself a cup of coffee , and made plans to go out with a friend tonight .","301712":"aw , thank you is going rather well , actually . i ve been quite productive and i even wrote a short story essay thing within the past two weeks that i finished today . i just need to proofread it a few more times and see if there are any ways to improve it .","301713":"invader zim ! ! i used to be obsessed with that show when i was younger .","301714":"i joined askfm because formspring . me died out i wanted another place to go in order to answer questions .","301715":"i used to meditate when i was younger , or at least try to meditate , but i only successfully did it a few times . my mind is usually racing and it s difficult for me to calm down and get into that sort of mindset , especially with my anxiety .","301716":"you won t know unless you reach out to them . i would say give it a shot you have nothing to lose .","301717":"i don t believe i ve ever done that , honestly . whenever i go out , i have a destination because i absolutely hate driving around , so i only do it when necessary .","301718":"i m sorry you re feeling this way . i assume you meant that it wasn t going to work . however , any breakup hurts both people involved , but eventually the pain does get easier to cope with as long as you have support . if you need to cry , then cry there s nothing wrong with it . crying releases endorphins which makes you feel better .","301719":"telling you that they ll make it up to you is somewhat an apology . however , i don t know the situation because i don t know who you or your friend are , so i can only base my answers off of what you ve given me . regardless , i believe it s something you two should discuss considering you obviously still care .","301720":"my parents , lmao . i try to avoid being visibly drunk around them at all costs .","301721":"i prefer poland spring or smartwater . other waters have either a stale or metallic taste to it , in my opinion .","301722":"yes , absolutely . i don t like where i live anyway .","301723":"honestly , i doubt they ll talk to you about it because the way you responded was a bit insensitive and gives off the impression that you don t care . even though they were rude , they told you that they would make it up to you , but you brushed it off .","301724":"my favorite band is linkin park , and the first song i heard from them was somewhere i belong back in .","301725":"nobody knows yet , lol . they implemented the whole coin thing months ago but never explained what they were for .","301726":"yeah , well song lyrics , at least . i never wrote a song on an instrument , but i used to write lyrics all the time .","301727":"rum soaked cannoli cake is a godsend .","301728":"not anymore , no . i used to regret doing a lot of things , but considering there s nothing i can do to reverse what i ve done , it s a bit taxing and useless to regret them . it only hurts me in the end . the best thing i can do is learn from those experiences .","301729":"i think it depends on the individual . it s impossible to class an entire group of people and make a blanket statement like that .","301730":"take a hot , relaxing shower pop on some netflix or hulu and crack open a few beers .","301731":"based on the information you just gave me , it does sound kinda rude especially with the duh . if you re concerned , which i assume you are since you sent this message out to a few people , then just talk to them again and apologize for sounding a bit brash .","301732":"so ? ? who gives a sh t . if it doesn t affect your life then why worry about it .","301733":"there s this one friend i have where we solely go out drinking together . it isn t necessarily on purpose though , we re just only available to see each other after like pm and the bar is the easiest place to go .","301734":"see my boyfriend and chill out while watching netflix for a few hours . i also like doing laundry and cleaning because it makes me feel better when everything is done .","301735":"lol . yeah tom , gtfo ! !","301736":"uh , i m pretty sure i m older than babycadiexo . lmao .","301737":"at my boyfriend s house , preferably when we have the house to ourselves and we can do whatever we please . it feels like a small vacation every time i visit him .","301738":"i like ariana grande s new songs , lol .","301739":"i don t think askfm is dead it all depends on who you follow . my page is relatively active .","301740":", .","301741":"i took french for two years when i was in high school , but that was over years ago .","301742":"because i never learned another language . lol .","301743":"i only know how to speak english .","301744":"november th .","301745":"why would i say goodbye on askfm ? ?","301746":"most people in general . i m content with being alone .","301747":"i don t like most condiments on my burgers , so it s never been appealing to me . if i order a burger , it s usually plain with cheese , lettuce , and tomato .","301748":"sure , why not ? ? it s the cycle of life .","301749":"nature is the most beautiful thing in my eyes .","301750":"i ve never had a big mac before .","301751":"lol . i ve seen that game on the xbox store but i have no idea what it even is . one of my friends plays it all the time .","301752":"i think it depends on the individual . ironically , i recently had another anon post in my inbox about how they feel terrible about their physical appearance and prefer how they look through snapchat . i do have to admit , most of my selfies are taken through snapchat because it clears up my skin and thins out my face . however , i already have low self esteem to begin with , so idk if it really has an effect on it at all .","301753":"yeah , i agree . i m just happy for the moment that i can still file my taxes .","301754":"thankfully , we haven t been affected by the shutdown . however , i know a few people who are because they re federal employees .","301755":"my family has their own mailbox by the front door .","301756":"i crack my knuckles and back at least once per hour , lmao . i know it s terrible for you , but my hands and back are normally in so much pain . cracking sometimes relieves that pain .","301757":"it depends on what i need to get done versus what i want to get done , if i have anything to do that day to begin with . on a regular day where i feel motivated , i ll usually do laundry and clean . i also run errands sometimes early in the morning if i need to pick anything up from the store . however , if i m exhausted or not feeling up to anything , then i usually just stay home and catch up on sleep .","301758":"monday when i went over my boyfriend s house .","301759":"i usually like dark roasts . i get the french roast at starbucks the brazilian roast at .","301760":"yes ! ! lmao . you re definitely not alone , i m sure we re not the only people who do this .","301761":"yeah , he s never had an issue with my teeth .","301762":"i know , lol . i just never have the energy to brush my teeth at night . i ll do it if i m going out somewhere , but if i m staying home , then i never leave my bed .","301763":"for those who don t know , the new abortion law in new york state says that people can have an abortion after weeks if the mother s health is at mortal risk . i percent support the new law . doctors have been persecuted in the past for saving people s lives by aborting after weeks , and this law ensures that the mother s well being and safety is taken seriously .","301764":"it s normally fairly windy where i live as it is , and the wind factor around my office building is absolutely ridiculous . there s really no way to avoid the wind , so i usually just endure it .","301765":"it s normally gray and very windy , and occasionally we get snowstorms where we get anywhere between inches of snow , depending on how severe the storm is .","301766":"they absolutely terrify me because i m always forced to drive in icy weather . this past monday was really icy , it dropped down to degrees fahrenheit during the day , which made for slippery roads because it had rained the previous day .","301767":"around pm these days . i can t wait until the spring , when i can actually drive home from work in daylight instead of pitch darkness .","301768":"my wednesday wasn t terrible , but it also wasn t great either . i couldn t get out of bed on time this morning , but i still ended up arriving to work before am , which was a relief . work dragged , but i had a good lunch with my coworkers , which broke the day up nicely . i ve only been home for about an hour , and i m planning on doing absolutely nothing tonight .","301769":"yes , i wish i had a more defined jawline , since i absolutely hate how i look when you view me from the side . i wish i was skinnier as well .","301770":"to improve my hygiene , perhaps i could brush my teeth twice per day instead of once per day and floss more often . other than that , my hygiene is pretty well managed . i m so paranoid about looking dirty or smelling bad , so i always make sure that my hair looks clean and that i have some sort of pleasant scent on .","301771":"it s difficult for me to describe the taste of food , especially verbally as i ve always had a hard time expressing my thoughts and feelings verbally . i m not really all that interested in food to begin with , so it also has never been something that has occurred to me .","301772":"january has flown by , honestly . i don t recall much of what i ve done in january at all all i ve been doing is working , and occasionally seeing a friend or two and my boyfriend on a regular basis . however , this past monday was a wonderful day it was the most fun i ve had in a really long time . my boyfriend and his friends and i all got together , and we ended up playing video games and poker together until am .","301773":"my hobbies include writing , reading , browsing the internet lol , playing video games , watching television shows documentaries , hanging out with friends , and painting . i don t know if these hobbies make me who i am , although they are a large part of who i am . and it s easier for me to identify with material objects and interests as opposed to ideas and personality traits .","301774":"lol . the last time i isolated myself was tonight , actually . i m currently shut away in my room , drinking coffee and listening to music and drowning out the sounds of my household . i don t want to bother with anyone , i just want to be left alone in the quietness .","301775":"i certainly hope not . i m not quite as adventurous as i used to be , but i still have a passion for seeking new experiences as they help me learn and evolve as a human .","301776":"i m hard on myself because i know i can do better than how i m currently doing . i can work harder than how i m currently working . i can put more effort into my appearance , i can take more time looking after my health , and i can be more productive if i sacrificed a few things in my life . i m hard on myself because i deserve to be hard on myself , because you cannot improve without looking at yourself critically .","301777":"i believe it would help me eat healthier food , and i rarely eat meat products to begin with as it is . i already transitioned to black bean veggie burgers instead of beef burgers .","301778":"not generally , no . i have the tendency to be rather pessimistic , especially in light of terrible circumstances . i always expect the worst to happen , and when something bad does happen , i become very overwhelmed .","301779":"yes , i eat meat occasionally . i m not vegetarian or vegan , although i would like to transition to vegetarianism eventually .","301780":"i surpassed my expected number of completed assignments this morning , which was a pleasant surprise and made me proud of myself . i was expecting to complete between at the most , but i managed to write narratives within four hours .","301781":"i have no interest in obtaining power , and i m not a powerful person by any means . i know how to be a leader when it s warranted , but it isn t a position i m comfortable being in sometimes because i m afraid of ab sing my power privilege .","301782":"most of the time , i m a very patient person . i m willing to work with other people and give them the benefit of the doubt if they re learning something new or don t understand a concept or action . however , sometimes i can be rather impatient . it mostly happens with myself because my mind works faster than my body can handle , and often i become frustrated with myself because i m not moving as fast or as efficiently as i want to be .","301783":"i m more honest to others than i am to myself . it s difficult for me to be honest with myself with certain subjects because the truth can be hard to swallow .","301784":"i don t know about the country as a whole , but the most common complaint in my region is that rent and mortgages are extremely expensive . it s difficult for people to live independently because an average ranch styled home is k on average , and rent for a one bedroom apartment varies between . k and . k .","301785":"i can t really make that determination at the moment because i simply don t know how puberty blockers hormones will be years down the line . as they are now , puberty blockers are mostly detrimental to a child s development so there is a lot of controversy regarding giving children under the age of hormones . i would be hesitant to say yes because i don t know how it would affect their health , but obviously i would be percent supportive of their need to transition .","301786":"i ve been given a lot more chances that i realistically shouldn t have been given in the first place . i have a tendency to screw up a lot , act selfishly , become distant , etc etc . my boyfriend knows how to call out my behavior when it warrants correction , but he has also given me a lot of second , third , and fourth chances when i really didn t deserve them .","301787":"ah , yes . well maybe not tomorrow , but definitely over the weekend .","301788":"i believe it varies from relationship to relationship , since everyone has different qualities which are attractive to their partner . personally speaking , what has kept the spark alive in my relationship is our ability to have genuine fun together , where we can sit down and talk joke around and laugh until tears are rolling down our faces . we also go out together occasionally , where we ll either go bowling or go to a brewery , etc etc . making memories and experiencing is what keeps my relationship alive , and we ve become not only partners but also best friends .","301789":"it depends on the lie itself , since it s difficult to give a blanket statement regarding all white lies since they all range in subject and severity .","301790":"paul rudd , jason statham , robert downey jr . , jack nicholson , tom felton , and leonardo dicaprio .","301791":"hello do you have a question ? ?","301792":"i play video games on the xbox one , and most of the games i play are first person shooters or open world rpgs . my favorite game atm is fallout , but i also love the rest of the fallout series , the elder scrolls series , the assassin s creed series , the tomb raider series , the bioshock collection , life is strange , the wolf among us , the walking dead , etc etc .","301793":"ideally , i would love to create a novel or a book of short stories poetry . it s something that has always been a goal of mine ever since i was a teenager . within the past year , i have been writing more frequently , which i believe is a step in the right direction .","301794":"most recently , i was stuck in traffic . lol . it took me nearly an hour to get home from work today . however , in a more metaphorical sense , i was stuck when i graduated from college had no idea what profession i wanted to pursue . i ended up working retail for an additional year after graduating because i didn t know what sort of career i wanted , and eventually i began looking for jobs that had to do with writing and editing .","301795":"you shouldn t wait to take an opportunity that may present itself in rare , or once in a lifetime , occasions . our lives on this earth are short and fleeting , and we should take advantage of unique opportunities that provide growth , fun , and experience .","301796":"i don t believe in heaven . however , for the sake of answering this question , i ll pretend that it exists to me . if i were to somehow go to heaven , it would probably be filled with things that bring me peace , people who enriched my life prior to their passing , and a general sense of tranquility and well being .","301797":"i was stunned when i saw linkin park perform live in concert for the first time . i ended up sobbing towards the end of the show because of how moving it was . i ve seen them at least times in concert since then , and every show was magical , fantastic , and heartfelt .","301798":"yeah , i believe that there are some people out there who are too friendly to the point where their kindness is often taken advantage of and they become hurt as a result . in some cases , people who are too friendly don t know how to say no , which results in them getting stuck in awkward situations .","301799":"peppermint , lavender , sage , yellow and pink roses , and sunflowers .","301800":"continue to survive when all i wanted to do was crawl into a hole and d e .","301801":"i suppose . i m a pretty boring person though .","301802":"i ve never watched it before , but i don t think i would enjoy it .","301803":"yeah , i ve been driving since i was .","301804":"sleeping is my favorite hobby .","301805":"probably ? ? i can t really predict that , lol .","301806":"no , i don t go home for another four hours .","301807":"depends on what sort of liquor it is . i usually mix vodka and rum with sodas , but i drink moonshine , amaretto , and elderflower liquor on the rocks .","301808":"honestly , i usually just try to sleep it off these days . when i m sad , it normally turns into depression where i have no motivation or will to live , so i wind up sleeping all day .","301809":"oatmeal , three pieces of toast , and chicken noodle soup .","301810":"no , i m still middle class despite living in a sh tty area . i m definitely not below the poverty line , haha .","301811":"no , not at all . lmao .","301812":"no , i m middle class .","301813":"if i had to choose only one goal , it would be to continue pushing myself to write regularly .","301814":"i have no plans except to sleep and complete some freelance work .","301815":"because they re under the impression that god only loves you if you re x , y , or z . even though religions do teach to accept everyone , a lot of people from different faiths interpret texts at their own free will to suit their own bias or agenda .","301816":"no , not generally . when i m tired , i m more apt to be silent . when i m drunk , i m more prone to speaking my mind without a filter but i m usually in a good mood .","301817":"yes , this too .","301818":"my boyfriend keeps things in perspective for me .","301819":"i ve literally never said that . people have asked me if i thought others were fake if they don t post photos of themselves online , and the only specific thing i can recall saying is that perhaps they re insecure with themselves and don t feel comfortable posting photos on the internet .","301820":"that s not true . no one is obligated to post photos of themselves on social media , and lnr isn t pretending to be someone else either . if she was fake , then she would have used someone else s photo and pretended to be that person .","301821":"that isn t a question i can answer , considering i m not lnr . a person isn t fake because they re uncomfortable with photos of themselves on the internet . it just means they want their identity to be kept private .","301822":"right , and that doesn t make you fake at all . there are dozens of people on the internet who don t post photos of themselves , it s simply a privacy matter .","301823":"lol , no . if i thought lnr was fake , then i wouldn t interact with her on social media .","301824":"no , i m not a superstitious person at all .","301825":"yeah , we follow each other on other social media as well . cc lnr","301826":"i haven t done that since i was a teenager .","301827":"that might describe me , yeah . i wear a lot of flannels , skinny jeans , knee high boots , cardigans , and tank tops .","301828":"i don t really have a style . i just wear what s comfortable .","301829":"hello do you have a question ? ?","301830":"lol . hell no .","301831":"i can certainly sing , but that doesn t mean i sing well .","301832":"well , i did other questionable things that were definitely illegal during that time too . but i understand what you mean .","301833":"some were friends , others were acquaintances .","301834":"you are absolutely correct .","301835":"no , i m not proud of the things i did in my past . however , i m not going to deny that they happened either . i m pretty neutral towards those situations at this point . they re a part of who i used to be .","301836":"lol . honestly , that entire era of my life is a blur .","301837":"uh , probably cocaine , lol . there was one time in particular that i remember being sloppy drunk , and suddenly i was doing cocaine with everyone else in the motel room . needless to say , i don t remember much else about that night .","301838":"it could be , because i feel the same way with people i m close with . i m incredibly clingy when it comes to my boyfriend and closest friends , to the point where i feel as if my life would be in shambles if they disappeared from it . there s a weird disconnect , though . usually the people i cut from my life were never that close to me to begin with , or if they were like one or two people were , then something terrible must have happened for me to finally cut that person out of my life .","301839":"aw , thank you","301840":"i ve never threatened to cause physical harm to a person , no . mainly because i m a tiny , frail excuse for a human being and it wouldn t make sense for me to threaten someone when i wouldn t be able to follow through with it .","301841":"whoops , i didn t answer this before the weekend ended , lol . my weekend was actually good , i saw my boyfriend for three days in a row , which felt really nice because we seldom see each other anymore perhaps only once to twice per week . last night , we invited a few of his friends over for games and poker , and it was the most fun i ve had in a really long time .","301842":"no , it s relatively easy for me to cut people from my life . if someone pushes me to the point where i m contemplating removing them from my life entirely , then i have no feelings toward them anymore . i ve removed plenty of people from my life without a second thought .","301843":"i think the shutdown is pretty pointless . government employees are filing for unemployment because they don t know how long the shutdown is going to last , and it s detrimental to thousands of americans who live paycheck to paycheck .","301844":"i always fantasize about having a day to myself where i don t have anything to do where i can sleep in as long as i want , drink as much coffee as i want , and not leave the house at all .","301845":"i prefer leather jackets , boots , blue jeans , cowboy boots , beanies , and army print .","301846":"i think it s too early to say for certain who will win the presidential race in . however , as much as i dislike trump , i don t think i would be surprised if he was elected to office again . he still has some strong supporters despite the chaos that has happened in the past few years .","301847":"sometimes , but it s also something that i ve continuously worked on for many years . i used to hold a grudge for a long time , but i ve recently learned to let things go because grudges mainly hurt you , not the other person .","301848":"oh really ? ? i didn t know that about her , i thought she was a woman . and yes , i abvsed drugs alcohol , but i wasn t into the whole party lifestyle and i m definitely not into that now , lol . even when i had my party stage for lack of a better term , it only lasted a few years when i was to years old , which was a long time ago .","301849":"amazon , lol . i buy pretty much any miscellaneous thing i need from amazon because i have prime , so the two day shipping is hard to resist .","301850":"no , i don t believe courtney love had any role to play in the death of kurt cobain . i believe he completed svicide . when i watched the documentary soaked in bleach , however , i found the opposing viewpoints to be very interesting , though . i don t know if it s still on netflix or not , but i really enjoyed watching it because it raised a lot of questions .","301851":"no , that doesn t describe me at all . i m non binary , and i had a pixie cut once when i was years old . i m not interested in party lifestyles , and i absolutely hate dancing . i ve also never been punk before , either in personality or in clothing , and i m not open in a sxxual manner .","301852":"i don t believe that the wall should be built . the resources and funds that would go into the wall would be far better suited to fixing what s already wrong with this country or go towards helping homeless citizens , veterans , and health care . i also haven t read up too much on it , but apparently the wall would disrupt the environment located along the border and displace species of animals .","301853":"yes , i absolutely believe that he s guilty . i haven t watched the documentary on him yet , but apparently there s very strong , compelling evidence within the documentary of him behaving this way since he was much , much younger .","301854":"no , i ve never compared myself to miley cyrus before nor has anyone else .","301855":"yes , i believe in extraterrestrial beings , or at least life existing in some format elsewhere in the universe . to think that the earth is the only planet that can sustain life , when we haven t discovered a fraction of the universe , is a wee bit ignorant .","301856":"the killing on netflix was an absolute gem imo , if you love true crime and police dramas and whatnot . i m not sure if it s still on netflix anymore because i watched it over a year ago , but the storytelling was compelling .","301857":"i think it would be a good idea for victoria s secret to offer plus sized options . i honestly didn t even know that they didn t sell clothing in plus sizes , lol . i m sure they would garner a broader audience by offering more sizes .","301858":"it depends on what s bringing me down in the first place . if i m in the midst of a depressive episode , then pretty much nothing can cheer me up and the only thing i can do is ride the wave wait until it passes . otherwise , my boyfriend s words and actions have the potential to cheer me up if i m upset , overwhelmed , anxious , etc etc . he always knows what to say to help me .","301859":"above all else , i hope askfm improves their blocking reporting system . there are plenty of users on this site who can make endless accounts and continually harass others , while people who are productive members of the site get banned for no reason whatsoever .","301860":"i don t greet my neighbors . however , it depends on the individual and how close i am to them . my greeting changes depending on who its with .","301861":"i m sure there are a lot of factors that play into the stereotype , but i m honestly not going to research the history behind it right now .","301862":"yes , i know quite a few people who are like that . i try to limit my communication with them as much as possible .","301863":"i ve never visited any of those countries before , and they ve always been placed that i wanted to explore .","301864":"i have had friends ruin my trust in them before , and i never sought revenge . i just ended up cutting them out of my life entirely .","301865":"unfortunately , a nuclear bomb would be more detrimental to the environment than to the human race .","301866":"i would personally confront him about it , especially considering how close you two are . the next time it happens , perhaps tell him , hey ! my eyes are up here ! or something along those lines , and then proceed to explain that it makes you uncomfortable when he does that .","301867":"no , i don t mind discussing my prior relationships at all . my boyfriend is also open about his past relationships , it s been a topic of conversation for us on many occasions .","301868":"i certainly hope so . the human race has wrecked havoc on this earth .","301869":"i consider myself to be intelligent , but there is always room for improvement . no matter how much i ve learned and continue to learn , there will always be subjects and ideas worth pursuing .","301870":"perhaps in terms of weirdness . i m not completely out there , but i do have particular quirks .","301871":"yes , i play video games pretty regularly . lately i ve been focused on fallout , but i also love the elder scrolls , assassin s creed , the bioshock series , halo , tomb raider , far cry , and minecraft , among other games .","301872":"lol . you re thinking of martin luther , who lived in the th century . martin luther king jr was a minister and activist of the th century who led the civil rights movement .","301873":"my first job was at a drug store , i was a cashier .","301874":"sometimes , i do enjoy life . last night , for example , was probably the most fun i ve had in quite a long time . my boyfriend had a few of his friends over we spent the night playing xbox and poker . i was laughing so hard that tears were streaming down my face at one point .","301875":"when i was in high school , my favorite subject was english . i loved learning about different time periods of literature and studying classic novels .","301876":"yes , i ve always loved setting up camp in riften for some reason , lol .","301877":"occasionally , yes . i ve learned how to cope more effectively with stress , but that unfortunately doesn t make the feeling of stress go away . sometimes it does catch me off guard and i panic .","301878":"no , i m not religious at all . i m an athiest .","301879":"me too ! ! i can definitely see myself living as a nord in the snowy mountains of skyrim , lol .","301880":"i don t blame you i ve always been uncomfortable changing in front of people too . personally , i would find a bathroom and change in there instead of getting changed around other people . although you also have to remember that other people likely have the same thoughts you do in that they don t want to be seen either , and they re more likely focusing on themselves rather than other people .","301881":"i m already friends with people whose perspectives and opinions differ from mine . if you surround yourself with people who thought exactly the same as you , then it becomes difficult for you to grow and see things from other points of view .","301882":"i would probably love living in tamriel the world in the elder scrolls video games .","301883":"the lord of the rings will always be my favorite fantasy films .","301884":"i don t buy chocolate , but i wouldn t consider such an act to be self indulgent . if an individual wants chocolate to eat , then they should have the freedom to buy chocolate .","301885":"freshly cut grass , gasoline , snowfall , lavender , patchouli , dragon s blood , and roses .","301886":"i was unaware that i was anything other than tame .","301887":"the south is portrayed that way in the media , and so society has basically adopted those viewpoints to the point where now most people believe that those who live in the southern us are bigoted , uneducated , and overly religious .","301888":"no , i have no interest in talking to you or anyone else for that matter .","301889":"no , i have no intentions of leaving askfm anytime soon .","301890":"no ? ? i m no one special , lol . and one day , i ll probably leave for good .","301891":"yesss , i routinely watch the dr . pimple popper videos on instagram .","301892":"no , i don t like ginger itself .","301893":"since when has that been new ? ? i ve been saying that for years , lol .","301894":"normally because i go hours without answering questions because i m asleep and then i m working , so questions accumulate by the time i get home .","301895":"no , the only ginger thing i enjoy is ginger tea . i don t even eat ginger because the texture is weird to me .","301896":"i didn t get to see it in all of its super wolf blood moon glory , but i saw the pictures it looked beautiful . i wish i could have seen it in person .","301897":"somewhat , sure . if i don t understand something , then i ll just google it quickly .","301898":"no , they have no desire to contact each other or even hear each other s name anymore .","301899":". . . why can t you tell her that ? ? enjoying cuddling isn t embarrassing at all , it s a universally loved concept well , most people do at least . if it s something you enjoy , then tell her you would like to do it more often .","301900":"no ? ? lmao . why , am i using it often ? ? it s a word that i use regularly at work , and i notice that my work jargon spills over into my regular vocabulary after a while .","301901":"i ve been in this situation for a few years now , and it doesn t really make a difference to me . my cousin one of my close friends were best friends up until something put a rift in their friendship , and now they hate each other . however , i still see each of them separately pretty regularly . it s not something that s ever been an issue for me because they re both aware that i still see the other person . they just don t bother bringing their name up anymore .","301902":"my first relationship somewhat ended on bad terms because of how hurt i was at the conclusion of it , and we ended up not talking for a few years subsequent to the breakup . however , we re best friends now so it doesn t matter much anymore .","301903":"yeah , it s martin luther king jr . day . i m fairly certain it s a federal holiday , post offices and government buildings are closed and whatnot .","301904":"i ve never been in a situation where someone was outwardly jealous of me , lol . however , if their feelings and subsequent actions are detrimental to my well being , then i would sit down and talk to them about the way they re feeling and if there s any way to help the situation at all .","301905":"that isn t really something i can answer unless it actually happens . it would depend entirely on circumstance the reason why we broke up , my feelings towards him , my emotions overall , etc etc .","301906":"my monday has been fine so far i got to work super early so i found a nice parking spot , i had a productive work day , and my commute home only took me minutes ! ! i m just eating dinner then i m going to head to my boyfriend s house to hang out with him and his friends .","301907":"i usually eat avocado on toast with a fried egg , or on a blt sandwich , or on a salad , or inside of sushi .","301908":"i prefer to answer questions . i seldom ask questions anymore unless i m incredibly bored my feed is dead .","301909":"i have a tellonym ! ! i don t really know what i think about it yet , considering there isn t much traffic on my page . but it s pretty much the same idea as askfm . https tellonym . me poetalunam","301910":"i had a pixie cut when i was in high school .","301911":"yes , i m currently wearing a necklace my boyfriend bought me for xmas .","301912":"my day was fine , but uneventful . my commute was really easy considering a lot of people are off from work today , so that made my day a little brighter .","301913":"all i did today was work . i woke up around am , went to work , and i just got home around minutes ago .","301914":"i m doing well , although my entire body hurts from all the physical labor i did yesterday , lmao . i m excited to sit down and relax .","301915":"i just got home from work , so not much at the moment . i m about to heat up some dinner then head back out to my boyfriend s house .","301916":"hello do you have a question ? ?","301917":"hello do you have a question ? ?","301918":"aw , thank you","301919":"right now , it s degrees fahrenheit windy . it s supposed to go down to degrees fahrenheit by the early morning with a wind chill of .","301920":"friends . i think it s a somewhat funny show , but definitely not as hilarious as most people make it out to be .","301921":"i m a big wine enthusiast . my favorite types are pinot grigio cabernet sauvignon . i have a few preferred brands , but i like pindar vineyards a lot .","301922":"yes , i love fish ! ! fun fact my boyfriend i redid one of his tanks today . it looks so beautiful .","301923":"no , i m not a big fan of his music from what i ve heard of it .","301924":"no , i ve never worn fake lashes .","301925":"australia , new zealand , and cuba .","301926":"no , it s literally just my character from fallout . lmao .","301927":"obviously those people have no souls .","301928":"lol , i wish i didn t have to . but it s my job i unfortunately have to go in .","301929":"i don t want to go to work tomorrow . the roads are supposed to be super icy and i m nervous about driving in .","301930":"it s cheaper to make it ourselves , but sometimes we like to treat ourselves and order in .","301931":"yeah , that s unfortunately normal it happens to me a lot too . that s why a lot of my selfies are from snapchat , lol .","301932":"because their personality is less attractive to you .","301933":"yes , i thoroughly enjoy sleep . i try to sleep as much as i possibly can .","301934":"about an hour ago , lmao . my boyfriend and i ordered chicken parm for dinner .","301935":"it isn t terribly cold out rn . it s only degrees fahrenheit .","301936":"you asked me this last night , so i ll answer in regards to last night last night , i felt terrific . i saw my boyfriend for the first time in about a week , so we spent the night watching the new season of the punisher on netflix .","301937":"i started reading wildly into the dark by tyler knott gregson last week , and it s beautiful so far .","301938":"just be yourself the right person will come along . you shouldn t feel then need to be something you re not in order to attract a person s attention , and if that happens , then they ve become attracted to a version of you that s a facade , which isn t healthy . just continue living your life to the best of your ability and remain true to yourself .","301939":"i don t know anything about him , so i can t give an informed opinion .","301940":"gender dysphoria is in the dsm v but it isn t classified as a disorder in itself , which is why they changed it from gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria . the new name seeks to remove the stigma associated with the condition and provide greater understanding , although a lot of people in the trans community think it should be declassified entirely .","301941":"yeah , i usually order general tso s chicken when i have the option for chinese .","301942":"no , being transgender isn t a mental illness .","301943":"no , i didn t even know she was still on askfm .","301944":"yes . all dogs are puppies regardless of their actual age .","301945":"no , i haven t . i ve never left the east coast of the united states .","301946":"i have no idea , i don t really know anything about her at all .","301947":"no , i left my last jobs on really good terms . neither job wanted me to leave , lol .","301948":"i m neutral on clowns . i don t like or dislike them .","301949":"i know how to cook simple meals , but that s pretty much it .","301950":"i ve never dated a single mom before , so i wouldn t know .","301951":"i definitely think so . you start to appreciate their physical qualities and notice things you didn t notice before . same concept as when you either fall out of love with someone or don t like someone anymore . sometimes they become less physically attractive .","301952":"i ve been trying to grow out my fingernails , but it s been difficult for me because i m a constant nail biter .","301953":"yeah , sometimes . if he has to clean then i ll help him , but we haven t cooked in a while . usually we just order food or his family makes food for everyone .","301954":"i just laid down for about an hour , and now i m going to shower head to my boyfriend s house for the next two days .","301955":"a troll is someone who instigates drama in order to entertain themselves despite the fact that it might hurt someone . a troll is also a person who relentlessly bullies someone else for their own amusement .","301956":"i m more curious than frightened . there s a lot for me to look forward to in my future .","301957":"i prefer rose gold or silver .","301958":"i just recently heard her covering a temple of the dog song say hello to heaven and i think she should do more rock music , because it was hella good .","301959":"i don t have any photos of myself from this year yet .","301960":"baby leigh","301961":"i don t normally encounter people with bad hygiene , so it never crosses my mind .","301962":"i think an interesting fact would perhaps be something that people wouldn t expect about you , or maybe it s a controversial opinion that you hold or something that s relatively uncommon . whereas an uninteresting fact would be something that s commonplace and boring .","301963":"my name is leigh i m years old . i m addicted to caffeine nicotine . i m a mental health advocate . i have a bachelor s degree in communications professional writing with a minor in english literature . i currently work as a writer editor . i m an avid video game enthusiast . i have seven tattoos , i m planning on getting dozens more . i have a boyfriend , with whom i ve been in a relationship for nearly years . i currently have blue hair half my head is shaved . my favorite genres of music are alternative rock , nu metal , hip hop , and instrumentals video game movie soundtracks .","301964":"i think it s normal , but i also don t believe that it s okay . if you re missing a past relationship , then you re clearly not entirely happy with your current relationship . if you were happy then you wouldn t have a reason to miss an old relationship at all .","301965":"i used to in the past , but not anymore . i m not going to take responsibility or blame for something that wasn t my fault because i don t want to give that person the satisfaction of knowing that they can control me .","301966":"i m normally incredibly hard on myself because it s the only way i can keep myself motivated . it s great if i accomplish something , but in what ways can i make it better ? ? i m not at the top of my game , and there are always methods for improvement .","301967":"probably not , unless they were directly speaking to me about it . i m not going to come out of the woodworks to a complete stranger and tell them my opinion on the lgbtq community .","301968":"i like them both equally . he s very attractive to me , but his personality is what has kept us together for so long . he s such a humorous , understanding , hard working , and creative person , and i ve always admired him over the years .","301969":"it s acceptable to voice judgment when the person you re speaking with asks for your opinion . i believe it s unacceptable in most cases to judge something or voice your opinions on things if someone isn t explicitly asking , unless that person is in danger or something similar .","301970":"i never used to think i was strong , but over the course of many years and through attending a lot of therapy sessions , i ve realized my strength . i endured a lot of things growing up , and although i have struggled and continue to struggle enduring those circumstances have only been a testament to my strength because i ve managed to not succumb to my past and i ve tried to live a successful life in spite of my mental health bringing me down .","301971":"when i was a child , i used to read the dictionary for fun .","301972":"i m not hypocritical , as far as i m aware .","301973":"that s normal , but not all psychiatrists are like that . there s one psychiatrist in the office i go to who only sees patients for minutes at most just to refill medication , and i ve never personally been a fan of that . you might be better off trying to find a different psychiatrist , especially if you want to discuss diagnoses and get to the root of your mental health instead of just being on medication for your current symptoms . there are psychiatrists out there who are willing to work with you on that , you just have to find them .","301974":"my country isn t the best country in the world , lol . the united states is basically the laughing stock of the earth right now .","301975":"it s normal for temperatures to hover in the s fahrenheit , but it s gotten into the s before as well .","301976":"sometimes , it does ! ! i ve noticed that it wakes me up in the morning , but it relaxes me in the evening . i can easily go to bed after drinking a cup of coffee it won t affect me , lol .","301977":"yeah , i thought i had bpd prior to my diagnosis because i had done a lot of research online regarding different mental illnesses and everything about bpd resonated with me on a very deep level . originally , i thought i had depersonalization derealization disorder , but over the course of many years , bpd stood out more because it touched upon everything from my emotions to my behavior . i was diagnosed by my former psychiatrist she since retired after seeing her for almost a year . i miss her a lot , because she allowed me to talk about my feelings and my past and we discussed how my upbringing influenced my current behavioral trends . the psychiatrist i have now isn t so great and i ve been thinking about finding a new one .","301978":"i don t know much about him other than the fact that he ruled the soviet union in the early th century .","301979":"i used to ride the bus in the mornings then walk home from school in the afternoons .","301980":"i m relatively easy going , so i ve never had a dream date any time that i spend with my boyfriend is time that i cherish , and our dates in the past have ranged from going out to dinner and the movies , to walking around and taking photos in the park , to taking a spontaneous road trip .","301981":"a catch is a situation in which there is no logical escape due to conflicting or contradictory circumstances or rules . i . e . the whole idea of you have to have money in order to make money is a catch , because if you don t have money in the first place , it s difficult to make money since you don t have the money required to make that money in the first place .","301982":"cuddle up with my boyfriend while watching a movie or watching him play video games , while drinking coffee or tea .","301983":"no , not at all . there are a lot of people i don t find attractive , and there are also people who have ugly personalities as well .","301984":"i already explained why chester was a big influence in my life unless you didn t see that post . even though he passed away , he still had an enormous influence on my life and taught me how to cope with what i was enduring in the past . his struggle with his own demons made me feel less alone at the time , and just because he completed s icide doesn t mean he wasn t a good role model for me .","301985":"absolutely ! ! going on medication is entirely your choice , and you can see a psychologist and get a diagnosis while also learning healthy coping skills .","301986":"yeah , i was bullied a lot when i was in middle school .","301987":"no , probably not .","301988":"yeah , i cut ties with a lot of people in the past because i knew my behavior at the time was toxic and borderline manipulative , and i didn t want those friends to endure that anymore .","301989":"rofl . what in the world would make you think i would do that ? ? at least spell them right , geez .","301990":"according to the reliable internet , apparently the distinct difference between emotions feelings is that emotions are event driven , while feelings are learned behaviors that are triggered by an external event . there s a really good article about them here https www . laughteronlineuniversity . com feelings and emotions","301991":"no , i m basically living in a state of perpetual exhaustion .","301992":"i have a instagram . however , it s private i only accept follow requests from people i know .","301993":"i already explained the reasons why . it isn t necessary to repeat them .","301994":"i just finished up some freelance work , and now i m going to attempt to finish an essay i started writing earlier this week .","301995":"you ll have to be more specific . i have no idea why you re saying why not .","301996":"i m indifferent . people can wear whatever they re most comfortable wearing , it doesn t make a difference in my life .","301997":"friendship doesn t happen upon request . it normally happens naturally , not by a person asking someone else can we become friends ? or anything . either way , you re anonymous . it s impossible to be friends with someone who won t even untick .","301998":"you can kinda see it in my profile picture ! ! i m on my laptop rn , so i don t have any better photos on hand .","301999":"uh , i just said i was in a relationship . my boyfriend is years old , lol .","302000":"shaved half of it off .","302001":"yes , i ve been in a relationship for quite a number of years now .","302002":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","302003":"yeah , but not very often .","302004":"i have no interest in watching teen nick .","302005":"i don t care enough about the storm to watch the coverage .","302006":"i don t really have a guilty pleasure . i m not ashamed of anything i like .","302007":"broccoli .","302008":"it s been all right . i gave up on writing so i ve been watching the show you for the past hour or so .","302009":"my family does , but i seldom watch cable tv .","302010":"it isn t going to be a big snowstorm where i live mostly rain and ice . the temperatures are supposed to drop a lot , though .","302011":"years , i suppose . although the only grudge that i ve been holding onto has lasted over a year at this point , lmao .","302012":"snow is beautiful to look at , but i absolutely hate everything else about it , lmao . shoveling snow , cleaning the snow off my car , and especially driving in snow .","302013":"no , i already get enough notifications from askfm , so i wouldn t want to be notified when one of my friends posts an answer .","302014":"i m all right just tired , so i m attempting to caffeinate myself in the hopes of finishing something i ve been writing .","302015":"yes , i see myself getting married in the future . i think it s an exquisite celebration of love .","302016":"i prefer the cold over the heat . i absolutely hate being hot , but at least if i m cold , i can bundle up and wear a lot of cozy layers .","302017":"lol , yes . that happens to me every now and again , and then i immediately back up and say , wait , no . i didn t mean it sarcastically , i was genuine , i m so sorry . please forgive me .","302018":"i don t believe that there s such a thing as saying i love you too much . i think people should express their love for their friends , families , and partners more often because you simply don t know when you won t have someone around anymore .","302019":"i normally wake up between and am , and i get dressed for the day , take my medication , use the bathroom and brush my teeth , wash my face and brush my hair , and pack my lunch for the day . in the mornings , i normally stop by dunkin or starbucks or for coffee before i head into work .","302020":"honestly , sometimes my first thoughts are is it worth it to call out of work today ? lol . i ve been so tired lately , i need a day to just sleep in and do absolutely nothing .","302021":"i m currently wearing pajamas , lmao . i m wearing a thin hoodie because it s super cozy . it also still smells like downy softener .","302022":"yes , i value my alone time a lot . i need at least one or two hours of alone time per night , otherwise i become restless and exhausted and an anxious mess .","302023":"i ve never really brushed my teeth in a strange place tbh . the only places i ve brushed my teeth are my house , my boyfriend s house , and whatever hotel i m staying at if i m traveling somewhere .","302024":"not at the moment . it snowed early this morning , though . it was barely an inch , but it was enough to make other people drive erratically on the road .","302025":"when i m sleeping alone , i use four pillows , a heavy down comforter , and i usually have some sort of dim light on , whether it s the blue light of my fish tank or a small set of string lights that surround my tv . i take up the entire bed . when i m sleeping with my boyfriend , we re usually back to back and i have the terrible tendency to steal the blankets in the middle of the night , so sometimes he gives me my own blanket , lmao .","302026":"during the summer , i always sleep with a fan on because it gets so hot and humid in the house . the noise sorta bothers me , but i need the air circulation . during the winter , i don t use a fan .","302027":"it depends on my mood ! ! sometimes i use french vanilla creamer , while other times i take it with one scoop of stevia and a splash of half n half although lately i ve been using sweet cream . as for tea , i usually drink different flavored green teas , but when i drink english breakfast or earl grey tea , i like one scoop of sugar and a small splash of milk .","302028":"i like my sense of humor , my passion for writing and art , and my loyalty to my friends . i dislike my impulsive nature , my tendency toward giving into my desires i have zero self control , and my mental illnesses .","302029":"thank god it s friday . this week went horridly slow , and i m looking forward to staying home for two days straight , lmao with the exception of seeing my boyfriend tomorrow night . my only plans are to drink a lot of coffee , do laundry , finish my freelance assignments , and finish my personal essay .","302030":"when i want to get to know someone , i ask them what their passions and ambitions are . you can learn a lot about a person by noticing what they re passionate about and what they want to succeed at in their life .","302031":"there isn t anything i m really looking forward to because i don t have anything planned in the future . i m looking forward to seeing my boyfriend this weekend , but that s all . he cleaned and bought new furniture , so i m excited to spend time with him and relax on his new couch .","302032":"i only ever drank it as a child , and i don t remember if i liked the taste or not .","302033":"facebook , solely because i get most of my memes from there and people interact with me more on facebook compared to twitter . twitter is good for my random thoughts , but hardly anyone follows me and only close friends like my tweets .","302034":"hello do you have a question ? ?","302035":"i m assuming you mean painting , drawing , etc etc . if so , then i honestly can t remember the last time i painted or drew . it s been months .","302036":"honesty is the ability to be forthright and sincere with both yourself and those around you , lacking fabrications .","302037":"respect is having admiration or appreciation of an individual due to the content of their character , their positive attributes , their contributions to their community , and or their opinions .","302038":"at my worst , i m impulsive , self sabotaging , keen to giving into my compulsions , and bitter . at my best , i m creative , compassionate , open minded , and empathetic .","302039":"yes , it happens quite often to me , unfortunately . usually it had to do with work where i would have no choice but to work with a person i didn t like , but i would obviously remain civil with them in order to be more efficient .","302040":"well , yeah . you re anonymous so it s not as if you have anything to lose .","302041":"my boyfriend s smile and laughter , spending time with my boyfriend , relaxing with a cup of coffee after work , having my first cigarette of the day , catching up with friends over a few drinks , having a productive day at work , writing something i m proud of , smelling snow in the air , having a bonfire with friends , and lighting candles .","302042":"i prefer the park over the beach . i dislike the beach most of the time , it s too hot and i don t like going into the water anyway . the only reason why i would go to the beach is to drink beer and get a suntan . the park , on the other hand , is one of my favorite places . there are so many parks in my region and they re all beautiful . i used to bring my camera and take a lot of photos of nature .","302043":"i wholeheartedly agree . also , apparently the government isn t doing as many inspections on food items due to the shutdown , so we have to be extra cautious about the food we buy .","302044":"no , quite the opposite actually . i have a lot of patience and nothing really pushes me to anger unless a person attacks a close friend of mine or my boyfriend .","302045":"last week , i believe . i don t remember the reason why , although sometimes it happens without real reason .","302046":"i m interested in politics , but i m definitely not an invested in it as i was in the past . i like to remain up to date , though .","302047":"i never skipped classes when i was in high school , but i skipped classes occasionally when i was in college . most of the time , it was because i had assignments and papers to finish and didn t have enough time during the day to complete them .","302048":"if i have any enemies , they haven t made themselves known to me . lmao .","302049":"i have the samsung galaxy s .","302050":"depends on my mood i like a whole range of genres . i mainly listen to alternative rock , nu metal , hip hop rap , and video game movies soundtracks , though .","302051":"no , i don t trust people easily at all . i m very hesitant to trust people and i don t trust others until they prove their loyalty to me or give me a reason to trust them .","302052":"yes , i m quite passionate about music . music has helped me when no one else was there to support me , and it makes me feel utterly alive .","302053":"i purchased my current phone about three years ago .","302054":"writing , sleeping , playing video games , working , and drinking alcohol .","302055":"i honestly don t remember . i don t watch movies very often . it was probably one of the harry potter movies when they were on television for the holidays .","302056":"the only thing i did today was go to work . i just got home not too long ago , and now i m drinking coffee listening to music . i was going to finish writing an essay that i ve been working on , but i need to brainstorm because i have no idea how to end it .","302057":"work is going well ! ! there s a surplus of work to do , so i m always busy , which keeps my mind off of things . i also picked up some freelance work to do this weekend for some extra money .","302058":"hello do you have a question ? ?","302059":"no , i have no intentions of buying a ps . i m happy with the xbox one .","302060":"i usually eat oatmeal or a yogurt parfait , but occasionally i like to treat myself with an egg sandwich from the deli .","302061":"i probably wouldn t do anything . it isn t my business and i couldn t care less about what my parents do in their spare time .","302062":"my job caters lunch every friday afternoon , but that s the only routine thing that happens in my life . otherwise , it depends entirely on the week .","302063":"his impact upon my life was so great when i was a teenager that i owe my life to him . i struggled through a lot when i was much younger , and linkin park s music and his writing and perspectives on things really inspired me to keep holding on . he fueled my creativity and allowed me to write out my feelings instead of keeping them within it . it kept me sane .","302064":"this is so sweet . thank you so much","302065":"no , celine is a woman .","302066":"yeah , i respect her a lot as both a person and an artist .","302067":"lol . this is the way gender works everyone is different .","302068":"i don t own a ps , so unfortunately i don t have any game recommendations .","302069":"i know . that s why when the other said millions was more probable , i agreed with them .","302070":"that s indeed true . i prefer masculine compliments over feminine compliments . however , i m aware that i pass as a woman which is why it also doesn t bother me if people give me feminine compliments .","302071":"i picked up some freelance work for extra money , so i m planning on completing those as well as finishing the essay i ve been writing all week .","302072":"definitely . i already have two more designs in mind .","302073":"because i pass as a woman . even though i m non binary , i have very feminine features .","302074":"i didn t say very few people , obviously millions of people is quite a large number .","302075":"i ve never had blonde moments because that s just a stereotype .","302076":"you re also not the first person to have said this either , a few people on askfm have made this comparison .","302077":"you re not the first person to say that , actually ! ! it must be the hair , lol .","302078":"medical degrees are doctorates , lol . doctorate is an umbrella term for anything from a phd to an md to a dba or dmin .","302079":"my initial answer referenced doctorates . the original anon asked about successful people , so i figured they meant in a professional context .","302080":"since when have i ever claimed to be woke ? ? lmao . also , that s the third time you said the whole typical white person bit . if you re so pressed , then leave my page , unfollow me , or block me . it s that simple .","302081":"i m not lying , and you should learn how not to be so salty . you ve dragged this on for three days , find something more important to b tch about , rofl .","302082":"dark blonde .","302083":"i just took an anti anxiety pill i m going to try to drift off to sleep .","302084":"watercolor painting has always appealed to me , it s so beautiful and it s also a lot of fun to do .","302085":"i love photography ! ! i used to be an avid photographer in the past , and it s something i ve been wanting to get involved in again .","302086":"basically any of the fetish questions that get thrown at me are the weirdest questions , especially considering they re always unwarranted and completely random .","302087":"blackberries are too bitter for my liking .","302088":"smoking cigarettes , smoking marijuana , drinking alcohol , skin picking , food restricting , etc etc . the list goes on and on , lmao .","302089":"lol . like . . . i don t know if it s as bad to me personally , but that s still really bizarre to me . people have absolutely no mindfulness of their surroundings , or they simply don t care . why can t they wait to do those things at home ? ? why must they torture the rest of us ? ? why ? ?","302090":"you re in an office with other people sitting closely around you . why would you choose the office to be the ideal location to clip your fingernails ? ? it makes literally zero sense . it happened routinely with my last job and it drove everyone wild . i never knew who was doing it , but every time they would start clipping their nails , my coworker and i would stare at each other in mutual disgust .","302091":"i prefer masculine titles compliments over feminine ones .","302092":"people snorting grunting at their desk like animals , people chewing food with their mouths wide open , people clipping their fingernails at their desk yes , this happens ! ! , people who are overall bad at driving and insist they always have the right of way , etc etc .","302093":"at this point in my life , there s really no such thing as too much coffee for me . lol . i m the king of being over caffeinated .","302094":"not surprisingly , i m doing the same thing now as i was two hours ago listening to music and drinking coffee . this will be my last cup , though . otherwise i ll just end up dehydrating myself completely .","302095":"i heard really good things about that spiderman game ! ! i ve never been the biggest fan , but the gameplay i ve seen looked a lot of fun . ah , god of war . my boyfriend was obsessed with those games back in the day , and he contemplated purchasing a ps solely so he could play the new god of war game , lol .","302096":"yes , absolutely . my relationship is perhaps one of the best things that has ever happened to me . i ve never had such a strong , solid beacon of support before , and even after years of being together , we still haven t run out of things to talk or laugh about . every day is a new adventure .","302097":"halloween has always been my favorite holiday . i love the creepy decor , the horror movies , the seasonal drinks and foods , the chilly weather , etc etc .","302098":"yes , i agree ! ! that game literally blew my mind . i still have it installed on my console , perhaps i ll play it through again one day . it was hella fun . i ended up having a solid months of playing solely bioshock because i bought the bioshock collection for a reduced price a few years ago . i was completely captivated .","302099":"like i said earlier that unfortunately isn t how mental illness works . my boyfriend has , thankfully , always been incredibly understanding and supportive . but just because you re in a relationship , that doesn t magically make mental illness disappear . you can still experience love and support while struggling through episodes .","302100":"open world role playing games and first person shooters . my favorite games are skyrim , the fallout series minus and , i never played those , destiny , tomb raider , the bioshock series , the halo series , minecraft , assassin s creed , and life is strange .","302101":"? ? ? there s really no correlation between my mental health and my boyfriend . you re not suddenly happy simply because you re in a relationship . unfortunately that isn t how mental illness works . i only started feeling better once i sought out treatment for my mental health , i . e . attending therapy sessions regularly and taking medication .","302102":"hot chocolate is good , but sometimes it can be a bit too sweet for me .","302103":"coffee cigarettes my psychiatric medication music water","302104":"no , english is the only language i know .","302105":"we ve been together for nearly years .","302106":"here , have a picture that s so old that i have literally zero idea of what year it s from","302107":"sometimes , but not really . pasta is just empty carbs , unless it s whole wheat pasta .","302108":"yes , i do have a boyfriend .","302109":"yes , vegetables are probably my favorite food group ! ! they re so versatile and can be seasoned in a variety of ways , and it honestly boggles my mind when people say they dislike vegetables .","302110":"my favorite meal depends entirely on my mood in that moment . but lately , i ve been craving sushi constantly .","302111":"i m not happy with my life in the present moment , but i feel a lot better now compared to nine years ago .","302112":"i appreciate both digital and traditional art . like courrtana said in her response , they both require an immense amount of skill and practice , so artists should be respected regardless of whichever style they choose .","302113":"no , lemonade is too sweet for my taste .","302114":"lol , atrocious . i was severely depressed , so i was drunk and high every day when i wasn t attending classes .","302115":"travel across the country , first and foremost , as well as travel to other countries . i want to visit so many places within the united states , like oregon and washington and alaska , and i want to also see australia , new zealand , and europe .","302116":"that depends entirely on what the item is . things have different values , so for a tube of mascara , for example , is a lot different than for a television .","302117":"no , not really . i ve never had a sweet tooth , and the only sweets i ll eat are rainbow cookies or cannolis on rare occasions usually on birthdays or holidays .","302118":"i don t remember a large majority of my past , but the aspects of it that i do remember , i definitely don t miss at all .","302119":"lmao , no . the united states is embarrassing at this point .","302120":"it s a subgenre of alternative metal that also incorporates influences from other genres , like hip hop or grunge .","302121":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","302122":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","302123":"hello do you have a question ? ?","302124":"yes , i most certainly do have work tomorrow .","302125":"in , i want to progress further with my mental health , as well as advocate more on behalf of those struggling with mental illness . i want to write more often , with more passion fire than ever before . i want to get back on that health kick and begin working out again and losing weight .","302126":"i play poker with my friends occasionally , but that s pretty much it . we usually play texas hold em .","302127":"i look for someone with a sense of humor , someone who s loyal , someone who knows how to have a genuine conversation , someone who is intelligent , someone who is good with animals , and someone who is willing to put up with my bullsh t . thankfully , my boyfriend is all of those things .","302128":"i like surrealism the most . salvador dali is one of my favorite artists .","302129":"i just stepped outside to have a cigarette . when i m done , i m going to go back inside , maybe make myself some dinner , and take my medication .","302130":"if i didn t like twitter , then i wouldn t use it . lmao . it s an interesting platform , though . i don t really tweet very often , but i mainly retweet things that interest me or make me laugh .","302131":"my half sleeve took the longest to do . i think i was sitting there for maybe hours straight .","302132":"no , i m not vegan . however , when i do wind up living independently , i want to slowly transition to a vegetarian diet because i think it would be healthier for me .","302133":"my day was a bit difficult in the beginning , but it got easier as time progressed . i woke up feeling absolutely terrible and almost didn t go in to work , but i managed to make it there i would have felt even more horrible if i had called out , anyway . the first few hours , i couldn t focus on my work , but it got better as time went on . right now , i m feeling pretty good actually .","302134":"i listen to a range of genres , i . e . alternative rock , nu metal , hip hop rap , instrumentals like video game and movie soundtracks , classical , etc etc . these days , my most played artists have been grandson , matt maeson , bryce vine , two feet , and imogen heap she did the entire harry potter the cursed child ost .","302135":"the only cookies i eat if you can consider them cookies are rainbow cookies . i also eat cannolis , but those are more like pastries .","302136":"i prefer cold weather over warm weather . i can t stand the feeling of being hot or sweaty , and i would rather live somewhere that experiences autumn and winter seasons above all else .","302137":"the social media sites i mainly visit are facebook , instagram , twitter , and snapchat .","302138":"no , insults hardly ever offend me . insults say a lot more about the person who s attempting to insult you than it does about you . most people insult others out of a need for attention , or because they re unhappy with an aspect of themselves and they don t want to reflect upon it , or because they have a complex and can t admit when they re wrong .","302139":"no , i don t like pineapple at all unless it s mixed with rum .","302140":"at the moment , no . lol . my best friend borrowed my dslr last year and i keep forgetting to take it back from her , so it s just been sitting at her mother s house collecting dust .","302141":"no , i don t like anime . the only anime esque things i really enjoy are studio ghibli films .","302142":"i enjoy pizza sometimes , sure . i usually have a grandma or margherita slice .","302143":"i feel like this is a strange question to ask , considering how these days , everyone owns a smartphone so technically speaking , everyone is always online , it s just a matter of whether or not someone is looking at their phone .","302144":"no , i don t play any instruments currently . when i was a teenager , i enjoyed playing the guitar and the keyboards , and i even owned a ukulele for a brief period of time . but i haven t been interested in creating music in years .","302145":"no , i ve never been a fan of call of duty . however , i do like some first person shooters , i . e . halo and destiny .","302146":"i have the samsung galaxy s .","302147":"yeah , so that would be december st . i put pto in for my request so i would still get paid for the day .","302148":"no , not lately . admittedly , i ve been watching the show you routinely even though i m only up to episode six , but i go in phases when it comes to television .","302149":"does the weekend count ? ? lol . the last day i took off of work was december st . i felt like having a four day weekend since my office was closed on new years day .","302150":"i ve only owned xbox products , so it would have to be the xbox one .","302151":"no , i ve never been a fan of sports . i think the only sport that i might enjoy is ice hockey , simply because watching competitive games is really entertaining .","302152":"it depends on my mood because i love both tea coffee . these days , i ve been drinking mostly coffee but i ll normally have a cup of tea mid afternoon or right before bed usually earl grey or peppermint or ginger peach .","302153":"i ate a bag of doritos a few hours ago while i was at work .","302154":"yes , i work in an office building .","302155":"it s currently pm est .","302156":"i haven t been off of medication in over two years , so i don t know how i would be anymore i don t really want to find out . prior to starting medication , i was severely unstable , actively svicidal , and too depressed to leave my bed or shower .","302157":"all of the above . coffee tastes delicious , it makes me feel wonderful , and it gives me a much needed caffeine boost .","302158":"aw , that sounds adorable . yeah when i think of pride , i think of nyc pride and the chaos that happens there , rofl .","302159":"i m left handed , actually . which is amusing because the it guy came to my office earlier this week to update everyone s software , and he was struggling to use my mouse because it s on the left side and i guess he would have felt rude if he had moved it , lol .","302160":"abandonment","302161":"i prefer talking to people in person . i m not great at texting other people back i often forget that i m having a conversation with someone since i don t use my phone at all throughout the work day .","302162":"i prefer responding to questions . i seldom ask questions these days i only do so when my feed is dead and i m looking to kill some time .","302163":"tbh pride isn t really something i ve ever wanted to attend . i like looking at people s pictures , but walking around in a crowd full of people makes me extremely anxious , so i don t think i would enjoy it . as for your second question , yes i love art .","302164":"my xmas was fine and went a little better than expected , given the circumstances i was dealt at the time . i really had a lot of fun when i saw my boyfriend and his family , though . they always make me feel welcome and at home , like i m a part of their family .","302165":"i ve never had a fling before , so no . that s never happened to me .","302166":"as far as i m aware , i m fairly open minded . i always try to view things as learning opportunities and even if i don t agree with someone s point of view , i try to understand why they think the way they do .","302167":"yes , i ve been driving since i was years old .","302168":"yes , i actually wore boots to work today because it was a bit chilly outside . i ll probably end up wearing them again tomorrow since it s supposed to snow tonight into tomorrow morning .","302169":"i ve driven through pennsylvania briefly , but there was no reason for me to stop there .","302170":"yes , i ve traveled up and down the east coast from maine to florida . however , i ve never ventured further west .","302171":"lol . i m honestly not sure what size it is , i just filled a big glass up with ice and made some iced coffee when i got home before .","302172":"i ve known i liked people of all varying genders since i was years old , but i don t believe i actually came out to the public until i was or so .","302173":"i m doing fine , thank you for asking . i just got home from work not too long ago now i m relaxing with my laptop , coffee , and some music from the harry potter the cursed child ost .","302174":"yeah , i answer questions every day . however , i might be seeing my boyfriend tomorrow evening , so i probably won t be very active at all .","302175":"not in the literal sense of addiction , but generally speaking , yes they can be addictive depending on your personality . for people like me , once you get one tattoo , it s difficult to see yourself with only one tattoo , so you start planning more and more .","302176":"i ve unfortunately never attended a pride event parade before . they re usually always in manhattan and the idea of going into manhattan for a parade full of people seems daunting to me .","302177":"i m five feet tall .","302178":"i love all of my tattoos , but i really cherish the meaning behind my tattoo dedicated to linkin park chester bennington . i got it a few weeks after he passed away .","302179":"no , i meant bisexual . bisexual generally refers to two or more , while pansexual refers to all .","302180":"yes , i m doing just fine . i m just performing my nightly routine sitting at my laptop , drinking coffee , and listening to music .","302181":"i m bisexual .","302182":"hello do you have a question ? ?","302183":"my birthday is november th .","302184":"yes , i smoke both cigarettes and marijuana and drink alcohol .","302185":"i don t currently have any piercings , no . i used to have my labret and my nose pierced , though . i had my labret pierced for years when i was in high school .","302186":"they ranged anywhere from each , but that s because they re all different sizes and i ve gone to four separate tattoo artists to get them done .","302187":"as i mentioned earlier , i have seven tattoos . they re on my shoulder blades , my upper arm and forearm , my ribcage , my thigh , the back of my calf , and my ankle .","302188":"july . i got two tattoos done in the same day .","302189":"i normally take naps on the weekends , and they last between hours long .","302190":"yes , in a heartbeat . when i move into my own house apartment , i m adopting an animal . although tbh i would probably be more inclined to adopt an older dog because there are so many older dogs left in shelters waiting to be adopted .","302191":"i can t remember the last time i actually hugged a tree , if i ever have at all .","302192":"yes , i m an immensely loyal person . i don t make friends very easily , but i m loyal to the ones i do have . i think loyalty is one of the most important things you can contribute to any form of relationship .","302193":"no , not at all . my pain tolerance has lessened greatly over the past few years .","302194":"my parents never witnessed me getting low marks on tests when i was in school .","302195":"zero . i ve never watched a royal wedding before .","302196":"yeah , i play video games . lately i ve been exclusively playing fallout with my friends .","302197":"it depends on your pain tolerance and where on the body you re getting the tattoo . my thigh and forearm didn t hurt me much at all , but the ribcage and calf hurt like hell .","302198":"i currently have seven tattoos , but i have two more planned out .","302199":"yes , i use so much softener , lol . all of my clothes smell like downy softener and it makes me so happy .","302200":"i usually buy the big jugs of starbucks black iced coffee make it my own way usually with three pumps of vanilla sweetener and a splash of cream . as for hot coffee , it depends on my mood . sometimes i take it with a scoop of stevia and cream , while other times i prefer it without sweetener at all .","302201":"uh , i did admit i was wrong it was the second question in this thread where an anon mentioned it was probably millions i said that s probably more accurate . this entire thread was about success pertaining to doctorates , so idk where you got the assumption from that there was an underlying issue there .","302202":"no , i m not a hugger at all . i only hug my boyfriend and my best friend .","302203":"how so ? ? only thousands of people have a doctorate so i don t think it s a stretch at all .","302204":"as far as i m aware , no one that i talk to from askfm is transphobic .","302205":"no . that s transphobic , and i wouldn t want to be friends with someone who s transphobic .","302206":"well i wouldn t be civil with a person if they were intentionally being mean to me . i would just cut them out of my life in that situation . i also think there s a difference between being wrong and simply having a different opinion . you aren t necessarily wrong if your opinion differs from someone else s , but there are some opinions which are based on false information , which would make them wrong .","302207":"depends on a variety of factors , i . e . who s telling me i m rude , the tone of their voice , what we re talking about , etc etc . it would be different with every scenario .","302208":"well yeah , that s part of being a civilized adult . as long as you respect each other s opinion , even if you don t necessarily agree with them , then that s all you can do .","302209":"all right , so i just watched the commercial . to my understanding , the commercial doesn t demonize men at all . it s simply bringing to light the injustices that have been done upon other people by men , creating this culture of toxic masculinity that exists today . it doesn t say all men do this , which is exemplified by the fact that there were men who were breaking up fights , stopping their friends from chasing after girls , etc etc . it s setting a good example for younger boys and young adults to open their eyes as to what acceptable versus unacceptable behavior is . boys will be boys is not an acceptable phrase to use anymore because there should be no excuse for violence or harassment , and those behaviors need to be corrected . there s so much pressure on men to act and behave a certain way that gillette is trying to break that pressure and point out that certain things are not okay , and we should educate the future generations accordingly .","302210":"sometimes i feel as if askfm is implementing these changes in an attempt to start competition between users , lmao . first they revealed how many followers everyone had , and now they re posting up how many coins people have and stacking users against each other , both within their friends list and within their countries . seems like some sort of marketing tool to make people answer more questions be more active on the site .","302211":"if my friend turned out to be racist and continuously made racist remarks without attempting to understand why their thoughts behavior is wrong , then i wouldn t be their friend anymore .","302212":"to me personally , being fake is when a person isn t being their genuine , true self . whether that s because they re putting on a facade in front of other people or they re in a state of denial about who they truly are .","302213":"i usually answer this sort of question with australia or new zealand , but lately i ve been wanting to visit more wintry , snowy places like alaska , or vermont , or new hampshire . there s really nothing for me to see in any of those places , but they re all so beautiful .","302214":"i deleted it because sweetnothings sent the same exact question just minutes prior to your question . i still haven t answered it because i haven t watched the commercial yet , and tbh i know absolutely nothing about it .","302215":"the only things i would need are coffee cigarettes , lmao . just bury me with a steaming mug of hot coffee and a pack of menthols , and i ll be fine .","302216":"which question was it ? ? i still have questions left in my inbox .","302217":"i wouldn t choose either person , considering i don t know who t series is and i don t like pewdiepie .","302218":"huh , interesting . never heard of them before .","302219":"am i behind on the times or something ? ? the only t series i know of is the t series power armor from the fallout series , lmao .","302220":"i craved sushi today , so i bought some for dinner . lmao .","302221":"no , i ve never seen any of those shows .","302222":"i answered a similar question to this a little while ago . i don t like the use of the term crazy in this context , but change doesn t usually bother me .","302223":"i ve never been religious , as far as i can remember .","302224":"you re under no obligation to answer anything that makes you uncomfortable or crosses a personal boundary , whether that s on askfm or in everyday life . that changes from person to person .","302225":"there s somewhat of a stigma , but it only really applies to places outside of big cities i . e . boston , new york city , los angeles where it s difficult to get somewhere if you don t drive . where i live , you pretty much need to drive everywhere , or else you ll wind up spending too much money on taxis and ubers and trains . in bigger cities , there s less of a need for driving because everything is basically in walking distance or there are subways and buses .","302226":"i disagree . people travel to other countries all the time for a variety of reasons , whether it s due to work , school , personal leisure , etc etc . just because you re not native to that country obviously doesn t mean you shouldn t ever go there , lol .","302227":"i can see how you would think that if you were to compare it to a global scale , but obviously i didn t mean not many at all considering the context it was in . also , i don t even know how many people even have a doctorate regardless of race . i don t personally know anyone who has a doctorate even my personal doctor doesn t have an md , so i don t really think saying thousands instead of millions isn t a big stretch .","302228":"driving . i absolutely hate driving , but i have no choice but to drive every day , otherwise i wouldn t be able to go to work , or run errands , or see my friends boyfriend , etc etc .","302229":"i don t make it a habit to hide things from people . i m pretty much an open book .","302230":"she s most renowned for the vampire chronicles . they re great books , although i ve only read two of them so far .","302231":". . . since when have i been patronizing people of color ? ? lmao . the original anon was being racist af , so i corrected them .","302232":"no , not that i m aware of . although the whole you eat x amount of spiders while you sleep does creep me out .","302233":"it s just an expression of disgust .","302234":"in the past , i did . these days , definitely not .","302235":"my stomach , bleh .","302236":"surprisingly , yes . i have a habit of delaying gratification in an effort to inspire me to complete tasks , i . e . if i write one more paragraph , i ll treat myself to another cup of coffee or if i do x amount of chores , i ll spend a few hours playing video games . it s always been the way my mind works , because if i don t have something to look forward to , then it s difficult for me to get things done .","302237":"like . . . a gigantic amount . fat in excess . lmao .","302238":"lately i ve been writing for fun , which is a nice change from the writing that i typically do every day for work . i forgot how easily i can slip into the creative process and actually create content that makes me proud . sometimes i feel as if i lost my creative flair , or that i already hit my peak , but these days i ve been hopeful .","302239":"bruh , i still have questions left in my inbox . have some patience , lol .","302240":"no , but i do have a heaping mass of year old fat on me .","302241":"i ve been listening to matt maeson obsessively lately , and i m super happy because my favorite radio station just discovered him started playing his music ! ! cringe matt maeson https www . youtube . com watch ? v chvxxrnewg","302242":"lol . more than half of my followers are probably bots because i only have the same maybe people who interact with me on a regular basis . i keep gaining new followers every day , but i really don t see much activity difference at all .","302243":"i just ordered sushi , so i m excited for dinner tonight ! !","302244":"that s probably more accurate , considering how many people exist on this earth .","302245":"chester bennington . he was a role model to me when i was a teenager , and he and his music was the reason why i kept holding onto life when all i wanted to do was lay down and die . his death hit me the hardest out of any celebrity death , and i still have periods of sadness where it just hits me that he isn t alive anymore and i get that heart wrenching feeling in my gut .","302246":"as my bio indicates , i m from new york .","302247":"lately i ve been obsessed with stash s peach ginger tea . it s the perfect combination of fruity and spicy , and it helps me when i have digestive issues ! ! i don t put anything in it . otherwise , i also love earl grey tea . i usually take it with a small splash of milk and one sugar .","302248":"my favorite authors are stephen king , anne rice , franz kafka , j . k . rowling , and george orwell . however , i ve read a lot of books who aren t from those authors and have a few favorite books from other writers entirely .","302249":"do you mean the chilling adventures of sabrina , like the netflix tv show ? ? if so , then yes ! ! i only watched the first few episodes , but it was really intriguing and entertaining .","302250":"none of my irl friends use askfm , so in that respect , no . however , i have both online friends and irl friends added on twitter , instagram , and facebook .","302251":"i usually read suspense and thriller books . although some of my favorite books are more fantasy like and dramatic as opposed to suspenseful .","302252":"do you mean do people with insomnia have a higher mortality rate than those without insomnia ? ? i personally don t know . you re better off googling this question or asking a health care professional .","302253":"i ve been wearing glasses since i was a child . i used to wear contact lenses , but i ve stopped wearing them within the past two years because they would hurt too much when i stare at a computer monitor all day .","302254":"no , having a traumatic childhood isn t part of the diagnostic criteria when it comes to personality disorders . you can certainly have a personality disorder without experiencing childhood trauma , although it is a bit rare .","302255":"i m allowed to leave early or call out of work without repercussion , within reason , due to my mental health problems . lately , i haven t been leaving early or calling out very often at all , but it used to be a frequent issue in the past when my health wasn t under control . and yeah , i have an official letter from my psychiatrist on file .","302256":"i can certainly sing , but that doesn t mean i sing well , lol . my singing voice is absolutely terrible .","302257":"i haven t hugged anyone today , and i m not planning on hugging anyone either .","302258":"i believe i used to watch it when i was a child , but i don t remember anything about the show at all .","302259":"yeah , but that doesn t guarantee that i ll have an answer for you . i don t know very much about health in general .","302260":"if you read my bio , you would see that i m non binary . regardless , hello do you have a question ? ?","302261":"society needs to get over the stigma associated with having a complex mental illness , i . e . personality disorders , dissociative disorders , psychotic disorders , etc etc . due to misunderstanding of mental health in the past and the perpetration of stigma carried out by the media , people with complex mental disorders are often viewed as dangerous , manipulative , attention seeking , and weak . in reality , people with those illnesses are often more of a danger to themselves than other people .","302262":"i have dozens of movies that fit that category , lol . girl interrupted , the crow , heathers , the lord of the rings trilogy , the harry potter series , sweeney todd , secret window , the number , queen of the damned , the shining , and i am not a serial killer .","302263":"technically speaking , my mental illnesses make me crazy . tbh i don t really like the use of that word at all it only adds to the stigma associated with mental illnesses , especially with respect to disorders that include psychosis . there s such a bad connotation when it comes to the term crazy and it s been harmful toward people who struggle with their mental health .","302264":"most of the people i follow are active , so i ll tag a few ! ! courrtana shehitsback littlesha urlsareshittbh frecklefacedimplecheek","302265":"i m a slytherin , according to pottermore ! ! my coworker even knit me a slytherin beanie for xmas this year , aw . from favorite to least favorite slytherin , ravenclaw , gryffindor , and hufflepuff sorry to all of my hufflepuff followers .","302266":"thank you ! ! and don t worry , i know for this anon in particular , i was hoping to make them realize how ridiculous they sounded , and i m always up for educating people on misconceptions regarding mental illness . they don t bother me at all and it only reinforces the idea that we need better education when it comes to mental health awareness .","302267":"no , i was never suspended before .","302268":"uh , what ? ? lmfao . if i had children obviously i would want myself watching them .","302269":"tbh i have a lot of fonts in ms word already , so i don t think i need any new ones . but thank you anyway","302270":"thank you ! ! perhaps i ll try it later tonight after taking a break , god knows i need one now . i ve had writers block for months , but i m determined in to try to write more often , even if it s something i hate , because i ve realized you can t get better if you don t write at all . i started writing a book for nanowrimo in november , so i definitely want to expand on that eventually , but for now i ve just been writing this one shot fictional essay thing .","302271":"cont gives me a starting point , and i can always go back and edit it later . once again i m not sure if it works for everyone , but if you ever want to try when you re particularly stumped ? ? whoa , that s interesting ! ! i honestly hate comic sans with a passion but i ll definitely try it . it s also funny how different fonts affect people s writing , lol . i normally write better when i have serif fonts , but for this particular essay , i ve been writing in calibri and it s been somewhat helping too .","302272":"i ve been sitting at my laptop since i got home from work , and zero writing has come out of me thus far . ugh . how s everyone else s night going ? ?","302273":"yeah , although i m sure everyone has experienced this at some point .","302274":"medium rare .","302275":"this isn t true at all ? ? there are thousands of people of color who are immensely successful with medical degrees , doctorates , etc etc .","302276":"true , genetics can probably play a part in that as well . i don t really know the whole science behind why some people have higher iqs than others , though .","302277":"no , i actually posted the other day in an answer that i never learned how to ride a bicycle .","302278":"no , your intelligence isn t based upon your race , as far as i m aware . your intelligence is based upon life experience and level of education .","302279":"some mental illnesses are more severe than others . you re not useless , though not being able to work due to mental health reasons is incredibly common and people are on disability every day . i m sorry you feel that way though . tbh i would probably feel the same way if i couldn t work at all either . i have accommodations at my job due to my mental illnesses , thankfully .","302280":"he s endured traumatic events in his life . i won t go into more detail than that .","302281":"do you mean cocktails , like the alcoholic drinks ? ? if so , then yeah .","302282":"you re damn right .","302283":"well it s certainly not my cup of coffee , lol . that shit is gone within minutes . what lasts the longest in my life , though , are my friendships . i don t make friends easily , and the people i am friends with have been my friends for multiple years .","302284":"not until they re an adult . parents should be parenting their children as they grow older , especially in adolescent and teenage years , and be sources of guidance instead of someone that a child considers a friend instead of a parent . when children see their parents as friends instead of their parents , it leads to a lot of miscommunication , and parents tend to let their discipline slide because they want to maintain that friend persona , which isn t healthy .","302285":"yeah , he s struggled with depression in the past and he has ptsd .","302286":"the knowledge that i ll always have my boyfriend close friends as means of support if i m ever deteriorating in terms of my mental health . they give me hope and they ve always been a source of inspiration for me . also , the future . thinking about my future with my boyfriend gives my hope and inspires me to keep going .","302287":"my boyfriend insisted that journaling wasn t a real word when i told him i spent the morning journaling , so we bickered back forth for like minutes before i googled it and showed him the screenshot , lmao . granted it wasn t a real argument , but he was so adamant that it wasn t a real word and insisted that i say i wrote in my journal instead of saying i was journaling . lmfao .","302288":"i agree . i m a very paranoid person by nature and have been stalked followed before , so i don t reveal any personal information about myself on sites like askfm , twitter , instagram , etc etc .","302289":"littlesha is under no obligation to reveal which high school she attended , considering that s normally very private information .","302290":"your intelligence level has no correlation with having an addiction to nicotine , lol . i consider myself to be somewhat intelligent i smoke cigarettes , so .","302291":"then i wouldn t hire either of them , lol . having experience with children is integral to babysitting . i wouldn t want someone around my child who had no idea how to handle a child at all .","302292":"depends on their experience with children . if a person with no mental illnesses didn t have any experience dealing with children , then i wouldn t want them babysitting my child . having a mental illness doesn t make you an inherently violent or bad person .","302293":"no , i haven t . i don t know enough people to really set a friend up with anyone , haha . i only have one friend who s single , either way .","302294":"i don t want to change any of those things about myself , besides perhaps the whole success thing . i wasn t saying that having those qualities were bad , it s just the opposite of who i am .","302295":"probably the complete opposite of who i am , lol . someone who doesn t struggle with mental illness , has been successful in life , plays sports and doesn t have an ounce of creativity in their body , and is straight edge .","302296":"i m still myself regardless of who s watching me or not . i spent too much of my life worried about what people thought of me , to the point where i often put on a facade . now that i m older , i just don t care anymore . if you don t like me for me , then you re obviously unnecessary to my life .","302297":"i think the idea behind parallel universes is interesting and it s a great subject to write about , but i don t know if i necessarily believe in them .","302298":"for the most part , yes . i try to help people as much as i m physically or mentally able to do so in that moment , especially people who are close to me .","302299":"lol . my last piece of good news was that my close friend said she was available to hang out tomorrow night . i haven t seen her in a while and we need to catch up on each other s lives , so i m excited to talk to her over a few drinks .","302300":"no , it isn t valid to me at all . if i had money , i would be able to progress forward in my life more and attain happiness at a faster rate .","302301":"there s nothing supernatural or evolutionary about having a severe mental illness . having disorders such as aspd and did simply mean that you ve been subjected to intense , prolong abuse from a very young age to the point where you ve developed a longstanding personality disorder aspd or a fracturing identity in an effort to protect yourself did . i ve never seen either dexter or split , but i ve heard that split was incredibly ableist and demonized people with did by portraying them as these violent creatures , when in reality , people with did and other severe disorders are more of a threat to themselves than other people .","302302":"the biggest lesson life has taught me is that no matter how much you can have compassion for and genuinely care for someone else , or even a group of people , you still need to take care of yourself first and foremost . your happiness matters just as much as everyone else s happiness , and you shouldn t forego your own well being and stability just to make someone else more comfortable .","302303":"i think it s absolutely fine to judge people who are detrimental to society as a whole , such as cold blooded k llers , r pists , p dophiles , nazis , etc etc .","302304":"sorta , yeah . however , i ve always been good at organizing , delegating , compartmentalizing , etc etc . so big projects that may seem overwhelming at first are able to be broken down into segments , which makes them not as intimidating .","302305":"no , i m not superstitious at all . most superstitions come from old wives tales and other things that have been passed down and distorted for generations .","302306":"you re asking the totally wrong person , lol . i m absolutely terrible at jogging when i exercise , i speed walk at the most .","302307":"the only thing i really did today was go to work , lol . i only got home from work minutes ago . however , i did write more of my fictional essay while on my lunch break ! ! i think i m almost done with it , and then comes the hefty editing process .","302308":"uh . . . i really hope this is a random statement and something that doesn t have to do with flossing and brushing your teeth , lmao . if you think dental hygiene is an indication of hyperfeminity , then i am quite concerned for the state of your teeth .","302309":"no , i don t assume that . if someone doesn t want to share pictures of themselves , then that usually means that they re insecure or they don t want other people to focus on their appearance when talking to them on social media . as for names , there are a lot of people i know who don t share their real name on the internet . it s simply a privacy concern .","302310":"i normally floss first , and then brush my teeth afterwards . that way , the plaque or food is loosened and you can just brush them away when you re done flossing .","302311":"my boyfriend is a healthy balance of all of those qualities .","302312":"lately , it s been hallucinogenics by matt maeson . https www . youtube . com watch ? v c iwnpg vg","302313":"my boyfriend and my career .","302314":"yes , there s one person whom i can say i hate . but that s really all . there are other people i dislike , but hate is a strong word .","302315":"i m third out of my friends th in the united states .","302316":"why even bother ?","302317":"i wouldn t doubt it . people will do anything for attention .","302318":"apparently i am , but i m usually a nervous wreck whenever i have to speak in front of people because of my social anxiety .","302319":"it s degrees fahrenheit and windy , lol .","302320":"fetish mistreatment . oh lord . you can t help being gay , trans , non binary , etc etc . you can choose to not enforce your fetish onto unsuspecting people . to claim that people who have fetishes are somehow oppressed or marginalized by society is ridiculous .","302321":"uh , being gay and or trans has nothing to do with fetishes . that s your sexual orientation and gender identity . to compare being gay or trans with having a fetish downsizes the struggles gay and trans people endure .","302322":"that doesn t mean that people with fetishes should be associated with the lgbtq community . that just means that your friend happens to be a lesbian while having a specific fetish that was outcasted by her community .","302323":"aw , thank you","302324":"because having a fetish and being a member of the lgbtq community are two entirely different things . you can be of any sexual orientation and have a fetish .","302325":"nah , not really . i m incredibly patient for the most part unless you re one of certain individuals in my life who somehow find their way to creep under my skin .","302326":"? ? ? fetishes are entirely sexual that s why they re called fetishes . and no , the idea of fetishes being somehow associated with the lgbtq community is asinine .","302327":"i wish i never witnessed an individual overdose on drugs .","302328":"yeah , i believe he s racist . he may not realize it himself , but a lot of things he s said and done , both in the past and currently , have been indications that he s prejudiced against people of other races .","302329":"lol , no it isn t a turn on for me at all . i just think it s disgusting how people will anonymously ask a stranger a question pertaining to their sex life in order to get their own rocks off . if you wouldn t ask a stranger on the street these types of questions , what makes you think it s acceptable or appropriate to ask a stranger on the internet ? ?","302330":"most of the time , i m honestly disgusted with myself . however , there are some moments where i m confident in myself and genuinely like how i look granted , it isn t very often , but it does happen on occasion .","302331":"as long as i have the opportunity to spend the day , or at least part of the day , with my boyfriend , then i would be happy . i don t place much importance in holidays like that because they re largely commercialized .","302332":"tickling questions are worded in a variety of different ways . i ve been on askfm since or so , so i ve seen my fair share of tickling based fetish questions .","302333":"i wouldn t think so . i m a fairly down to earth and easy going person , and i think the only thing that would bother me is if the person i m living with constantly makes a mess and doesn t clean up after themselves . as for myself , i always try to keep things tidy because it helps my mental health and i ve always been pretty responsible . i think the only issue someone might have is that i go out about once per week and don t come home until midnight .","302334":"lol . it s still in my inbox , i just haven t gotten around to answering it yet . i still have or so questions left in my inbox .","302335":"tickling is a frequent fetish based topic on askfm , and because i don t want to entertain anons in that respect , i always delete questions pertaining to tickling .","302336":"you re correct in that it s a site for answering questions . however , this is my personal page , and if someone asks me a question that i don t want to answer , then i m not obligated to answer that question .","302337":"i probably have at some point , but i honestly don t remember . everyone i associate with is hilarious because i value humor in a friendship .","302338":"i don t love pizza , but i do enjoy it occasionally . i m not the biggest fan of myself , though however , it s something i m continuously working on .","302339":"you can ask me whatever you want , but that doesn t mean i ll answer everything sent to my inbox . i delete all fetish questions and questions pertaining to sex .","302340":"hello do you have a question ? ?","302341":"i don t answer fetish questions that much should be obvious .","302342":"which questions did you send ? ? i still have questions left in my inbox .","302343":"a guy fawkes mask .","302344":"my boyfriend is important to me he s perhaps one of the most important things in my life , besides my career . writing is also extremely important to me , as well as coffee , my friends , music , video games , my mental health , and video games .","302345":"i wash my hoodies , tee shirts , blouses , and other shirts after wearing it only once . i wash my jeans after wearing them perhaps three or four times although four is kinda pushing it . i hardly ever wash coats , though .","302346":"if i had the option , i would choose not to spend money at all , lol . however , i prefer spending money on experiences as opposed to material items , such as vacations , concerts , tattoos , etc etc .","302347":"i used to be close to one cousin , but we ve drifted apart over the past few years . i don t really talk to any of my other cousins .","302348":"i ve always wanted to visit australia and new zealand . they both seem like such beautiful countries , and i also have a friend in australia whom i d love to visit .","302349":"considering i have a terrible memory , i ve found that writing things down and taking photographs are great ways of remembering events , people , etc etc . i used to keep a journal , and i always take photos whenever i m out because i like cherishing the memories i create with my friends and boyfriend .","302350":"i don t really know what other people think of me because i ve never cared to ask , sans obvious people such as my boyfriend . i would hope that most people would think of me as a compassionate , knowledgeable individual , but i m percent positive that there are also plenty of people who hate me .","302351":"no , i ve never heard of that before .","302352":"i ve unfortunately manipulated people in the past , and i was horribly good at it too . i regret those decisions because i m sure i hurt a lot of people , but at the time , i simply didn t care . manipulation is a terrible thing to do to a person and it s a form of emotional abvse , especially if you do it to a friend or partner .","302353":"i would write if you re going through hell , keep going . it s my personal mantra , and it s always helped me persevere in times of struggle . i would like to think that it would help someone else as well .","302354":"i met chester bennington once when i was years old . however , i wish i could have met him again before he passed away . he was such a profound influence on me during my teenage years , and if it wasn t for him and his music , i likely wouldn t be alive today . i would thank him for all he s done for me over the years .","302355":"i suppose green . i have a candle lit that s currently green and it smells like clover , moss , and pipe tobacco it s supposed to resemble the shire . it calms me down .","302356":"i wouldn t want to see into the future . that would probably give me too much anxiety , and i would rather live my life in the present moment as opposed to constantly thinking about the future . in that respect , i would rather change a former regret into something better .","302357":"i don t think i would want to read anyone s mind tbh . people don t say everything they think for a reason , and it would make me too paranoid if i knew everything that someone was thinking .","302358":"i would love to have a dog rn . their name would be determined by their coloring and personality , though . i think if i had a white dog , i would name them luna .","302359":"i don t normally get sad , because my sadness turns into a depressive episode . at that point , nothing really cheers me up and i have to wait for it to alleviate in time .","302360":"idk , i ve only met my friends through school and work .","302361":"health insurance , lmao . granted i need it , but it still takes a lot of money out of my paycheck .","302362":"babycadiexo sends spam out occasionally ! ! i don t really follow anyone else who sends out questions regularly though .","302363":"questions pertaining to sex . i delete all of them .","302364":"seeing my boyfriend happy thriving , drinking coffee , writing something that i m proud of , playing video games , positive reinforcement , rainy or snowy days , feeling relaxed and collected after a hot shower , lighting candles , learning something new , and helping other people .","302365":"whatever hairstyle makes them the most confident in themselves .","302366":"i don t remember my childhood .","302367":"my boyfriend is the most humble person i know . he doesn t give himself as much credit as he should for being a hard working person and he s always in need to do more and be more than what he is . he s inspiring to me .","302368":"i don t really adhere to any specific culture .","302369":"this basically defines my life . i m in a constant state of exhaustion .","302370":"as my bio indicates , i m from new york .","302371":"i don t like honey mustard , but ranch is my dipping sauce of choice when it comes to fries and wings .","302372":"i made veggie burgers and french fries .","302373":"i don t cook very often . i help prepare meals and i take out the ingredients , but my mother does most of the cooking in the house except for tonight , ironically .","302374":"my inbox is empty ! ! send me your questions","302375":"i would call my boyfriend . he would probably know what to do in such a circumstance , depending on why i got arrested lol , and i trust him more than anyone else in my life .","302376":"i don t donate to any organizations , but if i had the money , i would probably donate to planned parenthood , the world wildlife fund , the juvenile diabetes foundation , and the american foundation for svicide prevention .","302377":"growing up , i liked shows like rocket power , catdog , thundercats , ren stimpy , dexter s laboratory , and rocko s modern life . these days , my favorite shows are criminal minds , ncis , parks and rec , how i met your mother , supernatural , wentworth , orange is the new black , and castle .","302378":"yeah , i ve texted while driving before . i only do it when i m at stop lights , though . never while i m actually driving .","302379":"i never learned how to ride a bicycle . i have a bachelor s degree in communications professional writing and a minor in english literature . i prefer wintry or earthy candles , like pine and moss and other musky scents . cheddar and sour cream is my favorite chip flavor . my favorite white wine is pinot grigio and my favorite red wine is cabernet sauvignon .","302380":"every day , lmao . when i get home from work , i need my quiet time with some music and a candle .","302381":"we usually just serve them as is , but we like to put a variety of ingredients inside of them so they taste yummy . like garlic potatoes , cheese , chopped meat , and tuna . not all in the same ones obviously but we ll mix the potatoes and meat in one empanada .","302382":"i m all right . i just finished doing a little bit of housework and now i m going to attempt to do a little bit of writing again .","302383":"no , i have no interest in sports . i don t even know when the super bowl is , lol .","302384":"it s rare for us to spend mornings together where one of us doesn t have to run to work , so we usually just give a small kiss goodbye before running out the door .","302385":"not really , no . ideally , i would love to be living on my own or with my boyfriend , making money through freelance writing although i don t mind my job at all , and caring for a bunch of pets .","302386":"i ve learned to be more mindful and live in the present moment instead of focusing too much on the past or the future . i ve learned to be more grateful and express my appreciation for my boyfriend and close friends , and i ve also learned that it s important to take time for yourself .","302387":"i like shopping at stop shop . they have a lot of all natural , organic foods that are generally low in price . my mother controls the food that comes into the house , so it s usually obvious things like milk , bread , and eggs , as well as k cups , chopped meat , pork , veggie burgers , frozen french fries , veggie chips and straws , oatmeal , pasta , etc etc .","302388":"lol . well if he had bad breath and smelled like ass , i would definitely tell him to brush his teeth and shower more often . thankfully , that s never been an issue .","302389":"i like my boyfriend s natural scent . it smells like home to me .","302390":"no , i don t believe marriage is overrated at all . i think it s a genuine expression of love and a celebration of love between two people .","302391":"i don t chew gum , so no .","302392":"i never wanted to be a parent when i was younger because i disliked children . even these days , i m still unsure of whether or not i want to be a parent . i would foster or adopt a child if i decide i wanted children and , for some reason , couldn t have any . there are a lot of older children and teenagers in the system who deserve a loving home .","302393":"there s a local news channel for my region , which usually has a lot of local news as well as national global news . however , i generally don t watch the news i usually read articles on google news to get my information .","302394":"yeah , i ve been in one crash which ended up totaling my car . another driver blew through a stop sign while i was going down the street , and i couldn t swerve in time so i ended up t boning him .","302395":"i don t know if i ll even get much back this year for my taxes i was doing a lot of freelance work for a while which is untaxed per week you pay back on taxes at the end of the year , so i wouldn t be surprised if i end up owing the irs money .","302396":"i ve never played the lottery because i ve always thought it was a waste of money .","302397":"i generally don t shop at walmart because there isn t really one nearby , compared to other stores which are only within a minute drive from me .","302398":"i don t remember my childhood . however , i don t miss being a teenager at all . my memories of being a teenager are nothing but bad memories , and i was severely depressed svicidal most of the time .","302399":"i absolutely hate cleaning the bathroom . our bathroom is small , thankfully , but i use a cleaner mixed with bleach and the smell makes me so dizzy because of the fact that my bathroom is so small and we don t have ventilation in there .","302400":"i want to be known for my writing , overall . i ve been trying to write more in an attempt to get my name out there once i m happy with what i ve written , because you simply can t get published if you don t perfect your craft .","302401":"they re not terrible where i live ! ! they re around . at the lowest price , and i can usually fill my tank with less than if i m on empty .","302402":"my student loans . it s my most expensive bill .","302403":"for the most part , yeah . i crave social interaction from time to time , but i can only tolerate being out for maybe hours before i need to be alone again .","302404":"no , i don t care about trolls . i normally delete their messages don t give them a second thought .","302405":"yeah , the area i live in frequently experiences nor easters . it s generally a really bad snow storm where there s high winds , zero visibility , and anywhere between inches of snow if not more . we ve had state of emergencies declared before as a result .","302406":"sometimes ! ! we usually make empanadas together when we have the house to ourselves for a change .","302407":"not at all , lol . i ve been wearing glasses since i was a toddler .","302408":"there s a bar called the local in a town on long island , but i ve only been there a few times .","302409":"a few weeks ago . there was a new bouncer at the bar i always frequent , so he checked my and my friend s ids before entering .","302410":"uh , i don t know what you mean by that .","302411":"i don t live in new york city .","302412":"i m not a big fan of chocolate .","302413":"i only have one sibling .","302414":"my sunday has been going well so far . i ve done really nothing besides drink coffee , listen to music , and work on some writing .","302415":"no . although religion has its flaws and brings out the worst in people at times , it s also a coping mechanism for others and that shouldn t be taken away from them .","302416":"i m not sure . i don t really know what everyone else likes at the moment , especially considering groups of people are interested in things in phases . i don t care enough to follow those trends .","302417":"generally , no . however , i am friends with a few people from askfm so when they write me with either accomplishments or struggles , then i totally empathize with them that affects my mood .","302418":"there isn t much i can do in that circumstance , so i just move on . you can t expect everyone to care about you or your feelings , and if someone simply doesn t care , then they re not important enough to be in your life at all .","302419":"i haven t done much this weekend at all , and it s not even noon on sunday yet . yesterday , i spent most of my time sleeping and i played video games for a few hours . this morning has been more productive alongside drinking coffee , listening to music , and answering questions on askfm , i ve also been writing .","302420":"i don t believe i ve ever fought someone over a guy , no . when i was in high school , i generally liked people who didn t reciprocate those feelings , so it was never an issue that came up .","302421":"sometimes , but it ultimately depends on my mood . i m more tolerant some days to philosophical questions than other days . at the moment , i really don t feel like crunching my brain to answer philosophical questions , though .","302422":"depends on the day . sometimes i don t eat anything , while other days i ll have some oatmeal or an egg sandwich . i also have been trying to eat yogurt or parfaits more often .","302423":"cont of oppression have already been planted and have been growing for centuries , regardless of him , and the further back in history you go , generally the less open to change people are . unlike a good portion of the world today , most of those people unfortunately grew up with oppressive beliefs and to suggest otherwise would be ludicrous . if hitler fought for justice as opposed to oppression , he may not have even been elected as president because we are all so afraid of change and so stuck on punishment that we choose to go with punishable sameness than justified change . also , even if hitler did end up becoming president , the rest of the world most likely would not agree with their version of building the country back up . world war ii could very well be the war on equality as opposed to the war on jews . it was obviously much well said than this but it s always stuck with me . it really makes you think . wow , thank you so much for sending this in ! ! that really does make you think and your friend s thoughts are absolutely true to a degree . i never thought about it that way before .","302424":"lol , aw . this is sweet . thank you so much","302425":"i answered a question similar to this yesterday , i believe . in short , i think there should be more push for better sex education in schools regarding sex itself , the idea of consent , birth control , infertility , stds stis , etc etc . i also believe that schools should introduce a mental wellness class that discusses depression , anxiety , and other mental illnesses , including how to effectively cope with negative feelings and reach out for help when you need it .","302426":"korn is one of my favorite bands , actually ! ! i like their issues album overall , but my favorite song by them might be falling away from me .","302427":"that s a difficult question to answer , considering how influential hitler was when it came to antisemitism and the outcome of world war ii as a whole . there s such a domino effect when talking about hitler s regime that it s almost impossible to really fathom how the world would be if he either did not exist or fought for justice instead of oppression .","302428":"i have a pimple on my cheek rn , which is aggravating me because it hasn t disappeared despite me washing my face often throughout the day .","302429":"aw , thank you ! ! i love aesthetics sm .","302430":"considering i already have a partner , i ll describe his qualities which have attracted me hard working diligent , compassionate to those who deserve compassion and animals , creative beyond belief his drawings and paintings are incredible , honest and straightforward , humorous to the point where his humor is a bit controversial , intelligent in a variety of practice areas , unbelievably handy around the house and outdoors , steadfast in his opinions and beliefs , and loyal .","302431":"i ve probably already ingested about oz of coffee already this morning , so you re right on target , my friend .","302432":"yes , as far as i can remember , she was .","302433":"my hobbies include playing video games , reading , writing , painting drawing , and hanging out with my friends .","302434":"i don t give my snapchat out publicly , sorry","302435":"i remember how other people have made me feel longer than anything else . i may forget exactly what people have said or done , but i don t usually forget how those words or actions made me feel in that moment or afterwards .","302436":"i always enjoyed learning about world war ii when i was in school . i just thought it was such an interesting time period to learn about , especially with respect to the psychology behind nazi germany and the experiments they would perform .","302437":"i tend to notice people s changes in expression , even when it s just fleeting . when people are disappointed but they re too afraid to speak their feelings , or when they re angry and they re trying to suppress it . the other night , i noticed there was a feud going on between two girls at the bar over this one man who was giving them both attention . neither of my friends realized that there was friction between the two girls , but i picked up on the subtle hints and cues between them . i thought it was interesting from a bystander s perspective .","302438":"most people i know seem more motivated when the weather is beautiful sunny outside . however , i ve always been more inspired when the weather is gray dark , or when it s raining . i don t know why it inspires me more , but i always feel more like myself when the weather isn t at its best .","302439":"the more knowledge you have , the more you realize that knowledge is limitless and there will always be things you don t know . i ve noticed that most ignorant people seem to think they know everything while those who are more educated or intelligent realize that there will always be more to learn . i don t think there will ever be a boundary for curiosity , no . no matter how much we think we know , there will always be more for us to educate ourselves on .","302440":"it s been the same in the united states , actually so far , this winter has been incredibly mild we only got one bout of snow right before thanksgiving , but everyone has been getting sick left and right . there have been the measles outbreaks , as well as the flu , which have hospitalized a lot of people i think a few people have died from it as well . i don t think i ve managed to avoid getting sick because i think i m sick rn , lmao . i ve had congestion , sneezing , coughing , etc etc . , for the past month at least . thankfully it isn t anything worse than that , though .","302441":"i would probably travel to australia , or new zealand , or alaska somewhere i ve never been before that i ve always wanted to go to . all of these places just seem like such beautiful places from a tourist s perspective .","302442":"the mountains have always been much more peaceful to me , as well as inspiring . when i lived in massachusetts , i lived in a region of the state where there were a lot of trees and mountains and hills , the college was situated right in the midst of a mountain range . it was honestly so inspiring for my writing , and i would often sneak out onto the roof of one of the lecture halls and watch the sun rise over the mountains if i was having a bad day .","302443":"any money that i ve spent on experiences , not necessarily material goods , have been the best investments i ve ever made . things like concert tickets , plane and hotel tickets , convention tickets , vacations in upstate new york , etc etc .","302444":"this picture has always put me in a state of awe . nature can be so beautiful .","302445":"i suppose it s been fine however , it isn t even am yet , so the day is still quite young ! ! i woke up about minutes ago , and all i ve done is smoke a cigarette make a cup of coffee . i just turned on my laptop and started answering questions since i had a lot in my inbox this morning .","302446":"most sugar substitutes taste absolutely horrid to me , especially equal splenda . my boyfriend takes his coffee with milk two splenda , and i have no clue how he drinks his coffee that way because it s disgustingly sweet . each packet of splenda equals out to two packets of sugar . the only sugar substitute i actually enjoy is stevia . it tastes the most like sugar to me , and it s also all natural .","302447":"right now , my favorite piece of jewelry is one of the necklaces my boyfriend got me for xmas . it s a rose gold tree pendant surrounded by a circle of opal . it s so beautiful and i wear it every day .","302448":"lately i ve been switching off between rose quartz moonstone by bath and body works in terms of body spray . my boyfriend also gifted me a few mini bottles of victoria s secret body sprays , which smell lovely my favorite is probably warm cozy . my favorite body wash is dove s coconut jasmine soap . it smells terrific . i also have been using a homemade soap that one of my high school friends made , it smells like pine .","302449":"i don t cook very often , but i do help my parents with the cooking when it comes to preparing dishes and such . i also like making empanadas with my boyfriend ! !","302450":"wild horses by the rolling stones https youtu . be qhwwcwkmyoc","302451":"i prefer art galleries . some zoos are terrible for the animals living inside of them , and the last time i went to a zoo , the animals looked absolutely miserable it broke me up inside .","302452":"most of my holidays spent with my family feel like holidays from hell , lmao . no one really has a filter on what they re saying , so someone usually gets offended and makes a mess out of the entire holiday , which makes it really awkward for the rest of us . there was also a time i actually got into an argument with my grandmother over tattoos on christmas day , because she was insisting that tattoos are trashy and won t get you hired in the workplace . meanwhile , at that point , i already had multiple tattoos and so did my cousins , so it was pretty demeaning .","302453":"these days , most movies i watch don t really seem to capture my attention at all . something really needs to be riveting and filled with suspense in order for me to be interested in it .","302454":"i prefer the forest . i ve lived close to the ocean my entire life , and i ve never been all that amazed by it , especially considering how people have treated the ocean the beaches around me . i ve always felt most at home in the woods , though , or just surrounded by trees and grasslands .","302455":"space has always intrigued me ever since i was younger . i always found it fascinating how there is so much we still have yet to learn about our universe , and there are so many unanswered questions . my favorite planet used to be pluto , up until scientists stopped calling it a planet . lmao .","302456":"i wish i had coffee . then i proceeded to go make myself a glass of iced coffee .","302457":"my mother .","302458":"i used to spend nights talking to my boyfriend on oovoo when i lived in massachusetts , perhaps hours long at the very least .","302459":"lol , i have no idea ! ! my family has never had cats before .","302460":"i don t have any cats .","302461":"why are you sending me someone s answer from over a year ago . . . ? ? obviously i disagree , lol . however , i m not religious and i don t believe in the concept of sin in the first place , so that s why i don t think being part of the lgbtq community is sinful . people can t help their sexual orientation , it s simply a part of who they are .","302462":"cross off mark morton feat . chester bennington https youtu . be fv otqwaxwc","302463":"most of the time , it s comfortable skinny jeans , boots or sneakers , hoodies , etc etc . however , occasionally i ll wear long , flowing sweaters and cardigans , knee high boots , scarves and beanies , and floral prints , so i d say it could also be somewhat boho chic at times .","302464":"i would love to learn how to sing properly . music has always been a passion of mine , and i wholeheartedly believe that if i had a good singing voice then i would have tried to enter the music industry .","302465":"i really have no idea tbh . the only color i haven t dyed my hair has been green , but i want to do an emerald green next after the blue dye fades out . not only have i had a variety of colors , but i ve also had different types of highlights lowlights with those colors with various combinations , i . e . red and black , purple and pink , brown and dark red , blonde and red , etc etc .","302466":"i have seven tattoos at the moment ! ! i have plans for two more , but i m waiting until i can accrue some more money before getting them .","302467":"i think i would make it mandatory for people to have to re take their driving test every years or so . there are so many people who shouldn t be on the road and i think it would make the roads a lot safer if people had to re take their tests again after they hit a certain age .","302468":"i m really passionate about learning education in general . when i was in college , i really liked learning about the social sciences , i . e . criminology , anthropology , sociology , and psychology . if i didn t get my degree in communications , i would have gotten a degree in any of those fields . i prefer hands on learning and lectures accompanied by powerpoints or anything else that incorporates visual audio learning .","302469":"kfc . it s always disgusted me .","302470":"i try not to lie at all , mainly because i have an absolutely terrible memory i wouldn t be able to remain consistent with lies since i would likely forget what i ve told each person , lmao .","302471":"it wasn t a real emergency as it turns out , but i was at work a few weeks ago my boyfriend called me in a panic because he couldn t find his dog . he searched all over the house , in all of the hiding spots in the backyard , etc etc . he didn t know what to do , so i told him to call some of his neighbors and his grandmother she lives next door to see if maybe he wandered off over there . we hung up , and he called me back five minutes later . apparently his grandmother borrowed his dog because she was lonely and never thought to tell my boyfriend that she was taking him for the afternoon , lmao .","302472":"a few years ago , i actually won a contest that the video game company besthesda hosted ! ! i don t remember what i had to do to win the contest , but they awarded me a gift card to their online store .","302473":"yes , i believe the educational system needs a lot of change . if i was in charge , then i would implement a more in depth sex education curriculum that actually teaches children and teenagers about sex , birth control , and reproductive health . i would also implement a mental wellness class that discusses mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety , as well as how to properly discuss mental health with friends or authorities such as parents or teachers and reach out when you re in need of help .","302474":"i suppose the last meaningful thing i did was prepare dinner for my parents earlier , if that counts for anything ."}}
