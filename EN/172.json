converse","159105":"the philippines could be cool too . i heard that there is a lot of human trafficking that happens there . i d definitely want to travel with a group","159106":"not quite sure what you mean . you re going to have to provide an example i think because i don t quite understand your point . also , neither gorillas nor chimpanzees are monkeys . they re both classified as species of great apes . species are different than breeds . for example , we have lots of breeds of domestic dogs , but all domestic dogs belong to the same species , canis lupus familiaris , just like we have many breeds of domestic horse but they all belong to the same species , equus caballus","159107":"i can speak some german but not really any other language . i think i mostly want to visit countries in asia because a lot of their traditional culture and food is so different from the western cultures i grew up in . i just find it really cool and fascinating and i want to learn more about them .

countries .","159109":"my family and i traveled all around when we lived in germany . we went to france , spain , the czech republic , austria , bavaria , and some others ! i think i d like to visit

anatomy and physiology","159111":"i d love to move back to europe , but i ve never been to anywhere in asia so i think i d like to visit somewhere there","159112":"it only took me a few times of babysitting children to discover that really really wasn t about it . i ve only really ever changed year olds . i know that it can take some kids up to three years old to learn to use the toilet though so i m sure changing a three year old would be perfectly fine and plausible","159113":"no worries and no not really . just hold your breath or breathe through your mouth if you don t like the smell","159114":"haha yeah i have lots of vlogs","159115":"aw thanks","159116":"idk , just see if their diaper is dirty . you can usually just tell by how it looks and smells . . . dude i gotta tell

i m trying to give you the best advice i can , but i really don t know that much about taking care of babies . i ve done it , it s not that difficult , i just hate it a lot .","159117":"i worked at a pet daycare kennel !","159118":"i ve done it a few times . you really can t mess it up , it s not that big of a deal . just make sure the baby is clean and dry before you put on a new diaper and try not to be too rough with them . they have sensitive skin so just treat them carefully and it ll be alright .","159119":"as often as i can find time to get out and see the horse , yes","159120":"naps

have , the terrible twos are an interesting time . it s all about bait and switch haha . just keep them occupied and busy and happy until they go to sleep and hope they don t decide to be difficult","159124":"i m doing good but the anons are really being weird today haha everyone keeps asking me super gross questions and being creepy","159125":"yeaaaah haha in order to be an ethical and kind horsewoman you gotta know a lot about horses p i ve been around them for a lot of years , so i ve just ended up seeing and hearing a lot about them . there are lots of physical indicators of horses health . just like any animal you can look at their body to see if they have any visible signs of neglect or abuse like large lacerations or infected areas . that would probs be pretty obvious haha you can also look at their body condition relative to their age . older horses can sometimes look a bit thinner and droopier just like elderly people , but young horses shouldn t look that way . you shouldn t be able to see a young healthy horse s ribs , backbone , and hip bones too clearly . that would mean that they re too skinny and don t eat enough food . it s also bad for them to be way too fat . you can also look at their hooves and see if they re overgrown indicating poor health and bad care from their person or if they re nicely maintained and help the horse bare weight evenly . you can look at their teeth , coat condition , eyes , lots of things can tell you if a horse is feeling well or not . chance is currently i believe . he s getting a bit old but i wouldn t consider him to be ancient or anything . horses can easily live up into their s","159126":"yeah , i know how to take care of babies and i know i can be patient and gentle and good with them but i still don t like them . i don t really like children in general tbh","159127":"everything . i don t like babies .","159128":"don t be impatient i was typing answers to other questions lol","159129":"not sure , i didn t name him . his full register name is royal fancy chance . horses get named after their parents , usually some sort of spinoff of their father s names . it s traditional i guess . i like calling him either chancellor or chance the horse like chance the rapper haha . he s an arabian cross and has never raced . he was bred for western pleasure i think but has been a trail horse for most of his life . we usually go on nice trail rides and do strength training up and down hills , practice flatwork and balance exercises with leads and diagonals , and work on bending . just keeping him in shape and helping him keep entertained . i d love to teach him to jump one day but i m not sure if he ll ever really be able to jump very high . he seems to enjoy doing it on his own when he s out running around the pasture but he s getting kind of old now to do too much difficult work with a rider on his back lol","159130":"i myself don t own any horses but have leased and ridden lots in the past .","159131":"his name is chance and he lives on pasture board so he s always outside . he s free to roam around , eat grass , and run whenever he wants to he also has access to a natural freshwater spring so he s never thirsty or too hot . he loves to splash in the water it s adorable !","159132":"kind of ? haha he s as healthy as a horse","159133":"of course","159134":"watching tv , drawing ,

convicted of animal abuse should never ever ever be allowed to have any more animals ever again as well . they should also be put on a watch list like pedophiles and monitored to make sure they can t own or harm any living creature ever again . in severe cases , animal abuse is often a sign of someone who is more likely to take the next step and begin abusing or killing people too . in addition to jail time , fines , and a watch list , these offenders should have to take a medical assessment to see if they are likely to become dangerous to society .","159224":"i eat soup and go online or

taught people about nature like about the animals in the park and about fish and trees and stuff and i lead hikes and other programs outdoors ! my favorite thing i had to do as a park ranger was leave

peacefully exist by ourselves without factory farming , fast fashion textiles , etc . the better !","159447":"yeah totally ! critics praised the new lion king remake by disney for its beautiful and realistic looking characters and it made a ton of money in the box office . i thought that movie was total garbage haha so yeah , that just proves your point . everybody has different tastes and opinions","159448":"it s a country that was literally built by immigrants of all races . that s with the american dream is supposed to be about right ? . . . coming from somewhere where there aren t opportunities and building yourself a good life in america no matter your background . haha honestly i think there are almost the same amount of people who speak spanish maybe more in the united states as there are people who speak american english","159449":"no , constructive criticism helps us grow and learn . negative and unwanted criticism aka hate comments etc . only serve to bring others down . not fuck the critics , fuck the haters lol","159450":"you can say something bluntly while also trying to put it nicely , but when somebody says that a statement was brutally honest it usually has a more negative connotation","159451":"no they d be too obsessed with them self","159452":"i hate the dentist ! i go in for my yearly check up but not much else unless there s a problem","159453":"yeah ! plus i used to live there so we learned about hawaiian history a lot at my house lol","159454":"if you re the same anon as before , then we already talked about this .","159455":"is it hawaii ?","159456":"a question many are asking in these strange and messed up times","159457":". . . no i already said that i don t support president donald trump","159458":"no i don t have enough money to buy enough food to hoard . when the panic buyers scooped up everything at the store we just went without . my parents even had to mail me toilet paper once bc we couldn t find any at the shoppes","159459":"a well educated person not only knows things they learn from books but can also learn from the mistakes and successes of others around them . they have knowledge of other cultures , are open to new ideas , can change their opinions after learning new information , can show empathy and sympathy for all beings , and they make geoliterate decisions . i know a lot of people who went to school who i would not consider well educated","159460":"not when i don t have to go . i much prefer to use the restroom at home though . public toilets are disgusting","159461":"loooove smashburger ! their rosemary fries are amazing . i ll def have to try it out thanks","159462":"nah i m over vaping forreal . i hopped on the bandwagon when vaping first came out and i had a juul and before that i had a box mod but i got tired of it really quickly and didn t like the way it made me feel . now seeing all of the anti vaping commercials that have come out recently telling you what s in a lot of vaping products like lead apparently has me convinced that s why i felt so bad when i was vaping overit","159463":"ooo okay ! is it a fast food chain or a mom pop shop ? ?","159464":"i don t think it matters if god is a man or a woman . if god created the universe in their image and the universe is imperfect , then it is exactly as they envisioned it

salad","159468":"if it s crispy and not soggy then yeah i ll eat it","159469":"some people count that as meat and some don t . i count fish and other seafood as meat , so if i decided to go vegan or something then i wouldn t eat that either","159470":"that seems very situationally dependent . obviously i don t want to ever eat a person in my entire life if i don t have to","159471":"yeah probably but i ve never tried . i love chicken nuggets too much haha","159472":"yes damnit","159473":"it s not ? it helps you manage your budget and keeps you eating a variety of healthy and good tasting foods","159474":"well , yeah of course not . otherwise he wouldn t have taken it to the shop lol . all i m saying is that i believe what your mechanic was asking your uncle was not please diagnose exactly what s wrong with your vehicle for me and was actually more along the lines of does it make a funny sound , do anything abnormal when you drive it , have a check engine light on , a noticeable leak from the bottom , etc . you don t need to be a mechanic to realize your car s brakes stopped working out or it screeches when you make turns and stuff like that haha . i think he probably just wanted a bit more information before he had to look at every single part of the car to see what worked and what didn t . my mechanic asks the same questions of me when i bring my truck into the shop . always thought it was a standard question . like how the doctor says what brings you in today ? when you visit . like you don t know exactly what s wrong with you but you know what the symptoms are so they can figure it out for you . that kinda thing .","159475":"your uncle sounds like he s being rude for no reason . . . no point in being rude to someone who s required to ask you that question as part of their job . any info he would ve provided to the mechanic would have been helpful and would ve helped them do their job quicker and easier , therefore costing your uncle less money in labor costs since it would ve helped them spend less time trying to figure out what to work on on the car . . . you asked my opinion and there it is .","159476":"sometimes","159477":"what are you going to do today ?","159478":"they biologically develop slower than females . boys are dumb and irrational and men don t get mature and calm until they re like . good luck sis !","159479":"my boyfriend likes ham on his omelette too but i don t like ham very much . too salty for me !","159480":"i haven t read a book in so long . i think the last one i read was the old man and the sea . . . it s a classic that everyone seems to have read before me lol . everyone seems to go on and on about the symbolism and how great it is , but honestly i didn t find thaaat interesting . not bad but not as amazing as people say . maybe i would have liked it better if i would have actually studied it in school or something and had people explain to me more about the literary devices and stuff","159481":"thanks","159482":"i love omelettes . what do you like to put in your omelette ? i like cheese , sausage , peppers , and chives in mine !","159483":"no problem stay safe

write it down","159493":"kinda ? does it count if the other dog we have is technically my mom s ? this is my pup cezar !","159494":"follow my personal instagram nikki copenhaver my nature photography instagram thenativeva","159495":"i would try to slowly walk around it , giving it a really really wide bubble of personal space . skunks usually only spray you when they feel threatened or afraid or surprised . you can tell when they re about to spray you because they raise their tail up and shake it and stomp their feet and show you their bum . if that happened i would run away lmao","159496":"good , how are you ?","159497":"yeah but it s hard to navigate","159498":"no , having commitment to somebody is what i like most about having a lover","159499":"procrastinate

very good writer .","159502":"it s not the most comfortable thing for me , but i ve had lots of practice in public speaking when i went to university and through my jobs over the years . my last job had a lot of public speaking involved . i was a park ranger , so i had to speak to large crowds every day and was in a leadership position during programs and events i had to organize and present","159503":"that s a different scenario than just being lazy , so if that was something that would be financially viable for us and would help us both in the long run then that would be fine of course . managing the home is a tough job in and of itself lol","159504":"i try my best to dismiss them . the voice in my head can be pretty loud sometimes but over the years i ve learned that i can help quiet the little negative voice by reminding myself of all the things that i am blessed for . a loving support system of family and friends , wonderful pets , a roof over my head , good food to eat , and cloths to wear doing things i enjoy also helps me to quell negative thoughts . going outside for a walk even just for a few minutes , doing art , playing with pets , singing , photography , etc . getting a hug from my boyfriend always really helps too . he s really supportive","159505":"if it came down to it and my husband really just wouldn t work for the sole reason that he was lazy i would seek marriage counseling before just leaving him completely . if he couldn t work because he was injured or sick or something that would be a different story but not if he was just deciding to be lazy . if getting help for the problem didn t work then i would probably try to divorce him . relationships have to be , where each partner tries their best and helps support each other","159506":"being rude to people or taking advantage of them makes me feel bad and i don t like feeling bad","159507":"maybe go out to a restaurant or get curbside pick up from a restaurant if

groups like nazis and the kkk do . . . they exclude and ridicule and demonize people groups they feel superior over and then spread those ideals and continue to raise children who are taught those racist and hateful things , thus breeding and creating more unnecessary hatred in the world . people who know nothing but hate have no place in a compassionate and forward thinking society . i will not argue this subject . i told you my opinion . that should not be and currently is not lawful or just . we have to learn to build each other up , not tear each other down","159561":"yoga

normal everyday life being so ignorant i m truly sorry the education system failed you so badly . . why do you love monitoring my account and commenting disparaging things ? especially when cowering behind anon ? if you have something to say then say it with your name attached . the only reason you won t come out and say rude things off anon is because you know you re being rude and don t want others knowing how hateful your opinions truly are . . the person mentioned never specified their gender so how would you know if they were a man or woman ? i think that you sent me that question just to start discourse because you re bored . . regardless of if it was you pretending to be someone else or not , putting others down based solely on on their socioeconomic status or family background is disgusting . you are a rude , overprivlaged , unaware person . i didn t ask your opinion nor do i care to hear it . keep it to yourself .","159573":"that s good for you ! tough job but a good and

that s why i think some people get uncomfortable with the idea that they ve aged and no longer look like somebody who is years old anymore . they feel pressure to be a certain way and feel abnormal when they can t live up to that standard . as far as orientation goes , that just seems to be a very personal question . lots of people aren t keen to share such personal things . maybe because they

the other group members and myself . they would be an even and fair set of expectations that divided up the work between all members equally . i d produce or demonstrate what we did and make clear what you did not complete . then i d let the prof decide the grades . unfortunately i had to do stuff like this more than once in some of my classes .","159664":"hearing disparaging things said about you can be hurtful whether it s online or in person . nobody should have to feel that way . revenge will not help you heal either . it will only serve to hurt you and others in the long run .","159665":"it s very difficult to help someone who isn t trying or doesn t want help . can be very draining","159666":"request to the professor to either kick you out of the group after everyone else has completed it with me , or if that s not possible then give you poor peer review scores so you receive an f grade to reflect the work effort you did . it happened so many times in college . people can be very inconsiderate . every time the group members who didn t do anything received bad marks for it thank god . professors at my university usually didn t tolerate lazy and unhelpful partners and were fair in grading individual group members","159667":"i never said that ?","159668":"my loud and pushy aunt sometimes makes people uncomfortable at holidays","159669":"when i think of my hope for humanity sometimes","159670":"depends what the circumstances are most of the time my mantra is forgive and forget . water under the bridge . but some things are just

before so i d reckon i m more approachable . people tend to gravitate towards me in groups i ve noticed . like laugh and smile my way more than others when i can tell they re feeling awkward . honestly i feel that , i know what it s like to be left out or feel awkward so i like to engage people who seem shy . it s nice to see them crack a smile of course it s all speculation on my part bc it s not really something for me to decide on my own . i guess other people have to tell you if they find you either snotty or approachable lol . i do know that i m always the one who gets told weird secrets and have been a person who people go to to talk about their problems","159676":"yeah totally . they re classics !","159677":"everything s a balance","159678":"if i have somewhere to be then my

people on the same channel as you","159688":"i m not a sex crazed , nasty , pubescent boy , nor was i ever . that behavior repulses me as well as any oedipus complex garbage . it s just so so so especially disgusting to sexualize your family . . . i just don t understand","159689":"lmao dude i wasn t born yesterday . . . i know what all those things are if that s still the question . i loved my walkman when i was a kid . i ve never used a transistor radio but my dad had one and i ve used a typewriter before lol","159690":"that s weird . that sounds like an old side show attraction where

awful miserable lives","159701":"dude why are you staring at your aunt that way . . . that s extremely creepy . also periods aren t gross they re just an uncontrollable fact of life and a necessary part of biology . grow tf up","159702":"they re the same","159703":"money isn t something i actively seek . if someone i liked ended up being really rich that would only serve as a bonus . i used to date someone who was really well off , actually i dated them for a whole year . but they were slightly egotistical and never stopped talking about themselves . i m sure not all wealthy individuals are that way , but that particular trait about my ex is what made them my ex","159704":". . . ok ?","159705":"you say a lot of things are stupid . . . i haven t been to a stupid county fair in a long time

and oranges . . . . you re a little obsessed","159718":"avengers !","159719":"no i ve already expressed my opinion on that . that s hateful and unnecessary .","159720":"pop tarts have better flavors but i like the texture and consistency of toaster strudels better !","159721":"it s not . you can choose to bring your peers up with you when you rise up the ladder . it s a good social networking move . the more positive connections you have , the more likely you are to succeed and have later job opportunities","159722":"no","159723":"they re okay . can sometimes get confusing","159724":"nice

on chinese people . he killed more people under his poor leadership than joseph stalin and adolph hitler . however it s not a part of western history so it isn t taught as rigorously in at least in my

stigmatized opinion who s seeds are sewn in young people s minds from an early age as a holdover from a time where women were considered weak , evil , unholy , or unclean . an unfair judgement in my opinion . men can be just as cunning and manipulative . abuse goes both ways . silly little girls and boys play mind games and try to feel superior to others . women and men realize how to be mature

things or being angry . i m much more likely to remain soft spoken and be very serious when someone pushes me too far","159833":"i ve never killed anything in my life on purpose cause the act of me killing something makes me very very uncomfortable . with that in mind though everybody needs to eat and everybody has a different ideology . it s the circle of life i guess","159834":"bc conquering

what a lot of women i know like to and want to do lots of women have strong helper instincts , motherly instincts . but everyone knows that the only person who can change someone is themselves . it s easy to get caught up in trying to change your man because you know that he could better himself and be happier . but a lot of times men don t want help and only see it as confusing and annoying . that s just from my personal experiences and that s just my opinion , but still an angle to consider","159838":"i don t have any of those . just regular women s jeans and shorts","159839":"no , just said it wasn t my thing .","159840":"lmao blood doesn t come out of you when you have a tampon in , idiot . go back to basic sex ed class bc you obviously didn t pay attention bet you think girls pee out of their vaginas too","159841":"that s cool of him . forreal nobody needs to flex so hard and be so in your face with their money . it s downright gross and unattractive . there s no shame in living a modest and normal life even if you have lots of money","159842":"no ? ? why would anyone do that ? people who put themselves up on some pedestal because of their affluence have real issues they need to address","159843":"so you re another incompetent , entitled , oaf , who never had to learn how to do anything for yourself and was spoon fed by mama all your life ? you have no basic life skills ? you can t follow directions the first time ? why ?","159844":"no thanks anon . i don t know you","159845":"could be attractive maybe . but women are so much more beautiful and soft and curvy

and so can any other women who chooses to","159847":"i m literally poor too lol so never . if i m interpreting this q correctly then you re referring to people in blue collar or service jobs and stuff right ? i hate when stuck up assholes who think they re better than everyone else and treat others like they re somehow lesser than them just because they were lucky enough to be born into a family that was more well off . disgraceful and despicable","159848":"not really . the closest thing to that that i have is my athletic shorts and they cover my butt fully . i have some jeans shorts too but they also cover my hurt . i don t like when stuff is hanging out of my clothing . it s uncomfortable and impractical","159849":"i m not really into high waisted bikinis either . not sure where that trend came from but agree , they re kinda diaper ish . not everyone can pull them off . i like the triangle bikinis or my victoria s secret bikinis that have support and cute rings and stuff on them .

house off the dock before with some friends and once with a love interest but now there s a lot of seaweed growing in the water so it feels gross to swim","159856":"i like ones that provide enough coverage where i don t feel uncomfortable or exposed . i don t like the way very small and revealing bikinis feel when i wear them it probably looks okay i just don t like the feel","159857":"either

campus at my university once pulled over and offered me their umbrella while i was walking in the pouring rain too","159911":"coffee and horses","159912":"flippy ear boy","159913":"thou shalt not use the pretense of religion as a means to discriminate against or harm another person , believer or not . rather than seeking the character and the heart of god , religious pretense looks for forms and ignores character it looks for self justifying laws and crushes people .","159914":"yesterday","159915":"poor people are happier because they can appreciate the simple things in life , they usually know the value of a dollar a lot better than rich people , and they have to work for what they have . when everything comes easy to you and you don t have to work hard then you ll never be satisfied with what you have and you ll always want more and that s what i see from a lot of well to do people","159916":"no i don t think so cause what if i messed something up ? it always turns out badly in

from a day of ball chasing and dock jumping","159930":"there s a difference between a kind person who is socially aware enough to pull their head out of their ass for long enough to consider the wishes and opinions of marginalized groups and a libtard snowflake social justice warrior who takes every opportunity to become offended on someone else behalf and shove political correctness down people s throats because they think they need to . you have so far shown me that you re quick to become frustrated when someone shares a different world view than yours . you seem no more equipped to handle positive social change than those who choose the latter stance .","159931":"apparently butch is also an offensive term to use . i m not someone who identifies as lesbian so i wouldn t know how they want to be called but i ve heard the terms stud , dom , aggressive , and masculine centered before instead but idk if people really be saying all that","159932":"needs are more important . i need

trying to get a rise out of me . we re probably not even from the same area i don t know you dude come off anon and show me who you are , then let s talk","159938":"no . fuck them for being dishonest , disloyal , and unworthy of my affection , time , and attention .","159939":"i don t think i d actively try to . people tend to get hung up on their first love if you know what i mean . even if that person isn t right for them . it may seem somewhat selfish idc tho but i don t wanna have to deal with that","159940":"sending good vibes to all who scroll past this ! don t forget to go outside and

stick to the streets !","159980":"charging my electronics !","159981":"i don t want to be crushed ripped apart","159982":"pretty rural and sometimes suburban . i split my time between a few different
