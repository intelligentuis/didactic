The second best gifts are that my favorite face to draw right now gave me new selfies and I started a painting from it, and also today I got the pharmacy tech whose face I like too agree to send me a selfie so selfies were my second best gift for sure I love when the things I want to art fall into place.\n  ","159774":"\n  comfortable.

Ini this case specifically it's helped along by a good foundation but I almost never wear foundation. Today I wanted to go with a really dramatic blush so I did the foundation.\n  ","159806":"\n  I can be? Once in a while I will see something sporadically and think \"that would be a good gift for so and so\" and if I buy it and give it to them then yes but when it comes to holidays and there's pressure and it can't happen organically, not really\n  ","159807":"\n  imagine if you just talked to people or asked interesting questions instead of repeating the same childish things over and over\n  ","159808":"\n  stuffing but honestly both\n  ","159809":"\n  I tell people I talk like \"americans on tv\" like I don't have much of a regional accent at all but I speak like they do on tv\n  ","159810":"\n  good morning\n  ","159811":"\n  it would be hard but I'm sure I could adapt.
