I think if I ever did get a piercing it would be a nose ring (small hoop), lip ring or eyebrow. I also liked the idea of this earring last night. I could picture the nose ring, lip and the actual earring on my left side and the eyebrow on the right side. I wonder if that means anything since I can envision tattoos on my left side of body as well\n  \n  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  ","468827":"\n  I want a few but I'd rather wait for that.

I might agree. Treat them with kindness.  Not everyone knows your story and those people don't matter in the end. Maybe silent treatment or I'll say something.\n  \n  If I feel awful already then it could hit more personally. Period doesn't help that either lol\n  ","468830":"\n  Yes, I do.\n  ","468831":"\n  I feel good!
