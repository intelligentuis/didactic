   American rapper XXXTentacion passed away yesterday. He was shot in a robbery.

   Alright so personal question here (I've seen this topic around lol) 
Bubba and I have been together forost of the last 3 years...his ex wife is married and has her husband around the kids...(they've been together officially a year) 
Is it right for her to be mad that I'm in the kids lives?
  ","
  No wtf.
  
  You’ve guys been together for 3 years.
  
  I believe personally that after a year of dating you should be able to meet your partners kids
