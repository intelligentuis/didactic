I apologize in advance this is going to probably be very long.\n  \n  Aliens have been on this planet for billions of years. There are hundreds of different species that are all harvesting different materials for different reasons. Some say that theres species that require metals such as gold. theres other species that require dna. Aliens also have a hand in manipulating our dna. They are saying that they finally have decoded our DNA after 13 years and 93% of our DNA is classified as \"unknown, exterrestrial\" Aliens contact (& have been in contact with government officials for decades) and they give notes with ASCII binary code. They have been warning us to stop sending signals up into space, which is exactly what Bill Gates, Elon Musk, & Stephan Hawking have all been saying. They are saying that we are having an increase in UFO\/ET encounters from life from 40,000 years from the future to stop us from making any nuclear bombs. After the bomb in Japan, they have numerous sights of UFOS at different nuclear sights. They communicate telepathically. They come in many different forms. They can be lights, androids, or whatever they want to perceive themselves as. President Eisenhower had 3 meetings with aliens, even Obama states,  'Well, certainly I can tell you that in 1954, President Eisenhower had three encounters, set up meetings with aliens, which took place at certain Air Force bases including Holloman Air Force base in New Mexico.'\n  \n  Nordic Aliens come from the Pleiades who resemble Nordic-Scandinavians. Blonde hair, blue eyes, fair skin. Nordic aliens are often associated with spiritual growth and love and act as protectors for the experiencers.\n  \n  Now Lets talk about Rendlesham Forest:\n  \n  The first of several sightings occurred in the early hours of December 26, 1980 when U.S. military personnel spotted strange lights.  It is one of the few officially documented UFO sightings where witnesses claim to have seen a craft land Nick Pope, who was a Ministry of Defense employee from 1985 to 2006, \u201cThis was not some vague \u2018lights in the sky\u2019 sighting \u2013 the UFO actually landed.\u201dOfficer Jim Penniston's witness account, \u201c...No landing gear was apparent, but it seemed like she was on fixed legs. I moved a little closer... I walked around the craft, and finally, I walked right up to the craft. I noticed the fabric of the shell was more like a smooth, opaque, black glass.\u201d The next day, radiation levels recorded at the site of the indentations were also reported to be unusually high. United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt recorded, \u201cIt looks like an eye winking at you... Here he comes from the South, he's coming towards us now...

Then i started thinking about how everything im interested in are different aspects of the brain\/mind\/cognitive; astrology, psychology, sociology, neuroscience, biology, chemistry ect. So then i thought what if i need to study every aspect to be able to get the full understanding of the brain and not just focus on one, maybe i can connect more dots then other people because im taking information from all different categories. Then i started to think what if they make you focus on one thing because in order to fully discover other worlds you need to have a complete understanding so if they make you limit yourself, youll never get there. Cause if you think about peoples careers, they dont keep growing and growing... they hit a stopping point, its the people who do something different that end up learning more and more even about their career before.\n  \n  Think about musicians. They are pushed to keep making better music of what they are specialized in and a lot of times if they try to do something different the music industry kinda loses their shit.. they hit a stopping point too and thats why people like eminem went to do different things cause theres only a limit you can go with one thing...\n  \n  Omg i got off topic.

Take this time to cherish those in your life because when you get older whether you like it or not, you will out grow some and some will out grow you so enjoy the time you have with them. Life takes you on crazy paths and you will have some crazy chapters but just enjoy it. Life is too short to be so sad all the time. Dont worry so much about the future. Worry about the present because if you dont, you might not even have a future. Pay attention to your health and your mind. Take your time to heal and let go. ?\n  ","609463":"\n  I feel like its only logical for aliens to try to take over the universe to establish dominance.\n  "}}
