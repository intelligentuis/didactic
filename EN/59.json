That's somewhat vague and also somewhat specific.....\n  \n  Um.... Well it depend..\n  \n  Does the narcissist WANT to come back? I'm going to say yes, they do, otherwise you would've have asked this question in the first place. And it also depends on if the one who was being ghosted believes in the reasons as to why the narcissist wants to come back. Would your intentions be true? Understand, someone who could also very well be a narcissist themselves do know how to read when someone is lying.. So it's more on if the reason you'd want to come back, are honest and true, and that you really want to come back.\n  \n  Im more than certain that the other party would be more than happy to accept your back. But I don't think they'd be willing to put up with the unnecessary pettiness. You know, being ghosted- can change someone, I would know. As I'm speaking from my own experience.\n  \n  There's a certain pressure point that is developed in the person who was ghosted. That pressure point is self made, in case they need some sort of defense mechanism. They don't WANT to have it, but it's one of the side of effects of losing trust in people. I'm sure the person has a side of them that' is still as compassionate as ever before, but there's also a cold side that perhaps they kept down for years because, well, they needed to.\n  \n  basically without the repetitiveness, if you do come back. Come back for the right reasons. Come back because you're reasons are true, and are you. Give and Show they why they should believe you. I'm not saying just lay it all out on the table, I get things take time to develop\/rebuild but as long as both are willing and WANTING to heal old wounds, it' takes the trust and honesty from both side..  Letting people hurt those who didn't deserve it, is done. Just be your true self if you do decide to do that, because you'd be taken back with arms wide open.... sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith in order to find out.\n  \n  Also, since we're both speaking in VAGUE as FUCK riddles, lol, What do you mean by\"How likely is it that he will come back to Hoover?\" Are you referring to a vacuum \"hoover\" or like \"Hoover St.\" down in compton..\n  ","63424":"\n  I think think there's a word for that... it's called\n  \n  \"Attention Whore\", \"Thot Pocket\".. jk i don't know.. try asking a females... maybe they just do it because women want to secretly destroy the world\n  ","63425":"\n  Mhm..

What your two's relationship like?\n  \n  Depends on how you asked. did you do it like a dickhead? or were you courteous about it. Also, it matters on the words you use as well.. or perhaps you're just ugly as fuck and they said fuck no. or perhaps they're just not interested...\n  \n  Anywho.. why the fuck am i answering things you should be figuring out on your own.\n  ","63427":"\n  Happy New Years , Dick Cheese\n  ","63428":"\n  I already do.

It's not just about \"doing you\"  It goes deeper than that. It's when you're able to do that, you start your journey of independence and to be able to stand on your own two feet. Not many people are able to do that, which is why you hear about so many people be miserable. It's beause at the moment, they're unable to do what they want, or they're unable to. Me- I love editing. Editing is what bring me happiness, as in I have a special ability to make a person feel by watching something i edit. There's a sense of satisfaction when I get a particular response. I'm doing what I dreamed of doing, I'm fortunate enough to get that chance and opportunity to do so. When I found this, this is what I spend every single moment trying to perfect. I focused on me and myself, because, you're the only one whos going to be affected by your choices, good or bad.\n  \n  So with the time you have, is it better to worry and kill yourself over what other people who mean no real significance in your life, control your life.

My depression, something which I was just starting to make some real progress on overcoming, reappeared. It was a total shit show.\n  \n  It was unprofessional, and was fucking embarrassing.\n  \n  That was the very first time I\u2019ve ever lost interest in something I worked hard to get. Not any time before this recent moment, have I EVER lost interest in my pursuit for it. I know this because I don\u2019t pursue things I think might work, or \u201cit\u2019s a maybe\u201d.\n  \n  I know what I want and i cherish everything I work for.\n  ","64353":"\n  Why is everyone asking this same goddamn question. If you\u2019re going to ask this, as it in a way that doesn\u2019t just feel copy and pasted or generic\/typical. Don\u2019t mean to come off rude about it, but I\u2019m sure you can get where I\u2019m coming from with it.\n  ","64354":"\n  You know, when you copy and paste your answers(if you did... it seems like it) onto something that did not ask or mentioned that particular thing you replied back with, it makes your answers feel hollow.\n  ","64355":"\n  Idk. I think 20-30 I believe.\n  \n  I don\u2019t apply to any and all jobs just to say I did it either. These were jobs I was more than qualified to do\n  ","64356":"\n  What about it.\n  ","64357":"\n  From the moment of Birth to roughly our adolescent\/teenage years, yea- I do believe there is some good inside of everyone....\n  \n  But from that point on till their present day age, no.\n  \n  Not everyone. People can be cruel.\n  \n  And as people grow older, some tend to grow and become more cruel. After so many years of that cruelty, that \u201cGood\u201d that inside can only last so long before it withers away and there\u2019s nothing left.\n  \n  Unfortunately.\n  ","64358":"\n  To be loved.\n  \n  You can love someone all you want, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll ever know or acknowledge it.\n  \n  There\u2019ll always be more satisfaction in knowing that you are loved by someone, than to love someone ,but never be loved.\n  ","64359":"\n  Hello, I\u2019m alright I suppose. But To be honest I could be doing much better. Lol\n  ","64360":"\n  Uhhh...\n  \n  I don\u2019t have a volleyball team. Lol.\n  ","64361":"\n  Yea we use them when cleaning ourself. But that doesn\u2019t mean they still don\u2019t go in and all around a persons shitty asshole, their gooch, their balls and\/or va-jay-jay, their armpits. So unless you\u2019re using your own hands to clean out your doo doo maker, you\u2019re gonna be \u201ccleaning\u201d yourself with a shit rag.\n  ","64362":"\n  No. I Don\u2019t any pets.\n  \n  Not anymore that is, home slice done went and died. Old age, \ud83e\udd7a.\n  \n  What kinds would I eventually want.... mhmm. Well, most of my- I\u2019ve dreamt of owning a midget farm. And purchase some land for them to go play in and roam around in the open. I wanted a whole farm full of them.\n  \n  So yea- I guess my next pet could very likely be a midget.\n  \n  Damn... it\u2019s getting me kinda exited now that I\u2019m thinking about it.\n  \n  \ud83e\udd14 mhmm..... decisions, decisions....\n  ","64363":"\n  An I supposed to know who that is?\n  ","64364":"\n  Well that\u2019s good to hear.\n  \n  What\u2019s making your day amazing?\n  ","64365":"\n  Alright\n  ","64366":"\n  It was a lot less productive than I\u2019d hoped it be. It was lazy actually.\n  \n  How about yours.\n  ","64367":"\n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/HtMxyNqQCH4\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","64368":"\n  Fuck no. Lol\n  ","64369":"\n  Well besides having mutual feelings, I\u2019d say it\u2019s transparency and trust.\n  ","64370":"\n  I\u2019m from Bakersfield.\n  \n  What about you.\n  ","64371":"\n  Bills. And food. And whatever subscriptions I have or need for work.\n  ","64372":"\n  Nobody to blame except for the ones starting the fires\n  ","64373":"\n  I believe they\u2019re possible, yea.\n  ","64374":"\n  I wouldn\u2019t.\n  \n  I don\u2019t want to Imply anything different either.\n  \n  Plain and simple.\n  ","64375":"\n  A Fox.\n  ","64376":"\n  Translation:\n  \n  \u201cCollective:\n  \n  Do you think that if you left Ask now, someone would miss you?\u201d\n  \n  Answer:\n  \n  I can\u2019t see why anyone would, I feel like I leave a lot of questions unanswered. Perhaps theirs might fall under that category.\n  \n  BUT!!\n  \n  IF someone did, It\u2019d be nice to know. As well as who. Perhaps they\u2019d give me more incentive to want to stay.\n  ","64377":"\n  Translation:\n  \n  \u201cIs there anything that can be consulted for TA thesis, but not services :') Stuck with rules\u201d\n  \n  Response:\n  \n  Rules are meant to be broken.\n  ","64378":"\n  I\u2019m going with warm blanket.\n  \n  But I\u2019ll take the cup of tea so I can quench my thirst.\n  ","64379":"\n  Dafuq?.....\n  \n  I never said ANYTHING about playing or liking of all games, NBA Live... lol\n  "}}
