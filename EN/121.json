enjoy cooking . as long as my kitchen doesn t suck , that is .","112083":"i m a fan of the clavicle on either and the nape of the neck","112084":"sweating a lot","112085":"i have no idea wtf this is supposed to mean so whatever , here s a bird drawing","112086":"if it were up to me we d be in an open marriage to be honest . so the idea of either doesn t really bug me a ton because i don t really feel like anyone belongs to me . it s a concept that frankly grosses me out . however , my husband is very traditional and for now this is how we are and that being said i guess physical but only because of the risks involved .","112087":"i have never heard of it , but judging from the name alone , no , i m in a monogamous marriage .","112088":"sock dreams and then i would take all the socks i love for myself muahahaha","112089":"yup , they exist . i ve granted and been granted them .","112090":"the dress i m wearing in my profile pic","112091":"it depends but in most cases i ve given multiple chances .","112092":"both . everything . relationships are hard in every way . you have to be willing to compromise for the greater good and understand that love fluctuates . you have to trust and be trustworthy . you have to be patient and empathetic . it s all hard work . having someone love you is worth the work .","112093":"because when you re in love , especially when it s new , it feels like the most important thing in the world . people who don t have love want it , people who have it want more . love is quite dangerous .","112094":"everything dramatic was also traumatic , and as i have cptsd i m going to pass on this and suggest you not randomly ask people shit like this because it can be extremely triggering .","112095":"i m pan and am def attracted to women so i m for sure in support of lesbians","112096":"i tried to ride a bike again at the store last year because i was thinking of buying one but i nearly fell off and could hardly remember how to ride the damn thing","112097":"all of my cats are short haired american mackerel tabbies . so short hair i guess . long hair would be too much during shedding season .","112098":"this is another boring question so

off , it s because it s fun . this question is ridiculous so it was probably good that you clicked anon even though we all know who you are","112101":"i think it s pretty easy to avoid feeling burdened by either with mindfulness . there are more pains than those and in fact those are not even necessary or things that everyone has to deal with .","112102":"hahahahaha","112103":"lol i don t get likes on any of my answers or posts across any social media so it s like nbd i m old and ornery people hate me","112104":"sure , who doesn t","112105":"art , empathy , instability","112106":"rules against piercings and tattoos are pretty outdated , cashiers not being able to sit is something i find annoying . i dunno . i also think most dress code rules are pretty ridiculous . like , if a place has a uniform that s one thing but if it s a polo shirt or a t shirt , then just let your employees wear jeans or a skirt or whatever . pleated front khakis should all be burned in a bonfire .","112107":"i think that you choose your own path , but whether or not we deserve what comes to us for those choices depends on quite a lot more than whether or not we went with the status quo .","112108":"maybe , and they re probably insufferable .","112109":"i don t think it s anyone s place to try to talk someone out of their faith , no . that seems really intrusive . i don t think religion is the enemy . i think a bunch of internet atheists are trying way too hard to feel oppressed .","112110":"i like it . i think most people could benefit from caring more about what is happening around them and how their actions affect others .","112111":"i don t agree that this is a thing . i see plenty of positive stories through my news aggregates and while there is plenty of negative too , i don t feel like it s unbalanced or that society only focuses on the bad . i think the bad is just really bad right now . i m not sure i ve ever seen anyone blame the government or country for bad news ?","112112":"people would react by being depressed and hurt . religion is a comfort to people . i don t think that the fight would be any different , just maybe reasons would change . i was raised with no religion and still believe in right and wrong , you know ? values exist outside of religion .","112113":"i try not to classify the majority as ordinary because it creates a them vs me situation in my brain . i think very stupid people are easily influenced but that s just an unfortunate part of being stupid . i think most people are not that stupid though and if they are allowing the media or whatever to influence them it s after they ve given it some thought and made a choice to believe it . the drive to do so could be anything but i don t think that most people choose badly because they think they re doing the wrong thing , everyone thinks they re on the right side of an issue i m sure for whatever reason .","112114":"privilege , luck , opportunity","112115":"i smile a lot . i smile back at people , i smile at people first , i smile for no reason , people probably think i m a weirdo .","112116":"i m glad it wasn t underwear ! my soon

you re really very heavy serious and i m generally coming here trying to relax . i don t really have any advice . i am having an okay , thanks , hope you are doing well as well .","112119":"it s not really my experience that this happens that much , and i don t really see it as a problem anyway . it s not anyone else s business how someone wants to present their lives online . if suzy wants to only focus on the positive then good for her it doesn t mean anything to me one way or another . if bobby uses a bit of hyperbole in his fishing stories , what does anyone else care ? it has nothing to do with good in the world .","112120":"everyone s different . some people will never hit the point of breaking with things , they ll just continue convincing themselves that things are fine forever .","112121":"i don t think that s the case . i don t think we demand so much from our politicians because we believe them to be god like , but because we put our faith and trust into them when we elected them to make the right decisions and pass the right laws and represent us as they are supposed to do","112122":"i m trying to be . i m not sure what creates happiness . maybe living in the present rather than the past or future . enjoying the present . i don t think it s either achievement or exploration based , though those things can create joy during their moments .","112123":"i don t really know you well enough to have an opinion other than your someone who sends and answers questions on here and i follow you . not really much of anything , but i mean , at least there s nothing negative .","112124":"i trust people too much sometimes , but other times it takes me ages to trust . i m not sure where the line is drawn and what makes it so wildly different from person to person . i deal with those people by trying to stop giving my energy to them as much as i want . it s not always easy .","112125":"i see","112126":"it was drizzling , it was june , he was and i was , his mouth was very wet and he smelled like a bowling alley","112127":"not everyone s meant to have a singular passion , and society tells those people that there s something wrong with them or their goals or drives but there s not . i am very singularly passionate about things art , for instance and always have been . my husband however tries different things all the time and hasn t ever really settled into a hobby or interest that he s felt was his . but that s okay ! because in the meantime , he s learned new things about himself as well as by trade and some people thrive on newness and varied experiences .","112128":"having survived this much","112129":"a crush belongs to you . it s your secret , or your thing to share . it s butterfly stomachs and doodling your names and daydreams . love belongs to two people equally and needs to be treated very carefully and with respect to stay healthy . love is serious business . love is comfort and peace . there are lots of types of love and love can be shared by people of any age but romantic love is not something children experience or should strive for . romantic love and the chemicals and hormones associated with it come with sexual maturity .","112130":"crime comes from lots of things , and i would wager that not even a small fraction of all crimes are performed by mentally ill people . yes we should treat criminals that need it , but to assume that criminals and the mentally ill are one in the same or even overlapping to a small degree is harmful to those of us who are mentally ill and doing perfectly fine without criminal behavior .","112131":"i don t know enough about evolution and genetics to really have an answer for you . i suspect that it s not stopped our progress but maybe slowed , sure , that sounds reasonable . phew . you re making me think too much i am way too stoned all of the time lol","112132":"was this supposed to make me like got suddenly lol or you just felt like quoting something at me that you d know i d have to google . anyway here s some house finches i drew tonight","112133":"i don t watch game of thrones and as an outsider looking in the fandom and what i ve heard about the show seem

government doesn t need to be responsible for everything , firstly . it makes me uncomfortable to consider the government in charge of what to do with any group of people unless that thing to do is protecting rights . anyway . not everyone s worth is in what they produce . maybe when jobs are no longer plentiful a more socialist society will have to be adopted to educate and enrich the population while taking care of them as well . this doesn t have to be a big government concern , it would probably be most beneficial to govern in small city groupings or whatnot if it came down to that .","112144":"not a single plan .","112145":"hi , not much just drinking my coffee and listening to the spotify discovery playlist for the week","112146":"behind every successful man is a

children i pay almost no attention to the school systems so i don t have a good answer for this","112150":"mandatory , government enforced anything is pretty effed up in my humble opinion . removing

d","112166":"year old me hates this but present day me thinks seems like a good idea . smoking is a really unhealthy habit , i quit years ago after years of smoking . can t drink or buy weed in legal states until , there s no reason cigarettes shouldn t be the same .","112167":"from what i understand she s feeling okay but her heart is in bad shape . i guess they re going to put her in a cardio

read the comics or watch many of the movies . most of the comics i ve read were big in the s and were independent or dark horse or whatever . i never read or watched deadpool because i really hate the whole i m so random thing . my husband says i d like it if i tried though .","112172":"definitely . i went to a fine arts high school like in the movie fame so we were basically the coolest . all of my friends were artists , musicians , dancers , actors , opera singers , or musical performers","112173":"i feel like this got cut off halfway , so i m not really understanding . if you mean what edible foods can t i eat at any cost , the answer is mangos . i m really allergic to them .","112174":"we re looking for something close to move in ready but don t mind doing some minor work if the price is right . we ve been looking for something with a large yard , a large kitchen with new ish cabinets , and a master bedroom with a master bath big enough to house a tub and a shower stall and two out of three of those things only come in more modern or at least modernized homes and the yard generally only comes with older properties because these new homes get squished in together so close so it s been sort of a weird assortment of houses .","112175":"well , foremost , my grandmother had another heart attack today in west virginia and i m across the country in washington so i can t go be with her and i hate that . i also hate that she s under lbs . and it makes me feel like my uncle isn t taking good enough care of her and i m ready to move her out here with me but i don t think she d ever agree to it . i wish i could take care of her . it would help both of us to be on a regular meal plan and have someone to look out for us . secondly , we put an offer in on a house last night and are hoping to hear something about that tomorrow sometime so we re nervous , we ve already had two houses we loved bought out with really impossible to match offers . i m ready to be out of these apartments . in three days , i meet with the gi doctor about some irregularities seen when i was having my appendectomy last month . i ve been worried for a while about this , and i guess he ll be recommending a colonoscopy and we ll go from there but something looked weird enough in there to alert my surgeon at any rate . my bird has been such a great help to me , i haven t had a panic attack in a while now , and even today with all of these things weighing on me i feel relatively calm . i think about his amazing influence a lot , i m grateful for my feathered friend . and that s basically what s been on my mind , thanks for asking","112176":"you will survive","112177":"i don t disbelieve or believe you but i m married and i don t really care . but thanks . it s nice to be

furries but all of them . it really bugs me when random people bring their sexual business to the public eye not everyone is comfortable with that and no one gave consent . it s triggering as fuck for some survivors to have to deal with other s weird ass kinks in their inbox or walking down the street . kids shouldn t be exposed to you walking your pet otherkin in bondage gear . etc .","112195":"okay my official answer is no one . but while i was considering it i had the sickest thought what if there was a really terrible family group of people and one of them died of whatever

. just a different vibe .","112201":"generalization and stereotyping for the most part are things lazy bigots do . there are exceptions . an oppressed person expressing themselves against the

s the case then i feel pretty strongly that he or she wants us to progress and be good to each other and our communities , not continuously knock down anyone outside of the white cis straight male

perforated edges so you can easily tear them out are my favorite book features . being left handed , being able to tear the page out to work on helps me out a lot . mandala books are very popular , as are patterns and animal and plant designs , but there are coloring books of all sorts out there . saw a star wars one the other day that i wish i had bought but it was hard cover and pricey

tell you that the english folktale of melusine often depicted her with wings in her true form , even though she was essentially a freshwater mermaid . of course , she could also look completely human when she wanted as well , and is said to have mothered children with one of the lords of the plantagenet house , from which i m descended . . . . . so i mean , i guess there s a minuscule possibility

back and was having intense muscle pain , and found that indica strains with a lot of cbd really helped with that . i started experimenting with other strains and found that hybrids containing certain sativa properties , who had a good amount of terpenes , were reallllly helpful for anxiety and staying focused for me , so that s mainly what i smoke nowadays . much better as needed panic medication

your husband , so you can say something shitty about my appearance , or his there s a new one today in your group of questions , about boyfriends , i can only imagine what your ridiculous little self thinks you re baiting me to say there what do you do with the results of this ? sit around slapping your gross , unwashed dick thinking about all the feminists you got to pull a gotcha ! on ? are you fucking ?","112555":"i usually immediately block and report these . sometimes , i answer angrily . from now on , i m just going to answer with this and leave it on my page . this is literally the same question , verbatim , that i ve been asked , repeatedly , dozens of times for the entire length of my time on this website . this is something that someone , somewhere or several someones thinks is an appropriate question . the idea , you see , is to try to clumsily bait someone percieved as a feminist or sjw into saying that you ll cut off the penis so then . . . . i presume they can hate you more for hating men ? or maybe it s a fetish thing . shrug . either way , i don t care about you , i don t care about your ridiculous attempts , and i definitely don t care about your sad boner

overall it s pretty clear they are quite divided .","112558":"i don t . mental illness has so many faces . it s me . it s someone you know . it s someone worse off than us . it s someone more functional than us . i ve grown up with a very skewed idea of what sanity means , all i know is that it s fragile .","112559":"my husband snores very loudly but that s not that weird . i had a roommate in my freshman dorms in college who sleep talked my favorite times were when she held up her fingers like a phone and had one sided nonsense conversations into it .","112560":"i m only

thinking about streaming nuclear throne again tonight but mostly i just don t want to interact , i wanna listen to music and play , you know what i mean ? at any rate , my twitch channel is shehitsback","112568":"it s been a few years since i ve watched south park , but i stopped caring about it then because i felt like they are just kinda spreading this message that there s nothing anyone can do about social issues , so may as well just make fun of everyone and sit around pretending we re super awesome and funny for it ! and frankly , that s an attitude i could do with much less of in this world . it s easy to sit around in your privilege and judge everything without action or care , but i prefer to hope things can change for the better and do what i m able to make that happen .","112569":"i won t click links from anons since the last time i did it was an attack on me in video form . try again or bye","112570":"i was too lazy tired to wash off my lip color and

it s a very human thing to do to remove one s self .","112572":"i have a hard time picking one , and the greatest albums i can think of aren t necessarily representative of my latest tastes in music ,

grimes","112573":"right this very second , alex winston is on . lately , i ve been listening to a lot of missy elliott , the tontons , grimes , beach house , mr twin sister , yacht , leisure cruise ,

to be mouthy and rude about naive opinions and assertions , not so cute .","112575":"what she said","112576":"sure if i wasn t passionate about things , then they wouldn t get done . art especially requires some sort of passion .","112577":"thank you ! and thank you to all of my friends who have put up with extreme mood swings and paranoia this past while , you mean so much to me . not everyone

years","112580":"you re fine ! i m only sending this out because when i had a falling out with another member things got a bit wonky and i lost some followers and gained new followers and i just wasn t sure where i stood anymore . i will keep you around","112581":"i have reservations to my favorite lebanese place so i m going to go with that lol . jon loves schawarma , i get my beloved childhood

recommendation for medical marijuana , i have certain comfort type things i do for myself when i m suffering . this usually includes coloring or drawing , music that i ve pre selected to be soothing on a playlist , focusing on the present , relaxing my muscles , playing my ukulele , stuff like that .","112589":"nah . i like pleasurable things as much as the next person but its not what drives me

maybe , but otherwise , not really . i ll geek out over furiosa merch but only because there is just so little of it","112596":"i hate them . i hate those , and fail videos where someone gets hurt , and basically anything that targets women for a prank because . it s something really terribly sexist and almost as often relies on consent that the prankster doesn t have i m thinking specifically of that one shitbag that was smacking women s asses for lolz like , the kid who goes through drive thrus dressed funny is alright . that s not offensive or harmful to anyone .","112597":"i convinced this guy kirk in like th grade or something that there was a paint splash on the ceiling of the student lounge at the studio we were at because gravity stops working once every thousand years for like ,

dunno . i m bad at love .","112600":"the only person i know who s ever quoted this monologue to me is bpd and split me off , destroying our business and causing me to lose my closest friend of over years , so i m a bit anti blade runner for the time being .","112601":"in the south they call when that happens devil beatin his wife . isn t that terrible ?","112602":"i m not one of those rabid bacon people either . wings and bacon are both alright .","112603":"i have cptsd and schizophrenia , my brain has been under attack for years and years , and along with it , my intelligence . so i do try to preserve it in that case , as best i can , but there s not really much you can do , i don t think ? improving or learning and hoping that i can keep things as is for as long as possible is all i can do right now .","112604":"on a scale of they are overrated . i dunno i m honestly not the biggest wing fan , though i do like them . i liked them better when they were cheaper but we can thank mcdonald s for mucking that up .","112605":"durability","112606":"markers definitely . i color a lot and with crayons they re too thick to get details well , and pencils take too much hand pressure so my hand ends up cramping after too long but markers have fine points and don t require any hand pressure","112607":"yes","112608":"radicchio","112609":"i guess the middle , i didn t finish watching

a lot lol . i ll take them a few at a time . i ve often wondered what it would have been like in the cabaret voltaire in zurich in as the dadaist movement was formed . so many strong personalities re defining art , i think the air must have been electric .","112612":"it s hard to not let paranoia take over when the slow down on all activity literally started right after your friend s little sub tweet marathon about my personal business .","112613":"i don t do well with brothers , ask the one i don t speak to , or the one who i refuse to call brother any longer . i don t really do well with anyone tbh .","112614":"i see ask fm took a break from one type of ableism to switch to another . if i were able to ride either thing , i d probably rather a roller coaster .","112615":"hey followers go ask leigh some honesty day questions","112616":"imbalances roll , plea .","112617":"at least the basics . more important than that though , i have to care enough about the issue to bother to hold an opinion .","112618":"um . pickle slices , i guess . some people really love me and some people instantly do not . i m not meant to be idolized or thrown out though , so i wish i was more like mayo or mustard or something . holding shit together without any major expectations .","112619":"oh , well . . . it was small and well made so we were advised to wait it out . my poor grandmother had to check after me for a couple of days to make sure it passed through .","112620":"anything that switches on the metaphoric lights on something important or interesting to you , i would think . sometimes when i m coloring i sort of zone out and unpack really important parts of my past or emotional make up or whatever without really meaning to i have more memory flashbacks when i m in that frame of mind i consider those profoundly enlightening experiences in their own ways .","112621":"gasp","112622":"i wonder of ask . fm can go a week without using the word cr zy in a qotd ? assholes .","112623":"lol i m not so lovely . i m a mess . you may be proud of me though i m building up some nice calluses on my fingertips from my new instrument , i m aggravated that i live in apartments because i had to put it away a couple of hours ago for quiet time and i want to play more","112624":"i am having a hard time conceptualizing world peace while my inner peace is so fragile lately . maybe it is . it would take a complete overhaul of the way we do things .","112625":"creating","112626":"abstract reasoning is kind of a combo of logic , pattern recognition , visual reasoning , and spatial reasoning , and it was the part of the iq test i excelled at most . i did less well at math .","112627":"i swallowed a locket when i was because i woke up from a vivid dream about candy , reached over to the dresser , and grabbed it and ate it thinking it would also be candy .","112628":"omgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomg i am so glad that this movie exists . it was like falling in love all over again . also , i thought i d love rey the best but i ended up loving finn the best because it was so so so important to me to see that un mentioned cptsd appear in his character and watching him make decisions based on panic but still overcome and be a good guy ugh this movie was so good .","112629":"do you follow souls ? he also really likes hendrix .","112630":"tell you what . come off anon and let me know why you hate women first , and then i ll maybe answer .","112631":"gosh thank you","112632":"i think it s somewhere in the middle of those two options . intelligence is subjective enough , there are plenty of things that can influence someone and alter the way they process thoughts but i do think that there s sort of a baseline level of intelligence that each of us have that can be estimated .","112633":"ugh , i hated gym class . i was the person convincing the teacher i had period cramps basically every day . looking back , i see the value of encouraging students to learn team work and that exercise should be an important part of one s day . i don t think it has to be exclusive to those who are other abled , but at least back in the s and s it certainly was . i think that if educators are able to create a plan that includes everyone , and expectations come away from the whole meeting the presidential fitness award or doing x amount of push ups or being the best baseball team in the tri state or whatever and instead focused more on staying healthy and simple calisthenics and team play , it s valuable .","112634":"i honestly don t know anything about the educational system in my area or country or whatever , i don t have kids and i m in my late s . from what little i ve gleamed from other people bitching on facebook or whatnot is that there doesn t seem to be any room for variation , which seems counter intuitive to learning imo . the schooling i had was so successful because there was plenty of wiggle room to explore ideas and move from subject to subject organically .","112635":"well , i m trying to teach myself to play the ukulele , so that . if i have to pick traditional school subjects , i never took a lot of science or geography classes because my schedule was strictly core credits art school , so it would be nice to get a chance to learn some of what i missed . also , language . i was unfortunate in that i was assigned a spanish and spanish teacher that i absolutely loathed in high school and i didn t retain nearly as much as i would have liked because of it . i grew up listening to spanish and portuguese speaking radio broadcasts with my grandfather so i can understand a lot of it but i can t speak any other languages and i definitely wish i could .","112636":"i had a series of testers come pull me out of classes as a child to run state and national tests on me this was like , st through rd grade . i don t have my transcripts from the time but i was in the top so that would put my iq somewhere above . from there i was placed in a specialty gifted school , but i transferred out of the academic program in th grade to pursue visual art instead and continued that for the remainder of my school years","112637":"hrm i thought this was a question about how to express love but when i went to answer it it changed to most embarrassing moment , so i guess i ll answer both . . by being emotionally present and genuine and caring . i ate something that was spoiled and didn t realize it when i was like , so nearly years ago but anyway i go to the laundry mat that s like , city blocks away and feel okay doing the laundry and then suddenly do not feel okay and run to the bathroom . . . . which is locked and out of service . so i decide well , gotta just very carefully and swiftly walk home . this guy i kinda knew stopped to chat about something , small talk , i dunno , i m trying to be polite but my face is red and i m sweating and bouncing from one foot to another and this guy just won t stop talking or realize what s happening , just jabbers away and disaster . i was wearing a very long , very thick velvet skirt and tights , so he still didn t have any clue and kept talking so finally i just started running , crying , got home , cleaned everything up , and had to walk back shamefully to finish the laundry .","112638":"revenge is fueled by anger , pain , envy it requires the wronged party to mete out the justice rather than leaving it to a non passionate third party or fate or whatever else . justice steps back and allows the systems in place to work , or at least works towards making sure that those systems work better . it s the fairer , more logical of the two .","112639":"i wouldn t say weak , as embracing your faults can be quite healthy in some ways but if your inner demons include harming others or being uncaring or not ever improving on yourself , then you re probably just doing more damage to yourself and those around you than good . i suppose as with most things , there s a grey area here to consider .","112640":"can someone please explain to me why ask is promoting disgusting ableist slurs again ? this girl s probably going to get an inbox full for it , i d feel sorry for her except for i really just don t .","112641":"lol nothing that ever saw the rest of the world . my former partner and i had several we were working on over the past years , i d been attending conferences and making contacts for the past years , we were at a point on our main endeavor where all of the concept work was finished and animations were starting and we were ready to start making videos and blogging and release information and then he was diagnosed with bpd , spiraled out of control , split me off , and destroyed our mutual file share accounts . we had signed several legal documents in the beginning of this mess , and i m prevented from re using any of the art i did from his concepts . anyway all of this came after over a year of constant medical nightmares for me and personal tragedy for him already and the culminating blow up destroyed me in a lot of ways and now game development is kind of a trigger for me . it s been really important to my therapist that i focus on creating just for myself for the next while , doing simple artistic creative things for the joy of it without pressure because with everything that s happened to me and around me in the past years i started basically just falling apart . if i am ever well again , and choose to work on a game , it will likely be solo . i ll just learn to code or whatever and simplify my ideas . i have some basic knowledge of it . i literally put hundreds of hours of my life into projects that are now never going to come to fruition and i don t think i ll ever be able to take that risk involving someone else with a creative endeavor again , art is too much a part of my actual self identity . on the plus side , i don t ever have to attend pax again .","112642":"wish i knew . there was one brave soul who messaged me pretending to be a woman who wanted to beat up men with an account name attached when i took anon off for a month but when i sent him my own anon question asking why he hates women so much i got no response the account is obviously a burner account , they ve never answered anything . my assumption is that somewhere there is some chan or reddit thread somewhere with questions to use to aggravate people on ask . fm or tumblr for mra gator shitholes to use because i literally get the same questions copied and pasted in waves . i was stuck on some silly list at the beginning of gg of sjws to attack or whatever or something so definitely not a high number or anyone important and i think there must be some extra pathetic , super ignorant fuck out there who thinks i m an easy target even though i literally do not even work in games anymore .","112643":"okay , from now on if i get any repeat questions from people about the following topics , i am instantly just reporting . this exact fucking scenario has been presented to me in the same fucking exact words either by one individual or multiple anons , and it s ridiculous . y all need to find something better to do with yourselves than harass people anonymously . i knew i shouldn t have opened them back up . peeing feet shoes egalitarianism hitting women pretending to be a woman to discuss hitting men dominating people with force any other weird shit i recognize that rubs me the wrong way . i m not here to make your sad little pee pee hard . fuck right off .","112644":"i like to think that the arguments i get very passionate during are about fairly important things . when people bring silly , childish , pointless shit to me , i might get angry but i m not really going to fight back or fight for that person or that relationship in any way . for instance , recently a close friend of mine didn t like that i had an opposing view to an article about a woman s response to gendered harassment and he chose to have a total fit and delete me from all of our social networks and then sub tweet me , attacking my past relationships and me in ways that were just beyond infantile . i didn t get passionate about it . i mean , okay , i said some angry shit but the main take away was welp , that was fucking pointless and i have no regrets or grief over that loss . fights i ve gotten reaaallllly passionate about it s only been because the fight wasn t so ridiculous that it made me stop respecting someone . when i still care , when i still value someone , i ll fight for that relationship . i terribly miss a friend of mine who ended our relationship several months ago , and i would fight for him over and over again if i could . for now , though , i need healing .","112645":"hrmmmm well , i guess for starters , i use prescribed medications to alter the way my body processes a ton of things i smoke to control my reactions to side effects from those as well as to ease chronic pain i keep my mouth shut when i want to scream at people , or else rant and erase , so that s some control over my temper i listen closely to what my body is telling me so that i can use it s signals to control what i need to start or stop or whatever for instance , feel full stop eating i exercise control by making choices , whether it s small like whether or not to smile at a stranger or major like choosing to sign an apartment lease or whatever each decision is a means of taking control over some facet of my life we have lots of control over a lot of things . sometimes when i feel out of control it helps to remember that .","112646":"i ve never purposefully been a part of this sort of relationship dynamic . from the outside , maybe because it s easy to confuse dominant with oppressive .","112647":"sneeze glitter . it would be annoying for everything to be covered in glitter during allergy season , but i can t imagine it would be even a small fraction of the annoyance of coughing up sputum covered wet paper confetti .","112648":"i mean , i guess every situation and relationship is different , so the dynamic could be harder or more equal or whatever for other people but in my experience , with the amount of mental illness diagnoses i have , and the amount which i m disabled , i find it pretty hard to believe that anyone close to me could possibly think they suffer more from my illnesses than i do . i ve suffered a lot as a friend or family member to others who are mentally ill , any friend or family member of someone who is mentally ill does , but not even a fraction of the suffering i ve survived from my own illnesses .","112649":"this is rin and kyo . they have a little sister , mimi , not shown .","112650":"if the habits are similar , then not that long i wouldn t think . if they re vastly different , maybe a few months ?","112651":"the emotional vampire buzzword again . it s not a real disease so no , i don t guess there s a cure ? this term was coined not even that long ago as a means of addressing draining relationships , but each relationship is different and the term is so broad and emotionally charged that i really just hate it . one can learn to behave differently . one can be more aware of how they affect others . vampires are fiction and emotional vampire is some other abusive term to throw around on the internet .","112652":"maybe regardless of what they prefer though , self diagnosis is dangerous and any medical issue be it psychological or physical needs to be addressed by a professional when possible .","112653":"beta blockers and latuda . i ve only had like , panic attacks this past week , and i ve cared so much less about other people s ridiculousness . the side effects are horrible but i am crossing my fingers that they ll go away soon .","112654":"my favorite cuisines lately are probably lebanese , portuguese , indian , and creole but honestly i also really like a bacon cheeseburger a whole effin lot .","112655":"harold and maude","112656":"lol did you make this account specifically just to troll feminists ?","112657":"i had a jawa toy with glowing eyes and i cannot find anything even sort of like it anywhere , i m almost convinced i imagined it .","112658":"we get a lot of light rain and mild temps here in the pnw , which means gnats are an issue . i ve found that putting an open jar somewhere in a room with a lot of gnats with an inch or two of plain white vinegar and one squirt of dawn dish soap gets rid of them quickly . they are attracted to the vinegar to drink and normally , can land on the surface and then fly away but the dawn changes the surface tension , so when they land , they sink under the surface and drown and the vinegar breaks down their bodies so you don t even have to see a bunch of corpses , just sort of a weird sludge in the bottom . anyway , yeah . i feel like i should have thought of something better than this but seriously , gnats are annoying and this is a quick and cheap solution .","112659":"it s possible they have mixed up their realities . it s possible that they are just so panicked about defending themselves that they re committed to it . i dunno . i try not to lie about shit .","112660":"well i can be a bit of a music snob so i think sometimes people are grossed out by my love of lady gaga but really , they can fuck off because she s amazing . i like cookies a lot and i really need to stop eh i dunno . there are tons of things i enjoy but none of them are guilty pleasures really , i just like what i like .","112661":"sure . i guess one could say that people manipulate people constantly without knowing it or meaning to in some cases . like , say i m really sad and i want someone to talk to , my gut reaction might be to reach out to a friend and ask how they re doing . it s not a bad sort of manipulation , but it s an action i took that eventually meets my own needs even if it s harmless enough .","112662":"mustard , and variations of mustard such as honey mustard or a mustard aioli or whatever . my least favorite condiment is ketchup and even the smell of it grosses me out lol .","112663":"gah i don t know i have so many dumb pieces of costume jewelry that i m overly attached too","112664":"i had a recurring dream all through childhood until probably college age where i was at the base of jabba the hut , but he was bigger . . . several stories taller . i feel so small in the dream , but i am supposed to feel important . he is telling me something crucial , it s of utmost importance that i listen and follow orders precisely or he will kill me and destroy everything . i cant understand his language . his voice booms and i can t decipher anything . i spiral mentally into myself , feeling smaller and smaller . then wake up screaming i still have recurring dreams night terrors , but they no longer involve jabba the hut p now , i have this town i ve constructed slowly , centering around a mall , a school , and an apartment high rise . often the dreams are standard anxiety dreams where i m late for something or i have to complete some sort of trial in order to be able to do something important or whatever but occasionally , they go way dark and i m being chased by men in suits who intend to take me underneath the mall to a secret government laboratory so i can be tested on .","112665":"nahhhhh no worries . i m old , shit goes wrong . all has been biopsied in the past years and we re cat . probably benign everywhere still . just a pain in the tits for me is all lol .","112666":"haha i don t sit around and try these things , these fuckers are full of painful cysts and tumors so i mean i know how a mammogram machine or the mri machine fit on there but past that . . .","112667":"i m an animal person . i have cats as pets , but i grew up with dogs as pets and i like both and rodents and birds and reptiles and amphibians and everything else .","112668":"i think maybe i just don t have the emotional make up to adequately answer your questions sometimes . i m not much of a destroyer . i m a reactor , and a fighter , but not a destroyer .","112669":"yeah , i suppose i agree mostly . someone in a really great mood can lift my mood up , and vice versa .","112670":"basically . my bras are not pretty .","112671":"this is actually some old wive s tale or something the bra store i go to here in portland is called the pencil test because apparently there was some old saying for adolescent girls trying to determine if they were old enough for a bra yet that if you could hold a pencil under your breast with no hands then it was time for a bra . i have h cups i could probably hold a box of pencils under there p","112672":"i ve been thinking about this or something like it more or less off and on since eternal sunshine came out , tbh , but at the end of the day i think i want all of the bad as a reminder of challenges completed and trials survived . i have memory issues related to cptsd as it stands , i hate those areas where i m not sure what happened . i d rather have what s mine .","112673":"lol thanks the first two dates were alright , for the record . meanwhile , he lived very close to me so every time i saw him out with other women after that i always made a point to look at their shoes haha .","112674":"i had gone out with this guy twice , so it was third date time . he was cooking dinner at his place . i get there , first time in his apartment . everything is like , fluorescent purple . walls , furniture , etc . the miss universe competition was being aired , and he insisted we watch it with d glasses on with the sound muted and bjork playing instead . i was semi okay with this , whatever , i was an art school kid so it wasn t thaaaat strange but then right after dinner he takes a long hard look at my feet and tells me he needs to take me shoe shopping because my shoes weren t sexually gratifying for him . i noped out . can t even remember his name now .","112675":"thank you","112676":"i m having a hard time making sense of this question , which i m sure is mostly my fault because fever . at any rate , i am the queen of holding on to love too long so i m probably the worst person to ask .","112677":"i learned a few days ago that a sea otter has over a million hairs growing per one inch of surface area .","112678":"the dead don t care . one should be respectful of mourners present , though .","112679":"some of us find comfort in that .","112680":"i d watch and give you an opinion but i ve been extremely ill for days and i can t handle putting on headphones and listening to noises yet . i have no interest in this movie , regardless of trailer .","112681":"i really hate these new qotd s . it makes me uncomfortable . i don t know why .","112682":"if i have , it was so long ago i can t remember . i ve never really been around many kung fu movie fans , and haven t really had much interest on my own . maybe i ll check it out one day just to do so .","112683":"some problematic favorite franchises of mine have had a redemption recently , so i have no issue with loving the old knowing that the new makes the changes necessary to show that the times have changed mad max , star wars . otherwise , i try to remember that a lot of the things i love that are problematic are also really old , so there s a certain amount of excusing i do for that i think . james bond , however , is and always has been a franchise built on womanizing and being alpha white male so i m not exactly in love with that mess . it s boring .","112684":"i usually assume people tell the truth about things , at least for the most part ? i don t know . i feel like a lot of you are just looking for the worst in people constantly . i don t operate like that . unless something is blatantly throwing red flags i tend to trust .","112685":"fuckin motherfucking like just so . . . anyway goddamnit","112686":"lol but it makes me sad i don t want mokey to eat spelunker ladies","112687":"i don t really have a good answer for this because my brain keeps reading it and immediately thinking what if the monsters in the movie descent were fraggles and that s awful and i don t want it to be my answer but here it is being my answer anyway","112688":"god i hope so","112689":"somewhere that gives the opportunity for talking and getting to know one another without being too secluded for the comfort for both involved just in case things get hinky , so i dunno .

minute but then they went away and now i guess maybe they re coming back sometime , who knows . since they tried wings here and basically ruined the chicken wing economy i think they ve been sort of unsure about what to do with chicken haha .","112693":"we do not and now i m sad . that bread looks way better than anything mcds would ever serve here .","112694":"i have two sitting in front of me right now thanks to jon yay","112695":"i sort of cut scoop twirl while wishing i was eating basically anything else besides spaghetti","112696":"i have not personally squirted like i ve seen on videos or whatever , but that doesn t mean it can t happen i suppose . most women do have some sort of ejaculate from the skene s gland during orgasm , but for me it s always been more of an extra lubricant situation , not a squirting situation .","112697":"i ve only seen a couple of episodes , and that was way back in the day .","112698":"not really , sorry .","112699":"this is gross but when i m really sick or sad but still have an appetite i want mcdonald s cheeseburgers . not the fancy ones , just the little plain single cheeseburgers . maybe they remind me of visiting my grandma when i was a kid or something . other comfort foods include tater tots , grilled cheese , and tomato soup .","112700":"pancakes . someone please bring me some right now .","112701":"owls and cats and omg i went to some sea lion caves today and they are smelly and loud but that was one of the coolest things i ve ever experienced","112702":"i have never played any metal gear solid games so i m not sure what the dealio is . i m not the biggest fan of penises lately .","112703":"i ve been out of town for the past two days and hadn t paid much attention until now . the font bugs me a lot but i like owls and cats and orange , so those bits are alright","112704":"my birthday lol . everything else is kinda cold and meh .","112705":"this is a thing that happened on ask dot fm today","112706":"i ve been

jelly beans especially the black ones and swedish fish .","112708":"chomp it super loudly and pop bubbles as much as possible","112709":"apparently you watched the chardee mcdennis electric boogaloo episode of it s always sunny recently , too . also , i don t drink .","112710":"i ve turned down so many little honors here and there throughout my early teens and twenties because of fighting the system in some nonsense way or another , including refusing my mensa acceptance . i regret all of it . always take the honors , no one really cares anyway and as you get older it s nice to have mementos about your accomplishments .","112711":"i don t , sorry","112712":"yes","112713":"i honestly don t know . it seemed like a good way to process thoughts other than the ones that haunt and instead it s become a source of anger and anxiety .","112714":"this question is meh , just like all you kids using ableist terms like cr zy and ins ne all the fucking time . how about stop being offensive little shitheads , some of us actually are diagnosed with a lot of mental illnesses and aren t pretending on the internet for attention . those words are offensive . hurtful . triggering .","112715":"to settle is to be content with ignorance . i try to learn ask questions as much as i m able .","112716":"today is the best day ever , for real . thank you so much , leigh your kind words were a major blessing this weekend . i think you re pretty awesome , too ! not only for being the first other infj i d known besides me though now i know marty s one too but also for being wise and mature beyond your years and beautiful inside and out .","112717":"i dunno about athletes but i can tell you who my favorite mathlete is . . . . millie kentner","112718":"i m afraid my eyesight will be first to go because of some medical issues , but i d much rather it be my sense of smell . i smoked cigarettes for years off and on mostly on quit the first time for a year ish but couldn t handle the smells of everything and started again to make them less offensive . i did quit again for good and a half years ago though . i apparently have an incredibly sensitive sniffer and smoking cigs dulled it enough that it was normal . i d rather be overwhelmed by smells than give myself lung cancer though , so meh .","112719":"i m having a rough morning as well , but i get to live with these cuties so that s alright . hope things improve for you !","112720":"nope . there is no logical reason for it , but i can t do wearable tech , i short it out . i ve gone literally through first gen fitbits , off brand heart monitors , and fitbit flexs . i wore all of those either on my wrist or clipped to the center of my bra , i can t imagine what would short out if it were actually in the belly of the beast , so to say . i d be worried about something causing me harm because of malfunction , and i wouldn t expect it would work well anyway .","112721":"lol awesome ! thanks","112722":"i m not a fan of tolkien , and while i know i saw the movies at jon s insistence , i can t remember a single character name right now except gandolf . . . . so him .","112723":"i m schizophrenic . during episodes which are thankfully very infrequent though i ve been having one since november , it is the first major episode since so in a way i feel pretty happy about that i often feel concerned about my level of sanity . i can tell the difference between auditory delusions visual hallucinations and reality easily , and once i take my meds and give a bit of rational thought to things i can sort through the paranoia but a new thing this episode for me is losing time and that is really fucking me up . the tipping point into this episode was a breakup with my former best friend and business partner . i was already having an incredibly hard time with my mental health because of some major physical health concerns and cptsd triggers , but that pushed me over the edge into dangerous territory . my first instance of lost time concerns him , and that situation . a few weeks ago , i noticed the thumb ring i d been wearing for over a year it s one i bought in utah when i last visited my friend and his family . it reminded me of him , and the trip . i looked at the ring , sighed , and went on with my day but i didn t touch or remove it . the next day , my hand felt strange and i soon realized that the ring was gone . i spent several days in huge frantic spurts looking everywhere for this ring . i do not remember ever removing it . i didn t normally remove it for any reason short of mris . but now it s gone . somewhere in that day s worth of time , i removed it , put it somewhere or threw it away , and then immediately blocked all memories of this . i still don t know where it is , and i ve since purchased a new thumb ring to hopefully attach new , healing memories too . that shit fucking scares me though .","112724":"maybe for some people ? i don t feel that s the case with me at all . i m not afraid of being offended , i m afraid of giving others the impression that i m unlovable or unworthy because i feel unlovable and unworthy . has nothing to do with fear of offense , more fear of abandonment or dislike . i can see why this is a theory , though , especially for those with panic disorders or who are prone to panic attacks , if being offended causes panic then a fear of anything that could cause another attack is pretty normal .","112725":"i don t think this is the average person s experience but maybe i m wrong . this seems more like a personality disorder reaction . i m obviously no expert in anything so maybe i m the oddball here . at any rate , i don t relate to this so i m not sure . i want to protect the people i desire , and make them happy .","112726":"i kinda feel like that s always a low key responsibility of any empathetic and caring human being to some degree . maybe not to the point of hyper vigilance or anything , but i feel like it s important to try to be as helpful and understanding as you can when others come to you with their problems on their journeys forward . when possible , at least , obviously everyone has their dark days where they can t be much help to others because they need to help themselves . i feel like we d all be a bit better off if we gave honest advice and genuine care to each other .","112727":"ha yes i saw your answer and my first thought was hell yeah i knew it fuckin old white dudes you re right , liberty and safety shouldn t be mutually exclusive . both can exist without having to choose whether to live in a state of freedom or security . you broke it down more thoroughly than i did , my thoughts immediately went to situations where staying safe needs to be the first priority and felt the quote was quite judgy against the oppressed and abused .","112728":"no , i don t . it sounds like it was written or spoken by an old white man who has no idea what being oppressed feels like . the rest of us do what we need to do to survive .","112729":"i can t separate these and choose . i want to be a comfort to someone who also comforts me .","112730":"the terms sociopath and psychopath have been used interchangeably more or less since the s and both describe basically the same condition but with varying degrees of severity . nowadays , these terms are more frequently referred to as antisocial personality disorder . i do not have any of the symptoms of this disorder , but i m certainly not neuro typical . so none of these things .","112731":"i cannot imagine a state of existence where i wouldn t feel judged . i have schizophrenia . major depression , ocd , complex ptsd , and a panic disorder and all of those things add up to enough anxiety that i m thoroughly amazed with myself for being as in control as i am . i feel judged by nothing . by memories . strangers . my cats . whoever . whatever . hopefully we ll get some new meds sorted out at the end of the month to help with this a bit","112732":"understanding","112733":"i have no idea what i want or what the future means for me at this time . i keep doing whatever because the alternative is too hard to think about .","112734":"an old , favorite flannel with paint stains on the sleeves , because i feel like throughout my life that s sort of ended up being the go to for comfort . they are soft and warm and ageless .","112735":"well i don t really watch them anymore but i was a secret big fan of the flavor of love reality dating shows with flavor flav back when they were a thing . there weren t any redeeming qualities really other than being a wellspring of memes for tumblr .","112736":"it was actually a really decent day . i think finally having an appointment lined up with a therapist i go tomorrow instead of the seemingly never ending waiting list took such a big load off of my shoulders . i can t get in to see my psychiatrist again to change my meds until the nd still , but at least i can get something going towards positive change soon . i felt well enough that i was able to finish the stack of intake paperwork and call the insurance company and wash my hair and decide to go out to a restaurant for dinner waiting for my husband to get home from work now . extra bonuses , chatted with a few wonderful friends which is always good and got a ring i had ordered for myself as an early birthday gift in the mail .","112737":"shoulder pads were a nightmare when i was growing up , i m so glad i ve not had to deal with those since and i pray it stays that way . i also hate high heels , pointy toes , peplum waists , i dunno . basically if you d wear it to a cocktail party in i hope it never come back . ps i love legwarmers lol i don t care if they re never in style again i ll still wear em .","112738":"it was hard re watching twin peaks recently , actually . not because it was bad , because it was actually probably even better than i remembered , but because while it was a very progressive show for it s time there were still some pretty problematic things said here and there that stuck out to me on most recent viewing .","112739":"cookies or cheesy type snacks like cheez its or cheetos or doritos or whatnot .","112740":"definitely not the main reason , though surely a reason for some i m sure . i m too lazy to bother some days , but more often than that i m not going anywhere so i don t feel like it s necessary , or i m having a really good skin day so i only wear mascara or whatever . i m allergic to a ton of stuff as well , so i don t wear much when i do at least , not on my face . my eyes or lips i ll do up sometimes but i never really have more on my face than a korean bb cream their requirements are stricter and ingredients are much easier on sensitive skin the us lets all sorts of nasty chemically stuff sit on the market and some translucent powder because anything more than that will break me out into hives .","112741":"thank you i did need a teeny break but i m feeling a little better tonight . i had a bit of a break last night and this morning and it ended up being bad enough that i was able to convince the behavioral health place i m supposed to see a therapist at to get me an emergency appointment thurs evening so i m relieved to finally be able to get started with that .","112742":"well , the five stages of grief denial , anger , bargaining , depression , acceptance seem to be the way i normally go , except maybe with anger and depression being a low key constant throughout the process . i need to have time to go through all of the stages at my own pace .","112743":"went and saw tei shi at the doug fir in portland last fall , she was amazing .","112744":"i used to really like to paint . i haven t done it in a while , though . i m not sure why . i want to i ll get all set up to and then just don t . i ve got a lot of shit to work through , hopefully i can speed through this waiting list for the therapist i want to see . i do still do art , mostly via an ipad but what i really want to do is encaustic paintings and i just feel so petrified about it for some reason","112745":"i actually usually do go on weekday mornings if i decide to see something , which does help with the crowds . it definitely doesn t help with the little ones acting up , since around here apparently bringing a month old , a year old , and a year old to an r rated movie is the norm and i ve yet to see any movie in this town where there wasn t at least one mom with several inappropriately aged kids going wild . i ve never liked theaters . i keep making exceptions because i want to see things , and then regretting the decision . i m just done with the whole experience . there s no benefit for me to watch a movie that i already think is way too loud when the large screen gives me a headache that i can t get comfortable in because of dirt and distractions and that i can t pause when i have to pee . thanks for trying to help though , i know people reallllly love the theater experience but i just do not .","112746":"last thursday night i went to see the force awakens , which was amazing . what wasn t amazing was the screaming infant , the talking yuppies , the toddler kicking my back for over an hour , the gross floors , the bad smells . . . i m over movie theaters . i may go to one of those living room style ones , but i am too mentally ill to deal with that much distraction and nonsense when i m trying to enjoy myself .","112747":"i guess i d react first by getting my butt to an urgent care to have it properly removed don t want any extra wiggly bits left in there accidentally","112748":"i regret not blocking more shitty anons .","112749":"i m not sure what being disabled has to do with feminism but you can fuck right off anyway .","112750":"my first celebrity crushes were tina turner and david bowie . my first actual other kid crush was this little boy in my kindergarten class named corey who had a ton of freckles and bright orange hair . corey was also good at coloring and we were best buds . i was invited on a play date , and we went to a park near a tennis court so his yuppie mom could play tennis while we played on the playground this was the s , people just left little kids to do shit all the time . i ended up having to use the bathroom and i went and got corey s mom expecting her to put us in the van and take me to a proper potty but instead she made me huddle behind the van and pee in a jug while she held up a blanket and i was so mortified that i stopped liking corey because i was afraid i d have to go on another play date .","112751":"i finished my first mandala from the coloring book i received for xmas just before midnight on new year s eve . my hands shake and tremor because of various reasons , so it s not perfect but it was nice to put energy into something on paper without any stress or pressure .","112752":"he kept trying to get into my lap by sneaking up behind me and putting his claws in my elbow so that i d look at him and invite him up , but when i did , he wouldn t settle in and instead chose to try to knock everything off my desk before turning his attention to pawing at my face chin . it s a cute kind of annoying .","112753":"why the fuck are you bothering me still . i m nearly . i have no interest in your bullshit . there s nothing wrong with a fetish . there is something wrong with coming at someone anonymously with shitty questions and then having a fit over their answers if they don t go the way you hoped . you have no right to continue to bother me after i asked you not to . you are invading my personal boundaries . you are being , in short , an annoying little shit . i m blocking you now .","112754":"hey everyone , look ! another fucking internet asshole who thinks that because he rolled up in here without consent and pestered me over and over about a thing anonymously , i m comparing his fetish to aids . i assume he ll call me hitler next .","112755":"okay questions about feet massages , on a site that literally every fucking user here knows is filled with foot fetishists without any social boundaries . all involving children and a women older girl in a dominant position ? how about , just don t ask me questions ?","112756":"making someone do something is wrong , sure . if it s a silly thing like an agreement was made or a bet was had and it resulted in foot massages , then shrug . i mean , are guns being held to heads ? are these younger sisters and brothers being blackmailed with information that is going to ruin their adult lives ? at the base of it there is a consent issue , no one should be made to do something they are against . but really . this seems like a family thing that probably has more to the story than susie made tommy and alice rub her feet against their wills .","112757":"i mean , i was the oldest , and i was a brat to my younger sister and brother too sometimes i m sure but i didn t have the luxury of fucking around and making people massage my feet , i was too busy trying to make sure we survived an abusive mother . like , if this is your biggest concern , then maybe you should just be thankful . but since this is probably just the lead in to another stream of anon foot fetish questions , i m not sure why i bothered answering anyway .","112758":"any variation of fuck . such a useful cuss word .","112759":"i only like it when it s up on the mountains in the distance . i enjoy being able to drive to rainier or somewhere in the summer and stand in snow for a few minutes , but if i have to deal with it past that i detest it . thankfully we don t get much of it down here in the valley .","112760":"my cat kyo is being especially annoying right now and doesn t deserve a party , so i ll describe the party i d give him if he wasn t such a terrible cutie . his favorite treats are those soft whiskas i think ? cat treats with the cheese centers , strawberry yogurt just a tablespoon ! , and the leftover dust and crumbs from a bowl of cheese flavored snacks , like cheetos or doritos or whatnot . so i d have a pile of treats for him and a few smaller piles for his guests his sisters , rin and mimi , and on either side of his pile would also be a plate with a dollop of yogurt and a bowl with fake cheese dust sprinkled generously the other two cats don t care about those things . we would play chase the laser , try to get the dangly thing out of mom s hands , and roll around in catnip and run fast . his gift would be a few bright green fuzzy mice and the plastic curls from a few gallons of milk .","112761":"me wow , this glum ass death pseudo philoso shit is kinda dangerous and unwanted right now you . . . you . . . you . . . you but what about dying","112762":"i would love to be able to control my anxiety .","112763":"survive . heal . be better to myself .","112764":"to be honest , not great , but that s not abnormal lately . how are you ?","112765":"it s hard seeing a large number of things there , it s like a constant reminder that you re not doing things fast enough or finishing anything or i dunno . definitely panic inducing sometimes .","112766":"you re a strange , manipulative little man , aren t ya .","112767":"the same way i ring in every other shitty day . stoned and in yoga pants .","112768":"so , yeah . i m currently in the process of working through a psychotic episode , and am really bored with not interested in such glum pseudo philosophical questions . i don t mean to offend . it s just like i dunno . i m old . i m tired . it s eye roll worthy . i could say a lot more about my feelings on the matter but i m high and it ll probably come out way meaner than i actually intend for it to . instead , i want to know about you . why do you think you re a sociopath ? what was your previous account name ? how did you choose to follow me ? i was already following you without any additional action on my part , so you must have either re branded yourself or re activated an old account and made a few new changes .","112769":"uhhh . . . . . i said that i m queen of everything , not queen s princes of the universe","112770":"yessssss it s so good . there s a diner up the street from me that does an eggs benedict with avocado and lump crab meat and it s lovely .","112771":"sorry souls , i don t really know anyone i wish you luck though .","112772":"i don t , though i do regret deleting a few . i ve had a hard time with mental illness recently , and i couldn t bear to have unanswered questions anymore so i went on a deleting spree .","112773":"i am terrified of monkeys , big or small or not actually monkeys but basically the same sort of animals like gorillas and whatnot . it s probably because of the one armed chimp they used to have at the virginia zoo in norfolk iin the early s , because he was loud and mean and they had to keep him separate from the others because he would fight them to the death . . . and being an ignorant kid , i once threw a pine cone in the cage before they removed him from the gen pop , when i was maybe . that mean old one armed chimpanzee went apeshit and it was the scariest thing i d ever seen .","112774":"hummingbirds have such short legs that they can t walk or hop . the only movement they

lol","112776":"i m really bad at narrowing down to one thing as usual . several things that i really dislike or don t care about that seem to be very popular are zombies shows and movies and games about zombies , watching sports , italian food not counting pizza , bell peppers","112777":"there are a few things that come to mind untangling things , brussel sprouts , fruitcake , sitting quietly for a few hours without music or talking","112778":"i ve not read anything on it , but if the goal of this initiative is to support the models health and well beings individually and they follow through with that without it just becoming more numbers that have to be maintained at any price necessary at the expense of the models , then awesome .","112779":"haha ! thanks this was me in th grade

or noble type .","112782":"i think when you commit to someone long term , it s hard to realize and remember at that time that people change so much and over such a wide variety of ways as time passes . i ve found that being able to still like who someone is at their core is the most important thing in a marriage or long term commitment , because who you say i do to is probably going to have totally different feelings about a lot of things years down the road . . . and that can include anything from what turns them on to what their political views are to how they identify themselves to what jam they prefer on their toast . both of you change . it s been both surprising and interesting to watch how we ve changed over the years and still remained able to love and care for each other . it s not always easy but we ve worked well so far .","112783":"probably about the same as for any other getting to know people situations , but to be honest while i do become fond of people often and fairly quickly , it takes a lot of interaction and mutual care before i really fall for someone . plus , i ve been married for nearly years so crushes that become that intense rarely happen . not that they don t , i m not saying i m the perfect wifey who never looks at other people and finds them attractive or emotionally important , but at the end of the day my husband prefers monogamy at this time and that s where we are with that .","112784":"if i m taking a selfie or if i have final say in what gets shared posted that i m in , then i have no issues . i hate when people take candid shots

generation s sport s life is ruined , i think that they re just so safety conscious and over protected that they have much bigger limitations as far as where they can play outdoors or practice sports

with him i didn t go on opening night because of crowds . the last movie i watched was a week or two ago , a new zealand horror movie called housebound and it was amazing . also , it definitely cured my recent aversion to special effects gore , so i can maybe try to watch the new ash and the evil dead show with my husband one of these days previously recently i d been unable to see gore or violence even in entertainment without getting really upset , i ve had some major ptsd things happening","112803":"when i was a kid in virginia , a couple of the neighborhood boys got together each

side of the country , i haven t seen any mistletoe and certainly no one has had any to sell me , so i haven t really thought about it at all until you brought it up so i guess the point is i ve nothing against it , i just sort of forget it exists as a thing","112804":"ursula . because of these tentacles , mostly .","112805":"no where to go , nothing to do with your time ?","112806":"because the cover isn t what tells the whole story .","112807":"i reallllly want a couples massage for my husband and i but i think he had already bought me a gift before i expressed that want .","112808":"it sounds like a cop out but i can t narrow down one true favorite . i ve posted a few different paintings here over the past year or whatever , all of those would be included in favorites . i started taking specialized art classes in th grade and continued on to a fine arts high school , summer school fine art program , and then an art college , and every year of that included art history classes , and i fell in love with at least new things every week i m fairly sure .","112809":"ruining untangling things necklaces , yarn , xmas lights , etc . driving everyone away overthinking being trusted by domestic animals and a few wild ones expressing myself through lines , whether drawn or written self loathing reading people remembering song lyrics","112810":"the permafrost i just smoked ? it was alright . the bud quality was extremely good , as is usual from top cut out of tacoma , wa . it s not my favorite strain but it s a good workhorse strain for me medicine wise . it works fast on anxiety and helps me narrow down my train of thought so i can get things done around the house and work on projects . has a piney taste smell to it . high is pretty low key but it does it s job . not great for pain , but good enough that i can usually avoid having to take tylenol or whatever for headaches cramps backaches . would recommend to a friend .","112811":"if circuses were taking the same steps as many modern zoos are and working towards a more educational approach that included animals who were being rehabilitated or can t be released into the wild for whatever reasons , then they would be okay . sadly , at least from what little i m aware of , most are not . there s nothing wrong with rescuing an animal from a situation that it wouldn t survive in to train it to be a teaching tool for the goal of future conservation and protection of others like it . for instance , the audubon society near me has an albino barred owl who was rejected by it s mother and would not have made it with it s non camouflaged coloring . it is now taken good care of and is a calm , friendly addition to the center . until circuses become more conscientious , i won t attend them .","112812":"i like marzipan but i don t often have it","112813":"perfect health . i m so tired of feeling so broken . a better and more fulfilling job for my husband because i know he s depressed about that right now . a house in the woods . but mostly , really close friendships . i ve moved so often and been so angry and am so particular and apparently difficult to approach and i feel like i have friends , but the very close ones the ones i could really depend on , who i always felt reassurance from and had a history with and had a deep connection to they re gone . i know that new friendships will evolve and that i ll have people in my life like that again but for now with all these changes , and everything going on i want more than anything to have that sort of friendship available again .","112814":"when i was a kid , we could open one present which was always pajamas and then we d get baths , put on the new jammies , put out milk , cookies , and a carrot for rudolph , and would watch a movie . now , sometimes we watch a movie . if that . lol .","112815":"i d be a grey","112816":"most of my traditions for the holiday season occur well before the actual holidays . i put my tree and decorations up the week of american thanksgiving rd thurs of nov and send out a big group of xmas cards the day after thanksgiving . lights go up the following week . the week before xmas i whine until my husband takes me out to drive around and look at house lights . on xmas itself , we generally just go eat at a chinese buffet and call our families .","112817":"forgiveness is a big part of loving and respecting someone , i think . however , not everyone s actions are deserving of respect and not everyone is deserving of forgiveness . i will never be able to forgive my rapist . i don t know if i ll ever be able to forgive my mother . as for everyone else , i get angry and hold grudges but honestly i do forgive and let go pretty easily .","112818":"not every woman has , can have , or will have children .","112819":"yes , absolutely . many of my best friendships past and present began online or existed online at some point .","112820":"absolutely a surrogate should be allowed to refuse an abortion , it s her body . i don t know how these things generally work , but it seems to me like there would have been some sort of contract or legal paperwork signed at some point during the negotiations for surrogacy ? it seems like there ought to be pre arranged back up plans if the parents change their mind for any reason , that still take care of the mother and child . shrug .","112821":"i like salty cheesy snacks most , i guess , with cookies as a very close second . the last major craving i had was for tortilla soup , which i had for dinner with a salad .","112822":"i put it up early this year because i wasn t sure how i d be feeling , but normally i put the tree up the week of thanksgiving third thursday of november usually and take it down twelve days after xmas .","112823":"there s a painting in boston s museum of fine arts by oskar kokoschka called two nudes lovers that i had a very strong reaction to when i saw it in person . i d seen it before and have seen it since in print , without the same feeling , but standing there in front of it , something about it really grabbed my guts and squeezed . i d steal it , so i could see it everyday .","112824":"i don t really have a favorite . i always like to buy flowers in the summer when my neighborhood farmer s market is going there is a elderly woman from portland area who sells bouquets of whatever is in bloom from her i presume very large gardens named mary cho , and they are always bright , large , varied , and smell amazing . when her grand kids can help her prepare bouquets , she does a size and a size , so i always buy when she has the available and once in a great while will get a larger one if i have company coming or something .","112825":"a really awesome owl type creature to be my sidekick","112826":"i d commission a game of thrones themed tarot deck because you like that show and do tarot .","112827":"prosthetic foreheads on their real heads","112828":"yes ! the character s name is aughra .","112829":"they ll probably do a sequel eventually , or maybe a prequel seems like everything s getting re visits lately . i d definitely watch it , at least once . i can t think of any more recent christmas movies that i liked very well at least of ones i ve seen .","112830":". emmitt otter s jugband christmas . a charlie brown christmas . elf i don t have specific memories attached really , other than my dad also really loves peanuts and muppets so the first two are movies we both enjoy a lot , and he s basically buddy elf when it comes to christmas , so i guess yeah . i like christmas movies because they are things that my dad and i are both really excited about so it s a bonding thing , maybe ? i dunno . my dad wasn t around a ton as a kid because my parents were divorced when i was and my mother limited visitation pretty strictly because she s a borderline narcissist so good memories from my childhood with my father are few and far between but not in a way that s anyone but my mother s fault , if that makes sense .","112831":"in my early s i used to pick up after work on friday and drive hours or so to atlantic city and just play blackjack and get drunk for hours sober up and drive home sometime the next day . i have no idea why . i don t enjoy drinking or gambling that much . i guess it was just a way to get completely out of myself for a bit .","112832":"aliens are more likely because there are infinite planets circling infinite stars so who knows what else is thriving out there . . . but some of those aliens could be squatch , then , so they re both more likely to exist . alien squatch . i would love if sasquatch existed or aliens or any of the things we don t yet know about and understand because it would be something new and exciting and maybe get people more interested in science and exploration and environmental protection or whatever .","112833":"i still haven t looked it up so i don t even know what genre it is i literally only know that it s bad and that an anon quoted it at me . if it s a horror and it s the worst movie ever , then i might still want to watch it if it s bad because of terrible gore effects or being especially surreal or something . most other genres , i d probably avoid .","112834":"yes , i consider joining cults all the time i just never decide that it s a good idea to join . the last cult that caught my attention was one started by a band called yacht . it s actually quite interesting .","112835":"i have memory blackouts and one is during a time in college where the only clear memory i have is running across the street to talk to my art history professor and getting into his car . so who knows , i may have dated a professor and just don t remember because trauma . i don t know as far as the question . i mean , it happens . it always seems gross unless you re one of the people involved , right ? i don t really have an opinion . i don t have the emotional reserve to come up with opinions or answers for a lot of these serious topics lately , they just sort of bring me down and raise my anxiety levels . sorry","112836":"i have teeth and i ve never bothered to ask a single one what their preference is .","112837":". i was an exotic dancer for a very very short amount of time in my early s think it was like , maybe and the gross lecherous husband of the woman who owned the bar taught me how to twerk after my first shift because he thought i had the ass for it and tbh that s what got me the best tips lol . this was not a full nude bar at the time the law where i lived was that you couldn t wear less than a bathing suit so ample nipple coverage and at the very least a bikini cut bottom . . i have an amazing memory for all sorts of things going all the way back to age but there are several periods of time lasting months each throughout my life that i have literally no memories from at all . . yoko one sent me a christmas card in","112838":"the smells that came home with jon from his welding classes , putting hundreds of hours into game projects for free for a partner who ended up splitting me off and deleting me from his life , anxiety levels rising to heights unimaginable before and literally causing my body to shut down , a january trip to lake tahoe and a beautiful snowy drive home , my sister being extremely pregnant with her very very large soon to be born son ty waverly will be her second boy , he s due in feb","112839":"i haven t seen the room . what s it about ? should i watch it ?","112840":"i just want to get better .","112841":"i m re answering because i originally answered that i would normally take a nap , but then i ended up tossing a can of ginger ale aside in my hallway to lay on the floor and sob so obviously i m not doing anything right with my life right now , don t take recommendations from me .","112842":"fact i don t know how to answer this question .","112843":"i honestly have never really done this . i have no otp . i was going to say that maybe this is a millennial thing , but i m sure people have been hoping for fictional characters to hook up before now , we just didn t have words for it . maybe it s just that i m so over romantic relationships being a plot or sub plot that i don t want anyone to get shipped , it s so much more refreshing to me to see characters in fictional worlds do things that aren t motivated by love and relationships .","112844":"yes . it requires a ton of money , meds , effort , and care to maintain me in my current state .","112845":"well i m fat , so definitely not middle . no one enjoys that . i like the window on short flights and the aisle on long flights .","112846":"i don t think i m very patriotic , but i don t hate my country . i don t like the way we do things sometimes , and i don t like how our culture and ignorance looks to the rest of the world , but shrug . things i love about the us include the national parks and all of the different and beautiful wild parts of the country uh i like some of the people here i feel safe from war or attacks of that nature , and with the exception of when i lived in an area with a high concentration of navy bases , i always have , so that s probably something i should be thankful for i dunno . it s not so bad .","112847":"i like egg drop soup also occasionally , i used to make it but i don t remember what recipe i was using . anyway buffet the one we usually go to makes a really good yellow curry , crab rangoon , and a fried shrimp sushi roll with spicy sauce and i don t remember what else that s their house roll . those three things i almost always get at that specific place , but if we re talking just in general sorts of buffets i probably will go for things like chicken with cashew nuts , fried rice , anything with mushrooms , beef and broccoli just to get some greens , and of course an almond cookie for dessert .","112848":"only the same lies everyone else tells on those personality questionnaires with questions like gerald s family is really having a hard time lately , with a sick relative . you know he s desperate , so you look the other way when he steals a tv to sell for food and medicine true or false ? because of course i m totally not gonna snitch on a dude with a sick kid or mom or whatever , fuck your big box store , but i m sure as hell not going to tell you that lol . as far as the accident thing , it really depends on the level of seriousness . if it s like someone lied about being unable to perform a specific physical task in a job that requires it , and then worsens a pre existing condition or whatever , then yeah , it s just that person s fault , but when it comes to something like , i dunno a brain surgeon lies about having the proper schooling and then patients die , then that s also on the hospital that hired him without checking credentials .","112849":"i show everyone respect the same way by being as kind and genuine as i am able to be . if i am unable to be those things a majority of the time with you , then i ll probably remove you from my life rather than disrespect you with my continued inability to be kind and genuine ."}}
