about a month or so after my boyfriend bought me an ipad, i accidentally broke the screen, lmao.\n  \n  i was horrified but it still worked, thankfully. it was only a crack on the corner of the screen so i was still able to use it.\n  ","420618":"\n  there's really no way around it. you can tell someone you need some distance, however, and hope they respond favorably. however, blatantly ignoring someone can be hurtful in most instances.\n  ","420619":"\n  absolutely not. there's no excuse for physically abvsing your partner regardless of whether or not they've been raised in an abvsive household. they're old enough to understand the difference between right and wrong.\n  ","420620":"\n  i was speaking in the context of askfm regarding\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n  . obviously i know

person.\n  \n  cc:\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n","420622":"\n  LOL. it's been SO long.\n  \n  story time ; i used to play fallout 4 religiously when it first came out, and even after taking breaks to play multiple other games, it was one of the few games i would always come back to. i got back into playing it a few months ago because i felt like making a new character and playing a few mods, which jumpstarted my obsession all over again.\n  \n  well. i downloaded a few mods and my game kept crashing. i uninstalled the mods, and the game still crashed. i did a hard reboot, uninstalled the game, and reinstalled the game -- and it still crashes. there's no predictability over *when* it's going to crash, but it's made me almost throw my controller a few times because it's just so frustrating.\n  \n  tl;dr -- i haven't played fallout 4 in a long time because it crashes every time i play, so fml.\n  ","420623":"\n  not at all. crying is a natural human reaction to stressors, it doesn't determine whether someone is weak or strong. crying also releases endorphins which is why you usually feel a bit more relieved after you've cried over something.\n  ","420624":"\n  pros ;\n  \n  \u2727 lightweight & airy\n  \n  \u2727 comfortable af\n  \n  \u2727 matches any outfit\n  \n  cons ;\n  \n  \u2727 literally none. they're perfect\n  ","420625":"\n  i've never seen it that way, but

 lmao.\n  \n  first off -- if i like an answer that morgan posts it means i agree with her.\n  \n  second off -- she's completely right. it isn't up to the child whether or not they should go on a trip, that decision is left up to the parents. if a parent doesn't want their child attending a trip for whatever reason, then that's the final decision.\n  ","420629":"\n  for the most part, mental health isn't taken as seriously as physical health and a lot of people still see mental illness as a weakness of character instead of an actual illness.\n  \n  it isn't so much taboo anymore considering recent events over the past year regarding celebrities, but it still isn't fully accepted.\n  ","420630":"\n  it's understandable to be nervous about starting therapy -- i was afraid & nervous too prior to starting myself.\n  \n  in the beginning, she basically asked me why i sought therapy and asked me a little bit about my life. we talked about the things that were bothering me or holding me back and she made it abundantly clear that her office was a safe place and i don't have to talk about anything that i was uncomfortable talking about.\n  \n  we talked a lot about my past and how it affects the present day, especially my behavior and how i think about myself. lately we've been talking about the things i think and experience week by week and go from there.\n  ","420631":"\n  my therapist has told me that it's perfectly okay to distance myself from things or people who don't serve my happiness in life. if something \/ someone does not serve me, it's natural to not associate with it \/ them because first and foremost, i should preserve my own well being.\n  ","420632":"\n  right now, the few things that have kept me optimistic are my relationship with my boyfriend, my motivation to continue eating healthy & working out, the freelance work i'm about to start this week, and meeting mike shinoda next week.\n  ","420633":"\n  lmao, it's pretty much guaranteed that there's at least one florida headline that's completely weird & bizarre.\n  \n  i.e., i just looked up florida news in google news and found the headline, \"alligator moves florida couple's patio furniture in the middle of the night.\"\n  \n  LMAO WHAT.\n  ","420634":"\n  yes, but it entirely depends on the individual. sometimes marijuana can exacerbate people's symptoms, while other times it can actually aid in lessening their symptoms. i know quite a few people who use marijuana to help treat their mental illnesses.\n  ","420635":"\n  i'm against spanking. there's no reason to be using physical punishment against a child, especially if they're old enough to understand reason. in addition, if a child is too young to understand reason, then they won't know why you're hitting them. it's psychologically damaging to children.\n  ","420636":"\n  the fact that i have fish as pets doesn't really have any correlation with the type of food i eat.\n  \n  regardless, i honestly haven't had fish in a while. i think the last time i ate fish was a few weeks ago when i was on vacation. my boyfriend & i shared a plate of fried calamari.\n  ","420637":"\n  my job is giving me the opportunity to earn extra money through freelance work on the weekends, and i'm so stoked !!\n  \n  i'm definitely going to take the opportunity. we're behind on a lot of assignments so not only is it the perfect chance to catch up, but i can make at least $100 more per week easily.\n  ","420638":"\n  i've been watching the documentary evil genius on netflix, and i'm completely intrigued by the entire case and how it's been playing out.\n  \n  i'm only on the second episode but i'm looking forward to watching it again tonight !!\n  ","420639":"\n  aahh, thank you !! this made my day. :'))\n  ","420640":"\n  i prefer calling my boyfriend, but everyone else, i text. i'm not comfortable talking to anyone else on the phone.\n  ","420641":"\n  we met through mutual friends at an amusement park back in 2008.\n  ","420642":"\n  of course -- boys should be taught to respect everyone regardless of their gender unless prompted otherwise.\n  ","420643":"\n  i don't think my boyfriend would appreciate me squeezing him with all of my strength, lmao.\n  ","420644":"\n  not speaking over black people when they're discussing oppression and discrimination against their community, and promoting their statements regarding activism.\n  ","420645":"\n  i wish i wasn't feeling nauseous rn. it's distracting me from my work. i'm afraid to eat something because it might upset my stomach.\n  ","420646":"\n  yeah that's why i said it, given the context of the relationship -- you've only been talking to him on kik for a month, and for him to go all out and say he wanted to propose ... that's just bizarre and a bit terrifying.\n  \n  i'm happy you're out of that situation, though. it could have turned ugly really fast. take care of yourself first, the rest will follow suit.\n  ","420647":"\n  honestly ... fck that guy.\n  \n  he's 30 and you're 18 -- right off the bat, that's a red flag because you have to think about why someone that age would want to even date someone as young as you. second, the fact that he was so immature as to curse you out & accuse you & even wish bad things upon you is terrible and manipulative, and he shouldn't have said those things at all.\n  \n  you're not in the wrong. you need to look after yourself first & foremost, and if that means taking care of your mental health, then you have the freedom to do that. i understand that you feel bad or guilty, but you cannot blame yourself for this. he's the one acting ridiculous and predatory and immature.\n  \n  live your life -- you will find someone worth so much more and will treat you so much better than this dude.\n  ","420648":"\n  i like taking selfies when i'm confident because i can control how the photo looks. however, i hate when other people take photos of me.\n  ","420649":"\n  it's interesting because i have a tendency to not cry over major events or stereotypically sad things, but i do cry at minor inconveniences and insignificant things, lmao.\n  \n  like, i've never cried while discussing my trauma with my therapist but god forbid i drop my iced coffee.\n  ","420650":"\n  no, probably not. it's difficult for me to meditate & i haven't done it in ages. the last time i tried, i was dissociating for a few hours and it was awful.\n  \n  i like the idea of hiking in the woods and being one with nature, but i'd prefer to do it on my own time.\n  ","420651":"\n  not really. then again, i don't pay much attention to other people, especially strangers, so it's difficult to really say.\n  \n  also, i live in new york & mostly everyone is aggressive in some manner, especially while driving, rofl. so i may be a bit biased.\n  ","420652":"\n  i have an xbox one.\n  ","420653":"\n  well it's only the fifth of june, so there isn't really much to go on, lol.\n  \n  i've been surviving, though. i've had both good and bad days and i'm just trying to take my days hour by hour at this point. i'm hoping things will start to look up soon, though.\n  ","420654":"\n  i like sitting outside in the sunshine and drinking iced coffee with my boyfriend.\n  \n  i also enjoy having bonfires at night !!\n  ","420655":"\n  thank you, i really appreciate it. \u2661\n  ","420656":"\n  yes !! i'm going to a meet n greet event to meet and take a photo with mike shinoda of linkin park later this month, and i'm honestly so excited and nervous and terrified all at the same time because linkin park has been a saving grace in my life and i don't know how to convey those emotions to mike so i'm probably going to write him a letter. :'))\n  ","420657":"\n  i'm honestly not feeling well today at all, and that's partially because i haven't been able to take my mood stabilizer for the past two days so now my mind is all frazzled and i've been overwhelmed by the simplest of things. :\/\/\n  \n  i want to do things to occupy myself, but i don't have the motivation to do anything at all. besides picking up the tickets yesterday, i've done absolutely nothing and the only reason why i was able to get the tickets in the first place is because my boyfriend drove me to the venue. i want to do a water and filter change on my fish tank but even that seems daunting.\n  ","420658":"\n  yeah, and it's definitely not as if i'm glorifying smoking by any means or promoting it or saying that its good for you. it's legit just a photo of me having a cigarette in my backyard, and the reason why i took the photo was because my skin looked good, LOL.\n  ","420659":"\n  i don't do it myself personally, but it isn't unheard of to see close friends and family give pecks on the lips as a greeting. especially in europe.\n  \n  it isn't weird, there's just a cultural divide and it's something most people aren't used to seeing.\n  ","420660":"\n  there's nothing wrong with it at all. it's commonplace in most cultures.\n  ","420661":"\n  it depends on the circumstances. while there are some people who have the capability to change, there are others who don't or don't see the fact that they've made a mistake. it goes on an individualized basis, you can't really group all cheaters into one.\n  ","420662":"\n  i'm a writer \/ editor for a publishing company.\n  ","420663":"\n  i've never exactly entertained a group of people before, so idk. my social anxiety usually gets in the way of that.\n  ","420664":"\n  people aim for it, but it doesn't exactly exist. there's no such thing as the perfect human.\n  ","420665":"\n  because the human race is very selfish & greedy, and instead of using that power to eradicate disease and genetic illnesses, people would likely use it for nefarious means or try to create the \"perfect\" child.\n  ","420666":"\n  the idea of being able to live independently with my boyfriend in our own house & starting our own lives together somewhere away from our families.\n  \n  it motivates me because it gives me a reason to wake up and go to work every morning, knowing that the money i make is one step closer to that reality. it also motivates me to work on bettering my mental and physical health because i know that also aids in my own pursuit of happiness.\n  ","420667":"\n  i think we're born as blank slates to a certain degree in that our environment raises and nurtures us into developing the personality we have today. especially when it comes to opinions we may hold, if our families have enough of an influence on them.\n  \n  however, there is also a genetic component in that people are more predisposed to certain behaviors based on family history. it's a combination of environmental and genetic factors.\n  ","420668":"\n  people seem to believe i'm a radical feminist because of a few opinions i hold, and they automatically label me as ignorant or uneducated simply because they don't take the time to actually get to understand my reasoning or the fact that i'm not actually a radical feminist.\n  \n  it happens mostly on askfm, thankfully. people IRL don't really judge me as harshly as others do online because i only really interact with people who already know and understand me.\n  ","420669":"\n  be polite & thoughtful, and listen to them when they're speaking and ask follow up questions to show you're actually interested in who they are.\n  \n  also, it's integral to remain yourself so that you don't give out a false impression of who you are. if someone doesn't like you for who you are, then obviously they're not the right person for you.\n  ","420670":"\n  this is the cutest thing ever, omg. thank you & ily too !! \u2661\n  ","420671":"\n  i haven't been to one in ages, but they were all right -- the crowds of people made me anxious, but some of the rides were fun.\n  ","420672":"\n  back when over-exposed faces was the thing\u2122 and my eyebrows were a wreck ;\n  ","420673":"\n  \"from the ashes\" by in this moment\n  \n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/s_GOM_MwSlk\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","420674":"\n  they probably believe it makes them sound edgy & superior. the term is generally geared toward people who have liberal mindsets who get offended over the smallest of things, but now it's basically applied as a defense tactic for those who have no other means of defending their position in a debate or conversation.\n  ","420675":"\n  i've honestly never heard either of those terms in my life, but they sound like phrases a troll would use to taunt trans people.\n  ","420676":"\n  i don't really have a perspective on the matter because most of them don't apply to me, since i'm not a parent.\n  \n  however, the only opinion that i do strongly hold is that i believe circumcision is an outdated procedure that shouldn't be performed on infant males.\n  ","420677":"\n  i love all kinds of art -- whether it's paintings, sculptures, photography, writing, music, etc etc.\n  \n  i really like surrealist art because it usually has a dreamlike quality to it that blurs reality with fantasy, which is something that always fascinated me.\n  ","420678":"\n  STORY OF MY LIFE, LOL.\n  \n  i have such a terrible habit of getting halfway through a game & then abandoning it because i became interested in something else. that's why i try not to download new games until i know i'm done playing the one i'm currently fixated on.\n  ","420679":"\n  i think that people can post whatever they want in their bios. if they feel as if their illness is a large component of who they are, then it would make sense to place the illness in their bio since it's something they associate with themselves. i used to have \"neuroatypical\" in my bio back in the day.\n  ","420680":"\n  roses blooming in my boyfriend's grandmother's yard. \u2661\n  ","420681":"\n  you do realize i'm 26 years old, right ??\n  \n  not only is that disgusting but it's also extremely illegal.\n  ","420682":"\n  self esteem issues, probably -- these people were likely raised in a controlling environment or simply grew up not happy with who they are, so they don't allow themselves to accept notions of love because they feel that they're not deserving of it.\n  ","420683":"\n  people have said that i'm a good writer, but i always think there's room for improvement. i used to write a lot as a teenager and i feel as if i've passed my prime already.\n  ","420684":"\n  i don't really understand how i would be able to get into a relationship with someone in the first place if i couldn't understand what they were saying.\n  ","420685":"\n  i'm doing well !! i just came back from the gym & took a shower, and now i'm going to watch some netflix before bed.\n  ","420686":"\n  i suppose the concept of moving out & starting my own life is what motivates me the most -- knowing that i'll be much happier in the long run once i'm able to live independently without the influence of my family weighing me down.\n  ","420687":"\n  it makes me feel as if we're living in the truman show, lmao.\n  \n  i don't really understand what sort of expertise kim has regarding prison reform.\n  ","420688":"\n  LOL. fucking hell.\n  ","420689":"\n  aw, this is cute.\n  \n  cc:\n  \n   @littlesha_\n  \n","420690":"\n  so my best friend never texted me back about the gym, so i just walked a mile around my block !!\n  \n  i know a mile isn't much at all but it's a hell of a lot better than what i used to do, so i'm v proud of myself. :'))\n  ","420691":"\n  i have a lot ;\n  \n  moana, mulan, zootopia, brave, the emperor's new groove, tarzan, & inside out, among others.\n  ","420692":"\n  ???\n  \n  my boyfriend & i are planning on getting married. so for your own sake and health, i would advise you getting over this and finding something productive to do with your life.\n  ","420693":"\n  as you can tell from the rest of my profile, i speak english quite fluently. it's the only language i know.\n  ","420694":"\n  it depends on the severity of the mistake. i'll usually give people another chance but if they haven't learned from the first mistake then i usually cut them out.\n  ","420695":"\n  i LOVE the rooster teeth \/ achievement hunter podcasts and shows -- they have a few, i.e. on the spot, always open, the RT podcast, and off topic.\n  \n  i recommend the RT podcast & off topic if you want something to listen to while gaming. they talk about gaming and pretty much anything that comes up in their lives,

explanation because addiction is complex and differs depending on the person. people can have naturally addictive personalities and jump from addiction to addiction, while others fall into addiction without having the natural predisposition for addictive behavior.\n  \n  if you're concerned about your friend's habit, then rehabilitation is always the best go-to when it comes to recovery. however, you have to keep in mind that it only works if someone *wants* to be better and puts in the time & effort to change their behavior.\n  ","420705":"\n  yes, i'm very much a romantic. if i'm in love

that doesn't automatically mean both people are to blame if the relationship fails. sometimes the relationship could be completely one-sided where the other person doesn't put in any effort at all.

really nothing else to say.\n  ","420749":"\n  you really need to jump off your high horse. viability is used in the context of pregnancies *all* the time, and it's never been used to describe mental

not getting one, rofl. you're the one who came to me freaking out with judgment instead of asking for clarification if you didn't understand what i meant.\n  ","420751":"\n  i don't think simply smiling at a person is creepy -- people smile at each other all the time in public, and its common courtesy if you have to interact with them in some way (although uncommon these days).\n  \n  i think people just aren't used to having social interaction with strangers in public places anymore so everything is perceived to be threatening.\n  ","420752":"\n  i don't remember much about high school

i'm not. i'm adequately clean and groomed and whatnot but i don't obsess over things being clean 100% of the time. it's unrealistic and causes unnecessary stress and worry.\n  ","420755":"\n  it's hard for me to really think about this in an unbiased context because i've been dating my boyfriend for so long & we've both maintained our relationship even with our mental health issues.\n  \n  but

life. lmao.\n  \n  ok let me break it down for you -- is something isn't viable, then there's no chance for it existing or developing into an actual living creature. therefore, the concept of mental illness in such a specimen is preposterous.\n  ","420758":"\n  ???\n  \n  your logic makes absolutely no sense. i'm pro-choice meaning i support the idea of someone having the freedom to get an

to play games with people to see if they'll continue lying, and i would rather be honest and confront them with the issue first hand rather than wait for the 'perfect' moment.\n  \n  thankfully i've never had to really deal with this situation that often. it's come up a few times in the past with certain ex-friends, but i cut them out of my life after finding out they were lying.\n

me off, and it's rare that i actually feel comfortable around someone when meeting them for the first time. i'm very guarded around others because most people have ulterior motives.\n  ","421232":"\n  uh, people aren't 'inferior' to you if they don't make as much money as you do. money doesn't define who a person is by any means, and you're not a better person by default simply because you have more money than someone else.\n  \n  if i (somehow) got wealthy, i wouldn't care who my child dated as long as they were kind and respectful.\n  ","421233":"\n  not really -- i'm more antisocial, than anything else. i've learned to come out of my shell over the years, but i simply have no desire to talk to or be around most people.\n  ","421234":"\n  probably my best friend -- she's always been kind and understanding to me even when i wasn't exactly deserving of kindness, and she has always jumped through hoops to make sure i was okay even if it was putting her own safety at risk.\n  \n  i don't deserve kind people in my life, tbh. LOL.\n  ","421235":"\n  i've always thought that coffee \/ tea shops were among some of the best places to go because the environments are usually quiet enough to really be able to have a conversation

dates, and they were a lot of fun.\n  ","421236":"\n  a person's conscience is their own set of morals and ethics ; their belief system, their concept of right vs wrong, etc etc.\n  \n  i believe most people have consciences, but there are obviously a few exceptions (i.e. serial killers or other murderers). like most other things, it's likely a combination of both genetics and environment, something innate in a person as well as learned over time.\n  ","421237":"\n  i've mainly learned interesting or intimate details about my friends' lives, which makes me feel closer to them in a way. the good thing about askfm is that you become educated about who a person really is and how they think.\n  \n  it's also helped me learn who not to interact with based on how people respond to others,

driven any sort of luxury car and the most expensive car i've ever owned is the piece of shit hyundai i currently use.\n  ","421257":"\n  it's easier to get where i need to go if i just drive there

whatsoever.\n  \n  little things like the tone of people's voices set me off, and i constantly overthink what people mean when they talk and look for hidden meanings behind everything. ulterior motives. insinuations. i can't stand it. i'm ruminating on a conversation i just had and now i feel like i'm spiraling.\n  \n  and now i'm slipping into an episode because i can't control how people say things and my mind is reeling over what they could have meant and if they're angry with me. if they're going to give up on me. but i can't express this to them otherwise it's going to make it larger than it should be, and i'm afraid of them saying that they *are* angry with me because i won't be able to handle that.\n  \n  this has been happening too much lately and its exhausting.\n

only buy it at taco bell.\n  ","421270":"\n  it's such dark humor, which is my favorite kind of humor -- the plot is actually fairly dark and twisted, but the humor in the show is honestly top notch. i'm a sucker for shows involving murder, so it's right up my alley.\n  \n  i also love the characters and the actors who play the characters. there are a lot of good, witty comebacks and the writing is great. you can really see the character development over time.\n  ","421271":"\n  not generally, no. i enjoy horror movies a lot -- the only things that freak me out are jump scares. they drive my anxiety wild and make my heart race.\n  ","421272":"\n  i just finished eating dinner, and now i'm going to go out for a cigarette and make a cup of coffee.\n  \n  i'm also watching santa clarita diet, which is an amazing and hilarious show on netflix.\n  ","421273":"\n  medisafe -- it's an app used to track medication and alerts you when it's time to take your meds. you can update it with dosages and what the pill looks like, and its really helpful in reminding me to take my morning and evening meds every day.\n  ","421274":"\n  no, but it should be amended to include stricter regulations. everyone is entitled to their second amendment right, but the law is too lenient in the united states.\n  ","421275":"\n  i usually need space because attention only makes me more irritable at times, especially if people don't understand what it is i'm going through or won't take the time to try to understand.\n  \n  however, i do need the attention from my boyfriend because he's one of the few who do understand. he always validates me and makes me feel better about myself.\n  ","421276":"\n  abandonment. i start panicking and breaking down at even the slightest hint that someone is going to leave me.\n  ","421277":"\n  no, i've never thought about it in that way before. if there is a god, they would be accepting of different walks of life, which includes

finances to do so lately.\n  ","421280":"\n  i'm tired of anons coming onto my page and claiming they know my life better than me -- especially with respect to my gender, my financial situations, etc etc.\n  \n  it doesn't matter what other people think because i only air a small portion of myself on the internet -- therefore, their opinions will always be inaccurate. the fact that some people are so concerned with my gender is a bit alarming because i've had anons literally fuming with anger over the fact that i'm non-binary.\n  ","421281":"\n  i don't really like this question and would feel weird answering it -- i don't have much of an answer either way because my mental illnesses magically disappearing is an unrealistic thought.\n  ","421282":"\n  i prefer to avoid confrontation, but if i feel strongly enough about something, then i'll feel the need to engage.\n  \n  confrontations usually make me feel self conscious and panicky, so i try to avoid confrontation at all costs.\n

brutally honest are when i'm on askfm because sometimes it's warranted, especially if people come to me with asinine questions or inaccurate rumors.\n  \n  i never have to be rude in real life, and i always approach situations with honesty and maturity. if you're compassionate to the person you have to be honest with, they respond better if you're not rude about it generally.\n  ","421288":"\n  being kind to others unless being given a reason not to be kind, being wary of strangers and unknown websites, and reporting abvsive and threatening behavior.\n  ","421289":"\n  i think that's highly

","421292":"\n  so i bought a new tv, y'all. i'm mourning the loss of my bank account with sushi and iced coffee, though.\n  \n  really though, i'm actually pretty happy with the purchase because it's a lot bigger than my last tv and its also a smart tv, so i don't need to turn on my xbox every time i want to watch youtube, hulu, or netflix.\n  ","421293":"\n  haha, no. i basically have to plan everything in advance so that my boyfriend and i can request time off from work without it being an issue. my last birthday, we set plans weeks in advance.\n  ","421294":"\n  i'm only attracted to my boyfriend.\n  \n  even if i was single, that would be creepy af. that's 7-8 years younger than me and they're in a different stage of life than me.\n  ","421295":"\n  i'm not much of a texter, and my boyfriend and i prefer calling each other on the phone instead of texting because it's easier. he works all of the time, so a quick phonecall when he's on break is more efficient than texting him and waiting hours for a response.\n  ","421296":"\n  it's been passed on from generation to generation -- those who exhibit racism today likely was taught racism by their families or friends. the only way to break the cycle of racism is to continuously educate others and raise our own children without prejudice.\n  ","421297":"\n  looks like you're shit out of luck, fam. when you're on askfm, there really is no such thing as 'normal.'\n  ","421298":"\n  when you're in a healthy relationship, there really is no such thing as loving someone \"more.\" you love one another regardless of your flaws and mistakes, and there really is no basis for comparison between your love for your partner and their love for you. when you're in a relationship, you work as a team, thus rendering any sort of competition to be irrelevant.\n  ","421299":"\n  yes, i believe that is an invasion of privacy. you must respect your child's privacy and in return, they will respect you back. if you go through your child's things without consent, then that gives them valid reason to distrust you as a parent.\n  \n  the only exception to this would be if the parent has valid suspicions that their child is doing something harmful to themselves or others, i.e. drugs, SH, svicidal ideation, etc etc.\n  ","421300":"\n  absolutely, yes. mental illnesses can be just as debilitating as physical illnesses, preventing a person from being able to carry out their ordinary activities of daily living and functioning correctly in a work environment.\n  \n  i worked for a disability law firm for more than two years, and we had thousands of mental health cases, both alone and existing with other physical conditions. in most cases, mental health problems only exacerbated physical illnesses and vice versa. having mental health problems makes living with physical disabilities even more difficult, and physical illnesses often have the ability to make mental health problems worse as well.\n  ","421301":"\n  of course it is -- crying is a natural human reaction to emotional and physical stimuli, and it doesn't make someone less of a 'man' if they cry.\n  \n  crying is a form of cathartic release, and it helps release endorphins into the bloodstream, the 'feel good' chemicals that provide us with a sense of relief after we've cried. it's purely a biological reaction, and it has no bearing on someone's gender.\n  ","421302":"\n  i fail to understand why this is pertinent information for a complete stranger to know.\n  ","421303":"\n  yeah, my boyfriend. he deserves more than what the world has given him.\n  ","421304":"\n  even if the government doesn't do anything after today's marches, that certainly doesn't mean that activists should give up their fight -- and by the looks of things, the most passionate activists are the teenagers and young adults who will comprise the next generation of politics.\n  \n  even though things seem terrible right now, especially in terms of gun control, i honestly do have faith in the foreseeable future because our government has brought out the motivation and drive of young activists to make permanent changes.\n  ","421305":"\n  background checks,

to yourself that things should stay the same. the only way for things to change is to protest, rally, and march to allow our voices to be heard.\n  ","421307":"\n  advocating for gun control certainly isn't a radical view, especially in light of the increasing number of shootings this nation has witnessed in 2018 alone.\n  \n  gun control will never be pointless, and at this current point in time, it's necessary in order to protect the lives of our children and the generations after us. there's no harm in making it more difficult for people to obtain guns because those who will use those guns responsibly won't find it problematic to go through processing in order to be a registered gun user.\n  ","421308":"\n  #enoughisenough\n  \n  we've seen too much gun violence in recent years, and we should be protecting children instead of protecting guns. enough is enough, and this needs to end. this isn't just about the parkland shootings ; this is about every shooting that has occurred that has been the result of lax gun laws, every shooting that has taken the lives of innocent people, every shooting that has rained terror down upon grieving families whose names did not even garner media

symptoms of BPD which can be most debilitating for people with the disorder. we tend to think in extremes and our emotions are heavily influenced by our environment, so even small and insignificant

the beginning to be pristine.\n  \n  everything else flows naturally, though. i'm grateful in that i've always been talented at expressing myself through writing.\n  ","421460":"\n  i used to experience panic attacks every day, and i only experience them perhaps one or two times per month now. they're definitely treatable if you're on a good treatment regimen, i.e. medication and therapy.\n  \n  therapy has helped me a lot with panic attacks as well because it's helped give me insight as to *why* i have panic attacks so that i can avoid or better cope with situations that

that people are capable of being in monogamous relationships -- you see it all over the world, where two people are solely faithful to one another and have no thoughts about dating anyone else at the

independent individuals ; they have extremely hard work ethics ; and they've been through a lot of loss and trauma, but they don't let it define them.\n  \n  sometimes, i aspire to be like them because it feels as if they're everything i'm not, and that i'm weak compared to them. but their trust and love in me are what drive me forward, and i cannot thank them enough.\n  ","421472":"\n  of course -- people can have multiple loves throughout their life, and it doesn't mean that their feelings previously were not real or valid. people can fall in love with different people for entirely different reasons, humans are much more complex than having one love for their entire lives.\n  ","421473":"\n  if i start a book, i never skip through the chapters. the last book i read was 'i am not

i've been writing consistently for the past month or so, which makes me really proud of myself.\n  ","421510":"\n  i just took it now ;\n  ","421511":"\n  the problem with therapy is that you have to be at a point where you're aware that you need professional help and you have to be willing to accept help, even if it's not what you had in mind. it requires an open mind.\n  \n  if someone isn't ready to accept help for their problems, then they won't get anything out of therapy -- i used to be in that position when i was a teenager. i saw a therapist when i was 14 years old, but i refused to believe that i needed help, so i didn't get anything out of the sessions and stopped attending. it wasn't until 2016 when i realized that i severely needed professional help otherwise i was going to end up dead.\n  ","421512":"\n  thank you !! i still have my slip ups here and there, as well as occasional depressive episodes, but they're not nearly as debilitating as they used to be and i can still function through my episodes until they dissipate. i always become discouraged whenever they happen, but my therapist always reminds me that i'm still making improvements and my episodes will never be as disabling as they were two years ago, and i'm constantly improving every week i see her.\n  ","421513":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree !! like i was saying to celine, prior to taking medication, i could barely function as a human being and merely existed, even though i didn't want to exist. i've regained my life back after getting adjusted on medication (even though it took two years for me to find the right meds, haha), and i can't imagine my life without them.\n  ","421514":"\n  i used to have the same mindset too prior to starting psychiatric medication, i was afraid of becoming dependent on them. but over the course of the past two years, with the trial and error associated with finding new meds, i've learned that i genuinely do need certain medications in order to function on a daily basis, and there's nothing wrong with that.\n  \n  before i started medication, i slept for weeks. i missed work at least once per week. i couldn't leave my house. i didn't eat. i cried every day and had thoughts of svicide. and when i was at work, i couldn't focus and was prone to panic attacks. medication has helped me exponentially and it not only allows me to function at home and at work, but now i also have the motivation to take part in my hobbies.\n  ","421515":"\n  i use askfm every day, sadly enough. you would think that after 5-6 years, i would have gotten tired of this website, but here i am... answering questions on a daily basis.\n  ","421516":"\n  there have been some cases where people have been classified as disabled due to such illnesses as 'social anxiety' (or clinically known as panic disorder with agoraphobia). when i worked for a disability law office, there were plenty of claimants who were alleging disability based upon the severity of those related symptoms, and it's nothing to joke about.\n  ","421517":"\n  hello ~~\n  \n  i'm doing fine, thanks for asking. i just woke up not too long ago, so rn i'm sitting with a cup of coffee

the time era it was set in.\n  ","421520":"\n  yeah, i have quite a few books of poetry laying around my room -- i just recently bought a few books by lang leav, and i'm also a big fan of pablo neruda.\n  ","421521":"\n  i prefer open-world RPGs -- games where you can explore, complete a bunch of quests and side quests, and have time to do things at your own pace.\n  \n  my favorite games are fallout 4, skyrim, destiny 1 & 2, the bioshock series, the halo series, and the assassin's creed series.\n  ","421522":"\n  yes, i've been reading & writing poetry since i was a teenager. i've recently written nine poems within the past month and two short essays.\n  ","421523":"\n  i don't play sports and i've never really been interested in them. however, my boyfriend has somewhat gotten me into ice hockey, and we went to a rangers vs islanders game once (which was a lot of fun).\n  ","421524":"\n  leigh isn't my real first name -- i honestly adopted leigh as my 'name' when i was a teenager, and i've been using it for more than a decade now.\n  \n  i originally came across the name while watching the saw movies, because one of the directors' names is leigh whannell. i thought leigh was a beautiful androgynous name.\n  ","421525":"\n  i'm on my laptop rn, so i don't have any photos of my newest ones (i have seven in total). however, here's a photo of my half sleeve ~~\n

i'll always have a journal as backup.\n  ","421527":"\n  my handwriting is awful ;\n  ","421528":"\n  i want a giant cup of iced coffee, to be wrapped in a hundred blankets, and my laptop to be on my lap so that i can answer questions and write for the rest of the afternoon.\n  \n  (preferably with a candle or incense ignited.)\n  ","421529":"\n  askfm was certainly more entertaining when it was more active a few years ago, but i do enjoy the quietness of the app now. back then, you couldn't state any opinion without a million people jumping down your throat for whatever reasons they could muster, but askfm seems to be more relaxed these days.\n  ","421530":"\n  i think sex work should be legalized -- in that respect, there can be better regulations regarding how sex workers are treated in the industry.\n  ","421531":"\n  i think it's shitty for people to allege that some forms of abvse are \"better\" than others -- abvse is abvse regardless of whether it's emotional or physical, and they're equally as traumatizing.\n  \n  not all physical abvse marks heal, either. people can experience chronic illnesses due to the effects of physical abvse, especially if it's prolonged.\n  ","421532":"\n  one of my coworkers uploaded a poem to instagram, and i told her that i liked the imagery involved in it. i encouraged her to write more often when she can because she's talented.\n

guessed?\n  ","421535":"\n  this is probably something sexual, but i have no clue what you're talking about.\n  ","421536":"\n  lol, no -- being an empath doesn't mean you're mentally ill. if someone is an empath, it means that they possess a hypersensitive ability to perceive other people's emotional state.\n  ","421537":"\n  i'm fairly empathetic, as i can understand most of the time where certain people are coming from with their struggles and thoughts. i always try to seek to understand why some people behave the way they do and hear them out.\n  ","421538":"\n  this is inaccurate. i'm not debating this any longer, though. please go debate about trans issues with someone else if you desire.\n  ","421539":"\n  not generally, no. i'm extremely guarded when it comes to trusting new people, and i generally don't become close with a person until after talking with them for a long amount of time.\n  ","421540":"\n  mainly social media -- facebook, askfm, tumblr, and twitter. i've also been trying to use medium.com more often to post my writing.\n  \n  everything else i use is an app on my phone (instagram, curiouscat, snapchat, etc etc).\n  ","421541":"\n  no, i didn't say or

since then.\n  ","421545":"\n  just be yourself and the right person will show up naturally over time. you can't force anyone to be with you, so your best option is to just keep living your life to the best of your ability and the right person will come along.\n  ","421546":"\n  this is a question that probably has a lot to do with evolution and psychology, and i don't really feel like wracking my brain to come to an abstract conclusion rn.\n  ","421547":"\n  hell bent on war and destruction, by the way things seem to be going.\n  ","421548":"\n  i think it's still being studied, but this is based off of a preliminary google search -- you'd probably find more information by researching it yourself.\n  \n  also idk if\n  \n   @LAKocis\n  \n  has any insight into this because i'm pretty sure he has ADHD?\n  ","421549":"\n  i don't usually wish for things -- wishing for something isn't going to make it happen, so i've always actively worked for what i wanted in my life.\n  ","421550":"\n  no. i'm educated in a lot of different things, but i wouldn't consider myself to be a master at any of them. even though i have a college degree in writing \/ grammar, it doesn't necessarily mean i'm a master at it.\n  ","421551":"\n  yeah, i feel a bit better than i did yesterday -- although i'm not exactly sober rn, which probably helps (lol).\n  ","421552":"\n  i think so, yeah -- sometimes people are better off as friends as opposed to lovers, which tends to happen a lot. my first girlfriend and i are better off as friends.\n  ","421553":"\n  uh, yeah -- if you have to ask \"is this racist...\" then 99% of the time it's racist.\n  ","421554":"\n  of course -- crying is a natural human reaction to stimuli, and it doesn't make anyone less of a 'man' for crying. it simply means you're human.\n  \n  we need to get rid of this concept of toxic masculinity because all it does is persuade men to suppress their emotions, and that isn't healthy at all.\n  ","421555":"\n  he's an extremely messy person, and our concepts of 'clean' are two completely different entities. he'll clean his room one day, and the next day, it somehow is a mess again. i have no idea how he does it tbh. he's an organized person in his mind, but his living areas are always a wreck.\n  ","421556":"\n  my discovery of watsky & k. flay on youtube -- i first listened to watsky a

askfm are from different countries.\n  ","421560":"\n  no -- when i met my boyfriend, neither of us were perfect and i knew that neither of us could attain something that was perfect because we're only human and susceptible to flaws. i thankfully never had a need to \"prove\" myself to him.\n  ","421561":"\n  LMFAO. \"you're in a relationship, so go to hell. ok bye.\"\n  \n  good riddance,

instead of writing it all out again, i just screenshotted my facebook post. i totally forgot that i wrote that part at the end about smoking weed, so after i re-read the message, i started panicking HARDCORE.\n  \n  i ended up texting her immediately thereafter, \"PLEASE IGNORE THE LAST SENTENCE.\" i was SO nervous, lmao. obviously that isn't something you talk to your supervisor about !! but

feeling is the first sip of coffee & first drag of a cigarette in the morning.\n  ","421577":"\n  i think it works both ways for both males and females -- porn gives unrealistic expectations to both sexes. for women, it gives off the impression that big dicks = more pleasure, while for men, it gives off the impression that tight vaginas = a lesser experienced woman. both couldn't be further from the truth.\n  ","421578":"\n  obvious inquiries such as asking where a person lives, their phone number, their real name, their work place, their friends, etc etc. i also find that, with respect to askfm, a lot of anons don't understand the concept of 'privacy' so they'll ask invasive sexual questions. a lot of anons feel entitled to know private details about a person's history.\n  ","421579":"\n  remember that your mental illnesses do not define you, and you're still a complete & whole person regardless of your mental states -- you deserve to find someone who loves and cherishes you, even if you may think otherwise.\n  \n  it's obviously also important to find a person who's understanding of mental health issues, so if you're dating a person who clearly doesn't understand your illnesses, you're better off dropping them.\n  ","421580":"\n  tbh, i remember askfm being at its peak around 2013 \/ 2014. i used to get 100 questions per day, to the point where it overwhelmed me so much that i had to deactivate my account for one year.\n  ","421581":"\n  i'm proficient at doing repetitive jobs, but they obviously bore me and i'll get tired of them rather quickly. i prefer changes in my routine to keep things diverse and interesting.\n  ","421582":"\n  tbh it's a bit hypocritical to claim that they respect the lgbt+ community while also denying them

be in advanced classes, and also be proficient in sports.\n  ","421585":"\n  i haven't been online much at all today besides for the past hour (i logged onto my laptop to answer questions faster since i got a lot of questions since last night).\n  \n  but, it is rather inactive on this 'side' of askfm in general -- especially compared to one year ago.\n  ","421586":"\n  i never got detention when i was in high school -- i was all around a pretty quiet kid, i kept to myself and only conversed with two or three people, and i was focused on getting good grades. i seldom spoke in class.\n  ","421587":"\n  i don't think i could pick just one movie out, but some of my favorites are -- heathers, i am not a serial killer, the craft, queen of the damned, v for vendetta, the purge, django unchained, the shining, secret window, girl interrupted, and one flew over the cuckoo's nest.\n  ","421588":"\n  -- that my mental illnesses will magically disappear & i can revert back to being a confident, independent adult\n  \n  -- endless coffee, free of charge\n  ","421589":"\n  i see my therapist once per week, and i see my psychiatrist once per month.\n  ","421590":"\n  i dislike the commute to work -- it takes me nearly an hour to get there, and about an hour to get home. the commute wears me out every day.\n  ","421591":"\n  no. that's called sadistic behavior and you should seek professional help before it escalates.\n  ","421592":"\n  if you truly love a person, telling them that you love them never loses its meaning. you should never get so comfortable that you forego telling your partner that you love them and cherish your relationship.\n  ","421593":"\n  i assume you meant wouldn't* but either way, that isn't necessarily true. you can be het and date a trans person if one person is a man and the other is a woman, regardless of their biological sex.\n  \n  it isn't transphobic for you to not be sexually attracted to certain genitalia. that's something we can't help.\n  ","421594":"\n  LOL. i may have a small stature, but i've often been told that i have a big brain.\n  ","421595":"\n  it's good motivation toward success -- i often utilize delayed gratification when it comes to work or doing necessary chores, i.e. i'll promise myself an episode of tv or a cup of coffee after i do x amount of chores.\n  ","421596":"\n  not at all. there's too much corruption of power and they're most likely holding secrets from the general public to push their own agenda.\n  ","421597":"\n  a concept ; i have similar views to my friends because one perspective isn't shared by only one person.\n  \n  cc:\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n","421598":"\n  idk, all of the americans i know absolutely hate the status of this country, including myself.\n  ","421599":"\n  good luck and stay warm !!\n  \n  my favorite kind of weather is spring weather -- not too warm with a nice breeze. i also like grey, rainy days.\n  ","421600":"\n  there's no snow where i live. we're supposed to get a lot of rain over the next two days, though.\n  ","421601":"\n  a week-long vacation with my boyfriend where we do nothing but sleep, have coffee, walk around nature parks and quaint towns, and sleep some more. no responsibilities or worries.\n  ","421602":"\n  my teenage years were the most difficult for me because i was dealing with abvse, the natural act of getting older, depression and anxiety, and addiction.\n  ","421603":"\n  i think it's extremely active in countries other than the united states, but i agree that the activity has dwindled a lot since one year ago.\n  ","421604":"\n  i'll be 31 in five years, so hopefully i'll be living in an apartment or house with my boyfriend and be married with a lot of dogs.\n  ","421605":"\n  i am unfortunately still active, haha.\n  ","421606":"\n  a dog -- i miss having a dog to play with and comfort me, but my parents aren't too keen on the idea after our last dog passed away.\n  \n  it's why i'm looking forward to moving out of my parents' house, besides the obvious fact of being independent. i think having a pet will help me a lot with my emotional issues.\n  ","421607":"\n  usually i buy something for myself, like one of my favorite iced coffees or i'll get my nails done. i also have gotten into the habit of doing face masks, which makes my skin feel fresh and smooth.\n  ","421608":"\n  i give off the impression that i'm relatively stable, but i've been a wild and out of control mess for the past few weeks and i feel like i've lost control of myself.\n  \n  i like talking about mental health, but i seldom talk about my own mental health because it's difficult to explain and my behavior is so misunderstood and stigmatized that its not even worth it sometimes for me to explain.\n  \n  i might take it easy for a while. i'm not sure yet. but it's wrecking havoc on my relationships and i've been self-isolating and things need to change.\n  ","421609":"\n  the princess bride -- if that's considered an \"old\" movie. it recently turned 30 years old.\n  ","421610":"\n  i have the tendency to be jealous, but i've been trying hard to suppress those feelings. i usually make passive aggressive comments or, if i'm really angry, i'll confront the person directly.\n  ","421611":"\n  \"are you fucking kidding me?\"\n  \n  it's my automatic reaction to a lot of circumstances.\n  ","421612":"\n  waking up with my boyfriend to a view overlooking the mountains, having coffee on the patio, and making meaningful conversation.\n  ","421613":"\n  i like surrealism, like salvador dali. i have one of his prints hanging in my room.\n  ","421614":"\n  do you mean dying? i assume everyone would ideally want to die fast.\n  ","421615":"\n  probably one of those tattoo shows where people get filmed while getting their tattoos and talking about the significance behind them. i've been meaning to get a new tattoo for a while.\n  ","421616":"\n  i'm exhausted and i have a splitting headache. i honestly don't want to be at work right now, and i'm looking forward to going home in six hours and watching the rest of 'the end of the fucking world.'\n  ","421617":"\n  crying is extremely healthy for anyone -- it's a release of emotional stress and it also triggers the release of endorphins, the \"feel good\" chemicals, into your bloodstream.\n  ","421618":"\n  sometimes, yeah -- however, it's more of an uncontrollable emotional response than anything else.\n  ","421619":"\n  i'm not a girl -- that's probably the most significant difference.\n  ","421620":"\n  dunkin donuts vanilla iced coffee. 10\/10 would recommend.\n  ","421621":"\n  sometime last week. i don't remember when or for what reason, but it's a common occurrence.\n  ","421622":"\n  as long as they're babies, i see nothing wrong with that. however, if they're older then there's pressure for the kids to look a certain way and that can be detrimental to their self image.\n  ","421623":"\n  yes. i've always been a hard worker, especially when it came to school work, so i knew i was going to graduate with high honors.\n  ","421624":"\n  i love linkin park and tbh i think that song has been equated with chester's death so it has significant meaning.\n  ","421625":"\n  it was cute the first time i saw it, but now that i've seen you ask this to nearly everyone i follow, it's rather irritating.\n  ","421626":"\n  GUESS WHO'S HANGING OUT WITH\n  \n   @Courrtana\n  \n  ON SUNDAY AAAAHHHHH.\n  ","421627":"\n  my relationship with my boyfriend. he's my solid support system and i can't imagine not having him in my life.\n  ","421628":"\n  my current job -- writing and editing. i've been doing it for my entire life, so it comes naturally to me.\n  ","421629":"\n  answering questions is addictive, at the very least. it gives me something to do when i'm bored or taking a break.\n  \n  i also follow quite a few friends of mine, and i enjoy reading their answers.\n  ","421630":"\n  i'm not sober rn and it took me three times to figure out what this meant, lmao.\n  ","421631":"\n  no. traditions are often exposed to be wrong or outdated, and modern science has proven that there are better alternatives and can uncover new evidence.\n  \n  there are a lot of misconceptions about circumcision and it isn't as great as people thought it was in the past.\n  ","421632":"\n  chocolate chip cookie dough !!\n  ","421633":"\n  writing poetry again -- it's been years since i wrote anything, but a week or so ago, i started writing again and currently have eight poems drafted.\n  ","421634":"\n  if i had an option, i'd rather jump from a springboard. i used to love jumping off of diving boards into pools all the time.\n  ","421635":"\n  thankfully, never. i'm seldom in a public place where men have the option to flirt with me, and even when i am out (i.e. at the bar), people rarely approach me. i'm the type of person who saves their friends from disgusting men by telling them off if they approach them.\n  ","421636":"\n  they've gone through some terrible experiences, but has still managed to survive to tell their tales. i find this person interesting because we get along quite well and i find their openness about their illnesses to be refreshing and educational. i think we would be great friends IRL.\n  ","421637":"\n  circumcision -- it's an unnecessary and painful cosmetic procedure done on infants without their consent.\n  \n  hunting (as a sport) -- i don't believe in killing, maiming, or injuring animals as a form of entertainment because it's incredibly cruel.\n  ","421638":"\n  i don't feel compelled to have children at this point in my life. it would be irresponsible of me to do such a thing.\n  ","421639":"\n  i'm a writer \/ editor for a publishing company. i mainly write press releases, newsletter and magazine features, and biographies for websites. i also proofread and edit narratives that the other writers wrote.\n  ","421640":"\n  i have no tolerance for pro-life propaganda on my page. if someone wants to have an abortion, they should have the freedom to do such. to infringe on someone's decision to do what is necessary for their health is an invasion of bodily autonomy.\n  ","421641":"\n  LOL. that's certainly an interesting way to look at it. i think there's a difference between someone who's your therapist and someone who's your friend -- your therapist is supposed to listen to your thoughts, feelings, & experiences and give professional advice on how to cope with them, as well as make you view things in a different perspective. they went to school and studied mental illnesses so they have a clinical understanding of what people go through.\n  \n  friends aren't professionals and can only offer lay people advice and hope for the best. while you can tell your friends some of the things you go through, there's always the possibility of them judging you or telling someone else.\n  ","421642":"\n  i've always been hesitant with the idea of wanting children, so i often go back and forth on it. some days i can see myself as a parent, while other days i want nothing to do with kids and find them annoying.\n  ","421643":"\n  hell no. i don't particularly like children, and i literally have no idea what to do with babies. i've never experienced baby fever before.\n  ","421644":"\n  i think they would learn more about mental health and that  complex disorders aren't 'scary' -- it would promote understanding of things such as personality disorders and erase some of the stigma associated with them.\n  ","421645":"\n  as long as those charges are discussed prior to signing the contract and the buyer is fully aware of those charges, then i don't really see a problem with that (except for hidden charges, that's just a problem). i see nothing wrong with an exit penalty if you end a contract early because you were the one who originally agreed to the contract to its entirety.\n  ","421646":"\n  idk actually. sometimes parents need to bring their children with them because they have no other option, and that wouldn't really be fair to those parents.\n  \n  on the other hand, i think it would be interesting to have 'mature' restaurants where you have to be a certain age to eat there, and sometimes it's nice not to hear screaming children during dinner, lol.\n  ","421647":"\n  there was one night a few weeks ago where my boyfriend and i stayed up talking until 2am. we were just having one of those nights where the conversation just flowed and they were all deep and productive conversations, and it felt so nice to have someone to talk to like that. i felt so grateful that person just happens to be my significant other.\n  ","421648":"\n  no -- i agree with what pretty much everyone else has said regarding this matter. it's unfair to tip toe around people's diets or give them special consideration because no one is inherently a better person than another simply because they're vegetarian \/ vegan.\n  \n  i do believe there should be more vegan options in restaurants, but other than that, i don't really think we should be more mindful than we already are.\n  ","421649":"\n  yeah, absolutely -- we have no secrets between us, and tbh if i woke up in another person's bed, i would assume that i was assaulted because i would never consent to activity with another person.\n  ","421650":"\n  i'm not a girl, and i really hope this isn't the anon who keeps insisting that i'm a girl despite me saying otherwise.\n  \n  nevertheless, i'm good. i'm drinking wine and having a good time listening to music.\n  ","421651":"\n  showing off my new picture b\/c i'm an attention seeking asshole ;\n  ","421652":"\n  askfm is fucking dead tonight, man.\n  ","421653":"\n  it shouldn't be unless they're doing something illegal.\n  ","421654":"\n  not with strangers, no. but i've known my boyfriend's best friend for seven years, so of course i'm going to feel comfortable around him.\n  ","421655":"\n  the barista at starbucks accidentally knocked over a cup of coffee and like a millimeter splashed onto this customer's jacket, so the customer threw a fit because apparently it was a (insert expensive brand here).\n  \n  i grabbed my drink and ran. i have no patience for people like that.\n  ","421656":"\n  yes, we plan on getting married -- we're not engaged or anything yet, but it's pretty much a mutual understanding and he's probably going to propose to me after we get settled into an apartment together.\n  ","421657":"\n  donald j. trump.\n  ","421658":"\n  despite feeling like shit both physically & mentally, i've managed to clean, dust, vacuum, and do laundry -- and its only 12:30 pm.\n  \n  even though this is little stuff, i'm still proud of myself.\n  ","421659":"\n  LOL. i ask him occasionally how he feels about it, and he literally says \"i don't give a shit. do whatever you want with your body, i'll still love you either way.\"\n  \n  i haven't shaved since at least november or december, and i normally go months without shaving in general -- if it bothered him, we would have broken up years ago.\n  ","421660":"\n  oh hell no. waxing my eyebrows hurts enough, i can't imagine waxing other portions of my body.\n  ","421661":"\n  nah, i don't have a preference -- i love all dogs and will probably adopt one that i feel a chemistry who does melt my heart (although all dogs melt my heart lol).\n  ","421662":"\n  i don't think everyone is dangerous or threatens people -- regardless, idk why you're still carrying on about this. an anon came to me for help with someone who they perceived to be dangerous with a history of threatening behavior. i gave them advice. end of story.\n  \n  all other inquiries will be deleted.\n  ","421663":"\n  \u2727 move into an apartment with my boyfriend\n  \n  \u2727 lose weight\n  \n  \u2727 progress further with my career\n  \n  \u2727 recover more from mental health\n  \n  \u2727 adopt a dog\n  ","421664":"\n  idk why this is still a topic of conversation. the original anon who told me about him basically said they feared for their life, so i referred her to the police and the FBI.\n  \n  that's not unreasonable. you should always report potentially dangerous behavior.\n  ","421665":"\n  LOL i'm literally wearing one of his shirts rn.\n  \n  yeah, they're cozy and a bit bigger than my clothes so they hang loosely which is comfortable to me.\n  ","421666":"\n  red flag behavior is still red flag behavior regardless of whether or not someone has a mental illness -- mental illness isn't an excuse for abvsive behavior.\n  ","421667":"\n  i haven't done any research on it, so i can't agree or disagree with this notion. there's also the concept that there's less stigma surrounding disorders such as depression and anxiety, so people are more apt to seek professional help, which makes it appear as if more people have mental illness than in the past.\n  ","421668":"\n  LMAO. thanks for the humor, anon.\n  ","421669":"\n  that is interesting. but yeah, i can see where she's coming from -- BPD is a chronic illness and while we can \"recover\" to the point of stability, it's still always there. we can treat the symptoms of the disorder, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the disorder goes away.\n  ","421670":"\n  ... did you really believe that sending an anon message would really persuade me to quit smoking ?? lmao.\n  \n  my choices are mine to make. i have no intentions of quitting anytime soon, so any attempts to sway me otherwise are pointless.\n  ","421671":"\n  LOL. that's my secret -- i'm always anon.\n  \n  cc:\n  \n   @LAKocis\n  \n","421672":"\n  i like walking through parks and wooded areas to take photographs. i believe that nature is beautiful and i absolutely love photographing landscapes and other interesting forms to showcase that beauty.\n  ","421673":"\n  this question is better geared toward google.\n  ","421674":"\n  i know what you mean, it honestly scares me too even though i'm not in school anymore -- but the idea of anyone having free range in any public, crowded place is terrifying and it's almost as if no one is safe.\n  ","421675":"\n  i don't think pathetic is the right word to use -- moreso alarming than anything else.\n  \n  but i agree. idk why the police aren't taking that person's case seriously. it's damaging.\n  ","421676":"\n  i prefer pumpkin bread, although that's more of a thanksgiving thing where i'm from.\n  ","421677":"\n  yes, definitely -- i need to be with someone with whom i can have deep conversations, which requires a bit of intelligence. luckily my boyfriend is intelligent in his own right, even though he doesn't believe it himself.\n  ","421678":"\n  LOL the other day. i accidentally deleted a narrative from one of the folders before proofreading it, so i told the writer \"uhhh i can't find it in the folder, do you have a copy saved on your computer?\" and luckily he did.\n  ","421679":"\n  i personally wouldn't engage in such activities (especially considering i have a boyfriend), but it doesn't affect me if other people have friends with benefits. people are allowed to live their lives however they choose, and it isn't my place to judge.\n  ","421680":"\n  my boyfriend, lol. he's legit the weirdest person i've ever met, but that's why i love him.\n  ","421681":"\n  at times, yes. lately i've been dealing with it because everyone talking about gun control has been so emotionally draining on me and its been overwhelming me a lot. i can only read so much before my head starts to spin.\n  ","421682":"\n  i'm back and forth on the whole parenting deal because i've never really liked children and i don't have any sort of parental instinct.\n  \n  however, if i do have kids one day, i won't raise them like how i was raised and i would probably try to teach them a little bit about every religion to show them that they can adhere to whatever beliefs make the most sense to them.\n  ","421683":"\n  uh, awks ;\n  ","421684":"\n  tbh it's entirely due to therapy -- i've been in therapy for more than one year now, and i've learned a lot about my mental health and symptoms and behavior as a result.\n  \n  i can control some things, and some things i can't, but i'm grateful that i'm aware of things moreso now than ever before.\n  ","421685":"\n  if someone threatens me, then i usually tell them off quite calmly. so far, i've never had anyone push further than verbal threats, so i've never had a reason to defend myself.\n  \n  if it happens, though, i'm confident that i can defend myself. i carry a knife with me everywhere i go.\n  ","421686":"\n  most likely, yeah -- most parents do it everyday.\n  ","421687":"\n  no, i've never been arrested. probably should have been quite a few times, but i got lucky.\n  ","421688":"\n  idk, my boyfriend says i am and kids love me for some reason, but i feel really awkward around them.\n  "}}
