much about other people s private biz","96576":"no it s not normal , ideal , or something any parent wants but shit happens and some teens experiment sooner than others . you just have to hope they re with other kids and being safe and not being groomed by an adult or something extra terrible . if a teen is active then they should know about how to avoid pregnancies and stds . they should have the best tools available to aid in that .","96577":"if her daughter admitted to being sexually active then why not do the right thing and get the pill and teach about safe sex ? i mean like it s not

hit the hazard lights with my foot during the switcharoo so not only were we totally obviously drunk the hazards were on . somehow though , the cops passed us through ? like , he asked about the hazards and i slurred something about putting them on to let other drivers behind me know to slow down for the checkpoint . he told me to have a nice night and waved us through . white privilege holy shit . like can you believe i got away with that awfulness","96606":"i mean i would but not to their faces because then i d have to explain all the ways why and it s tiresome i m not everyone s
