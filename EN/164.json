upwards of a few thousand a month for fancy facilities with hour care . or it can be very cheap if you keep the horse on your own land and only have to pay for food and medical expenses . some very well bred and well trained horses can cost more than , but your average horse will probably be more in the price range to buy","151961":"haha yeah my bf is just starting to take lessons and he says it

in months","152114":"zebras cannot be domesticated like horses have been because of their disagreeable , flighty , nervous , and sometimes unpredictable nature , paired with their general lack of curiosity . some animals are prime candidates for domestication because they possess the key traits that make them easier to breed and alter into a domestic animal a diverse appetite , rapid maturation , willingness to breed in captivity , docility , strong nerves , and a nature that conforms to social hierarchy . some animals , like zebras , don t have those traits and are therefore very difficult to domesticate and therefore ride as a species .","152115":"get a mini one lol","152116":"don t want kids","152117":"art and equestrian","152118":"idk i haven t been to dc since the pandemic

also , birthing isn t nearly as painful for most animals as it is for humans because most animals have wider hips and produce babies with smaller heads than humans do . it s easier and much quicker to get them out because of this","152145":"nope no height limit . there are very tall horses for tall people and very short horses for short people . there is a weight limit each individual horse can carry but it s easily solved by finding a horse that s right for you . riders weighing over pounds kilograms will need large , strong horses like draft breeds to carry them safely . riders weighing from pounds kilograms can be carried safely by an averagely built horse breed . riders weighing anything under lbs kg can usually be carried safely by a pony breed if they re not too tall to do

therapeutic for your soul and good for your physical fitness !","152531":"first started when i was years old while living overseas it was a cool , cheap , activity there so my mom signed me up and i ve loved it ever since ! been riding for about years now","152532":"watch youtube , stare at the ceiling , go on this app , or scroll though social media","152533":"this stuffed animal i named bunny

monetized on ask if that s what you re asking , but i m not on youtube yet .","152540":"the dog yawning and saying his little awoo to get me to wake up , the sound of horse s soft noses snorting and banging around in their buckets to eat their breakfasts , and the sound of my partner saying goodmorning when he wakes up and greets me","152541":"merry christmas to you too","152542":"drew it as a part of my upcoming youtube video part of a series i m doing","152543":"the reins are like a telephone line keeping the communication between you and them flowing . that s why having a light steady contact with them is important . it helps you feel each other and communicate your intents . they re also helpful as a reinforcing aid you use when other aids don t get the response you re looking for or also for minor adjustments to the horse s body position , direction , and speed . for example , to slow down from a faster gait to a slower one , you d first sit up , sit deeper in the saddle , impede the motion of the horse with your body , and say woah . if that didn t immediately get a response you d continue doing those things as you close your fingers to squeeze the reins like a sponge , increasing pressure on the reins until you get a response . most of the time the horse will respond with very little pressure or almost none at all . if you wanted them to slow down but stay in the same gait you d use what s called a half halt where you maintain forward motion and momentum by keeping your body engaged and keeping your leg on but you ask the horse to collect and come back to you by squeezing your fingers on the outside rein like a gun trigger and saying easy or slow or woah , whatever word you choose to train","152544":"very very little has to do with the reins . most riding is done from the seat , core , and leg . horses are very capable of learning words and phrases as training though too just like dogs can","152545":"those are all people diseases so they d show the same signs and symptoms as people who had them . if you re curious i d say google it . but none of those are all that common diseases for a horse or a person to catch","152546":"idk about like actual bugs or anything but diseases people could catch from contact with an infected horse include ringworm , staph infections , salmonella , rabies , and anthrax","152547":"i ve been to a bat mitzvah before","152548":"yeah ear position is one of the ways horses communicate their emotions and intent but it s a combination of lots of things not just that","152549":"when i worked retail at a few different stores it was god awful . angry karen ass customers screaming in my face over produce and sweaters , married managers asking me to get in bed with them , managers telling me they loved me after knowing me for a week , one didn t even speak english and couldn t explain to me how to do things at my job , constantly having to clean up after other coworkers who were incompetent and having to do their jobs for them , standing for hours at a time and repeating myself over and over and over every minutes , being denied a break a few times , having to come in on my off days to fix people s mistakes . . . literally so annoying and life draining","152550":"haha idk go find her and ask her then","152551":"not often but i ve liked aussie brand hairspray before when i ve used it . comes in the purple bottle","152552":"hurricane with mild flooding","152553":"don t think i have a favorite anymore . used to be a horse i leased named roscoe but he s since been sold to a different owner and
