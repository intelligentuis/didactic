It's hard to describe what it's like in a lot of ways, because some symptoms are so subtle or start off subtle and then intensify so gradually that you accept them as part of your life without thought. In the past, I've had visual hallucinations that I just wrote off as \"omens\" for instance because they just became a part of my every day. I've at times had delusional lines of thinking, such as \"the government wants to experiment on my brain\" or \"there's a plot to plant a bomb in my home\" but that's been pretty rare and during times of extreme stress. I was active with symptoms such as these starting at around age 19, and then went into remission for a little while, then active again, then in remission for years and years, and now I'm active again but only to a very small degree. For me now, schizophrenia means my brain fills in silent spaces with it's own noise. I hear radio talk shows or newscasts or weather channel - type droning voices. Sometimes, my lines of thinking get a little muddled- like I'll be thinking about preparing kale for the bird then suddenly be certain she's going to die and it doesn't matter.\n  \n  That's a lot of words I just typed hope that helps explain some.
