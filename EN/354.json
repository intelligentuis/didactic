awkward to even get to that point (even now that i'm single, i'm still too awkward to flirt).\n  ","380121":"\n  for the most part, yes. everyone has judged someone to a certain extent at least once

","380125":"\n  no, i couldn't care any less.\n  ","380126":"\n  well, i wouldn't necessarily describe anything as \"hate\" because that's a very strong feeling that i only feel towards perhaps 1-2

chemistry we have in other areas. although music is very important to me, so it would be difficult for me to even find someone who doesn't like something that i like music-wise, haha.\n  ","380131":"\n  i prefer television shows because it's easier for me to watch since i can stop after any episode and continue the next day. i like watching them alone.\n  ","380132":"\n  i've never owned an apple phone before.\n  ","380133":"\n  i'm not sure if i agree with a mandatory vaccine at the moment, but it wouldn't surprise me if the vaccine does become mandatory in the future. as for my opinion on people who refuse to take the vaccine, i think it's irresponsible.\n  ","380134":"\n  no, not exactly, although i guess my views on what happens after death can be akin to reincarnation in a sense. basically, i believe when we die, our physical bodies perish but our souls (or spirits or whatever you believe) transfer mediums, as it's composed of energy and energy cannot be destroyed.\n  ","380135":"\n  same thing, haha. i went to college, attended my classes and often wrote my papers between classes, and then went home or went to work.\n  ","380136":"\n  at the moment, it's supernatural.\n  \n  however, other favorite shows of mine include criminal minds, NCIS, how i met your mother, parks and recreation, game of thrones, house, ghost adventures, and bob's burgers.\n  ","380137":"\n  unfortunately, alcohol use is *extremely* normalized in today's society, and a lot of people who ab*se alcohol refuse to consider themselves to be alcoholics until something really terrible happens. meanwhile, other addictions (such as to certain drugs) are shunned, like you said, because there's more of a stigma attached to them, and those addicts are often isolated and dehumanized because they have an addiction.\n  ","380138":"\n  2020 was great for me professionally, but not so great on a personal level. i was given extra responsibilities at work and

not experienced before.\n  ","380139":"\n  my day is going well. i slept in this morning, which felt really nice. then i had some breakfast and coffee, scrolled through social media for a bit, then

 uh, no. rofl. that's extremely disrespectful to him and his relationship.\n  ","380149":"\n  i've had my jealous moments in the past, but i was able to let go of them rather easily when i started to not care about the person anymore.\n  ","380150":"\n  yeah, although i don't believe in the conventional definition of a soul mate. i believe people can have multiple soul mates, meaning others with whom they share a close connection, and it doesn't always have to be on a romantic level.\n  ","380151":"\n  it really depends on who that person is. there are some people i can cut out of my life with no hesitation whatsoever, while there are others i cannot let go at all.\n  ","380152":"\n  \"interview with the vampire\" by anne rice. reading that book at such a formative age really helped shape my writing.\n  ","380153":"\n  i don't believe they should be held to a higher standard of education on a matter, but considering celebrities *do* have a larger platform than the regular civilian, i think they should really consider their opinions and how it affects others before posting their views on social networks or during interviews.\n  ","380154":"\n  i think it would be amusing to reveal who all of the anons are for 24 hours.\n  ","380155":"\n  i respect everyone until they give me a reason not to respect them anymore.\n  ","380156":"\n  do some self-thinking and discover why you feel jealousy in the first place -- perhaps it's because you may be insecure about yourself, or some other reason. once you figure out why you feel jealous of others (or a particular person), it becomes a bit easier to handle that jealousy and explain rationally to yourself how to get over it.\n  ","380157":"\n  2020 was simultaneously fast & slow, for some reason. certain months went by incredibly fast, while other months went slowly. and it feels like last march was so long ago, but also not long ago at all.\n  ","380158":"\n  i really value compliments on my writing.\n

","380173":"\n  you can't exactly get rid of him because you're not the person dating him. however, if you have such a strong dislike towards your best friend's boyfriend, then you should sit down with your best friend and describe to her how he behaves and that you believe she deserves someone more mature and responsible.\n  ","380174":"\n  i think it's disgusting, especially if they're treating those lower-position workers as less than human or just a number. ideally, bosses in high management positions should respect and accommodate lower position workers because they often are the foundation to any company.\n  ","380175":"\n  i haven't thought much about it at all. i'm probably going to make some tomato soup and grilled cheese.\n  ","380176":"\n  yes, haha. when i was dating my

in together or got engaged.\n  ","380320":"\n  it's difficult to say, because i guess it depends really on the timeline. at the moment, we're better off as close friends as opposed to being in a relationship, mainly because i think he's still in the process of figuring himself out \u2014 what he wants and needs, his perspectives on love, etc etc. he's been dating someone else now for a while

him for pretty much the same things \u2014 he's endured a lot of trauma and mental\/physical health conditions, but despite all of that, he's a very motivated and driven person. he always puts 120% into his work. additionally, he's probably one of the most intelligent people i know.\n  ","380325":"\n  i'd definitely say something \u2014 it's wrong and hurtful for people who actually *do* have

so. but after living with two (and then four) cats for over a year, i've learned to love cats as well. they all have such unique personalities and they're the sweetest animals i've ever met.\n

didn't get home until 11:00am.\n  \n  i'm not too worried about the swab \u2014 my roommate told me it wasn't the ridiculously long one, it's a shorter one thankfully. i was under the impression that

although i used to get high off of the fumes, haha.\n  ","380346":"\n  it's more than just happiness \u2014 it's a sense of intense euphoria, like i have 10x the amount of energy than usual, i feel i'm unstoppable, i'm hyperfixated on things, i make very rash and impulsive decisions (like binge drinking and dropping $300 on random sh*t online), and i also get irritable quickly when things don't

tested this morning and the rapid test came back positive. so now we all have to quarantine for 10 days since we're all at \"high risk\" of exposure due to living in the same household. i'm getting tested tomorrow morning.\n  ","380432":"\n  just because we don't understand it fully through science doesn't mean it's automatically something omniscient or higher than ourselves in a

lately. i'm almost done with season four (with 11 more seasons to go!).\n  ","380434":"\n  i think it depends on the relationship you had with them previously, as well as the friendship you may or may not have with them now. if they were toxic or ab*sive to you, then i'm leaning towards saying that you shouldn't text them -- you have to keep your own health and well being in mind, and that may open up the opportunity for them to manipulate you again.\n  ","380435":"\n  distancing myself and\/or ignoring them completely.\n  ","380436":"\n  this is the last thing i drew months ago, haha.\n

watch it on regular television, but hopefully there will be a live stream on youtube. that's how i've been watching the debates and everything else.\n  ","380440":"\n  that's a pretty immature mindset. people are allowed to like the music they like, and it certainly doesn't affect your life at all.\n  ","380441":"\n  jesus was a real person, from my understanding of religion. however, i don't necessarily believe he was some sort of prophet or supernatural being that's often described in religious texts.\n  ","380442":"\n  thankfully, no. i've been accidentally given someone else's

taste in music.\n  ","380445":"\n  no, i don't believe in god. i've simply never believed in god even when growing up. i've always viewed the bible as a fictional storybook, in a sense.\n

more bad that comes out of me hurting myself than good. i still have urges to hurt myself most days, but i keep reminding myself how upset and paranoid i would become afterwards.\n  \n  i also quit smoking cigarettes after 10 years of smoking a pack per day. i just stopped one afternoon and started vaping a lower dose of nicotine. i still vape occasionally now, but not nearly as much as i used

horrible, and called out of work today. :\/\n  ","380576":"\n  it could be, yeah. it could also be because perhaps you think gossiping is immature and you don't want to associate yourself with people

a quick five-minute trip into the drug store or 7-11, i bring my phone with me into the store.\n  ","380604":"\n  i've been working for the same company for over three years now, and i love my immediate supervisor. she's the best boss i've ever had, she understands my mental health conditions, she's considerate of everyone else in the department (especially everyone's worried about COVID), and she goes the extra mile to stick up for us if upper management is being irrational. i value her authority so much.\n  ","380605":"\n  i normally don't, haha.\n  ","380606":"\n  sometimes the \"right\" job won't hire you unless you have prior experience in working a job or two. waiting for the right job may not work out in your favor for that reason, and it's important to find a job that helps you gain money and experience so you can put it on your resume\/CV.\n  ","380607":"\n  yeah, i probably could for at least a month. i don't tend to spend frivolously to begin with anyway, and the only things i ever routinely splurge on are alcoholic beverages, haha.\n  ","380608":"\n  i'm feeling mentally & physically crappy today, so i mustered up the energy to re-organize my desk space\/at-home work station to accommodate the new movies and blu-ray disc drive i bought, and i feel a bit more at peace now. organizing things tends to help my mental health at times, i don't feel as \"crowded\" compared to the mess my desk used to be.\n  ","380609":"\n  it doesn't matter whether or not someone is wealthy or famous during these times -- the coronavirus doesn't discriminate, which is evident by how many famous people have either fallen ill to it and have even d*ed from it. when you have children in the midst of the pandemic, that's even more cause for concern because the children also have to adjust to online schooling, which is something that can be hard for children to transition to (as well as the parents who are helping their children).\n  \n  it's a hard time for everyone right now. people shouldn't have trolled her. her concerns are valid.\n  ","380610":"\n  not well, my coping mechanisms are trash.\n  ","380611":"\n  no, they're nothing special. i've been experiencing a lot of anxiety lately, so they're pretty gross and bitten up.\n  ","380612":"\n  no, i don't speak spanish.\n  ","380613":"\n  very much so, although sometimes my anxiety causes me to stay awake or wake up multiple times throughout the night. i've gotten into the habit of smoking a bit of weed before bed, and that seems to help a lot.\n  ","380614":"\n  yeah, sometimes. most of the time, however, it's pretty much to focus their attention on something other than me if they're concerned about me for whatever reason. i'll lie and say i'm okay when actually i'm not doing well at all.\n  ","380615":"\n  it can be somewhat important depending on what you want to do for a living. some jobs require a bachelor's degree or higher, such as if you wanted to work as an attorney or a nurse (but that would be a registered nursing license, sometimes a BSN).\n  \n  however, people have succeeded in life without obtaining a formal degree. i have plenty of friends who never finished college and they have successful careers.\n  ","380616":"\n  i would rather have telekinesis and be able to move things with my mind, such as getting a drink out of the fridge without having to get up, lmaoo.\n  ","380617":"\n  i'm not much of a procrastinator at all. when there's something that needs to be done, i try to do it as early as possible, otherwise i'll just get stressed out.\n  ","380618":"\n  only towards people whom i care about a lot.\n  ","380619":"\n  progress further in my therapy appointments regarding my mental health. i've only been seeing this therapist since

 ","380621":"\n  depends on what it is that they've said and how that person behaves normally. in most cases, that person is already a bit of a problematic person so it wouldn't surprise me, and depending on how close i am to that person, i might step forward and tell them why their toxic statement is hurtful.\n  ","380622":"\n  unfortunately, yeah. you need to invest money in order to make that money back in most cases, and very few people have that start-up money to begin with.\n  ","380623":"\n  no, i don't like nutella at all.\n  ","380624":"\n  my friendship with my best friend. we

children. the classroom was on the second floor of the school, and there was one time he threw a student's binder and notebooks out the second floor window.\n  ","380640":"\n  i'm friends with a lot of people who post high quality memes, and i'm also a member of quite a few sh*tposting groups, haha. facebook is a great distraction for me and it's where i find a lot of memes and videos.\n

","380649":"\n  that sounds like they're not such a good friend at all, and perhaps they were just saving face around you because of your boyfriend. i would advise that you talk to your boyfriend about this to get his opinion, and then eventually confront that friend about why they're acting the way they are around you when you two have been civil for the past three years.\n  ","380650":"\n

looking to watch new streamers on twitch. :'))\n  \n  as for your question, i'm more content when i buy something that's inexpensive and realize that it's worth a lot (or the quality is much better than the price makes it seem to be). this happens a lot with cosmetics, i've noticed. a lot of high-end makeup is good quality, but just because something is expensive doesn't automatically mean it's a good product.\n  ","380653":"\n  yes, i absolutely love video games.\n  ","380654":"\n  probably too much, tbh. i wouldn't be able to put a number to it.\n  ","380655":"\n  nah, i think that's

likely adopt.\n  ","380661":"\n  i agree with this statement. someone isn't obligated to agree with you on something simply because they're your friend, and it's healthy to have different opinions on things. however, that doesn't take into account if your friend, for example, says something discriminatory or oppressive.\n  ","380662":"\n  yeah, some advice -- wait until the pandemic is over. we're supposed to be social distancing, not hooking up with people and increasing the spread of COVID.\n  \n  (and before you guys come at me for saying this because i hooked up with someone over the

fan of fireworks at all, and i believe they do more harm than good. they're fun from a distance -- like if you're sitting on the beach and watching them from across the bay -- but to set them off in your own neighborhood with tons of houses surrounding you is inconsiderate.\n  \n  one, it startles and scares animals and people's pets. two, it can trigger people with PTSD and other people with sensory dilemmas. fireworks in themselves are also very dangerous if not handled correctly.\n  ","380668":"\n  no, at least not me personally. i mainly wear dark colors (most of my shirts are black or dark red and green, for example). i just prefer dark colors on myself.\n  ","380669":"\n  yeah, i constantly need something in my hand while i'm doing pretty much *anything* -- whether it's my vape or

concept of 2021 as a whole doesn't sway me in any particular way. we simply don't know what the future holds, so 2020 has taught me to remain in the present moment.\n  ","380671":"\n  considering i'm

it comes to my writing.\n  ","380843":"\n  i'm 29 years old.\n  ","380844":"\n  no, i don't share everything about my life with people.\n  ","380845":"\n  nah, i haven't used products in years (besides dry shampoo). i don't even blow dry my hair most of the time.\n  ","380846":"\n  the bahamas.\n  ","380847":"\n  -- the LOTR trilogy.\n  \n  -- les miserables.\n  \n  -- sweeney todd: the demon barber of fleet street.\n  \n  -- american psycho.\n  \n  -- the punisher.\n  \n  -- the crow.\n  \n  -- girl interrupted.\n  \n  -- the shining.\n  \n  -- the princess bride.\n  \n  -- nightcrawler.\n  ","380848":"\n  pay off all of my debt and probably purchase a house.\n  ","380849":"\n  haha, no. i haven't.\n  ","380850":"\n  yeah, i'm certain that i have.\n  ","380851":"\n  not everyone has good relationships with their families, so family isn't *always* the first priority. it isn't unreasonable to be upset when your significant other bails on you to spend time with their family, which is why i said they should divide their time equally between their partner and their family.\n  ","380852":"\n  sometimes, but not in recent weeks since it's been chilly out.\n  ","380853":"\n  i'd like to go camping again in northern pennsylvania, but definitely not in the middle of winter, lol.\n  ","380854":"\n  oof, it's definitely not a teenage thing -- it's nice to wake up to \"good morning\" texts, it's more of the sentiment behind it as opposed to the physical saying of \"good morning.\" regardless, he shouldn't have made fun of you for liking that -- that's just mean.\n  ","380855":"\n  you know i love art, haha. i'm always trying to find new artists on social media.\n  ","380856":"\n\n   @shehitsback\n  \n\n  also, heyfrancis (francis ochoa) on twitter is an amazing painter as well !! idk what other platforms he's on, but his work is beautiful.\n  ","380857":"\n  it's common, but not really normal or healthy. ideally, he should divide his time up between you and his family evenly, and he definitely shouldn't be cancelling your dates to spend time with his family. that isn't fair to you.\n  ","380858":"\n  oh goodness, no. i'd probably fall asleep mid-hike, lmaoo.\n  ","380859":"\n  sloppjockey_ert on instagram has amazing paintings\/drawings, and i really want to buy a few of his prints eventually off of etsy.\n  ","380860":"\n  lately i've been putting \"my mother told me\" from the assassin's creed valhalla soundtrack on repeat.\n  ","380861":"\n  \"i want to wear your skin.\"\n  ","380862":"\n  i wouldn't really consider them \"must-haves\" or anything, but i do appreciate good morning text messages, going out to eat together on occasion, spending time playing video games together (or watching the other person play games), and cuddling.\n  ","380863":"\n  i am also left-handed.\n  ","380864":"\n  i don't stream on twitch, but i follow a lot of twitch streamers !!\n  \n\n   @CourtneyUwU\n  \n  streams on twitch occasionally, so i'll watch her streams. also,\n  \n   @jenchaotic\n  \n  streams as well. other streamers i watch are chilledchaos, dooleynotedgaming, and neekums.\n  ","380865":"\n  yes. needless to say, they're not my friend anymore.\n  ","380866":"\n  well ... i wanted to watch the lord of the rings last night, but apparently the disc drive for my laptop that i got for christmas doesn't work with blu ray discs. :\/ so i'm going to give this disc drive to my friend, and i just bought myself a blu ray disc drive off of amazon.\n  ","380867":"\n  i have a few friends who were in the military, but i think they were mainly in the navy and the marines. either way, it depends on the individual person.\n  ","380868":"\n  i honestly don't remember, i had a few weird tinder stories too but it was in the spring, so i don't recall much of them at this point. i'm like 90% sure it was the facebook guy, though. i remember asking him how he \"triggers\" his mania, and he basically said, \"i close my eyes and focus really hard and i can bring on mania.\"\n  \n  i was like, \"uh... i don't think that's how that works.\" lmao. he was super weird, though. he'd constantly send me photos of his cat and was very \"woe-is-me,\" which is just irritating to me.\n  \n  he's actually a good friend of my coworker, so during the entire ordeal, i was texting her and sending her screenshots of the conversation, and she was in shock at how persistent he was despite me obviously not showing interest at all.\n  ","380869":"\n  yes, i absolutely *love* the cold weather.\n  ","380870":"\n  it's only 2:20pm, so my day kinda just began since i only woke up a few hours ago. it's been fine, though. i have the house to myself today, so i'm taking advantage of the solitude and blasting music, cleaning, and doing all of my laundry.\n  ","380871":"\n  i think i remember who you're talking about? i think you mean the guy who was messaging me on facebook, the one who said he could apparently make himself manic on his own free will, lmfao.\n  \n  i was never interested in him, but he kept on messaging me every day despite me ignoring him half the time. eventually i did tell him i wasn't interested in dating, and he unfriended me immediately.\n  ","380872":"\n  no, i don't believe in love at first sight. what people perceive to be love is actually lust combined with what they want that person to be like, not what they actually are.\n  ","380873":"\n  i used tinder for a few months earlier this year, but i wasn't really interested in it at all. it made me realize i didn't want to get into dating.\n  ","380874":"\n  of course -- people's friendships with each other shouldn't be dictated by what gender they are.\n  ","380875":"\n  i have playlists on spotify, but i don't really advertise them -- not because i purposely want to keep them to myself, but i don't really have a reason to share them.\n  \n  however, whenever i do hear a new song that i like, i love showing it to my friends.\n  ","380876":"\n  \"hi, i'm leigh. i'm tiny but i'll fight you if necessary.\"\n  \n  LOL. just kidding. i really have no idea, i haven't introduced myself to a new person in a long time.\n  ","380877":"\n  listening to good music, hanging out and having fun with my friends, sleeping in on my days off, and playing with the cats.\n  ","380878":"\n  no, not really. i know how to swim but i'm not great at it, especially considering i haven't swam in years.\n  ","380879":"\n  there are some country songs i like, even though i mainly dislike country music as a whole. like \"toes\" and \"chicken fried\" by the zac brown band, haha.\n  ","380880":"\n  i've actually never heard of that before !!\n  ","380881":"\n  yes. :\/ this has been happened a lot over the pasts two months. i've been having random flashbacks and idk why they're happening.\n  ","380882":"\n  honestly, i love netflix. i've watched a lot of netflix original series that i enjoyed, and most of my favorite shows are on netflix.\n  ","380883":"\n  eh, not really. i tend to freeze up in situations like that, like trivia games and whatnot.\n  ","380884":"\n  my job gives us all a holiday bonus, LOL. that's never going to happen, though.\n  ","380885":"\n  i think it's not only his voice, but also his general aesthetic and how he doesn't reveal what he looks like, it all adds into the mystery. rofl.\n  ","380886":"\n  \"leigh, you're going to get out of this situation. you're going to be able to escape, and it might not be for a while, but you have to keep holding onto that hope that things will get better.\"\n  ","380887":"\n  *starts playing corpse*\n  ","380888":"\n  sunny, yet chilly.\n  ","380889":"\n  my friends' support and encouragement.\n  ","380890":"\n  make my own weapons (i'm partial to baseball bats with spikes or barbed wire on them), and go hunting.\n  ","380891":"\n  in certain situations, it can be. especially if the person you're talking to is being rude to you and they won't let down, sometimes being rude towards them in return works well if you need to get out of the conversation.\n  ","380892":"\n  it's much easier for me to name three bad things about myself, rofl. i think i'm manipulative, i have an addictive personality (not in a good way), and i'm selfish af.\n  ","380893":"\n  there was one vacation i took with my friends where i fell into a really bad depressive episode, and i basically spent the entire weekend locked in my hotel room and sleeping because i couldn't handle being around all of my friends.\n  ","380894":"\n  no, that isn't bad. as long as you're taking care of yourself and you're not allowing him to affect your life anymore, it isn't bad to forgive them. everyone has different methods of coping.\n  ","380895":"\n  i literally just recorded myself singing on snapchat and sent it to three of my friends, LOL. i've never done this before and i'm super nervous because my voice sucks, but i stupidly love the song i sang along to.\n  ","380896":"\n  i can't think of any movies, tbh. sequels tend to ruin the original movie anyway, haha.\n  ","380897":"\n  nothing really shocks me anymore, but i met a lot of overly privileged people when i worked in retail & they made huge scenes over the most insignificant things (i.e. coupons not scanning, expired coupons, their own payment method being declined, etc etc).\n  ","380898":"\n  i would travel cross-country.\n  ","380899":"\n  i just started a load of laundry, so i'm going to attempt to be productive today. i haven't done basically anything since christmas eve, haha.\n  ","380900":"\n  that stupid \"oh no\" tiktok sound clip, lmfao.\n  ","380901":"\n  does \"myself\" count? lmao.\n  ","380902":"\n  smoking cigarettes. i smoked a pack a day for basically 10 years, and i quit in september 2019.\n  ","380903":"\n  probably nothing special besides begin going out to eat at restaurants and going to bars again, haha.\n  ","380904":"\n  yes, i do.\n  ","380905":"\n  jail food i suppose, considering school food can be withheld from students who don't have the money to pay for lunch food (which is so f*cked up).\n  ","380906":"\n  when the love you have for someone else is causing you to lessen yourself, and you're not being the best version of yourself. when love is discouraging you from working towards your goals and dreams (like if your partner convinces you not to achieve them), then that's not only a weakness, but toxic af.\n  ","380907":"\n  you can simply ask them.\n  ","380908":"\n  definitely not -- they're humans just like everyone else, with feelings and boundaries and a life outside of their job. i absolutely hate people who treat retail workers\/clerks\/food service workers as \"machines\" as opposed to actual people. it's disrespectful af.\n  ","380909":"\n  coffee -- much needed at the moment, i didn't sleep well last night at all.\n  ","380910":"\n  mental health, psychology in general, music, and various aspects of world history (especially world war II and the holocaust).\n  ","380911":"\n  AP chemistry when i was in high school. my college courses were fairly simple considering they were all within my major and it came easily to me.\n  ","380912":"\n  bojack horseman, you, unbreakable kimmy schmidt, the punisher, and santa clarita diet.\n  ","380913":"\n  i'm doing okay, although i have a slight headache because i drank a lot of wine last night while binge-watching supernatural.\n  \n  i finally made it to season four, though !! only 11 more seasons to go, lmaoo.\n  ","380914":"\n  combination of our genetics and environmental factors.\n  "}}
