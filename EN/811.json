people , i didn t even know where any new people to meet even were . i cried i think everyday day for months . from september through february . and then i would cry once a week , and then once a month , and then eventually not at all . from the outside it probably looked like nothing , because we were just friends and we didn t even really hang out that much . but we talked everyday and i

compromise . your significant other or friends should be able to know and understand what your going through or how you may feel be affected etc . without communication and understanding theres a lot of misunderstandings and conflict which can break trust cause a breakup to happen . sit down and talk to those people and tell them how you are feeling , make sure they understand or reassure you both got it and will work together to fix whatever issue it may be . also if there s zero communication then it s mainly one person who is working hard to maintain those friendships and relationships which results in a lot of emotional days and hard feelings , which can just become a very toxic and negative place you re in so it s best to just let go of that person and move on .","750667":"i have believed in god since i was little bc my parents grew up in the catholic church teachings and beliefs and growing up i kinda followed that path as well . however there are some things i dont agree

themselves . if they do succeed , immigration laws and ice would eventually find them and force them to return back to wherever they come from . get a passport green card or visa whatever the term is

haven t really been posting much lately cause i ve just been thinking a lot . i love the time around new years because even though literally nothing is different , we re all still the same people with all the same problems , it feels good to have a whole year ahead of myself and to think about what it could be . i know this year was not what anyone expected and everyone s plans went into the trash so it might be hard to make any plans or think about how this year could be , but regardless of how crazy things get around us , there are still things that we can control . our behaviors , mindsets , how we treat ourselves and those around us , our habits . . . it s easy to feel like there s no point in changing or growing when your future feels so uncertain , but actually the future is always uncertain . we re just more aware of that fact right now . i ve been thinking about how i view people and the world and how i can change that to a more positive view while still being realistic lol , dealing with some anxiety inducing mindsets that i ve gotten so used to experiencing but am realizing they re actually something i can change , thinking about how i want relationships with family and friends to be better and what type of conversations i need to have or effort i need to put in to do that , thinking about what effect i have had on the world and what effect god wants me to have on the world and how i can better serve him in the work that i do , thinking about the lifestyle i live and how i want to have a healthier more organized one while still having time to relax and have balance in my life . i encourage you to think about these things for yourself and how you can grow this year regardless of how things go . if we want to make a better world , that starts with each individual person doing and being their best .","750854":"what are you even talking about ?","750855":"mhm","750856":"no , as long as the soil is moist you should be fine","750857":"water polo . i
