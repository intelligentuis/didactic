Money doesn't buy happiness.\n  ","866459":"\n  oh that's pretty simple. If you are hallucinating then you're doing it out of confidence. Other people may view you being hallucinated out of this reality yet you're engaged in a new reality which they cannot understand except you and chose to accept this new reality. It's that inner experience, within a world, a society how Insanity was created in them. Fear is an illusion, and that is what causes hallucinations. But beyond that fear somewhere down the road is the truth. Being crazy has its emotions, actions, feelings. People who does unthinkable hatred, crimes and mischief. Which leads to a next question, what is a choice from there? Living in fear and staying crazy? Or accepting those fears to find the truth and finding the wisdom in the heart? For any experience to occur in life there must be a choice first understand it or not, even if you find a reason for why things happen the way they happen. It will not change anything in reality because things are the way they are, what matters is your choice.\n  ","866460":"\n  I try to keep good habits most of the time.

Don't wait until you have 100 subs then decide to tone back on video rate. (But if something happens later on the effects the ability to keep up- the earlier the better still stands!)\n  \n  2: When you get the mean comments, just delete them! If they\n  \n  keep appearing from the same person don't be afraid to BLOCK THEM! There's nothing wrong in\n  \n  protecting yourself! Also there's been an increase in s*x channel bots in small channels. Just report & delete.\n  \n  3: Figure out what you want to do for the channel or if you know, just go! First few videos you may feel a bit awkward or scared. But the awesome thing of starting from scratch is you get practice time before you get traction- you'll be a lot more comfortable by then!\n  \n  4. A mistake (imo) that I see when a channel changes to something else (say going from reactor to gamer) is announcing it. Slowly merge- don't announce! Subs won't hop off and you'll have an easier time with the YT algorithm with gaining subs interested in the new content as the previous ones leave. The higher the sub amount the quicker the rate of new subs get. Once you hit 100 you're usually set! Just be sure to do your best to keep up the same schedule you've been using.\n  \n  5: ALLOW yourself mental breaks as needed!! One thing I recommend is to make an extra video every now and then (not all at once to prevent burnout by that sh*t is real) and if you're gone for awhile you can just post those during your break. You can set a video to be published at a certain date even years ahead without a premiere. You can change it if you get back from break earlier than the date the videos release date to hold it for when\/if you need it in the future!\n  \n  If you have anymore questions just send a message directly to me via any of the social medias connected with my carrd link on my profile here.\n  \n  Best of luck! \u2764\n  ","866687":"\n  Absolutely yes!

How could she have been dying without even knowing? Without a single thought she was even feeling sick? Smiling happily, just like every day I had known until that day she had just left, gone, never going to return, from something I never knew could happen.

I have 2 channels: \"Raindrop\", and \"Warriors\" about a series.\n  \n  The 1st video that boomed on subs and viewers was \"Confessions\" on the Warrior series. It Includes what I found strange or disagree with in Warriors, Those videos are commonly searched and since \"confessions\" sounds like a bit of drama will show, people click it more. This is good, but is also bad: More views, but More likely to cause fire in the comments.\n  \n  To prevent arguments or thrown insults, I put the confessions logically and calmly, making sure no anger will show in the video. Any comments that would cause arguments, i.e., \"You are stupid to think that-\" esp. If cursing is present, I delete then. I've had 2 or 3 of these, all deleted as they appeared.\n  \n  1 person in the comments said they didn't agree on 1 and why. Those I will interact with, polite debates are more likely, which makes it look better.\n  \n  People enjoy the invite to tell about something they are proud of, so I like giving them a chance to by questions about them shown in the video and interact with them.\n  \n  I try to keep consistent with videos, even if it's rare. I don't want to add 5\/week, then drop to 1\/month.\n  \n  Of course, all channels are different. My Warriors one has 30 subscribers currently, prob. low due to uploads spread so far, but I feel it's a good trade-off; I have subs that I enjoy interacting with, opposed to having 100s of subs that aren't easy to interact with.\n  \n  Vlogs and fursuit-kinds of videos I can't help with, though. I'm sorry about that! I never have time to do vlogs, and for fursuit videos my only good camera is my phone, and I'm still waiting on getting a stand or even a selfie stick that I would record them easier.\n  \n  For frequency, I'd say to start at a slow pace, maybe once per 1-2 weeks(?), then add them more frequently until you get a feel for what's right for you.\n  \n  I hope this helped you!
