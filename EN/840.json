I think I used to think that the two can\u2019t exist at the same time. I spent a lot of my life repressing my feelings and ignoring my pain. I wanted people to think I was put together and I was okay and that there was nothing wrong with me. A couple years ago I had a bit of an awakening to my own pain and I felt like I wanted to shout it from the rooftops. I wanted everyone to know I am in pain! I don\u2019t have everything together! I\u2019m not perfect! People have wronged me very deeply! I wanted to make my pain real. I wanted it to matter. And I think in the process of doing that, I started to over-identify with it. I started to think \u201cI AM my pain\u201d rather than \u201cI am IN pain\u201d. I think that was necessary at the time because of my natural inclination to dismiss myself. But recently I decided I don\u2019t want to hold onto pain so tightly. I used to think that \u201ccheering yourself up\u201d was a hoax because if you have a problem, it\u2019s a problem and cheering yourself up is not gonna change it. That is true, but I\u2019m learning that life is not so black and white. You can be going through extreme pain and still have moments of happiness. In the midst of a tragedy you can feel gratitude for the good in the world. In an extremely stressful time you can decide to do something fun and have fun and be carefree for a moment. None of those things will change what happened. None of those things will fix your problems or the problems of the world, but they can bring a little bit of light to the darkness. Turning on a lamp when it\u2019s dark doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s nighttime. Turning on a flashlight doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re ignoring the dark. It just makes it easier to continue on through the night. You need some light in the dark to be able to keep going. It\u2019s okay to turn a light on. And we can\u2019t forget that it can never be so dark that light cannot pierce through. Even in the dead of night the stars and the moon still shine. \ud83d\udcab\n  ","901342":"\n  Just the photos with the girls or ?\n  ","901343":"\n  About what specifically?\n  ","901344":"\n  Hi\n  ","901345":"\n  Youtube.com\/cimorellitheband\n  \n  Youtube.com\/laurencimorelli\n  ","901346":"\n  \ud83d\udc40\n  ","901347":"\n  Have a great sunday hun\n  ","901348":"\n  I think in a way I'll always prefer either the Beach or the lake considering I grew up in california and was surrounded by folsom lake and then when we moved to Malibu we were always at the beach either hanging out and enjoying the sun or filming a youtube video, or meeting up with others in the industry to collaborate\n  ","901349":"\n  I wasnt involved with going against guidelines and I'm pretty sure I didnt eat at specifically  his pizza place.
