normally occurred in a relationship context, but i've also been heartbroken over lost friendships as well.\n  \n  honestly, i haven't learned much from them besides that maybe i'm a much stronger

things, and if they don't believe me or think i'm loyal, then that would be a conversation worth having.\n  ","401485":"\n  depends on what it is i'm arguing about, tbh. if it's a topic that i'm solid about, then i can be perceived as stubborn because of how much i do believe in my stance. however, if i do recognize that there are flaws in my argument, then i have no issue with confronting the person again and reconsidering what i previously said.\n  ","401486":"\n  at this point in my life and in our relationship, probably not. i would end the relationship if he went behind my back and cheated on me -- not simply because of the physical aspect of having s*x with someone else, but more because it would be an indication that he doesn't care about me or my feelings as much as he says he does, especially to go out of his way to betray me in such a way.\n  ","401487":"\n  i already touched upon this in my last answer. it's something we considered a long time ago, but then reconsidered. we're just monogamous right now.\n  ","401488":"\n  no, quite the opposite actually. he's always been incredibly understanding and reassuring of my mental health problems, and he understands that my insecurities stem from my own past and ingrained thoughts that i've never been good enough.\n  ","401489":"\n  no, it's something we reconsidered a while ago. i wouldn't be comfortable with being in a polyamorous relationship and it would only make my jealousy worse, considering i already have my own issues with self-esteem and abandonment fears.\n  ","401490":"\n  polyamory has been around for far longer than feminism has been around, actually.\n  \n  and yes, i did say that in the past. i'm in a monogamous relationship, but i was open at one point to polyamory if i felt that my partner wasn't happy s*xually with me.\n  ","401491":"\n  ah, okay -- i thought you meant \"allowing\" or \"not allowing\" your partner to do stuff in a general sense, which is obviously controlling behavior. in monogamous relationships, then yes -- sleeping with someone who isn't your partner can be construed as cheating.\n  \n  i don't personally think there's anything wrong with polyamory, but it is what it is. obviously we have no common ground here.\n  ","401492":"\n  we met through a mutual friend when i was 17 years old.\n  ","401493":"\n  i feel limited at times, as if i'm being held back from doing what it is i need to do to be a successful partner, and that's largely due to my mental health issues. i've always sought to be a better person than i have been previously, but i know that sometimes i'm misguided and can fall short.\n  \n  i do genuinely believe he can find someone better than me, lmaoo. that comes from my own insecurities about myself, though.\n  ","401494":"\n  ???\n  \n  when did i say that monogamy was ab*sive ... ? i'm in a monogamous relationship myself, lol. if you're in a monogamous relationship, or a polyamorous relationship, then consent is crucial to pretty much anything. but the idea of \"not allowing\" your partner to do certain things in their life is controlling (i wasn't talking about going out and having s*x with others). your partner isn't your property and you don't hold the reigns to their life.\n  \n  we will have to agree to disagree, but please bare in mind that polyamorous relationships have always existed and will continue to exist, and as long as the people involved in those relationships are happy and consenting, then it shouldn't be anyone else's concern.\n  ","401495":"\n  i agree. that's why i said most forms of jealousy are toxic, not that it makes a person toxic. i experience jealousy in a lot of different ranges of my life, and yes -- it's very unhealthy for me, but it doesn't make me a toxic person.\n  ","401496":"\n  we've been together for 10 years.\n  ","401497":"\n  i had an active plan for s*icide, and it scared me. instead of acting on my plan, i decided to reach out and see my primary care physician to prescribe me medication, refer me to a psychiatrist, and assign me counseling.\n  ","401498":"\n  well, if i'm not a great partner then he certainly hasn't informed me, lmaoo. i'd like to think that i'm a good partner to my boyfriend, but i'm also hyper-critical of myself and believe that i can always do more, be more.\n  ","401499":"\n  4-ish

definitely lead to problems in marriage that might end up in divorce. if you're insecure with your relationship or not trusting of your spouse to the point where you're jealous of other people in their lives, then that's very unhealthy.\n  ","401501":"\n  no, people who cheat in relationships are not evil people. evil has a *very* negative connotation and is usually reserved for those who are senseless, remorseless k*llers and people in that regard. on the other hand, those who cheat on their partners aren't evil -- misguided and in the wrong, of course, but definitely not evil.\n  ","401502":"\n  yes, that is indeed the purpose of askfm. i've been using this website for going on 6-7 years, at this point. lol.\n  ","401503":"\n  in a healthy relationship, you don't \"allow\" or \"not allow\" your partner to do things -- that's overly controlling and can be a red flag for ab*sive behavior. your partner should have the freedom to do what to do. in terms of polyamorous relationships, it isn't the idea of \"allowing\" someone to date another person. it's consensual activity and both parties are free to date whomever they choose. people aren't property.\n  \n  in addition, being effeminate and emotional does not make someone \"less of a man\" either. we're all human beings, we're all creatures of emotion, and we're all free to express ourselves in whichever way we choose. if the idea of a man being emotional is off-putting to you, then that's your prerogative in terms of dating. but you shouldn't judge other people for the way they behave or express themselves simply because it isn't your exact lifestyle.\n  ","401504":"\n  uh, are you asking me personally or the anon? lmaoo.\n  \n  i have mental illnesses as well, which includes major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder (in remission, for the most part), and borderline personality disorder.\n  ","401505":"\n  i don't really know how to answer this because you're giving me little information. however, i can say this -- relationships are built off of communication and trust, and there's no use in blaming someone for something that happened in the past that you cannot change in the now.\n  \n  the best thing to do, in any circumstance, is to sit down with your partner and have a serious discussion about your communication issues, and how to make them better. which includes your hesitance to talk about your mental health and everything in between.\n  ","401506":"\n  my eyes look so pretty after i take my makeup off, lmaoo.\n  ","401507":"\n  i don't recall most of my dreams when i awaken, unfortunately. i only have vague ideas of them that soon disappear from memory after about 10 or so minutes.\n  ","401508":"\n  it's unfortunate that you believe in these things, because toxic masculinity is the source of high rates of mental illness in men -- mainly because it isn't seen as \"manly\" for men to discuss their feelings, which in turn leads to higher rates of male s*icide.\n  \n  you're correct in that no one takes it seriously, but it isn't something only \"moronic\" people care about. it's studied upon extensively by academic scholars and can be a great source of distress for several different types of men.\n  ","401509":"\n  (cont) ...

could still text those closest to me & talk to them, and i don't necessarily need the internet to do that.\n  ","401719":"\n  \"one more light\" by linkin park.\n  \n  i didn't like it at first, up until chester bennington passed away. then it acquired a whole new meaning & i can't listen to it without tearing up.\n  ","401720":"\n  i'm not really all that picky. i've been drinking starbucks' french roast lately, but i also like gevalia and caf\u00e9 bustelo.\n  ","401721":"\n  i'm not a fan of christmas movies.\n  ","401722":"\n  i'm personally a fan of it, considering i came from an ab*sive household and want to be as far away from my parents' house as possible.\n  \n  i also think everyone should experience, at least once, the feeling of being independent from their families so that they can find themselves outside of the image their family has set for them.\n  ","401723":"\n  red -- specifically dark red, like blood red or mahogany. it's always been one of my favorite colors.\n  ","401724":"\n  i've been wanting to get a writing quill tattooed on my right forearm for a few years now.\n  ","401725":"\n  i guess today, haha. i'm going into manhattan on tuesday to see a comedy show with one of my close friends & it should be a lot of fun.\n  ","401726":"\n  a space or corner for self-care purposes -- whether that's a makeup desk, or a desk with comforting items, or an altar with crystals and trinkets, or even your own bed with candles and\/or melts or incense. as long as that space comforts you, that's all that matters.\n  ","401727":"\n  i like headphones because they're more encompassing, you can really get lost in the music. but i normally wear regular earphones because i only use them at work and i also need to be wary of whenever my work phone rings. i don't think i would be able to hear my phone ringing if i had headphones on.\n  ","401728":"\n  lol, thank you for asking me my own question ~~\n  \n  i prefer fresh scents, as i find that floral scents can be too heavy at times. i use fresh linen air fresheners and detergents, and my body wash is coconut milk & jasmine. my shampoo smells of amber, but i bought it because it's supposed to enhance brown hair, not necessarily because of its scent.\n  ","401729":"\n  no, it's quite easy to make me feel uncomfortable. i don't like when people get too close to me and i am very wary and paranoid of others' tones of voice.\n  ","401730":"\n  fresh balsam & stress relief (eucalyptus and spearmint) from bath and body works.\n  ","401731":"\n  ahh, i haven't !! i didn't know the trailer came out -- i'll have to check it out. i loved the first season.\n  ","401732":"\n  it's super tiny & sits on top of a table, so no.\n  ","401733":"\n  it totally does, haha. i've always wanted moments like that, and the closest i've ever gotten to that was when my boyfriend and i have traveled out east to montauk, new york, and spent the mornings on our hotel patio overlooking the ocean before embarking on our daily adventures.\n  ","401734":"\n  in terms of an actual television show, it was \"deadly women\" on hulu. i love crime shows.\n  \n  the last actual thing i watched that wasn't really a show was dan soder's new comedy special that was on HBO.\n  ","401735":"\n  i love the scent of real christmas trees, but they're annoying to maintain. in my house now, we have a small fake tree (mostly because of the cats, haha).\n  ","401736":"\n  the area around my bed -- my bed itself, my tapestry, and the string lights hung above my bed. it's so calming to me.\n  ","401737":"\n

comes to mind. just having a sense of tranquility and intimacy on an emotional level.\n  ","401738":"\n  you obviously didn't get the memo where i asked for light-hearted questions only.\n  \n  i'm not up for philosophical questions. i just want something to distract me.\n  ","401739":"\n  tbh, probably an animal. human society is sh*t and humans have so much contemplation as to the purpose of life and inner feelings, and most other animals don't experience that. they live off of basic instinct.\n  ","401740":"\n  this is a boring answer, but probably a cat or a dog. when with the right family, they're treated so well & spend their days sleeping, eating, and playing. it's simple and joyous.\n  ","401741":"\n  i never thought that much into it, and i'm not in the correct mental state

people who are deemed lesser-than and inferior to others solely due to the color of their skin, their gender, their sexual orientation, their health or disability, their religion, etc etc.\n  \n  it concerns me that there is little being done to bring justice to those who have experienced wrongdoing, and how people are given little resources to better their lives in a society where it's difficult enough already to sustain oneself.\n  ","401744":"\n  \"will all of this struggle be worth it in the end?\"\n  ","401745":"\n  depends on what it is and who it's with. i don't like sharing most things

olives.\n  ","401759":"\n  idk, i never paid much attention to celebrities' bodies.\n  ","401760":"\n  loving yourself is *so* much more important than being loved by someone else. your happiness and

upstate new york, especially during the autumn and winter months.\n  ","401763":"\n  oh, absolutely. i would be able to afford to actually buy a house instead of rent, i could pay off all of my debt, i could actually go on a vacation, etc etc.\n  ","401764":"\n  oh, of course. what else is askfm good for? lmaoo.\n  ","401765":"\n  thank you. \u2661\n  \n  i don't know you, but i hope you're doing well too. you deserve a loving and healthy relationship.\n  ","401766":"\n  that was exactly it.\n  \n  but because i was young, naive, traumatized from past ab*se, and looking for affection -- i accepted it wholeheartedly. i was vulnerable and he took advantage of that. i didn't realize how wrong it was until years later.\n  \n  also -- my parents did nothing about it either. they accepted him into our home, knowing how old he was and thought that it was normal.\n  ","401767":"\n  the worst part, besides the obvious fact that he dated a literal child when he was an adult, was that he went out of his way to message me almost 10 years later to try to get into my pants again.\n  \n  i was livid. he was a disgusting human being.\n  ","401768":"\n  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  \n  in

how wrong it was until i was older.\n  ","401771":"\n  chicken, i guess. i usually eat grilled chicken because it's healthier but i absolutely love spicy, crispy chicken sandwiches.\n  ","401772":"\n

health was deteriorating & i didn't know how to handle it.\n  ","401775":"\n  i usually ignore them. it isn't worth the energy to entertain people who are arrogant, especially if they're so persistent and stubborn in their views that they won't listen to anything else.\n  ","401776":"\n  a few months ago. i was terrified for myself, for my future, for my own mental health. my thoughts were too overwhelming and disconcerting, and i was afraid for my own safety.\n  ","401777":"\n  rain scenes are always so tranquil to me.\n  ","401778":"\n  i was overjoyed the first night i was able to spend in my own house, sleeping in my own bedroom away from my parents. it was a sense of independence that i didn't experience before, and i was overjoyed at the sensation that i was finally living life according to my own terms with no one to answer to except myself.\n  ","401779":"\n  uh, zero. at least when it comes to my primary care physician. i only ever see her if i'm seriously ill, i.e. if i have the flu or something regular OTC medication cannot treat.\n  \n  i see my psychiatrist, on the other hand, every 3 months.\n  ","401780":"\n  writing, reading, photography, painting, perusing social media, sleeping, and sometimes seeing my friends (if i'm in the right mood for it).\n  ","401781":"\n  i purchase new clothes perhaps every few months or so? but it's only one or two pieces, if i need things like new leggings or jeans or a shirt or two. i don't clear out my wardrobe -- i have had the same clothing for the past 5-6 years, lol.\n  ","401782":"\n  my inbox is completely empty. ask me some questions ~~\n  ","401783":"\n  i don't believe i do? i don't know, i never pay attention to the ads, lmaoo.\n  ","401784":"\n  in that case, then i don't really believe that the person had the grounds to invade their privacy, so to speak. it's one thing to know a person intimately and understand that they're acting unusual, and therefore have suspicions that they're cheating and act accordingly. but it's something else completely to log onto their social media accounts solely because their partner wasn't responding quickly enough to text messages.\n  ","401785":"\n  my birthday was a few weeks ago, so i received two $25 gift cards for free from various family members !!\n  \n  i ended up using them both already for various cold and cough medicines, since i've been sick. lmaoo.\n  ","401786":"\n  being around my family brings out my insecurities, tbh. sometimes they wind up pointing out certain flaws about myself, which makes me even more self-conscious. my mother has a bad habit of indicating whether i've gained or lost weight and even goes into specifics as to where on my body the fat is, and it makes me horribly dysphoric.\n  ","401787":"\n  this is one of those gray area things, where both parties are wrong to a certain degree. however, i always side with the person who has been cheated on -- solely because most people are trusting their gut instinct that something is wrong, otherwise they wouldn't feel justified in invading their partner's privacy to check their messages in the first place.\n  \n  the person who cheated is, obviously, wrong. but i also think that not trusting your partner to not cheat is unfortunately common, and while invading your partner's privacy is wrong in most cases, a case such as this where their feelings were confirmed would justify going through the phone.\n  \n  this has happened to a few friends of mine, where they felt something was wrong so they went through their partner's phone while they were sleeping and discovered that they were messaging other people and\/or cheating. they knew that going through their phone was wrong in the first place, but they wouldn't have done it had they not already had an idea that something suspicious was going on.\n  ","401788":"\n  yes, i wholeheartedly believe that there can still be friendship after love. after a breakup, a person should take the proper steps necessary to be sure that they're over the person they've dated, so perhaps remaining friends with their ex right away may not work. however, i know of a lot of people who have rekindled their friendships with their exes after the fact, and their friendship is perfectly fine.\n  ","401789":"\n  i accidentally cracked the screen of an ipad my boyfriend bought me back in 2011. :\/ it still worked, but the crack was pretty bad.\n  ","401790":"\n  i believe i'm a slow eater, because everyone else around me always finishes their meals much faster than i do, lol.\n  ","401791":"\n  my boyfriend, without a doubt. i'm comfortable with telling him virtually anything and he has always been my go-to person whenever something good or bad has happened in my life.\n  ","401792":"\n  no, probably not -- that sounds a hell of a lot like flirting to me, with the intention of things going further. if i found out that my boyfriend was leading other women or men on like that, i would have to sit down with him and discuss it with him to find out his motive behind doing such things.\n  ","401793":"\n  i don't believe any of my books are valuable, actually. they're all books that i picked up from the bookstore or bought off of thriftbooks.com. a few are from amazon, as well.\n  ","401794":"\n  i'm exhausted 99% of the time, tbh. both mentally and physically.\n  ","401795":"\n  i don't follow people upon request, sorry.\n  ","401796":"\n  no, i'm not wearing anything yellow. i'm wearing a gray heather tee shirt, blue sweatpants, and a blue zip-up hoodie.\n  ","401797":"\n  4-ish years. i had just turned 14 years old, and he was 18 years old.\n  ","401798":"\n  spinach dip with whole grain chips. i wasn't terribly hungry at all because of how sick i've been, but i wanted something warm and satisfying.\n  ","401799":"\n  i think i legit slept for at least 12 hours last night. i didn't wake up in the middle of the night once at all, and my roommate had to knock on my door multiple times to make sure i was okay. lmaoo.\n  ","401800":"\n  i don't ask my spam to myself, lol. my spam is for the people i follow.\n  ","401801":"\n  no, i never felt obligated to stay in any of my relationships. i also only broke up with one person, lol. my relationship prior to that one, my girlfriend had broken up with me.\n  \n  when i broke up with my ex, it was because i realized that i didn't actually love him. i just loved the idea of him, and i didn't like spending time with him as much as i convinced myself that i was. he also lied to me on multiple occasions, and it was a toxic relationship considering our age difference. i didn't stay out of obligation, so i broke up with him.\n  ","401802":"\n  no, that's not wrong at all. if you don't love him to the same degree that he loves you & you don't feel as if there's anything further you can do to strengthen the relationship, then there's nothing wrong with ending the relationship.\n  \n  you need to look after your own happiness, and if you're not happy, then you need to make the necessary changes in order to attain happiness again. there's no shame in that. don't stay with someone out of guilt -- they deserve to know the truth, as hard as it would be to hear.\n  ","401803":"\n  LOL. honestly, i don't know how your body functions but if you're leaving a mess all over the seat, then that's disgusting. at least my roommates have the decency to clean up after themselves.\n  ","401804":"\n  i also wipe my own ass after i take a sh*t -- what's your point? lol.\n  ","401805":"\n  i absolutely *hate* cleaning the bathroom, lmaoo. it's satisfying once i'm done, but i find it so gross.\n  \n  i clean the house 1-2 times per week, which includes vacuuming, wiping down the counters, mopping the floor, dusting the furniture, etc etc. we try to vacuum, in particular, at least twice per week because of the cats.\n  ","401806":"\n  i just finished cleaning the house & doing the dishes, y'all should ask me some questions !!\n  ","401807":"\n  yeah, movies about the united states & the justice system are so far removed from the truth. there is little justice for many people, especially minority groups in the united states, and often offenders walk free from their crimes. especially if they're lawyers, politicians, or basically anyone who's in a position of power and has wealth.\n  ","401808":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree -- not only in the united states, but the society in the world as a whole. there's a deeply-rooted sense of toxic masculinity and patriarchy that have pervaded society for centuries.\n  ","401809":"\n  i actually don't support the death penalty at all, but i'm all in support of vigilante justice. haha.\n  \n  i think the death penalty is an easy way out for criminals, and they deserve to rot away in solitary confinement instead.\n  ","401810":"\n  not really, no. i've never been a youtuber -- i just watch gaming videos, haha.\n  \n  i think it is important, however, to try to engage yourself with other youtubers by commenting on posts, and promoting yourself on other social media pages.\n  ","401811":"\n  i haven't heard about it until just now.\n  \n  i'm glad that the suspects were k*lled, though. the victim did not deserve what happened to her and maybe her family can get some closure now.\n  ","401812":"\n  yes, that's another thing too. often women aren't heard & they're also afraid to speak out about the assault in fear of others not believing them (which happens in most cases, smh). it also leaves them vulnerable to another assault, and women are afraid to voice their trauma because they might be assaulted again, either by the same person or someone else.\n  \n  it's absolutely disgusting how backwards the system is in the united states. it's like the victims are being punished instead of the offenders. there's more emphasis on the \"tarnished image\" of the accused than there is on the well being of the survivor.\n  ","401813":"\n  there are r*pists all over the united states. the justice system does absolutely nothing for the victims\/survivors of the assault, and often the r*pists walk free or get minimal jail time.\n  ","401814":"\n  women aren't afraid of sex. women are afraid of being r*ped and m*rdered by men.\n  ","401815":"\n  i'm absolutely terrible at both singing and dancing.\n  ","401816":"\n  no, i've never been interested in the whole miss universe\/miss america thing, or any sort of beauty pageant.\n  ","401817":"\n  home remedies have never worked for me. i can drink all of the ginger tea i want, it's not going to make me feel better (as an example).\n  \n  in the past, i've always used saline spray, but the type of illness i have rn requires more care than just something for my sinuses.\n  ","401818":"\n  i don't have the flu, and if i got the flu shot now, it wouldn't be effective (assuming i do develop the flu).\n  ","401819":"\n  considering i need money to survive every day, and it's the foundation behind my food, shelter, and health -- yes. money matters to me very much.\n  ","401820":"\n  freezing cold, coughing up phlegm, and sneezing like a mo'fucka. i went to the drug store and picked up robitussin, dayquil, nyquil, and cough drops -- so i'm hoping to nip this cold\/cough\/thing in the bud, because i've been feeling this way since tuesday.\n  ","401821":"\n  i don't believe it's hypocritical at first glance, because you simply don't know a person's situation and the reason why they don't have a job in the first place. they may not have a job because of other obligations, i.e. taking care of family members or children, being disabled, etc etc.\n  \n  generally, i do believe that if someone has the capability to hold a job and they're not preoccupied by being a parent or a caregiver, then they may want to join the workforce, even just part-time. it's good to be doing something with your life and it will make you feel more productive. but if you don't *need* a job because you're financially secure, then you're not obligated to have one.\n  ","401822":"\n  you're sending this to multiple people, and that's a bit weird. then again, when i was 13 years old like you, i always did look up to older individuals for validation as well.\n  ","401823":"\n  i don't really believe in luck, so neither. i've gone through both terrible things and great things, and the reason why i've felt accomplished in my endeavors is because i've kept pushing forward despite my circumstances.\n  ","401824":"\n  in the united states, getting a college education is hella expensive, and the reason why some people only earn a high school diploma is because they cannot afford college. tuition is normally tens of thousands of dollars, and when you take out a loan for college tuition, you're normally paying it back for 10-15 years per month.\n  \n  it has nothing to do with the fact that some people may be willingly uneducated. most people *want* a college education, but they don't have the means to do so.\n  ","401825":"\n  i know absolutely nothing about the architecture industry.\n  ","401826":"\n  being a physician apparently has the highest salary in the united states, followed by architects, lawyers, and engineers.\n  ","401827":"\n  i don't know anyone who's wealthy or anything, but i have a few acquaintances who had rough beginnings and worked themselves higher and higher until they reached their goals and established themselves successfully, both personally and professionally.\n  ","401828":"\n  yeah, i use my regular phone camera sometimes because the quality is much better than the quality through snapchat.\n  ","401829":"\n  probably one of my old coworkers who has been working towards her PhD. she has a plethora of knowledge just sitting in her head, she's very intelligent and can verbalize her thoughts and opinions well, and her writing is on point.\n  ","401830":"\n  definitely not, lmaoo. i'm basically average in terms of intelligence and my finances.\n  ","401831":"\n  i used to be quite submissive when it came to my perspectives, my interactions with other people, etc etc. i was very non-confrontational. but as i've grown older, i've learned to grasp the idea of being forthcoming -- not really dominant in a sense, but definitely more sturdy and stubborn in the way i present myself.\n  ","401832":"\n  i've never really been able to pinpoint why. i have generalized anxiety disorder, so random things like driving and talking on the phone are a few of the things that make my anxiety spike.\n  ","401833":"\n  aw, thank you !! i hope you're having a great weekend too ~~\n  ","401834":"\n  hi, i am one of those people ~~\n  \n  sometimes, people experience phone anxiety and find it difficult to talk to others on the phone. i'm only comfortable talking to my boyfriend, best friend, and parents on the phone, and the idea of talking to anyone else gives me major anxiety.\n  ","401835":"\n  somewhat, yes. it took me a long time to learn to trust my boyfriend, and my lack of trust of people in general triggered a lot of paranoia (both warranted and unwarranted).\n  ","401836":"\n  even though he was the mayor of new york city for quite some time, i'm not all too familiar with his political\/social stances.\n  ","401837":"\n  yeah, i have major trust issues. i suppose it all stems from my childhood with my parents -- i learned early on that i could not trust them with my personal things, because often they invaded my privacy and would use the private information they learned against me.\n  ","401838":"\n  it's been all right so far. i've only been awake for around 2-3 hours, and i've been sitting at my laptop perusing various websites for christmas shopping, drinking coffee, and listening to music.\n  \n  i have to go to my parents' house later, but i'm still pretty sick so i'm debating on cancelling on them since i don't want to spread my germs around their house, especially since my mother's immune system is so low. i also have to go to the bank and pharmacy, but i'm hoping i feel better enough in a few hours to gain the motivation to go. :\/\n  ","401839":"\n  i would simply cut them out of my life completely. i have the ability to detach myself just as easily as i can attach myself, especially when coming upon the realization that they're not reciprocating my levels of commitment and energy.\n  ","401840":"\n  both, depending on my mood and how i've been feeling on that particular day. i know that rationally, i need to act on things that bother me but there have been other times when i've tried to ignore or suppress those feelings because i feel too overwhelmed to handle them.\n  ","401841":"\n  yes, i do have an addictive personality in that i become obsessed easily with certain things, as well as people. i've jumped from addiction to addiction throughout my life, between self-destructive methods of coping to drugs to alcohol to smoking.\n  \n  i also have the tendency to become overly attached to certain people, and that's mainly because of my borderline personality disorder.\n  ","401842":"\n  yes !! i've hung out with courtney (she used to be @\/courrtana on here when she was still active). we both lived in new york at the time, so we hung out twice. :'))\n  ","401843":"\n  no, i'm not. i'm only buying gifts for my IRL friends and family.\n  ","401844":"\n  etsy is a website you can visit to purchase handmade, unique products from self-sufficient small businesses and artists. you're directly dealing with an individual or group of people instead of a large corporation.\n  \n  it's incredibly versatile and it's a great website to visit if you're looking for customized gifts for the holidays, birthdays, etc etc.\n  ","401845":"\n  most of the shops i bought from actually still have sales going on, so i did save some money here and there.\n  \n  i didn't do any cyber monday shopping because i was at work all day, and honestly, i totally forgot about it. lmaoo.\n  ","401846":"\n  like nothing i could have ever dreamed about, in the very beginning. alongside the obvious infatuation, i felt completely loved and supported in all possible ways and garnered a feeling of safety unlike anything i've ever experienced before. i felt understood and validated, like my thoughts and feelings actually mattered for once, and there was a consideration of my emotions and a valid response that i wasn't familiar with.\n  \n  we have similar interests and passions, and those

me on a personal level -- whereas everyone else in my life was quick to brush off my insecurities and mental illnesses because it was too much of a burden on them. he's had an innate understanding of my struggles from when i was a child through deep conversations, and instead of distancing himself because he didn't know how to handle it, he pushed forward and opened himself up to methods by which he could make things easier for me.\n  \n  we've gone through hell and back together, although that's a cliche way to really put it. we've endured struggle, addiction, death, as well as celebrations together. we've hit milestones together in terms of graduations and have watched people come and go from each other's lives, and he has been the one of the few people in my life who have been there through everything.\n  \n  he has inspired passion in me and encouraged me to delve deep into my craft -- writing. he's always been my number one fan and makes me so deeply proud of my writing, and

are both college-educated, only high school-educated, and who have dropped out of high school. there isn't much of a difference between them all.\n  \n  even though i have a college degree, i have an hourly job, lol. it's hard to actually find a job that's salaried unless you have much more than entry-level experience.\n  ","402210":"\n  personality has always been more important to me.
