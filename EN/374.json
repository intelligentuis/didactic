everything about me ?","346837":"i m done now","346838":"can be hard at times .","346839":"not admitting to that one","346840":"remember when i admitted to having s x with someone that is taken ? ? ? ? how am i being in denial ? y all didn t find out by others ? haha what is this person on about ?","346841":"how is that denial ? ? ? ? you guys are something else lol","346842":"not everyone needs to know my full name or what is happening . stop being weird .","346843":"it s creepy how they just wrote my full name . i won t write that in my bio at all . i don t need to be branded a cheater or that someone else is cheating with me .","346844":"most likely eggsy . got that vibe with the awful , awful message . guess someone broke up with her again . it s literally the only time she comes out and plays . also the nonstop messages of repeating themselves over and over again . resorting to name calling .","346845":"i know . done trying to justify anything . even if i said x , y , z everything would be hypocritical bullshit to them . make everything much worse etc","346846":"not that ? you guys always lie to me about sending money . surprised kevin even did today .","346847":"i don t feel that way . they just want me to be a miserable c nt like them .","346848":"whatever lol","346849":"this doesn t even make sense now . fall for what ? stop trying so hard , man .","346850":"the shit you are writing isnt even about him or her anymore . you don t know all of my life either . stop acting like you know every single thing about me . don t you have anything better to do with your time instead of harassing me ? this isn t the way to share opinions , beliefs , morals . it doesn t hold me accountable calling me fat and using other things against me . you don t know anything about him either . again , blaming the girl for everything yet again . but oops . i can t mention that lol this just isn t the way to get the point across and you know it . so yes . it s being an asshole . grow up and focus on yourself too . what about failed relationships you had ? bet they were all your fault since always putting your business where it doesn t belong . if i was the one getting cheated on would you be saying the same thing ? probably . . since you are all about hatred over new and old things ! never letting anything go . always needing to bitch nonstop about something . have a nice life .","346851":"you guys are such assholes","346852":"apparently not","346853":"just using the same shape foundation but everything would be new so i m going with no . just like tearing down a deeded house and building a new one there in the same foundation doesn t make it the old house .","346854":"not understanding how that would effect my writing when someone is purposely trying to hurt my feelings . i m not revenge fucking the guy or anything else because other guys didn t pay attention to me ? ? ? is that where this is going ? definitely not the case at all .","346855":"i suppose but not the usual way","346856":"why would that be ? enlighten me .","346857":"let s go with this oldie","346858":"clearly you don t read my page or new to it","346859":"yes

and seems a bit painful too lol also would be odd explaining why i m boiling sugar and all that","346863":"people will talk no matter what i directly address . i try explaining things and its met with deaf ears . it s not about what i do vs everyone else on here . i don t have anything to prove . why address things when nobody even listens ?","346864":"most things could","346865":"mountains , greenery , waterfalls . . seeing a bunch of pictures of pretty areas there . .","346866":"that a problem ? well used a product","346867":"a little","346868":"haha nah . i just don t see myself going
