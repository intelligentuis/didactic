.","154832":"wegmans ! they have like everything a food court which is awesome","154833":"truuuuue","154834":"most apes aren t monogamous , however i think humans probably were built for monogamy because of the presence of jealousy . the biological purpose of jealousy is to retain access to a valuable mate and prevent others from taking them . since human babies also require so much parental care and effort unlike a lot of other animals who can stand up and start running just hours after birth , i think monogamous relationships also became the norm to help in childcare . it would make sense that both parents stayed together and helped since it gives the offspring a better chance of survival .","154835":"cezar likes anything tennis ball or tennis ball adjacent !","154836":"idk , what ?","154837":"i have rbf a lot so most people think i don t want to talk to them or that i hate them . doesn t really bother me , it s just a fact that if i don t try to look friendly and engaged

head haha","154844":"i haven t felt jealous or hateful in years . they re emotions i ve learned to let go when they arise and it s taken a lot of self work to get there . i can t say i m all that greedy either . . . i honestly like living a modest life even though i know it would be way more comfortable if i were richer , more aggressive , or played unfairly to get an advantage and whatnot . also it s extremely difficult to make me angry . anger is another emotion that i rarely feel bc i was very angry confused as a kid and i know i don t ever want to feel that again so i check myself when i m feeling annoyed . annoyed is the negative emotion i feel the most and i guess that s like the mildest form of anger possible sooo anger i guess ?","154845":"lack of money tbh . can t do

holiday","154876":"used to take the flintstones vitamins when i was little but honestly most vitamin supplements have a lot of fillers and the ratios of what you actually need are way too high so you just end up expelling the rest when you go to the bathroom . a lot of what s in over the counter vitamins just goes through your body without being absorbed . that s why most of them are kinda pointless and even a bit wasteful imo but i know some people swear by them so","154877":"kindness bc kindness encompasses honesty , respect , empathy , and courage in yourself","154878":"tarp ,

voice and talking sharing my opinions as i ve gotten older ! hmm your quirks would probs be something along the lines of endurance or strength based ones like hardening your body like a rock , hitting

something related to speaking to animals , invisibility , or some sort of telekinesis . funny you said super speed and screaming though cause i feel like that s super opposite of my personality . my

all your questions bc i don t know what the heck i m supposed to say back . you ask a lot of other great questions and you re a nice person who s entertaining to talk to , so i hope you take a step back and take this with a grain of salt but a good quantity of your questions seem kinda like humble brags if i m being honest like always asking me how much i think you can lift , or how tall you are , telling me how you re so good at football all the time , repeatedly bringing up how your ex gf is a model , always saying how you ll be a millionaire , and asking me how handsome i think you are and then you get flustered and defensive when i say i don t care about that stuff . just not sure why you re asking telling me stuff like that . i know you think i m pretty and stuff like you ve said before , and that s flattering , but trying to puff your chest and discretely show off doesn t and won t ever make me want to flirt with you . i feel i don t need to be sorry about that fact . and maybe that s not what you re trying to do , but from my end that s how it seems . this isn t an attack on you , it s just an explanation of my own feelings . if you can t handle the reality of that then oh well if you wanna be salty at me then do it i literally do not care lol","155067":"dude , i m sorry but i don t know and i really don t care . you seem to keep asking me q s about men s

the smell of the crisply cold woods .","155079":". . . ?","155080":"most don t need shoes at all . but some can benefit from shoes for more grip on slippery surfaces , better cushion and shock

around the house","155265":"meh","155266":"most people aren t like that so no not really . some are , but i tend to try not to get very close with those kinds of people if i can help it","155267":"build my house there , farm some of it , parcel some off as a wildlife and trail riding area , and put a riding facility and horse pastures on the rest .","155268":"haha um okay don t tell me tell them","155269":"nope","155270":"no idea . sometime i can t either . i think it s just the app being messed up","155271":"yeah cake is okay . i really like oreo ice cream cake the best though","155272":"to answer that i ll have to start off by explaining what causes an animal to be either albino or pure black . what makes an animal albino is a recessive and somewhat rare gene called the amelanistic gene . aka the gene that causes a lack of melanin the thing that pigments your skin and hair . you see , albino animals aren t white , they have no pigment , no color at all , and it shows up as white . what makes an animal pure black is also a recessive and somewhat rare gene called the melanistic gene , a gene that causes an animal to have really ramped up melanin production resulting in black hair and skin . there really isn t one answer to this question , but the most likely result would probably be a normal looking offspring that was neither melanistic nor albino . the most common colors that horses are born with are chestnut and bay . my bet is that the resulting offspring would be some shade of brown like chestnut or bay since those are the most dominant genes .","155273":"ooh gotcha ! neat idea for broadening your social media base","155274":"haha his hair does kinda look like that","155275":"yeah it s a pretty common color . for example the fresian horse pictured legit only comes in black and no other color","155276":"yeah","155277":"comfortable !","155278":"collard greens bc they re nasty and soggy lol","155279":"just . do it . leave . gather your things with a friend and get out . you don t owe your abuser anything","155280":"yeah i have several ideas i want but i don t have the money for them yet","155281":"into the woods","155282":"i don t do any messaging on apps so i m not the right one to answer this sorry !","155283":"choice but i m honestly not interested in discussing stuff like that on my page . i d much rather talk about equestrian","155284":"posted it on ask already but here it is again . new q a video with requested shoutout for my ask . fm people coming up next ! https m . youtube . com watch ? v nhr lvuadag","155285":"your attitude is disgusting","155286":"not interested","155287":"no , chance is grey . peep his grey skin patches they only really show up when his hair gets wet but the one on his nose and around his eye is always visible cause they re not covered in hair .","155288":"wishing ill on someone else is bad karma , a waste of time and energy , and sets your mindset up for failure . it s better to use your experiences with someone , negative or positive , as a learning experience rather than a weight to drag you down . even if you learn from them what you don t want in a partner , it s still a positive learning experience .","155289":"yeah , he s the king of rock and roll . this is like the th time someone has asked me this . do y all think i live in a bubble or something ? ?","155290":"yeah totally . albino horses coat color is legit just called white and it s pretty rare . you can tell a white horse from a gray horse by the color of their skin under their firm . white horses are born white and stay white throughout their entire lives and have pink skin everywhere on their body , unlike gray horses who are typically born a darker coat color and gray out as they age . gray horses also have gray skin instead of pink . pictured in the left is a white horse and on the right is a grey for reference","155291":"yes obviously interrupting anyone who s talking is considered rude .","155292":"the big percheron looking horse ? i think i saw a news article on that . such a shame that his people treated him her so poorly . it s outrageous to force animals to work so hard they nearly die ! just despicable and cruel . people like that who are only interested in using animals to make money should never have animals to start with . i hope that horse s owners are barred from ever owning another animal again and that the horse goes to a loving and caring home where it ll be treated with the respect it deserves","155293":"every animal has a limit to the amount of weight they can safely carry , including donkeys . as long as your animal is healthy , it can carry you if your body weight the weight of the riding equipment falls under that specific carrying capacity . assuming it s a healthy and well cared for animal , its carrying capacity depends on how much the animal weighs and how much you and the equipment combined weigh . typically , equines are safely capable of carrying of their healthy body weight . an average donkey weighs about pounds , so they can safely carry a load of up to pounds .","155294":"also in california , colorado , washington dc , hawaii , maine , new jersey , vermont , and washington state","155295":"no . dwarf breeds like the falabella and shetland aren t meant for riding and to force them to carry a fully grown person would be cruel . small dwarf breeds were created as companion animals or , in the shetland pony s case , to pull mining carts in small tunnels . that being said , small breeds like the shetland pony are suitable mounts for children because kids are small and light . lots of people introduce their very little kids to horseback riding using a shetland pony or other small breed like a miniature horse or welsh pony","155296":"it s already legal","155297":"right , you can t ride a foal because they re too small and their bones aren t fully fused yet . it s best to just handle a foal and get it used to daily care activities like walking on a lead rope , brushing , and blanketing . horse s vertebrae aren t fused enough to safely carry the weight of a rider until they re or . doing so before that time could permanently injure your horse and nobody wants that !","155298":"first i look for a relaxed body position , relaxed facial expression , and relaxed or forward ear position . all that indicates a calm horse . resting their weight off of one leg , falling asleep , and showing calm interest in others are also signs that they re happy and just chilling . if a horse is bothered frightened upset they look tense . they hold their head up high , have tight muscles and look kinda stiff , show the whites of their eyes , have tightly closed lips , and tip their ears back . not like flattened ears , that s a sign of anger , but just facing backwards . they also tend to blow and snort and won t keep still if they re frightened or upset .","155299":"chemistry homework","155300":"yeah some horses paw or stomp at the ground as a sign of anxiety , frustration , boredom , or loneliness . sometimes it s also just cause they re shooing away bugs . v situational","155301":"that sucks","155302":"shower and lotion . that s it lol","155303":"idk dude . just do whatever feels right","155304":"haha ok like i said before tho . . . i don t care about that , it s just white noise to me .","155305":"i don t care lol . i m not interested in anyone else s opinion of me , only sandy s","155306":"no thanks","155307":"yeah p much . if whatever it is isn t hurting anyone then it s whatever floats their boat .","155308":"mega stuffed i like the filling the best","155309":"probably . i ve never actually played it seriously","155310":"a stupid person lacks capacity to learn . an ignorant person just hasn t been exposed to the information . it would be much harder to explain something to a stupid person imo","155311":"no , the opposite . knowing when you re wrong , defeated , or bested at something is a sign of maturity and strength . knowing how to admit defeat and learn from your mistakes is how you grow","155312":"probably . the sun goes behind the clouds and it gets cooler outside so then my head gets cold cause it s out of the water . it s not really that fun to swim in the rain","155313":"sure whatever . also it wouldn t matter if he were gay or not . who you fuck doesn t impact your skills at performing your job","155314":"idk dude","155315":"not very often . i could take them or leave them at this point . they ve kinda lost their appeal after going to so many at college . now that i graduated people don t really be partying like that anymore anyways . i like kickbacks and bonfires more often than like actual parties","155316":"a person","155317":"enough with the office scenario questions where you say something is dumb or something is pointless or someone is rude . i don t know , man . that s just life and its little annoyances . sometimes it just be that way and you move on","155318":"yeah i really love taking pics of nature , of my animals , and of me and my bf when we go out and do things on dates or go somewhere cool","155319":"nope","155320":"don t think i have one","155321":"you should never ever litter , light a fire and walk away , graffiti , flick lit cig butts out the window , feed the wildlife human food , get too close to wildlife with the purpose of petting them or for a photo op , or disturb the wildlife on purpose","155322":"no idea","155323":"yay ! bananas can be good","155324":"spongebob squarepants !","155325":"married with a career and a house and car","155326":"universities , libraries , any cafe where i can have my back to a wall , and parks if i m with a group","155327":"dogs and cats cause they ve probably seen and heard some weeeiiiird shit from their people","155328":"i haven t really been on any truly awful dates tbh","155329":"get away with something","155330":"nothing","155331":"prolly be confused and close the door","155332":"i had a fish called mr . wiggles , cats called eloise and ebony , a dog named tucker , painted turtles that i don t remember their names , briefly a corn snake named corey , guinea pick called blueberry and meery short for meerschweinchen which is guinea pig in german , a rabbit named mabel , a dog named finn , and a dog named cezar .","155333":"a pickle who","155334":"niceee . gotta be careful with wish with some stuff but others it can be worth it","155335":"mirror","155336":"like a few hours you d say ?","155337":"so don t listen ? random people on the internet s opinion of you doesn t matter and listening to what they say is irrelevant and pointless . to obsess over and subject yourself to their opinions and expectations is only setting yourself up for failure . if you don t like what people have to say then don t make shoutouts to complain , just block them , ignore them , or take a break if you need to . you can t make everyone happy and it s impossible to have everyone in the entire world like you . sucks but it s the truth","155338":"my bf has those but they die after like min . are yours any better ? his are probs from like the dollar store lol i m not sure where he got them","155339":"not interested . stop fuckin asking already","155340":"no idea","155341":"anons asked me this question times in the past few days . scroll down my page if you wanna see my answer","155342":"true lol . i hate how easy the bluetooth ones are to lose tbh","155343":"who s there","155344":"lol that s why headphones were invented tho","155345":"yeah it s down worldwide apparently . just snapped off for me about minutes ago","155346":"just tried a while ago i watch it to help me go to sleep","155347":"depends on what day it was i guess .","155348":"did you hear about the youtube worldwide shutdown happening right now ? it s not letting anyone watch videos all over the us , europe , and asia apparently . not sure why but it just snapped off about half an hour ago for me . some folks online are saying it s been like that for a week for them","155349":"what re your big plans this weekend looking like ? weatherman says i t might rain buckets tomorrow and possibly friday morning too","155350":"going well . waiting impatiently for the weekend lol","155351":"blue","155352":"haha he just takes a bunch of allergy meds a bit before we plan on doing horsey activities so it s not too bad","155353":"idk man . that s all dependent on the person s height and bmi","155354":"yeah he s had horses all his life so he s grown up with them and he s pretty fond of them . he s allergic to them tho lol . kinda ironic","155355":"no idk who that is sorry","155356":"steal a billion dollars or something","155357":"dang that s a tough situation to be in . always best to commit to just falling off once you re at that point . tuck and roll lol my old coach made all of us practice emergency dismounts all the time so we d be prepared if we ever felt like we needed to bail real quick","155358":"at least once or twice a month ! sometimes more if i get a lot of filming done in one weekend ! i have a bunch of ideas but not that much time to film most days . i get out to see the horses every other weekend but lots of my barn weekends have been too rainy to ride or film lately","155359":"not year olds apparently lol . guess he ll never forget that lesson","155360":"lol no burnt popcorn is the worst ! it s extra butter and normal pop for me !","155361":"definitely !","155362":"sometimes yeah","155363":"i hope your cousin is okay ! that s really really unfortunate . horses are animals and can act unpredictably just like any other animal . however , the likelihood of injury increases when horses are handled by inexperienced people . sometimes accidents happen tho , even to professionals . i hope your cousin isn t afraid to be around horses after that ! animals never act with malicious intent , they only react to stimulus presented to them . i hope they know that that horse didn t kick them bc it hated them or something ! it was probably just nervous about something humans don t usually think about","155364":"yeah","155365":"idc about wrestling lol . i have no opinion on those people and don t know anything about them other than from memes and movies","155366":"when they bob nod their heads repetitively when standing around the stable or in the field , it s typically indicative of some sort of boredom or stress response . sometimes it s based on an old bad habit they just never broke . same goes with similar repetitive behaviors like biting the fence or stall door cribbing , swinging their neck head back and forth weaving , pawing stomping with no bugs present , obsessively flapping their lips , or sucking their tongues . if they constantly bob their head only when a rider is on their back then it could be a sign of discomfort or pain caused by bad health , poorly fitting tack , a harsh handed rider , or being ridden by someone who is too heavy for them to comfortably carry .","155367":"thanks ! glad you like them","155368":"i don t even know what an average height and weight man is supposed to be . i have no frame of reference . . . idk i m sorry","155369":"idk . look it up . i m sure there s stats on that","155370":"nope","155371":"couture","155372":"why even reply if you re just going to say okay . i just deleted it the first time lol idk why you said it again","155373":"walked in about halfway through my sis watching frozen so i sat and watched the rest with her the other day","155374":"no , my family made a point to blend in and learn the culture and language a bit wherever we went","155375":"nice , good to hear","155376":"yo","155377":"yes . respect must be earned .","155378":"bc young men are less likely to be mature , less likely to be able to fill the traditional role of being a good provider for their partner , and have less life experience . if it s not hurting anyone , whatever makes people happy is what they should do","155379":"i ve separated quite a few","155380":"it was good thanks ! pretty relaxing and rainy here . hbu ?","155381":"oreos","155382":"that s a current trend in america","155383":"i don t go to the spa . i don t like it when strangers get too close to me or touch me","155384":"i don t really like baths . i much prefer taking a shower","155385":"good vibrations","155386":"most of the time it s not worth breaking them","155387":"yeah p sure","155388":"i don t wanna deal with that clingy shit","155389":"only if i genuinely liked him . idc about anyone s money","155390":"hi i m doing well thanks ! happy wednesday !","155391":"no that just sounds like a dick move","155392":"no , everyone sucks at driving in my area so people cutting me off and being aggressive happens all too often to get upset about . i usually just grumble under my breath and move on","155393":"used to more when i was younger but we don t typically get to yelling nowadays","155394":"um no i don t know what that is","155395":"none of the above","155396":"never to extremely rarely if i m scared and they re in immediate danger . they don t understand yelling and it doesn t do anything to convey my point . they understand calm repetition much easier","155397":"yeah i d recognize them lol","155398":"not interested in being sexualized in that way .","155399":"yeah all the time . i think they like the interaction . whenever i come to the gate of the paddock they ll come up and sniff me and ask for cookies and pets"}}
