in the water . my family had an above ground pool growing up , and i spent all of my summers just swimming in it and soaking up the sunshine . i haven t been to any public pools because i think it s disgusting , but i enjoy swimming in the ocean .","278531":"i joined askfm back in or when formspring was shutting down . i wanted to join another q a site , and askfm had just started up at that time

.","278532":"psychology , forensic anthropology , grammar and rhetoric , cooking , and american history .","278533":"bars and restaurants can only sit at capacity at the moment , and everyone still needs to wear their masks when they re not seated at the table . i think there are some other restrictions , but i m not sure what they are .","278534":"it s always tragic , regardless of whether that

job and work remotely . i don t want to stay in new york state , it s super expensive to live here . i eventually want to move down south .","278556":"not personal at all ! ! i m very open about my mental health and medication . i did experience side effects when i first started taking each medication , which is normal and expected . every medication has its own range of side effects , but they

non violent person .","278594":"my roommate loves whiskey because he becomes so incredibly happy and giddy . but it never sits well with me mentally . the last time i went out and had whiskey sours the whole night , i almost got into a fight with a stranger at the bar . lmaoo .","278595":"nah , the way people type doesn t annoy me at all . as long as it s coherent enough for me to understand it

efron , solely due to his portrayal of ted bundy in extremely wicked , shockingly evil and vile .","278624":"i used to run on the treadmill , but those days are far and few in between .","278625":"i ve never had a tarot reading , so i m honestly not sure .","278626":"i d think that relates more to being empathetic towards others than a bpd thing .","278627":"evidently you didn t understand my last response .","278628":"i m not confident in my body , so no .","278629":"i m mostly introverted , but i m extroverted around small groups of friends .","278630":"from earlier today","278631":"i

book i want to write , let alone a movie script .","278634":"i watched my cousin vinny last night .","278635":"keep pushing forward , because you re going to eventually get to a point where you won t be ab sed anymore , and you re going to feel as if you ve started a new life . this pain is only temporary .","278636":"having knowledge in a specific area .","278637":"i m watching comedy videos drinking , ask me questions","278638":"i guess it depends on how i m feeling that day , because some days i m more confident than others . it probably ranges from or so , haha . irl , i m extremely socially awkward .","278639":"my friends inspire me . they re all strong individuals who have endured a lot of hardship , but have also worked so hard to get to where they are now despite those struggles .","278640":"travel to new zealand and see the shire .","278641":"creativity . when i have the motivation , i can be fairly creative whether it s in writing or some other form of art .","278642":"i ve been content at the most , but never like . . . genuinely happy , in a sober context . i ve been joyful when i m not sober , but when i am sober , the most i can feel is just a sense of neutrality .","278643":"it s perfectly valid to set boundaries with others when they re asking too much of you , and you shouldn t feel guilty for focusing on yourself instead of other people . often times when people are in toxic relationships whether romantic or platonic or with a family member , they feel obligated to appease to them and do their every whim , especially if the person in question is demanding or manipulative or just difficult to be around . it s perfectly okay to distance yourself from that person because you need to preserve your own well being .","278644":"i d say grammar and creative writing , but i ve never been a good teacher at all . most of my knowledge about the subjects is something that comes naturally to me , so it s really difficult for me to really teach it to others .","278645":"was a dumpster fire , as was the latter half of . for me at least , it s basically been one inconvenience after the other and a lot of breakdowns . what i take away from all of this is , focus on yourself first and foremost and try to guarantee your own happiness . take each day as it comes and try not to focus so often on the past or the future . be mindful of the present moment and take time out of every day to ensure that you re doing okay .","278646":"my compassion for my friends .","278647":"i think it varies depending on the person , because people behave in different ways . however , universally i think there would be increasing distance between you two both emotionally and physically , a lack of effort put into the relationship , and just an overall lack of spark in the relationship that used to exist . they may feel as if the relationship is at a standstill and no one is moving forward .","278648":"it s just how i was raised . when it comes to any sort of toxic or inappropriate thoughts or behavior , the fact that you may have been taught to do think so by your family can be an explanation but not an excuse . people have the ability to take accountability for their thoughts and behaviors and unlearn toxic mindsets .","278649":"i didn t even think about makeup , lol . i don t even really fully understand what baking your makeup means ?","278650":"i haven t baked anything besides myself in a very long time .","278651":"i don t even think i d be able to finish it in one sitting , especially considering how large popcorn bins are at the movie theater .","278652":"i got a wine delivery this afternoon .","278653":"no , i don t wear a watch .","278654":"slippers , hands down . i don t care if they re not real shoes . i d wear them out if i was comfortable enough doing that , lmaoo .","278655":"depends on the region and how severe the covid cases are there . masks are already pretty much mandatory where i live you re usually asked to leave the store if you walk in not wearing a mask .","278656":"disgusting they re the ones who are spreading covid and getting people sick for no reason other than their own stupidity and selfishness .","278657":"leave the area , lol .","278658":"no , i ve never been married before .","278659":"wolves .","278660":"i make phenomenol egg sandwiches for breakfast .","278661":"lmaoo . no , pubg is definitely not the reason why we broke up . lmaoo . we still play video games together although i hate playing pubg .","278662":"i used to check my phone when i worked in retail . if there aren t any customers around you re stuck on register , then it s common for people to check their phones .","278663":"i don t believe i m one to talk considering i m on the clock and in the middle of a work assignment , yet answering questions on askfm . lmaoo .","278664":"tbh we d probably just order a pizza . lmaoo .","278665":"no , i m not superstitious .","278666":"there are plenty of other games out there besides pubg , lol . i watched my ex and his friends play it for a while , but there are dozens of other similar games you can play too .","278667":"because my instagram is private and i only have friends on there .","278668":"we had a thunderstorm last night . it was raining super hard and felt quite peaceful .","278669":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","278670":"i don t even know , i don t check the brands when i buy clothing .","278671":"we can take hurricanes , but tornados ? hell no . hahah .","278672":"i don t believe so ? have we had any tornados recently ? lmaoo . i know a few occasions where one hit down on the island or in queens or something , but that was last year i think .","278673":"i try to occupy my time with a lot of activities to combat my feelings of emptiness , but if i don t have the interest or motivation in that moment , then i succumb to it . like , i ve been feeling it a lot lately because i have no interest in gaming or writing or reading these days , and i ll put on a show or movie but i ll hardly pay attention to it . i hate it .","278674":"thank you ! ! my supervisor validating my concerns made me feel more at ease and i m sure i ll get over it soon , lol . it happened at like am , and that s way too early for me to be that angry .","278675":"not wearing a seatbelt while driving a car .","278676":"abortion isn t m rder . obesity is an epidemic in the united states . people should be held accountable for their toxic behavior even if they have a mental or physical illness . it isn t an excuse .","278677":"a summer vacation isn t complete without having a few stuff drinks while sunbathing on the beach .","278678":"i d raise awareness for mental health problems and reform in the united states to lessen the stigma mental health patients face in society and in medicine .","278679":"money . lmaoo .","278680":"haha , i didn t even know that was going to happen this weekend ! ! if the weather permits , i ll be on the lookout .","278681":"yeah , i totally agree . i haven t had a meltdown in a very long time thanks to medication and therapy , but unfortunately i still have a lot of rage that comes out every so often and it boils up inside of me . i honestly don t even reach out to most people anymore , i just try to deal with it on my own using unhealthy coping mechanisms .","278682":"i m really f cking tired of coworkers from other departments undermining my authority and position as a program administrator at work . this has happened occasionally in the past , but this morning one of the sales representatives contacted a coworker of mine regarding my program and moving ahead with a client s requests and article edits without even looping me in even though i m the senior editor of the program and take care of all exchanges and edits . it just really peeved me . i messaged my supervisor to ask if i should have been the point of contact , and my supervisor said i definitely should have been informed by the sales representative instead of my other coworker who had nothing to do with it . it s just frustrating . the sales representatives have no respect for what my department does .","278683":"it wasn t the primary reason why i moved because there were many factors involved , but i moved from massachusetts back to new york partially to support my ex when he was going through a very difficult time in his life .","278684":"my friends know i have bpd , but we ve never really discussed it in depth and they haven t treated me any differently knowing that i have it . however , one of the things i noticed when i was dating my ex is that he had difficulty in understanding my breakdowns , i . e . how really simple things caused me to have a meltdown or rage episode . he did his best in helping me but he couldn t understand why it happened , and it was hard for me to try to explain it without sounding irrational .","278685":"a recent selfie","278686":"pretty much any of the local pizzerias , they all make awesome pizza . i also live in new york , which most argue has the best pizza in the united states , haha .","278687":"yes , waterfalls are beautiful .","278688":"i m not close to anyone in my family at all .","278689":"well it s only am , so nothing really . i ordered breakfast takeout because i didn t feel like cooking and that made me happy since i really wanted an iced coffee .","278690":"bpd is a bit difficult to diagnose because there s often overlap with symptoms consistent with other mental illnesses , and people with bpd also struggle with anxiety and depression and or ptsd , among others . to be diagnosed by a psychiatrist or psychologist , they normally do a psychiatric examination and a medical examination to rule out external factors . you re asked questions and you must meet at least out of the diagnostic criteria to be diagnosed .","278691":"i . . . just don t ? i m not interested in dating right now .","278692":"find another game to play .","278693":"no , i don t give out my instagram username to people on askfm .","278694":"lol , i don t have a crush .","278695":"me too ! ! i just found it on hulu . definitely one of my favorite movies .","278696":"drinking a beer and watching the movie my cousin vinny .","278697":"whenever someone asks me to follow them , of the time their answers are in a different language so i wouldn t want to follow them anyway if i can t understand their answers .","278698":"i haven t followed someone new in a long time . i have no desire to follow new people because i m satisfied with my friends list as it currently is .","278699":"the answer is no , then . i don t follow people upon request .","278700":"idk if you re serious even though you re anonymous or you re poking fun at the people who ask me to follow them constantly , lol .","278701":"this cat loves sitting in my lap .","278702":"nah , not really . i have a small circle of friends and tbh we don t talk every day or anything , so whenever we do talk , there s a lot to discuss .","278703":"justbpdthings lol . but for real , it is both . i get attached to people easily , but if someone wrongs me then i have no issue with cutting them out of my life entirely and i don t think anything else of it at all .","278704":"to be totally honest , i don t remember much about season seven because i watched it so long ago . lol . but you should definitely watch it , it kinda makes sense when you know the context but it still totally came out of left field .","278705":"unfortunately , yes .","278706":"i m not entirely sure . i m seeing this same person on multiple people s pages , but if the person is serious , then i feel bad for them i can t imagine how many terrible relationships they ve been in to the point where they genuinely believe that everyone values monetary goods and expensive items in relationships .","278707":"it depends on how i m feeling that day , but i m either extremely unbothered or every little thing gets under my skin . there s no in between . i m not posting my triggers on askfm , lol . that s just harassment waiting to happen .","278708":"no . i don t have a problem with cutting people out of my life at all .","278709":"i could perhaps forgive them after significant time has passed , but not in the context of a current relationship . i don t have the time or patience to play games like that . if you cheat on me , then you re out . sorry not sorry .","278710":"not everyone has the ability to really grasp grammar , not everyone has the privilege to have a decent education , and not everyone is a native english speaker . it would be wrong of me to basically judge someone on their grammar alone . also i spend enough time at work correcting people s grammar . this is my down time and i couldn t care less about how other people type , lmaoo .","278711":"i ve been having more bad days than good days , to be honest . it s been difficult for me to stay motivated because of various things going on in my life , and i have to admit that most nights all i want to do is drown myself in a bottle of beer until i can t feel anything anymore . today has been a better day compared to the last week or so , so i m thankful for that . however , my mood swings are still fairly unpredictable so i never know how i m going to feel next .","278712":"i don t have a type , and i m not interested in viewing people in a romantic manner especially people from askfm , lmaoo .","278713":"i took a lot of inspiration from stephen king and anne rice while i was growing up , but my style has evolved into my own since then .","278714":"no , writing is my specialty and it s always been incredibly easy for me to write my thoughts and feelings as opposed to verbally speaking them .","278715":"my day has been fine so far . i woke up early this morning , made coffee and had breakfast , then clocked into work at am . i took a shower and did the dishes on my lunch break , and then after work , i fed the cats and did a quick run for some beer and iced tea . since then , i ve been answering questions on my laptop and listening to music .","278716":"it does in some cases , yeah . i haven t reported anyone in a very long time , though .","278717":"i haven t watched that movie in ages . i don t remember very much about it at all .","278718":"i would like to think that i m fairly creative , especially considering i ve taken part in various art forms over the years such as writing , painting , and photography . those are the main methods by which i express my creativity .","278719":"lately i d rather watch a movie instead of reading the book the movie was based off of . i haven t had the attention span to read or finish a book in a very long time .","278720":"idk , to be honest . i d like to think that people perceive me to be an empathetic , helpful person . but this is really something you should ask people who know me , since i have no idea how other people perceive me in general , lol .","278721":"it could go either way at this point in , lmaoo . i genuinely do believe there s going to be a second wave of covid and it s just a waiting game right now .","278722":"i m assuming the anon meant light shows as in shows that are light hearted and easy to watch and absorb . meanwhile heavy shows would be shows that are dramatic , contain serious subject matter , and or aren t very comedic .","278723":"i suppose a combination of both ? lately i ve been watching house md , and i usually only watch things having to do with true crime or the paranormal or other medical shows .","278724":"no , not really . i don t care enough about other people to be jealous of them .","278725":"i like learning about the medieval period , as well as the renaissance .","278726":"taking a mood stabilizer as part of my medication regimen . it has completely changed the way i react to situations , and i feel so much more level now than i ever did in my entire life . prior to taking a mood stabilizer , my mood swings and anger were all over the place . i mean , i still do experience mood swings and anger here and there , but they re for justifiable reasons and they re not even close to the intensity that i felt before i started taking the medication .","278727":"lux aeterna by clint mansell . it s a classical composition , but it s one of my favorite compositions out there because of how powerful and moving it is . https www . youtube . com watch ? v bbs zhz

more americanized restaurants , my tastes vary . although , my default when i can t figure out what i want is always chicken tenders with honey mustard dipping sauce , lmaoo .","278729":"black lives matter . this shouldn t be controversial , considering all bipoc are asking is for equality and to be treated as a real human being , but nevertheless supporting black lives matter is seen as a radical controversial notion these days .","278730":"i don t know if this isn t necessarily unpopular , but i think it s wrong for someone to be so obsessive over their partner that they feel the need to interject in every one of their plans , i . e . feeling the need to always be there when their partner is hanging out with their friends or straight up not allowing them to see certain people without them around . in addition , a person shouldn t offer an opinion on how their partner dresses or acts unless it s directly hurting themselves or someone else . there s no reason to try to exert that much control over another person . you re an individual first and foremost , you aren t defined by your relationship and your partner is not an extension of you .","278731":"ah , that doesn t sound good . he really shouldn t behave like that towards you as your partner , especially calling you crazy . that s pretty cruel and invalidating .","278732":"i ve always wanted to stream me playing video games , but i m terrified of the idea at the same time because i hate my face and i hate my voice , and i also believe i would be pretty boring , lol . when i m playing with my friends , i think that would make for amazing content , though . i m always crying from laughter every time we play together .","278733":"social media influencers and beauty vloggers . i just never understood the

.","278736":"i m a bit paranoid when it comes to things like this , because even the smallest shift in energy makes me believe that my friend is angry with me or is just generally putting up with me because they feel obligated to be my friend . i don t brush it off , but i don t confront them about it either because i know it s irrational . i just worry about it for a while until i get so fed up that i ask them are you mad at me ? and then i feel better when they say no .","278737":"i only follow around people because i like keeping my following list small , that way my feed doesn t get overwhelmed with messages and i can read my friends answers . i have no interest in following new people .","278738":"don quixote by miguel de cervantes . the trial by franz kafka . the hobbit by j .

follow people upon request , sorry .","278741":"yes , i believe in aliens . i think it s ignorant for people to believe that earth is the only planet in the entire universe capable of sustaining life . there s so much we don t know about space and other galaxies in general , and it s more than possible for there to be life that we have yet to discover .","278742":"i don t generally dance , lol . however , i like sitting in bed and listening to music and grooving along to the music while i m drinking , and i m fairly certain the last musician i grooved to was ashnikko .","278743":"i believe that people have the right to own a gun for self protection like a handgun , for example . however , there s absolutely no reason why a regular civilian should be allowed to own something like an assault rifle , ak or an ar . it s unnecessary . i also do believe there should be stricter regulations in the united states regarding who and how to obtain a gun in the first place .","278744":"there are a lot of books that i ve read for high school and college that i enjoyed immensely . then again , i minored in english literature in college , so reading has always been a strong interest of mine , lol .","278745":"i suppose draco malfoy from the harry potter series . he s drawn out as this hateful , spoiled character but there is also so much depth to his character and his back story that i ve always found interesting .","278746":"i almost didn t accept the job offer for the current job i had , because i was waiting on another phone call for a different job i had applied for . i didn t think i would like this work as much as i would have liked the other job s work , but i took a chance and accepted this job offer instead . the hiring managers made me feel incredibly comfortable , while the hiring manager at the other job made me wait minutes just to talk to me during the interview . i m glad i took this job because it s probably the best job i ve ever had . my managers are amazing people , i ve become super close to a few of my coworkers , and i thoroughly enjoy the work that i do .","278747":"i guess pretty far ? i believe in ghosts and spirits , both good spirits and

issues .","278770":"yeah , from my understanding based on my own research that bipoc are pretty much everyone who isn t white , which includes asian people . you guys face a lot of discrimination for

the united states .","278771":"good luck with that . there s literally nothing worth stealing in my house , lmao .","278772":"if it s my time , then it s my time . i don t have much going for me right

cannot understand the struggles bipoc face for the color of their skin .","278793":"i believe i m bordering on the line of realism and pessimism , haha . i m definitely not an optimist , but it really does depend on my mood how i perceive things . i try to look at things from a realistic perspective , but sometimes my pessimism comes through .","278794":"i used to very much be a night person , but as i ve taken on jobs that required me to wake up early in the morning , i ve become more of a morning person than anything else . i enjoy waking up early because i can be productive throughout the

can tolerate physical pain quite well . however , i can t cope with mental pain much at all because i become s icidal pretty easily and resort to very unhealthy coping mechanisms .","278797":"pretty much everything , haha . i feel like i ve lost a lot of the knowledge that i previously had while i was attending college , especially with respect to areas of sociology and psychology , so i would love to freshen up on that knowledge .","278798":"idk , probably a better faster laptop so that i can do my work more efficiently . i m not much into technology at all , so there has never been any types of technology that i ve specifically wanted .","278799":"no , i don t believe that everything happens for a reason . there are terrible things that happen to people for no good reason whatsoever , and not everything is a lesson or a means of teaching someone something . somethings people get the sh t end of the stick , and we have to adjust and deal with it .","278800":"yes , absolutely . tbh , i find it a bit annoying when i m out with a friend and they re on their phone the entire time . i feel like they aren t truly valuing the time we re spending together . i can understand checking it every so often , but if a friend is on their phone legit the entire time we re hanging out , then i get annoyed .","278801":"don t trust anyone with personal information about you , because sometimes friendships or relationships can be fragile and those things you confided in that person could be exposed to someone else .","278802":"playing video games ! ! it s been an interest of mine since i was a child , and regardless of how old i am , it s something that i ve always loved doing .","278803":"i don t exactly think i m a great friend , so there aren t really many benefits to being my friend .

.","278815":"i find science to be interesting , but i ve never really studied them intensively or anything . i studied the social sciences while in college , but that was the extent of it .","278816":"i m pretty content at the moment . i have music playing in the background , i have a beer , and i m enjoying answering questions here on my laptop while my phone charges .","278817":"obviously lately it s been things related to covid , such as when i m going out in public and driving and whatnot . i always wear my mask and wash my hands immediately after coming home .","278818":"i don t get stomach cramps often at all , tbh . i ve never visited a hospital for any of my own illnesses , mental or physical .","278819":"it could be either , tbh . it could be part of bpd , but it could also just be inherently a part of who you are naturally . it isn t really uncommon for people to sorta define themselves by their interests if they don t have a steady sense of self . however , i can most definitely relate to this . i really have no idea who what i am most of the time , and i often become obsessive over new interests or pursuits until eventually i lost interest , and then because i lost interest in them , i lose a sense of who i am again . it s a weird cycle .","278820":"ideally , i d like there to be quite a few chairs and couches along the walls all facing toward a central television unit entertainment center . there would be paintings and some other pictures on the walls with plants here and there . ambient lighting , i . e . unique lamps , instead of an overhead light . big windows looking out toward the front yard . just an area that s very comfortable to relax in .","278821":"i don t know if i could date someone who wasn t interested in music at all . music is such an important part of my life .","278822":"uh , do you mean like . . . drugs and alcohol ? lmaoo . i ve drank way too much alcohol in one sitting , yes . i ve blacked out before on

depends on what i m in the mood to listen to at that moment . lately i ve been listening to alternative rock , hip hop , pop , indie rock pop , blues , and swing . i also like classical compositions , particularly soundtracks to movies , video games , and television shows .","278831":"i don t usually use emojis at all , tbh .","278832":"hot dogs and cheeseburgers ? lmaoo . i don t think america has its own traditional meal because there are so many influences from other cultures .","278833":"no , i don t generally like dancing .","278834":"mistakes i ve made , even if they re minor . i always beat myself up for work related mistakes because i m terrified that it s going to screw everything up , even though realistically most of those mistakes can be fixed .","278835":"i was reading a short story two weeks ago , but i haven t picked it back up since , lmaoo . i haven t had the attention span or motivation to read a book recreationally because i read and write all day long to begin with

based on what i m currently watching , it would be the television series paranormal lockdown . which would be . . . terrifying , to say the least . lmaoo .","278840":"this sounds like a homework question , tbh . i don t know the answer to this . you re better off doing your own independent research .","278841":"lol , i ve definitely never gotten an opinion of being that young before . regardless thank you . i ve always looked younger than my actual age , which will probably benefit me in the future .","278842":"abandonment , enclosed spaces , and public speaking .","278843":"i

would be able to listen to the same music together , though .","278851":"eh , it depends i have a wide variety of music that i listen to , so i m sure there will be at least some overlap there . i don t care much about movies , so that isn t a big deal . however , music is very important to me .","278852":"emotional stability , financial stability , and to be back with my ex . ugh . lmaoo

.","278859":"my long term ambitions are to write a book or more , and then also eventually move into my own place by myself . having roommates is nice , but i also believe i need to live by myself for once to really find myself if that makes sense . as for what i m doing , not much . i haven t written creatively in a few weeks , and i don t make enough money to live on my own .","278860":"my friends and pets are a first priority to me , not so much family because i m not close to my family by any means . my hobbies are important , but those are things i do in my spare time more than anything else things like writing , reading , video games , listening to music , etc etc . i really do value my friendships first and foremost above anything else .","278861":"i suppose i have more of an inclination to trust someone more if they confide in me that they ve suffered through things in the past . not only because they ve suffered and i can relate to that , but also because they entrusted that information with me to begin with , and it makes me more comfortable when someone can trust me before i make the decision on whether or not to trust them in return .","278862":"nah , not tonight . i m on my laptop rn because i had so many questions in my inbox and wanted to answer a decent amount of them , instead of trying to tackle them all on my phone . also , my roommate is

say anything about shane dawson , so i really have no idea who would be saying that . i also haven t been on askfm much the past few days .","278867":"i don t believe you re being too much , not at all . it s normal to crave attention from our partners , especially if there are things in the way that are preventing you from conversing with or seeing your partner to begin with . really though , a person should take the time out of their day to talk to you even if it s just a short five minute phone call in the middle of the day . you ll always find time for those you care about , so i do believe this is a conversation you should have with your boyfriend .","278868":"yeah , for over years now , the number has been standing out to me everywhere . it hasn t happened much recently , but i

better to me , lmaoo .","278870":"my internet went out last week , so i went out of my comfort zone and called my internet provider and spoke with a technician about troubleshooting my problem , which

.","278899":"tbh i used to be a typical dog person back in the day before i lived with cats , but ever since i moved into my new house with my roommate s cats , i ve fallen in love with cats . they re unique like dogs in that obviously they all have their own personalities , but it s silly to do the whole dog vs . cat thing because animals as a whole are great . i ve also had fish in the past , and my ex had a lot of reptiles too .","278900":"i think that s disgusting . i ve looked a bit more into shane dawson over the past day or so , and apparently he admitted to pleasuring himself over literal children , including willow smith ? absolutely horrific . he s a p do , and there s no reason to defend someone for that .","278901":"depends on how drunk i am , ahah . i have a better chance of dancing the more i ve drank , but i did dance a lot at my best friend s wedding three years ago .","278902":"what the hell is a girl code , lmaoo .","278903":"honestly , i m really skeptical of it

loyal enough to one another then they can make it work .","278913":"i played paintball once before , which was a lot of fun but it also hurt like hell , lmaoo .","278914":"foggy and lightheaded .","278915":"today s been not so great , tbh . i ve been getting sh t from my mother for not helping her this weekend because i ve been busy , and she doesn t understand that . i also saw my ex last night , which was good because we got a chance to catch up and talk , but it s also left me feeling confused about my feelings . on top of that , i m going through xanax withdrawals rn , so . . . having a grand ole time .","278916":"i just let them vent , and i ll offer to go somewhere with them or invite them over for food and drinks .","278917":"somewhat , yeah . my personality or attitude whatever it may be does change around different groups of people .","278918":"it doesn t make me sad , but it just frustrates me that americans aren t taking things seriously at all .","278919":"no , most psychologists have an advanced degree like a phd in most cases , and therapists just need their license in counseling or social work . . . . from my understanding , at least . i m not on that , so don t quote me on it , lol . they are different though .","278920":"i m quiet , but i m not all that shy . i just keep to myself most of the time .","278921":"i was a hard working student .","278922":"no , i still struggle greatly with my depression .","278923":"no . intensive therapy and medication , depending on the person .","278924":"i absolutely hate the summer heat i much prefer cooler and cold temperatures . my body doesn t handle the heat very well .","278925":"do you also go to counseling ? that could help you too . i understand the feeling though , i wouldn t be able to be a patient of a doctor who was rushing me out the door all the time .","278926":"nah , i m good . in other news we finally have air conditioning in the house , and omg i m so happy .","278927":"i would recommend seeing a therapist first because it seems as if you need to work on processing your feelings navigating the relationship with your mother first . you don t really discuss in depth things with psychiatrists , they only really prescribe medication .","278928":"find a new job .","278929":"i prefer soy milk .","278930":"smoothie , especially fruit smoothies . milkshakes have too much dairy for me .","278931":"yeah , i haven t had them in years though .","278932":"eh , it s all right . i prefer orange juice in the morning , though .","278933":"i sneeze when i go into bright sunlight or look at something that s really bright .","278934":"it can go into remission , so in a sense , yeah . you still have the diagnosis of depression but it s just classified as in remission .","278935":"hello do you have a question ?","278936":"i don t have any quarantine goals , haha . i m just trying to take each day as it comes along instead of worrying incessantly about the future

answering questions and drinking some coffee .","278942":"no , i rarely buy myself new clothes unless i need to . i spent some money a few weeks ago on new clothing a few tank tops and sandals , but that was only because my wardrobe has virtually no summer clothing left in it , lol .","278943":"i don t know very much about him , but apparently he s a p do ? at least that s what i ve read while

pretty fun and easy going . there are a few houses that have parties every so often , so i can hear people chatting and music playing some nights .","278948":"yeah , it s been ridiculous around here . my friends and i were eating dinner outside earlier today they were shooting off like wild . my friend who lives in brooklyn then told me that in his neighborhood , people were setting off fireworks almost every night until like am . it s ridiculous .","278949":"lately , drinking alcohol . hence why i m still drinking and it s am .","278950":"perhaps instead of cutting her off completely , talk to her about it instead . by removing all alcohol from the house prior to having a conversation about it , she s going to feel attacked , humiliated , angry , and ashamed . she s going to probably lash out and find even more adverse ways of coping with her feelings . just talk to her about her usage and how you re worried about her . if you approach it the wrong way , you re going to send her spiraling .","278951":"i m not aware of what other people are saying about kinks .","278952":"people are entitled to have their own kinks , as long as they re not forcing their kinks onto other people

pranks on my friends and doing prank phone calls when i was a pre teen teenager .","278956":"no , although there was one book i never returned to the library when i was a teenager because i completely forgot i had it , lol . when i was cleaning out my belongings when i moved , i found the book and remembered everything .","278957":"perhaps you should wait for them to contact you when they re ready to talk to you again .","278958":"my day has been pretty low key so far i did some laundry and laid down in bed for most of the morning , lol . tonight , my roommate and i are going to my friend s house just to hang out for a bit .","278959":"no , lol . i m not a doctor or a scientist .","278960":"nope , never heard of that either .","278961":"i don t know what that is .","278962":"depends on whether they re playful or malevolent spirits , haha . i m fairly certain that my current house is a bit active , but it doesn t bother me most of the time .","278963":"johnny depp , robert downey jr . , angelina jolie , helena bonham carter , winona ryder , and jason statham .","278964":"i didn t eat dinner last night . i m not sure what i m having tonight i m seeing a friend , so i might have dinner at their place .","278965":"renting out a log cabin in the woods for a week , going fishing and swimming and having campfires , and cooking on the bbq outside or over the fire .","278966":"i think of spirituality in terms of deriving a sense of faith from the natural elements , i . e . the earth and trees and environment as a whole . some people feel complete and whole when they re in nature , and they claim that as their spirituality .","278967":"adults who tell their sons that showing emotion is a weakness and condition them into being cold and stoic for their entire lives instead of showing their emotions in a healthy manner .","278968":"i haven t watched an animated movie since i was a teenager , haha . with the exception of studio ghibli movies .","278969":"i want to

, on numerous occasions . lmaoo .","278975":"no , i definitely don t . i feel uncomfortable when i m in the center of attention and i prefer to remain on the sidelines or behind the scenes , if anything .","278976":"hello do you have a question ?","278977":"abandonment , enclosed spaces , and public speaking .","278978":"good morning ! ! i just ordered dunkin coffee and an egg sandwich , and i m hoping i can get over this hangover fairly quickly so that i don t feel like sh t when i go see my parents in a few hours .","278979":"spelling inconvenience wrong it s one of those words i can never spell correctly on the first try , lmaoo .","278980":"i really only want to own my own house or a nice apartment , preferably not in new york , and publish a book or more .","278981":"i ve had this happen to me on a few occasions . especially last sunday when i had a telephone appointment with my psychiatrist , i was kinda venting to her and she cut me off and recommended that i try to continue therapy again . on the one hand , yeah your doctor is really there to just prescribe you meds depending on how you re feeling . but in order to do so , you really need to discuss those feelings somewhat in depth to see what will work best for you . if your doctor is rushing you off the phone or out of the office and you don t feel like you re worthy of their time , then maybe you should consider finding another doctor . ideally , your doctor should be a person you feel comfortable around especially when it comes to mental health needs .","278982":"i d get up and move to a more isolated seat . lmao .","278983":"if you re at risk of hurting yourself or someone else .","278984":"a person can be ignorant if they hold a specific opinion viewpoint especially in relation to politics or social justice and refuse to rethink their opinion if what they believe is problematic and presented with contrary , reliable facts stating otherwise .","278985":"true crime , and gorey movies and shows . i m not sure why i like gore so much , but it s just interesting and appealing to me .","278986":"having scars body abnormalities body hair . it s such an archaic concept for people to be basically hairless and perfect , and i m so tired of people staring at me because of the scars on my body . especially during the summer time when i can t cover my arms .","278987":"just because i appear normal aka neurotypical , it doesn t mean that i m not unstable or prone to breakdowns or anything else . i struggle a lot with my mental health , but i ve just learned to suppress hide it extremely well .","278988":"talk down to me as if i m inferior to them , or talk to me while pitying themselves and expect me to give them extra sympathy .","278989":"honestly , i remember going on forums on various fansites and deviantart in the early s , and those were such a source of comfort to me just talking to people every day and getting to know them , but not feeling obligated to be online . this was before cell phones had social media apps , so you d only go on the family computer after school and catch up with online friends then . i spent so many long nights just talking on forums .","278990":"i went to the gym a few years ago , and having that routine definitely was better for me than if i were to try exercising around the block or something . i also like numbers , so i enjoy keeping track of the miles and calories burned while i m exercising on the treadmill .","278991":"i don t like candy , so neither .","278992":"no ? that person would be cheating on their partner then .","278993":"i just fed the cats , and now i m waiting until pm so i can jump into my job s virtual happy hour meeting","278994":"i don t generally ask people questions .","278995":"bold to

have absolutely no idea if when we re going back to the office . no one has heard anything i even talked to hr the other day and she has no idea what the next steps will be . it all depends on upper management . i mean , i definitely don t mind . i love working from home .","278999":"aw , thank you ! ! i hope the same for you today s been a really busy day , i was overwhelmed with work a few hours ago but it s calmed down now , lol . less than two hours until i can clock out .","279000":"i prefer earth tones .","279001":"depends on my mood . the last time i ordered a wrap , i got grilled chicken , bacon , lettuce , tomato , avocado , and ranch dressing .","279002":"i never said i was famous , and i wasn t referring solely to askfm . there have been several people whom i ve wronged in the past .","279003":"it s good in that we have trains and buses and taxis , but it s honestly much easier to drive myself somewhere than rely on public transportation .","279004":"the heavy duty vacuum that we own it s necessary because of all of the cat hair that accumulates every day . it s cheap because my roommate got it for free from a family member , haha .","279005":"one of my pet peeves is when people speak over me while i m talking or even when people do that to others . i find it really disrespectful and rude .","279006":"i really dislike driving . i also dislike cleaning the bathtub , because it hurts my back and knees a lot , lmaoo .","279007":"i d rather be hated by someone i d rather not hold hate within me because it can be damaging to my emotional wellbeing , and i don t really care about what other people think of me . i m sure there are dozens of people who hate me .","279008":"i ve never donated financially to a charity , no . however , i helped raise money for a scholarship fund that was named in honor of my ex s mother after she passed away .","279009":"no , i seldom procrastinate . when it comes to work , i try to do things as soon as they come up i . e . arriving in my inbox and i prioritize accordingly .","279010":"no ? i don t even really know who you are , lmaoo .","279011":"not at all ! ! evidently i was raised here in new york with a misunderstanding of the term and the cuisine , so i ll refer to it as middle eastern food from now on . i m craving a lamb and rice platter now . . . damn .","279012":"i enjoy the cuisine , yes . i apologize for my ignorance regarding the language use of the term halal . i ll be more cognizant of that in the future . thank you for educating me","279013":"i m having a virtual happy hour with my coworkers tonight . tomorrow , i m cleaning at my parents house in the morning , and then i m spending the afternoon with a few friends who are coming over for some burgers and a campfire . i don t have any plans for sunday , i m probably just going to sleep and relax .","279014":"i never said it was a brand . it s a descriptor to refer to what type of food it is in my area there are places called shah s halal food and naz s halal food and the halal guys , among other restaurants . so when i say i m craving halal food , i mean food specifically made in those types of arab restaurants . a lot of them are chain restaurants . perhaps i was raised in ignorance , idk . i like the food because it s prepared fresh , it isn t greasy , it s delicious , and i don t feel gross after i eat it like most other foods .","279015":"i know what it means , lol . but that s the way we refer to it where i live in reference to food . if i ask my roommate what he wants for dinner and he says halal food , then i know where to order from . there are dozens of halal food places here .","279016":"it s specifically from halal food places where i live , which is why i specify it in that way . i know halal is a catch all arabic word in technical terms , but that s the way the word is used with respect to food here .","279017":"aw , thank you","279018":"i don t have any full length photos of my body , so here s a photo of me wearing a black shirt .","279019":"hello nothing much , just working at the moment . today s a short day yay for fridays , and then i m doing a virtual happy hour with my coworkers tonight .","279020":"i m referring to the halal food places that are located where i live they offer platters and gyros . i normally order a lamb platter with hummus and white sauce .","279021":"watch with amusement . assuming my partner wouldn t flirt back , rofl .","279022":"when i was in my early s , i spent a summer playing on an adult volleyball league for the local catholic youth organization .","279023":"lego pieces .","279024":"it s one of those phone cases that are actually two parts one for the front to create a lip above the screen , and then a sturdy back piece . it s gray and rose gold .","279025":"bacon , lettuce , tomato , and avocado .","279026":"it can lead to unrealistic expectations between partners and a general misunderstanding of how sex and communication actually work .","279027":"you re a sweetheart . ?","279028":"yeah , not only can it be harmful on a relationship scale but also the porn industry is horrid , and most actors actresses don t actually want to be in that position . there are also high rates of sex trafficking in porn circles . i m pretty sure i saw an article recently about mia khalifa and how she regrets being in the porn industry . i didn t read it , though .","279029":"ask me questions considering i am forbidden to move rn","279030":"everything works on its own timeline you can t compare yourself to other people , it s taking credit away from yourself because not everyone has the same set of circumstances . you will be independent and find a place in the future , i have no doubt . just keep working hard and take on new opportunities as they come . i have faith in you .","279031":"yep , that s exactly it even basement apartments are . and that s assuming you re going to live in an actually liveable basement . my rent is really high , but renting a house with two other people was literally the only way i would be able to afford to move out of my parents house . now that it s been quite a few months , i ve gotten into sorta a groove when it comes to my finances and bills so i m somewhat comfortable , but it s still ridiculous .","279032":"it wouldn t surprise me . regular one bedroom apartments on long island are between per month was the lowest i could find after apartment searching for months last year . obviously i can t afford that . the city is extraordinarily expensive , so it s probably at the lowest there .","279033":"not necessarily the happiest , but asknikko has been my favorite artist lately . she just released a new song with grimes titled cry https youtu . be psswsj t m","279034":"out in the backyard with my roommate and or a friend or two . having a campfire outside around dusk . perhaps going to the park or the beach during the day . i like doing these things , but normally i m too exhausted so i end up sleeping a lot and doing laundry household chores .","279035":"it doesn t bother me . i don t care about what other people decide to do , lol .","279036":"money , most definitely . lmaoo . i don t find any appeal in being famous . i have social anxiety to begin with , so the idea of people recognizing me antagonizing me is horrifying .","279037":"break up with them . cheating is unacceptable .","279038":"the rent i pay is overpriced it s not even just my own rent , it s rent in general where i live .","279039":"it s an old picture , haha . i just want my shaved head back .","279040":"evidently you didn t get the hint that i don t care .","279041":"uh , okay . lmaoo .","279042":"either mexican or halal .","279043":"i m not very curious about an anon s real identity because people have varying reasons why they feel more comfortable on anon as opposed to unticking especially my anons who are asking for advice and whatnot . i don t really have any advice to try to garner trust , because i don t really care if someone trusts me or not to come off of anon . i don t block people , so it doesn t make a difference to me .","279044":"i had a telephone appointment with my psychiatrist last sunday , if that counts .","279045":"taken a few minutes ago . bleh .","279046":"i honestly have no idea we ve been basically kept in the dark for this entire process , and i was talking to hr yesterday and even she said that she has no idea if when we re returning to the office .","279047":"most of my writing are personal essays and poetry that i have posted on a few websites . i don t really feel like sharing that on askfm , though .","279048":"i have a lot , too many to list , lol . lately i ve been watching house md . i m obsessed i watched the show here and there when i was younger , but now that it s on prime , i ve been binge watching it every night .","279049":"yes , i write both professionally and as a hobby .","279050":"i definitely don t mind living with roommates because i m lightyears better now mentally than when i was living with my parents . but i ve always been a self sufficient person overall , and i do value my alone time . it s part of the reason why i love working from home no one else in the house is home because both of my roommates work , so i have the house to myself all day .","279051":"writing i ve been writing for as long as i can remember , because i was an avid reader when i was young . i ve always wanted to provide people with a sense of escape that reading gave me . video games my brother played a lot of video games when we were growing up , and i played the original nes and n when i was young . i eventually learned to love video games , and i got a gameboy , gameboy advance , and eventually an xbox . i ve continued to stick with the xbox consoles . art painting i ve also been an artist for as long as i can remember , i always have a natural talent for it and i enjoyed it a lot . i took art classes in middle school and high school , got to paint murals on the post office , and my work was displayed at town hall and in a museum . i haven t done much art lately but it s something i ve always loved .","279052":"not really , no . none of my goals are really all that ridiculous or wild , lol . i mainly just want to live alone for a while and have the opportunity to adopt dogs and cats , and publish a book or more .","279053":"grilling some cheeseburgers and hot dogs , having a campfire in the backyard , and having a few friends over for food and drinks . we d chat and listen to music and laugh until the early hours of the morning . those are a few of the times where i ve felt most at peace .","279054":"lol . i think he was angry about something else besides that according to something my coworker told me before , so it probably only added fuel to the fire . either way , the problem is fixed now . the client is happy .","279055":"enclosed spaces , abandonment , and fire sometimes .","279056":"yeah , he s not exactly the most . . . appropriate boss in a professional sense . he has a tendency to take his anger out on the managers , not necessarily people like me who report to those managers . he s intimidating though , lmaoo .","279057":"i m doing well at least i am now , compared to this morning when i almost had a panic attack , lol . i walked into a really angry email from my boss boss about a project i and my team have been working on . he definitely didn t work the email well at all because of how angry he was , which sent me into a panic . however , everything is fine now . i m on my lunch break , i just took a shower and ate lunch , and now i m going to relax until i have to clock back in .","279058":"i can t remember the last time i went swimming , lol .","279059":"sunbathe and read a good book outside while drinking iced tea coffee .","279060":"i d want to know and converse with them directly about it , and then probably break up with them .","279061":"i honestly don t remember . i found it through some friends back in .","279062":"i like chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream , and my second favorite is cookies n cr me . i don t generally put toppings on my ice cream .","279063":"honestly , not so much now as i was in the past . it s all too overwhelming lately

work . then my roommate grilled some cheeseburgers outside for dinner . now i m waiting for my best friend to text me so that i can go over her house and hang out for a bit .","279079":"only with very close friends .","279080":"i suppose pie , but i m not really a dessert type of person .","279081":"that s part of the reason why there s drama i don t live with my parents , and they don t understand that i have my own life and schedule , and they think that i can drop whatever i m doing to help them around their house especially when it comes to work . they ve been so incredibly angry with me over the past week or so because i m prioritizing myself for a change .","279082":"alternative rock .","279083":"yes , i have on a few occasions .","279084":"i don t believe in satan , so no

just a stereotype of middle aged , middle class to affluent white women who make a big deal out of nothing and can t think of anyone except themselves . it s the same thing as calling a man kyle for being a stereotypical f ckboy who drinks monster , rides dirt bikes and disrespects women .","279109":"lately i ve been obsessed with rewatching house .","279110":"it promotes better traffic flow and

in the process .","279122":"i got everything done today that i wanted to do . it was a fairly productive day .","279123":"i would say going to bed early , but considering it s later than i expected and i m only getting into bed now , i guess that isn t an option . lmao .","279124":"i don t generally eat ice cream , but i always liked chocolate chip cookie dough and cookies n cr me .","279125":"i just finished paying off my car , and i have zero intentions of getting a new one , lol . i drive a hyundai accent .","279126":"social anxiety panic attacks .","279127":"unfortunately , no . i wish i could , but i m legit terrified of joining a protest even a peaceful one .","279128":"i don t really have any secrets , but yeah there are a few people to whom i m comfortable telling personal things .","279129":"thank you the same to you , friend . ?","279130":"depends on the contract .","279131":"yes , raspberries are one of my favorite fruits ! !","279132":"no , i thankfully never have .","279133":"lately i ve been replaying skyrim and fallout new vegas .","279134":"? ? ? i consider myself a fairly rational person .","279135":"probably , we ve been significant parts of each other s lives for over years , regardless of whether we were dating or not .","279136":"i d say i m a fairly romantic person , yeah . i appreciate small gestures of appreciation because they can go a long way .","279137":"i respect others a hell of a lot more than i respect myself , haha .","279138":"monday and wednesday nights .","279139":"graffiti as an art form , yes . there s a lot of graffiti in new york like in queens and brooklyn and whatnot that is absolutely beautiful .","279140":"no , but i ve always been tempted to eat the dog biscuits that are set out in the front of petco stores when you first walk in because they look so damn good , lmaoo .","279141":"nah , not at all .","279142":"my ex and i are still friends , though . either way , the relationship i have with my best friend is much different , and even we dated for a short period of time when we were younger , lol .","279143":"we ve been friends for years . i m certain we ll never not be friends , haha .","279144":"i m much calmer now than i was back then , haha . when i was in high school , i had weird multicolored hair and a lip ring , and i was mostly known as the quiet , artistic kid .","279145":"not really , no . no one ever approached me , i suppose i was a bit intimidating for some reason , lmaoo . i knew some people liked me but i simply wasn t interested in them , and none of the people i was interested in liked me back .","279146":"i m still attracted to my ex , and i don t believe i ll be ready to really date anyone until i m over him otherwise i ll be comparing everyone to him and still hold those feelings , which isn t healthy for a new relationship .","279147":"no , i haven t .","279148":"they re pores that got inflamed because i had dozens of needles enter my skin for about an hour , lol .","279149":"upbeat , but tired . i m in a decent mood , but i just ate lunch and now i m feeling sleepy lol .","279150":"a linkin park symbol on my calf .","279151":"here s my avocado it s part of a matching set that my best friend and i got together . she has the side with the pit in it .","279152":"i don t think that s bad , no . there are a lot of ethical companies that are family owned , like small businesses and mom and pop shops . i didn t even think about those when i initially answered the question , haha .","279153":"so i won t have to drive anymore , lmaoo .","279154":"in that case , probably have a mental breakdown . after , i d find a direction to walk in until i run into a road if i m not already on a road and then go from there .","279155":"find out where i am on my gps in my phone , and then ask my roommate to come find me . lmaoo .","279156":"lately i ve been craving sushi , like . . . twice per week . lmaoo .","279157":"i prefer writing over drawing , although i do occasionally draw and paint .","279158":"the power of teleportation .","279159":"yes , i love vegetables .","279160":"i ve only ever used black pens , haha . i hate writing in blue pens , they always seem to smudge easier for some reason ?","279161":"uh , my love of caffeine coffee .","279162":"this is one of my favorites .","279163":"i have seven tattoos .","279164":"it s brunch ! !","279165":"i don t think i m very funny , but some of my friends beg to differ , lol .","279166":"not particularly , lol . the only good thing that happened was two weeks ago when my roommate and i had a few people over the house for a bbq , drinks and a campfire . it was a really great time .","279167":"courtneyuwu she s one of the few people who has never let me down . she s always been so supportive and caring when i m not doing well , and i admire her strength so much .","279168":"both sound equally terrible , tbh . i d be horrible at both of them , lol .","279169":"i don t really dance , so i have no clue , haha . i can t remember the last time i actually danced because i m not much of a dancer .","279170":"have an old selfie from last september october . i don t even recognize myself as a blonde .","279171":"i think it s terrible just because someone is a family member or friend doesn t mean they re more qualified for the job than someone else . it creates an uncomfortable work environment , and ideally people should be hired based on skill level as opposed to having an interpersonal relation .","279172":"i wouldn t have a zoo because they re terrible to animals i don t support zoos at all , but i do support animal sanctuaries , which do more for animals than zoos ever did .","279173":"i loved the pool when i was younger , i felt really comfortable in the water . my family used to have a pool in the backyard , but i haven t been in one really since they took it down a decade or so ago .","279174":"i try my best to be eco friendy , yeah . both my roommates and i try to recycle reuse everything we can , we cook often instead of ordering takeout which creates more garbage if you re getting takeout , etc etc .","279175":"hello i m doing well . i m taking a break from work and i feel pretty good today .","279176":"no , it s from a painter whose name i forget at the moment . i found it on facebook .","279177":"the extra money would be nice , but i would be exhausted . on top of my regular job that i work monday through friday , it would be hell for me to do a weekend job on top of that . i used to work two jobs where i was working seven days per week , and i ran myself dry .","279178":"i ve never really celebrated the fourth of july , and tbh i find it super cringey when people get all dressed up in patriotic clothing for the holiday in things that resemble the american flag , haha . it s just another day to me .","279179":"i don t usually vote in local elections , but i do vote in presidential elections and primaries .","279180":"yes , i prefer eating lamb over things like chicken and steak .","279181":"school is sorta an umbrella term that encompasses all institutions of academia , such as elementary schools , high schools , colleges , and universities . a college refers to a two year or four year institution of higher learning . at least , in american english . i m sure it s different in other countries .","279182":"i do my christmas shopping around november december , haha . i ve never been the type of shop ahead or anything , i ve unfortunately always waited until the last minute .","279183":"oh jeez , no . lmaoo . i haven t played that since i was a child .","279184":"yes , indeed .","279185":"i m just wearing pajama shorts and a tank top . i brushed my hair this morning , for once . lmaoo .","279186":"hello . do you have a question ?","279187":"i m definitely not handsome , i look gross in that photo .","279188":"no , that seems pretty worthless .","279189":"obviously i m referring to the cat , lol .","279190":"look at this handsome man .","279191":"humans who are actors and actresses . . . if you really think p rn is realistic , then you must have a skewed perception of what sex is .","279192":"each can be equally as heartbreaking if not reciprocated .","279193":"no , i ve never played lotto or even bought scratch offs .","279194":"being comfortable around your partner and seeing them as not only a lover , but as your best friend and biggest supporter .","279195":"i remember that i ve seen things regarding this case in the news recently , and apparently there are new breakthroughs . i watched that documentary a long time ago , so i honestly don t remember anything about the case . it was compelling from what i remember , and obviously terrifying and tragic , and i d be willing to watch it again .","279196":"i had a similar situation with my ex when we were dating , in that we talked about having an open relationship so that he could be fulfilled sexually during the times i had a very low libido and was never in the mood . eventually , it never happened because i realized i was uncomfortable with it myself and we dropped the subject . if i was into polyamory and my partner was uncomfortable with the idea , then i would respect their feelings and continue with the relationship as it currently is . if the relationship is already great and communication is wonderful , then ideally nothing bad could come of that situation conversation . you have to respect your own partner first and foremost .","279197":"i don t trust people in general , but i ve never really come across anyone like that . i make it a point not to interact with a lot of people on askfm with the exception of people whom i ve known for a long time . normally , those advances are immediately deleted anyway , so it doesn t go very far .","279198":"similar to my answer to your last question , a good person is someone who has good intentions and goes out of their way to act on those intentions and spread good will towards friends , family , community , etc etc .","279199":"having malicious thoughts and acting upon those thoughts with ill intent , knowing full well what they re doing is wrong . the fact that it s conventionally wrong doesn t stop them from doing what they want to do , and they normally act selfishly .","279200":"i grew up with both parents in my house , and it negatively affected me because they argued every day , which made tensions in the house very high . i was always afraid to come home after school because i didn t know what i was walking into . there was talk of divorce , but it never happened . my mother became disabled and started relying on us as caregivers , so my father probably felt obligated to stay .","279201":"i prefer singing , solely because i m terrible at playing instruments .","279202":"couch , considering i barely have the motivation to exercise as of late .","279203":"it depends on their personality , because everyone behaves differently when they re drunk . luckily , all of my friends are happy go lucky people when they re drunk or drinking , haha . we always have a good time together .","279204":"depends on how terrible of a day i m having . sometimes nothing can cheer me up and i just need to try to sleep it off , while other times talking to my friends about what happened helps .","279205":"it definitely can , yeah . p rn can lead to people having unrealistic expectations when it comes to sex , as well as a lot of misinformation regarding sex . it could negatively affect a relationship that poses significance on sex , especially if the couple doesn t communicate very well .","279206":"i ve always felt more connected to the moon , and i often use it in metaphors and in reference in my creative writing pieces .","279207":"pluto , even though it technically isn t a planet anymore . smh .","279208":"depends on how much is actually there , haha . i would try to pay off all of my debt , buy my roommate a new car , and buy a house for myself my friends to live in or just live alone , but i d be content with just an apartment for that .","279209":"you re asking a writer what their favorite word is ? h oh boy . i like ethereal sounding words , and a few of my favorites are sanguine , maelstrom , and transcendental .","279210":"i would bathe in the blood of thousands of virgins .","279211":"game of thrones is one of my favorite shows ! ! i liked house stark .","279212":"i had unprotected sex , lol .","279213":"no , not very much at all . the topic was brought up after my brother left , but we didn t go too deeply into it and no voices were raised , so i m relieved . i told my mother i didn t want to discuss this in depth on a holiday that s supposed to be celebrating my father especially because he was a bit sad since he just lost his dad two months ago . she said okay and we dropped the subject . she wants to talk about it all eventually , though .","279214":"i can t take very spicy food , so i like moderately spicy food over things that are not spicy at all .","279215":"yeah , on one or two occasions .","279216":"i just came back from my parents house after having a father s day late lunch . beforehand , i went to the pharmacy and then the bakery to get him a cake . now i m home and i m just chilling out .","279217":"yeah , on multiple occasions .","279218":"birch trees .","279219":"no , but that sounds cringey af .","279220":"moving on isn t something that happens by choice it happens naturally , and considering we were together for years , it s natural for me to still have feelings for him months after we ve broken up . i m taking each day as it comes , and that s all i can really do for myself . i came to terms with the breakup months ago , it s just a matter of getting over my feelings .","279221":"i don t live in new york city .","279222":"no , covid has been the least of my concerns lately .","279223":"no , there s no need because they have their own cars .","279224":"this month has been terrible , so not much .","279225":"nope .","279226":"the short story secret window secret garden by stephen king .","279227":"happy summer solstice .","279228":"i m not interested in dating .","279229":"i had scrambled eggs for breakfast . not sure what i m doing for lunch or dinner yet .","279230":"nothing . most of the time , i only check askfm whenever i receive a notification .","279231":"ate breakfast and had coffee . sun bathed outside and read a book . took a shower . talked to my roommate and his girlfriend . cleaned the house . ordered mexican takeout and ate dinner . drank . ?","279232":"no , i just have the television itself .","279233":"look at this bby .","279234":"depends on how i m feeling that night , haha . it can be anything from a oz can of beer to a ml bottle of wine .","279235":"kitchen , living room , bathroom , and three bedrooms .","279236":"thank you so much . i m feeling better now then again , i ve been watching my roommate and his girlfriend play halo and i ve been drinking , so . . . lol .","279237":"i haven t been in a really long time , but there are a lot of fresh markets on eastern long island like the forks that have some beautiful , amazing produce .","279238":"i ve surprisingly never watched it before .","279239":"anyway enough depressing talk . here s a photo my roommate s girlfriend just took of the cat , lmaoo .","279240":"i ve tried that already . my mother can t go a few days without talking to me , and if i don t answer the phone , she ll text me nonstop . it s never ending .","279241":"my roots are brown , and then it s more brassy orange y as it goes down because of the color my hair used to be dyed .","279242":"honestly , it is just an idea . who knows if it ll actually happen , but my roommate did offer to take me with him if he decides to go there because he doesn t want to leave me hanging in a toxic environment . we still have another year at least on our current lease anyway , so there s time .","279243":"that s always been my difficulty in life i live mostly according to my heart , and i ve also always tried to believe that people can change . i thought things would get better after i moved out , but it s almost as if she s trying to strengthen her reins because i m one step closer to being out of her life .","279244":"thank you . i appreciate the kind words .","279245":"yeah , he s much more reasonable than my mother is . we ve never talked about it , but i think he knows how i feel which is why he hasn t pushed me like everyone else has .","279246":"i actually do know someone who i can talk to about this , you just made me realize . i ll have to text them soon . they also cut off their family after years of sustaining ab se , and they re so much better now .","279247":"cutting them off would be the best for my mental health . i m not sure why i m so hesitant to do that . i guess part of me feels guilty , especially considering my father isn t a bad person . i just don t see any other option . thank you for your support .","279248":"i m not sure now is the best time , with the pandemic and everything . i definitely would love to work from home indefinitely , though .","279249":"i m working remotely already . there s a possibility i could do that full time from philadelphia . or just find a new job . idk .","279250":"i honestly don t know at this point . everyone tells me to cut them off , and i know they re right . i guess i ve just been so brainwashed and manipulated that i would still feel guilty , of all things , and that just means she still has that control over me . my roommate s girlfriend is moving to philadelphia . after a while , my roommate might move there too . he said i could come along if that happens , and if that opportunity does present itself , i m taking it .","279251":"i ve tried to tell both of them , but they never listened . if i brought up the fact that i have my own responsibilities now , they ll just say i m making excuses and that i m a lazy pos . not to mention the fact that during this whole pandemic , my mother still wanted me to come over and do things when it wasn t exactly something that was necessary . as if she didn t understand the gravity of the situation . when my father was in florida , i did everything i could but i also went there in a mask and gloves only when something necessary needed to be done . she couldn t understand it . she d ask me to come over for breakfast and she d get angry when i told her i shouldn t because of how bad the pandemic was at that time .","279252":"i m an adult with a full time job , i don t live with my parents , and i already spent so many years of my life caring for her when i had no choice in the matter . i m just done .","279253":"she also relies on my aunt and brother as well , and they just put up with it . as far as i know , they ve never brought up the topic of hiring an aide , and i m thinking it s because it might be easier for them to just suck it up and do what she says rather than try to help the situation as a whole .","279254":"thank you i m just so nervous that she s going to bring it up tomorrow when i go there for lunch dinner . i just want to pretend she never texted me any of that . i m not ready to explode on her and explain to her that she s been hurting me since i was a teenager , probably even before that . i really just wish i could live my life the way i want to for once .","279255":"my ex tells me the same thing , actually . he knows the situations i ve had with her over all of these years , and he s always told me to cut her off because she s destroying me . my father is there to help her , and they have the option of hiring an aide so i don t know why they ve never done that .","279256":"that s what my friends are telling me too when i ve talked to them about it . like , i m living my own life now and i can t cater to her every whim when she asks me to . life doesn t work that way i have my own house to maintain , responsibilities to take care of , and hours of work a week to do . idk if she just doesn t understand that working from home is no different from me working in the office , i can t just get up and leave . i just have no idea where this is even coming from , and really i shouldn t be upset over this because that means she s getting what she wants out of me , but i can t help it .","279257":"thank you , livi . i really appreciate it . it just makes me question myself , like am i in the wrong here ? or is she just gaslighting me to the extent that it s making me question myself all over again ? she s always tried to exert control over everything in my life , and i don t know if she even realizes what she s done to me or if she s just continuing to be manipulative .","279258":"i haven t heard anything from him . he did text me that one day about the whole lunch break ordeal , and he asked if i could just take time off from work and make up for it later . i told him i couldn t do that because it would need to be approved by upper management , my job is really strict about pto . especially if it s within the same day and not in advance .","279259":"i m not , and i m not a drunk . lmaoo .","279260":"i just explained it above .","279261":"it s a really long story . to shorten it a bit . . . my mother is disabled , and she requires my help every now and again especially a few months ago when my father was down in florida . she has a bad habit of asking me to help her very last minute . earlier in the week , she asked me to come to her house during my lunch break at work to help her . it wasn t plausible i wouldn t have had enough time to drive there , help her , and drive back . so i explained this to her , and she got angry and hung up on me . a few minutes later , i got a really angry text from my aunt telling me to go there now and she doesn t want to hear excuses . i told her i only had minutes left until i had to clock back into work . she proceeded to berate me , tell me i hope you sleep well at night , etc . i told her i could go there after pm when i clock out of work , and she said your dad is home at that point , so nice try . i was calm the entire time i was talking to her and eventually she just ignored me . fast forward to today . i had a busy afternoon planned , and my mother texts me last minute asking to go to her house and clean . i told her i couldn t because i was busy , but i ll see her and my father tomorrow for father s day . then i received a paragraph long text message about how inconsiderate i am , how i m not even her child , how i never help out , how ungrateful i have been my entire life , how she gave me everything , etc etc . needless to say , i got really angry . she s physically mentally ab sed me for years , and i thought i would have peace of mind after i moved out but apparently it s only gotten worse . i have no idea what to even do .","279262":"lol . i m like that when i drink whiskey , which is super rare . i settled on margarita mix . i m still angry about the situation with my parents and i don t want to spiral down tonight .","279263":"for some reason , wine just makes me super emotional moreso than i already am . i ve noticed a trend of me breaking down into crying fits after having too much wine , but that doesn t happen when i drink beer or liquor .","279264":"tbh , wine makes me cry more than anything else . lmaoo . i might just open up a bottle of ready made margarita instead , now that i think about it . . .","279265":"definitely thought you meant a physical window , and i was very confused . lmaoo .","279266":"hi friends ask me some questions while i m home alone . i might pop open a bottle of wine .","279267":"thank you so much . my best friend just texted me and told me she s in town , so i might actually be able to see her tomorrow night after i leave my parents house . so that will be good .","279268":"it s pretty good ! ! those are the only two things i order , though , lol . i m normally a sushi sort of person .","279269":"i usually just order general tso s chicken or orange chicken .","279270":"when i fell in love , i don t really think my behavior changed all that much . what did change was my perspective on life i felt like i had something to lose , for a change , and it gave my life an extra spark of meaning .","279271":"i mean , i get nervous around talking to anyone because i have social anxiety , lmaoo .","279272":"a lot of it has to do with self confidence . ideally , you shouldn t be afraid to talk to someone because they re only human with their own thoughts , feelings , aspirations , etc etc . , just like you do . the best option is to simply put yourself out there , and if heartache is involved , then you ll handle that if when the time comes . you won t gain anything by being too afraid to make that first step .","279273":"i wholeheartedly agree . i m pretty sure the rest of the world is disappointed in the united states in general , and considers the country a laughing stock .","279274":"nowhere . i m not interested in dating .","279275":"like , do you mean crying ? if so , then yes , i ve cried while texting someone before .","279276":"those aren t my feelings , so i would never respond that way . lmaoo .","279277":"you re an anonymous stranger , lmaoo . i ve never understood people who say these sorts of things . obviously they re not going to happen , so why bother sending ?","279278":"not particularly , no .","279279":"i just ordered mexican food guacamole and chips , and pulled chicken tacos .","279280":"right now , i m just answering questions on askfm from my laptop while listening to music and waiting for my food to arrive .","279281":"cont . . . what do you think i should do ? i feel bad every time we do sxxual things even though it s not irl , just over the phone when i feel bored and lonely bc it makes me even more unhealthily attached to him but neither of us can control ourselves . i ve tried distancing myself from him and that hasn t worked either . like i said , i feel like without that sxxual aspect or me cracking stupid jokes to get a laugh , it would be radio silence between us and it hurts bc part of me still wants him around . i would appreciate your input , thanks sorry it s taken me so long to answer this , i ve been wanting to answer it on my laptop because it s easier to copy paste the questions into one block . you really do have to listen to your gut on this one if you know that the relationship won t be right or work out at all , then you can t keep putting yourself in a position where you re going to be hurt . i understand the bpd attachment all too well so i know that it s difficult as hell , but you have to try to wrangle it and exercise rationality and control over yourself . you have to think about your own happiness first and foremost , and this sounds like a toxic addictive situation . especially considering the sxxual aspect is a large component of your relationship friendship . i don t know how helpful this really is , but i really do empathize with how you re feeling . i ve had really strong bpd attachments before and i currently have favorite people which is f cking hell , so i understand you .","279282":"lately , i ve been having very weird dreams every night , but i honestly can t recall any of them . i usually forget my dreams minutes after waking up .","279283":"there are currently four cats in the house , lol . they generally keep to themselves , but two of the cats get into small fights on occasion nothing bad , they ll hiss at each other and swat at one another , and then run away .","279284":"i m worried about meeting with my parents tomorrow for father s day , because there has been a lot of miscommunication between us and i know they re just going to yell at me and berate me for what they believe i m doing wrong . i m not looking forward to it at all , and it s getting me really down .","279285":"no , i ve never tried baking a cake from scratch before .","279286":"my app is apparently up to date . however , i did notice a layout change a few weeks ago i m not sure if it s the same update or not .","279287":"i didn t have much authority over it because i wasn t a manager , but if we were suspicious of someone who was stealing , we would basically kill them with kindness . and if they did leave the store with items , then we would make a police report . we couldn t actually do anything unless they left the physical store , and even then , we couldn t do anything ourselves outside of the store . i did personally catch a few people stealing they were loading up shopping carts with really expensive items , and the game was that someone would leave the shopping cart in the store , someone else would come in , and they would take the shopping cart outside . i intercepted a lot of those carts and left them behind the cashier counter , lol .","279288":"no , i don t give out my snapchat to people unless they re already a close friend of mine .","279289":"it s very easy for me to fall asleep most nights , tbh . i guess because i m just always in a state of exhaustion , so i end up falling asleep within minutes . conditions fan on and windows open , string lights set to blue , and my bedroom door closed .","279290":"i only own one mask , and it s a standard n mask .","279291":"thanks ? lmaoo .","279292":"so do of adults in general .","279293":"i actually have zero children , lol .","279294":"no , this was taken with my regular camera .","279295":"i jumped through some hoops , knew where the cameras were , etc etc . it was relatively easy and i didn t take enough product that would be noticeable money wise .","279296":"i don t have a crush , lol .","279297":"my passion , creativity , and dedication to my job .","279298":"i m left handed .","279299":"a person can fall in love several times throughout their life , yeah .","279300":"i m doing well ! ! i just came inside from tanning and reading , took a shower and got dressed , and i feel great","279301":"i m currently reading the short story secret window , secret garden by stephen king .","279302":"sleeping , cleaning , and watching television .","279303":"ironically , yes . lol","279304":"i m not interesting in
