So basically, the guy told me that he loves me. But the feeling isn't really mutual, even though I do like him and have grown an attachment. In the past, I was in this cycle of forming relationships with men online, growing extremely unhealthily attached to the point of splitting on them constantly and just developing a very toxic relationship. This has happened so many times that I promised myself I would get professional help and get my life together before even thinking about love, and never do the long distance thing cuz it isn't for me. After several months of being successful, here I am again in this situation. I've become attached to this guy but I don't quite love him, i'm too conflicted on my feelings and here he is telling me he loves me. I was honest about how I feel and he said he wasn't going to push it. However, I just feel like someone will get hurt. He lives in a whole other country and like I said, I don't think this will ever progress into anything other than chatting online. Still, I'm super attached now and it'd be hard to just cut him off. What would you do? Sorry for how long this is. Thx\n  \n  --\n  \n  that's a rough situation to be in, and i'm sorry you're going through this -- especially since it seems to be rather confusing for both yourself and the other person.\n  \n  i don't know if i would cut him off entirely, but it might be beneficial for you to try to distance yourself from him. perhaps, instead of talking to him every day, you talk to him every few days. allow yourself the space to collect your thoughts and feelings, and also indicate to him again that you don't reciprocate those feelings of love.\n  \n  i understand the whole attachment thing, because i often feel the same way about people in my life. i get overly attached to certain people in rounds, almost, i.e. i'll become extremely attached to one person and then they do something wrong, and then i'll attach myself to someone else in the meantime. i've had too many \"favorite people\" to keep track of at this point.\n  \n  however, i do recommend distancing if you're attached and you don't believe you can cut him off entirely, and i also don't think cutting him off entirely is something that's necessary anyway. just enough so that he understands you don't feel the same way towards him and perhaps allow yourself the chance to ease yourself out of that attachment stage.\n  ","394005":"\n  i wrote a piece of non-fiction (an essay of sorts) that received a lot of attention on the

best for myself more than anything else. you can't force or rush the process of getting over an ex, it has to happen naturally.\n  ","394028":"\n  my version of love for today was self-care. i showered, cleaned my face with scrub and lotion, wiped down the bathroom to make myself feel productive, treated myself to my favorite meal, and watched a few episodes of one of my favorite television shows.\n  ","394029":"\n  yeah, i particularly enjoy cheddar and sour cream chips.\n  ","394030":"\n  they're showing you disrespect, and what they're telling you is *not* what BDSM should be about. if you feel uncomfortable, then you have to trust that instinct. nothing should be happening without your consent.\n  \n  your fear is correct -- in most cases, it does get worse. and even though you still love them, it's important to recognize that your partner's behavior and thought process are wrong. it's ultimately your decision as to where to go from here, but i'm just advising you that what they did to you was utterly wrong and ab*sive.\n  ","394031":"\n  the quote \"if you're going through hell, keep going\" has always resonated with me.\n  ","394032":"\n  i *love* sushi, and i actually had some tonight !!\n  \n  i've never made it myself, though. it would probably turn out terrible if i even tried, lol.\n  ","394033":"\n  i don't have any plans for this weekend -- it's a regular weekend much like any other weekend, and i'm working on memorial day as per usual.\n  ","394034":"\n  i've never heard of this before, but it sounds pretty unhealthy. you need more vitamins in your diet than what just meat can provide you.\n  ","394035":"\n  my entire life has been composed of addictive behavior, lol. i don't feel like discussing what they are\/were, though -- it could be very triggering for some people.\n  ","394036":"\n  woohoo, happy friday !!\n  \n  this week was grueling -- working from home doesn't make the work itself any easier, and i felt like my brain was overloaded every day this week. i'm definitely less anxious than i was when i worked in the actual office, but the workload has actually been more than usual.\n  ","394037":"\n  just because you're both into BDSM doesn't give your partner the right to hurt you without your consent. their behavior by hitting you is still wrong, and the fact that you're questioning it to begin with means that you know deep down that what they did to you was wrong.\n  ","394038":"\n  it's basic psychology 101 rhetoric, lol. a lot of people fall into unhealthy coping mechanisms when they've been ab*sed because they've been conditioned to believe that they don't deserve anything better, and it's easier to \"escape\" rather than confront your feelings head-on.\n  \n  also, addictive behaviors and mental illness go hand-in-hand, and they're often co-morbid.\n  ","394039":"\n  when i said diet, i meant the food i consume (probably should have been more specific). i don't order takeout very often although lately my roommates and i have been slacking on cooking, and when i do order takeout, it isn't a ridiculously unhealthy meal.\n  \n  i drink regularly, and that's unfortunately one of my unhealthy coping mechanisms.\n  ","394040":"\n  no, which is why i usually just copy\/paste the entire thread into one answer instead of doing it in separate parts. it doesn't take much for me to copy\/paste since i'm normally on my laptop when i answer questions.\n  ","394041":"\n  because i've been conditioned to hate myself for the past 15+ years and i haven't broke myself of the unhealthy coping mechanisms i've developed over the years in an effort to deal with what i've endured.\n  ","394042":"\n  thanks for reiterating exactly what i just said, lmaoo.\n  \n  my diet is healthy, but everything else about me is not healthy by any means. i'm taking steps to improve, though.\n  ","394043":"\n  i don't answer questions that are trolling or inappropriate, particularly any questions that pertain to sex or fetishes. it all depends on the question itself and my mood, though -- sometimes i'll answer but in a snarky tone without actually answering the question, while other times i'll just delete the question.\n  ","394044":"\n  spicy crunchy tuna rolls (sushi). i finally ordered sushi for the first time in months, and it was delicious.\n  ","394045":"\n  i probably take my health for granted over anything else. i've always had the terrible habit of ab*sing my body, and i know for damn sure that it's going to come spiraling back to me eventually.\n  ","394046":"\n  i wouldn't consider my roommates to be fat, per say, but they're on the bigger side. they're also both over 6 feet tall, lol.\n  ","394047":"\n  i guess? i've always been uncomfortable with calling myself a \"survivor\" of anything because a lot of people have had it a lot worse off than me.\n  ","394048":"\n  the only household chores that are done daily are the dishes. on a weekly basis, we do an overall cleansing of the house -- dusting, vacuuming, mopping the kitchen and hallway, cleaning the bathroom, etc etc.\n  \n  i've never hired a maid before. i don't mind cleaning at all.\n  ","394049":"\n  well, the day is pretty much over considering it's 9:00pm. however, today i worked for eight hours, took a shower, cleaned the bathroom, ordered takeout, and watched television for a bit.\n  ","394050":"\n  not that i'm aware of. i clean it fairly regularly.\n  ","394051":"\n  maybe once every two weeks or so? my household has a habit of defaulting to pizza whenever we can't decide what we want to eat, lol.\n  ","394052":"\n  fried eggs, bacon, and american cheese on a toasted roll.\n  ","394053":"\n  depends on the day. sometimes i only have one cup (roughly 12 or 16 oz), while other days i have three or so.\n  ","394054":"\n  if they start displaying behavior that doesn't agree with me or is problematic, i.e. if they seem prejudiced against people of other races, genders, sexual orientations, disabilities, etc etc.\n  \n  i also don't like when people are arrogant or conceited, so that's an immediate turn off as well.\n  ","394055":"\n  since i moved into a house with two cats, lol.\n  ","394056":"\n  the two in that photo are our own cats. this cat pictured below is a cat we're taking care of for the next few weeks or so. he's part mainecoon. :'))\n  ","394057":"\n  i guess i'm not writing *or* sleeping tonight.\n  ","394058":"\n  evidently, my last response went unheard. to reiterate -- i'm not engaging in drama because it's silly and pointless. you're just asking my opinion on someone else's opinion solely to run back to them and tattle, and quite frankly, i'm too old and tired for that nonsense.\n  ","394059":"\n  i think this is a loaded question that will only stir up drama. i'm not in the mood to engage in silly drama, so i won't be answering this question tonight.\n  ","394060":"\n  i'm not obligated to answer questions simply because they've been asked to me. i have dozens of questions in my inbox, and i haven't been in the mood to answer questions this evening.\n  ","394061":"\n  \"you didn't come this far to only come this far.\"\n  ","394062":"\n  it ranges anywhere between 6 to 10 hours.\n  ","394063":"\n  honestly, getting dropped off at my ex's house prior to my friends getting into a horrific car accident. i dealt with something similar to \"survivor's guilt\" for a long time (even though no one died) because the accident happened literally two minutes after they dropped me off, and if we had taken a different route, then it wouldn't have happened at all.\n  ","394064":"\n  something hand-made, like a painting or even just a written note inside of a card or with another gift. i love personalized\/sentimental things like that.\n  ","394065":"\n  no, you're irresponsible.\n  ","394066":"\n  aw, thank you. honestly, i don't really see it as strength as much as it's an attachment. we were friends prior to entering a relationship and i never wanted to end that friendship. when we agreed to break up, we both established that we would still remain in contact as friends because we both have contributed so much to each other's lives over the years and it would be a disservice to both of us if we stopped talking entirely.\n  ","394067":"\n  initially, i wanted to use it as an unhealthy coping mechanism because i knew getting drunk would help me forget about my life temporarily.\n  \n  eventually, i experimented and grew a taste for a variety of beer, liquor, and wine. i drink in moderation now.\n  ","394068":"\n  all of the cats eating simultaneously. lmaoo.\n  \n  i've officially become a cat parent.\n  ","394069":"\n  i've never solved one before. i don't have the patience for it.\n  ","394070":"\n  communication, whether events are good or bad, is the key to a successful relationship. you cannot move forward in a relationship unless you communicate effectively with your partner.\n  \n  also -- honesty, loyalty, laughing together, and being comfortable around each other. your significant other should really be your best friend.\n  ","394071":"\n  i used to think the same thing, lol.\n  ","394072":"\n  my tendency to automatically blame myself for everything that goes wrong.\n  ","394073":"\n  more to-go margaritas. :'))\n  ","394074":"\n  lol, definitely not. i wouldn't want to be with someone who would be so willing to cheat on their partner like that. if they wanted to leave the relationship anyway and we happened to click emotionally, then i would wait until they broke up before pursuing anything.\n  ","394075":"\n  i don't know much about him except that he's an animal rights activist, which i deeply admire.\n  ","394076":"\n  yeah, that was when i had my first girlfriend.\n  ","394077":"\n  LOL, probably the biker.\n  ","394078":"\n  i was probably 11 or 12 years old.\n  ","394079":"\n  lol, no. that doesn't sound very healthy.\n  ","394080":"\n  i guess the bathroom? that wouldn't necessarily bother me though.\n  ","394081":"\n  nah, i haven't been exercising lately. and by lately i mean for at least the past six months.\n  ","394082":"\n  not really, no. i've had things like popcorn stuck in my tooth which made the gums sore, but i've never actually experienced toothache before.\n  ","394083":"\n  television shows ;\n  \n  -- house\n  \n  -- criminal minds\n  \n  -- dexter\n  \n  -- it's always sunny in philadelphia\n  \n  -- how i met your mother\n  \n  movies ;\n  \n  -- the crow\n  \n  -- sweeney todd\n  \n  -- the punisher\n  \n  -- heathers\n  \n  -- inglourious basterds\n  ","394084":"\n  i'm not a virologist or anything, but i have a rudimentary understanding of how viruses work and spread.\n  ","394085":"\n  aw, thank you !! ?\n  \n  i hope you have a fantastic day too. i'm currently working, but the window is wide open and i can feel the breeze coming in. i'm also listening to relaxing music while i work, so it's been a pleasant morning so far.\n  ","394086":"\n  eh, not very often at all. perhaps once a week or so? sometimes i'm just craving chips or something, lol.\n  ","394087":"\n  it doesn't happen to me very often, but i know what you mean -- i definitely answered a zodiac sign question last night, lol.\n  ","394088":"\n  no, i'm a scorpio.\n  ","394089":"\n  i'm probably going to have a bowl of cereal or oatmeal. i think we have some bananas left that i can slice into the cereal.\n  ","394090":"\n  i feel fine today, although confused because i woke up before 7:00am and i'm wide awake.\n  ","394091":"\n  that doesn't define immaturity, so no. you can still be a mature adult and watch cartoon, play video games, and collect toys. i know several adults who do all of the above and they're very mature.\n  ","394092":"\n  yes, i've developed close friendships to quite a few people whom i've met on askfm. :'))\n  ","394093":"\n  i actually got a decent amount of questions last night, i just fell asleep. lmao.\n  ","394094":"\n  my friends have the most positive impact on my life at the moment. they've been there for me whenever i've needed to rant or vent, and i appreciate their level of care and guidance.\n  \n  my ex has also had a very positive impact on me as he taught me to learn how to be content with myself, even when my mind is struggling. i still talk to him on a regular basis.\n  ","394095":"\n  anything that's appropriate, haha. i'm open to anything.\n  ","394096":"\n  ask me questions, guys ~~\n  ","394097":"\n  onlyfans is a subscription service where you can subscribe to users who offer explicit media, like videos and images and whatnot.\n  ","394098":"\n  it was from high school, so i don't have any photos.\n  ","394099":"\n  i've never seen that movie before.\n  ","394100":"\n  yeah, i've had a pixie cut before.\n  ","394101":"\n  i don't know anyone who lives in america who thinks that way, lmaoo.\n  ","394102":"\n  turn off the television, turn off the lights, close my bedroom door, take off my glasses, and crawl into bed.\n  ","394103":"\n  sitting outside with friends at a campfire in someone's backyard and drinking alcohol and swapping stories. :'))\n  ","394104":"\n  i like writing, painting, charcoal sketching, and photography.\n  ","394105":"\n  i've learned to let them roll off my back after all of these years. people who say cruel things to you are more than likely not your friends to begin with, so why bother wasting the time and energy to be bothered by what was said? they mean nothing to your life.\n  ","394106":"\n  i get annoyed, but rarely angry (unless it's something about work, lmaoo). i usually just approach the situation in a calm but effective manner, and then vent\/rant to my friends about how ridiculous the situation is.\n  ","394107":"\n  eh, yes and no. i don't really believe in karma or destiny or anything, but i do think that sometimes things either work out or don't work out for a reason and you have something more to learn from the situations.\n  ","394108":"\n  i'm usually pretty calm, but arguments\/debates IRL are really rare for me. if anything, i find them mildly amusing.\n  ","394109":"\n  apple slices.\n  ","394110":"\n  ~\u00b0~ happy wednesday to me ~\u00b0~\n  ","394111":"\n  well, considering a lot of people i know are making bank on their onlyfans, it seems that there are a plethora of people who are willing to pay.\n  ","394112":"\n  no, i'm talking about past friendships and relationships in general. i've unfortunately dealt with a lot of one-sided friendships that ended up hurting me because i cared too much and they cared too little.\n  ","394113":"\n  don't put more effort into a relationship (whether platonic or romantic) than what it's worth -- especially if the other person isn't contributing to their half of the relationship as well. a lot of people hurt themselves because they invest so much time and energy into relationships that are one-sided.\n  \n  i've learned that no relationship is worth pursuing or maintaining if the other person isn't doing their fair share. relationships go both ways, and it's unfair to you if you're putting so much of yourself emotionally into something that isn't being reciprocated.\n  ","394114":"\n  i've only ever donated clothing to thrift shops. i've never shopped in them myself, actually.\n  ","394115":"\n  people who have onlyfans aren't wh*res, lol. regardless, i have no interest in doing that myself.\n  ","394116":"\n  i don't really have an opinion. i believe people have the right to do what they want with their own bodies, and if adults can succeed and gain some extra money by making an onlyfans subscription service, then more power to them.\n  ","394117":"\n  february 2020 !! i went swimming with sting rays in the bahamas.\n  ","394118":"\n  it can be for a variety of reasons. some people thoroughly enjoy asking & answering questions, while other people unfortunately use the website for trolling and harassing other people.\n  \n  personally, i like answering questions, getting to know my friends well, and being educated and educating others on different issues.\n  ","394119":"\n  i interchange between the two depending on how much cash i have on me & if i'm saving it for something else down the road.\n  ","394120":"\n  lazy and comfortable, haha. i haven't had any sense of style these days. i've been lounging around in sweatpants and tee shirts for the past two months.\n  \n  with the exception of today -- i went out to pick up food from a restaurant that was offering to-go food and drinks earlier on my lunch break. i put jeans on for the first time in weeks, lmaoo.\n  ","394121":"\n  the only opinions i somewhat care about are those of my close friends.\n  ","394122":"\n  when i'm depressed, i don't do any type of basic care. i seldom eat, only get out of bed to use the bathroom, i don't shower, etc etc.\n  \n  it's difficult. but sometimes it's easier to go little by little and try to convince yourself that you'll feel a bit better if you washed your hair that day, for example. or even brushing it can go a long way. using dry shampoo to get the grease out. using wipes to bathe yourself if you can't bring yourself to shower.\n  \n  i understand how you feel, and i hope you feel better soon.\n  ","394123":"\n  i do !! i don't post my username publicly though, my account is private.\n  ","394124":"\n  no, i'm an atheist and i don't believe in god.\n  ","394125":"\n  no, i'm currently single.\n  ","394126":"\n  i'm a scorpio.\n  ","394127":"\n  exercising and eating healthy foods on a regular basis. that's the most reliable way to lose weight.\n  ","394128":"\n  i rarely use emojis on askfm, and i don't play these games, so no.\n  ","394129":"\n  doesn't it? it's nice outside where i live, but definitely not warm enough out to sunbathe, haha. it's currently 61 degrees fahrenheit, but it's super windy.\n  ","394130":"\n  i don't remember what the last thing i said out loud was. i haven't spoken yet this morning, and i don't remember what i said last night before going to bed. lmaoo.\n  ","394131":"\n  pajamas, lmaoo. that's the majority of what i've been wearing these past two months.\n  ","394132":"\n  i don't believe i have.\n  ","394133":"\n  i *love* having BBQs during the summer !! my ex's family and i would have them every week or so, and his father would grill hot dogs and cheeseburgers and steaks.\n  \n  my roommates and i just hired a landscaper, so once everything gets cleaned up outside, we're going to buy a grill, a firepit, and some outdoor furniture.\n  ","394134":"\n  even though there are beaches all around me, i seldom visit the beach because i don't really like all of the crowds of people there. it's relaxing to sit in the sun with a friend and talk, listen to music, and have some drinks while swimming in the ocean every now and again, but the amount of people who go to the beach also deters me.\n  ","394135":"\n  sit outside and sunbathe with a good book and a glass of iced tea or coffee. :'))\n  ","394136":"\n  i've never gardened before, so i'm not entirely sure, haha. i'm not sure i would be very good at it.\n  ","394137":"\n  possibly. i've always gotten the same result too. i don't put much faith in those types of tests overall, though.\n  ","394138":"\n  no, i've never had surgery before.\n  ","394139":"\n  you should at least put a trigger warning before this question, or censor it in some way.\n  \n  there's active and passive s*icidal ideation. passive ideation is when a person has thoughts of s*icide but no intent on hurting themselves. active, on the other hand, is when a person

 you can't trace which device someone is using on askfm. you'd have to remote enter into the system with a provided IP address. you also didn't tell me which device i'm even using, lmaoo.\n  \n  i'm not clicking on your link, so if you want to leave this conversation with a little bit of dignity, you'll admit to your wrongdoings and stop sending these messages to people.\n  ","394147":"\n  well, it looks like the time you originally gave me has run out (remember, 15 minutes ago you said i had 10 minutes).\n  \n  guess my device will forcibly be corrupted. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af now it's

abide by your bullsh*t scheme and fall directly into your plan of deception. i'll inform you of when the operation is complete.\n  ","394150":"\n  this is like the fourth person (honestly, it's probably all the same person) to claim they're from like, microsoft or the government trying to scam askfm people into giving their account information, lmao.\n  \n  it's so amusing. like, yeah -- someone's security is compromised, therefore let's contact that person via ask f*ckin fm, aka a dying website, to resolve the alleged issue. :'))\n  ","394151":"\n  ah, the renowned bullshitter has

can't wait until next year when we decorate the house for halloween.\n  ","394166":"\n  everyone is entitled to their opinion but it doesn't necessarily mean that their opinion is correct or justifiable.\n  ","394167":"\n  i believe the means -- meaning the journey one takes to get to an objective -- is much more important than the end result. end results can either be good or bad, but it's what we've learned over that process that truly matters. it teaches us and helps us grow.\n  ","394168":"\n  last summer, when i went to the bay with a friend and we listened to live music, drank tequila, and watched the sun set by the water.\n  ","394169":"\n  probably sometime during the medieval times, just to see what it was actually like back then. i love watching period movies and shows about that era, but obviously it's much more glamorized than how it actually was back then.\n  ","394170":"\n  this is subjective, so it varies from person to person. i personally don't believe that we can ever stop improving because there are infinite ways to improve ourselves and evolve as we grow older. some people accept themselves for who they are, but that also doesn't mean there isn't more room for improvement.\n  ","394171":"\n  well ... first of all, i am mentally ill, so if i was hospitalized, it would probably be for a very valid reason. tbh, i should have been hospitalized a long time ago.\n  \n  secondly -- it's incorrect to refer to psych hospitals as \"insane asylums\" these days, it places more of a negative stigma on those types of hospitals and towards the mentally ill population as a whole. hospitals these days are a place for rehab and recovery, it isn't a death sentence.\n  ","394172":"\n  i enjoy going on walks, and i should really get out of the house and go on walks more often now that the weather is getting nicer.\n  ","394173":"\n  i don't believe in karma, so no.\n  ","394174":"\n  omg, that sounds literally *amazing* !! i'll be feasting with you in spirit.\n  \n  i had a leftover slice of pizza for dinner about an hour ago, lol. i didn't feel like making something new.\n  ","394175":"\n  i think that's the reason why people are so fascinated with killers -- *because* their actions are vile, and because the psychology behind why someone becomes a killer is also interesting and can vary wildly.\n  ","394176":"\n  no, i keep my door closed at night, lol. occasionally one of our cats will be sleeping on my bed already by the time i go to bed, but she usually leaves because i thrash around in my sleep. :\/\n  ","394177":"\n  did i tell y'all that my household is looking after four cats now? lmaoo.\n  ","394178":"\n  it could be both, but it's ultimately decided based on the individual. some people are racist because of their upbringing while other people are racist because they developed into that while growing up (not necessarily because of their family).\n  \n  either way, a racist person needs to acknowledge that their way of thinking is harmful and flawed, and it's their responsibility to take command of those thoughts and de-condition themselves into not being racist anymore.\n  ","394179":"\n  honestly, i'd probably stop myself from c*tting before it even started. it ended up controlling my life for eight years and was a big subject of ridicule and bullying when i was younger, which made me hate myself

definitely not, lol. their reporting system is subpar, and those who deserve to be banned or reprimanded never do while people who don't do anything wrong get warnings.\n  ","394184":"\n

etc.\n  ","394200":"\n  depends on the context, tbh. like i said, if it's derogatory toward the lgbtq+ community then that's not really a joke at all.\n  ","394201":"\n  i never said it was a *personal* attack, lol. some of my favorite comedians are probably pretty controversial, at any rate.\n  ","394202":"\n  if a joke is derogatory towards groups of oppressed people, then that isn't a joke -- it's bigotry.\n  \n  people in the lgbtq+ community can certainly joke and make fun of themselves, but if it's coming from someone outside of that group, then that's ignorance.\n  ","394203":"\n  i have a headache, but of course i just made more coffee so clearly i want to torment myself.\n  ","394204":"\n  most jokes don't offend me.\n  ","394205":"\n  if they seem racist when only they're angry, then they're overall racist -- when they're angry, they're showing their true colors, which is racism. the reason why they don't appear racist when they're calm is because they don't want people knowing that they're racist.\n  \n  so yeah, an angry racist person is still definitely racist all around.\n  ","394206":"\n  i'm a few towns away from my parents' house. far enough

a light shows where the appropriate markers should show up. there's also a pen you can use to put ink on the bill and it'll come up a certain color if the bill is fake.\n  \n  otherwise, it's all a

explode.\n  ","394221":"\n  it's funny to spin in into some random, overly-described way that is vague but also amusing.\n  \n  for example, if someone asks me what i do for a living, i'd say something like, \"i spend my days looking at paper, re-arranging sentences, and secretly cursing at everyone who doesn't have the aptitude for making a coherent thought on those papers.\"\n

diced in some salsa or guacamole.\n  ","394224":"\n  racism is a result, or rather a \"symptom\", of a unstable political system which favors middle aged white men over other minority groups. the fight against racism has always been part of civil rights movements, so in that vein, it can be classified as a political entity.\n  ","394225":"\n  ???\n  \n  you're asking me a question about an anon's personal beliefs. lmao. obviously i'm not going to know the answer to that.\n  ","394226":"\n  not necessarily. it perhaps would be something you or i would do, but politics isn't important to everyone. some people enter a relationship based on chemistry alone and then they discover things about their partner as they progress forward.\n  ","394227":"\n  some people don't show their true colors until later on. my coworker was dating someone for a few months, and she didn't know he was racist until a few months after they started dating. they were discussing how new york was allowing immigrants to get their licenses from the DMV (or something, i don't remember exactly) and her boyfriend started spouting off all of this racist nonsense about \"illegal aliens\" and calling them derogatory names, saying they don't belong in the US, etc etc.\n  \n  needless to say, she dumped him immediately. but had he shown those feelings earlier on, she wouldn't have dated him in the first place.\n  ","394228":"\n  literally a wall, lmaoo.\n  ","394229":"\n  rest in peace, buddy. ?\n  ","394230":"\n  if someone is racist and cannot see the wrong in their behavior, then not much can be done until they realize it themselves. a person won't be willing to change unless they recognize it within themselves and actively seeks to change themselves.\n  \n  honestly, if you've talked to him multiple times about this and he hasn't changed, then he's not going to see it from another perspective. you should consider breaking up with him if he's racist.\n  ","394231":"\n  i believe there is still unjust racial profiling in law enforcement, yes.\n  ","394232":"\n  ~\u00b0~ uwu ~\u00b0~\n  ","394233":"\n  new zealand. it looks beautiful.\n  ","394234":"\n  i get extremely anxious around

lettuce.\n  \n  as for sandwiches, that varies wildly depending on the type of sandwich. i like going to subway and getting a BLT with cheese and avocado spread.\n  ","394241":"\n  i usually like making my own spinach & mushroom salads, and i also like regular ceasar salads with a small bit of dressing.\n  ","394242":"\n  my roommate and i made steak, garlic potatoes, and mixed veggies last night. :'))\n  ","394243":"\n  to a certain degree, i believe so. however, it definitely isn't something for everyone and people will always have their preferences when looking for friendships or relationships.\n  \n  i tend to gravitate towards people who are more outgoing and bolder than me, for example.\n  ","394244":"\n  doing what's best for their mental and physical health, surrounding

illegal in most states within the US. it's ultimately up to you whether or not you want to talk to him and how important it is to you that your nudes aren't publicized, though. he should know regardless that what he is threatening is probably illegal (depending on where you live) and you'll consult a lawyer if he does leak them.\n  ","394248":"\n  yeah, i eat pork but not very often at

in being involved with a stranger from the internet.\n  ","394252":"\n  ... i'm assuming you mean long distance relationships, lol.\n  \n  they can work for some people, yeah. it takes a lot of commitment, trust, loyalty, and communication, but it does indeed work for some couples.\n  ","394253":"\n  reading other people's work inspires me, as well as my own thoughts and feelings. my creativity waxes and wanes, so sometimes i feel creative while other times i don't even want to think about creativity.\n  \n  character dynamics i enjoy the most are usually characters who work as a team but are remarkably different from one another, and they have compelling banter, i.e. mulder and scully from the x files.\n  ","394254":"\n  months ago when it actually snowed during this winter. i'm pretty sure this was the only significant snowfall we had in my area.\n  ","394255":"\n  it can go either way -- while religion is a refuge for some, it has also been the cause of much divide and war in the past. you can't really group everyone who follows a religion into one classification because people's beliefs vary wildly, and it all depends on the individual.\n  ","394256":"\n  i believe confidence is multi-faceted, meaning it can be applied to both your personality and how you are as well as your physical appearance.\n  \n  confidence means that you're satisfied with who you are and\/or how you look, and you also don't settle for anything less than what you deserve.\n  ","394257":"\n  happiness is being content with yourself, your life, and your interpersonal relationships. regardless of what difficulties you've had during your life, you remain optimistic and make the best out of every bad situation.\n  ","394258":"\n  i don't own sunglasses.\n  ","394259":"\n  aw, thank

","394260":"\n  thanks, much appreciated ~~\n  ","394261":"\n  no, not usually.\n  ","394262":"\n  no, i don't believe in karma. karma is some fantasy element of life that reassures others that bad people will get what's coming to them, when rarely that's ever the case. likewise, people who do good in life are seldom rewarded or recognized for their contributions.\n  ","394263":"\n  LMAOOO.\n

worried because i thought spending too much time at home would be detrimental to my mental health. however, i've actually adjusted quite well and i really enjoy it.\n  ","394274":"\n  water if i'm

serious most of the time, so it's nice to have a funny chat with my friends every now and again. they're the only people who can really make me laugh.\n  ","394282":"\n  yes, there are a few questions i'd like to ask people, but i haven't. sometimes you're better off not knowing certain things.\n  ","394283":"\n  just the ins and outs of day-to-day life. not every day is a challenge, but some days are and i've been trying to focus on the present instead of the future or the past.\n  ","394284":"\n  food, water, shelter, clothing, and sleep.\n  ","394285":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","394286":"\n  ???\n  \n  anyway, i finished writing the creative essay i was working on all afternoon & i'm pretty proud of it. :'))\n  ","394287":"\n  nah, it took me maybe 20 minutes, lol. all i did was a neutral eye shadow, mascara, foundation, concealer, bronzer, highlight, and a neutral lip color.\n  ","394288":"\n  there are a lot more important things to worry about than whether or not someone is using slang or made a spelling error or isn't very good at writing\/grammar\/etc.\n  \n  speaking of which, i'm writing creatively for the first time in quite a few months right now. :'))\n  ","394289":"\n  precisely. i'm glad i grew out of that \"omg your spelling and grammar must be immaculate\" stage. then again, i was a teenager when i thought that, lmaoo.\n  ","394290":"\n  haha, yeah it is rather classist. also, it's just the internet -- it's not as if you're writing a dissertation or something. language is constantly evolving, at any rate, and there will always be new slang words congruent with time.\n  ","394291":"\n  i don't trust politicians, but i do trust medical professionals.\n  ","394292":"\n  i can't force you to believe me. but i suggest you do further research and listen to the CDC.\n  ","394293":"\n  sitting outside with an iced coffee, listening to music, and sharing stories with friends.\n  ","394294":"\n  i believe the protesters are irresponsible and don't see the big picture -- especially if they're claiming the coronavirus is fake. tens of thousands of people have died from it, and chances are those protesters haven't had personal experience with it at all. it's ignorance.\n  ","394295":"\n  depends on my mood. usually my roommate and i cook, but we also order takeout if we're both exhausted or are running low on food.\n  ","394296":"\n  no, not really.\n  ","394297":"\n  i don't even know when\n  \n   @CelineM96\n  \n  is online, and it's normal for people's opinions and behavior to change as they get older. perhaps in the past, i didn't like using regular slang terms, but these days i really don't care anymore.\n  \n  i also used to think that people should be grammatically correct on the internet at all times years ago -- i don't hold those same views anymore, obviously.\n  ","394298":"\n  ???\n  \n  on multiple occasions, you guys have seen me use words like \"fam\" and \"my dude.\" i use those slang terms all the time, lol. the ones i don't use are phrases like \"what's poppin?\" or \"what's good?\" and things of that nature.\n  \n\n   @CelineM96\n  \n  is my friend and we're allowed to have differing opinions. not everything is as deep as you perceive it to be, lol.\n  ","394299":"\n  i actually did my makeup last night for the first time in over a month ~~\n  ","394300":"\n  forensic psychology, criminology, anthropology, sociology ... the list goes on and on. i took some beginner classes in these subjects when i was in college as electives, but because they weren't related to my major at all, i couldn't really go further with them.\n  ","394301":"\n  all of my years have blended together, so i don't really know which age was the best for me or which age i would rather stay in forever. i would say probably sometime in my early 20s, because everything else seemed to go downhill from there. lmaoo.\n  ","394302":"\n  i more often give advice than look for advice, but i wouldn't really consider myself motherly or protective. i know that people will make their decisions regardless of what is told to them, and some people will take that advice into account and some won't, but it's ultimately their decision and it's no use trying to protect them from their own mistakes.\n  \n  people will make mistakes, and will often learn from those mistakes. sometimes we have to make mistakes in order to move forward. i'm not going to sit here and try to protect my friends from those mistakes, but i'll give them my input and then they can decide whether or not they will take it.\n  ","394303":"\n  grilled chicken, steamed broccoli, and jasmine rice.\n  ","394304":"\n  i've always loved spinach and mushrooms salads, as well as ceasar salads with a small amount of dressing.\n  \n  i used to eat chicken cobb salads a few years ago, but i found that they weren't exactly the healthiest for you considering the abundance of ingredients.\n  ","394305":"\n  i don't really have an opinion, because people are much more complex than what their religious beliefs are and they're more than just a religious follower. they aren't defined by their religion.\n  ","394306":"\n  i only know of achievement hunter -- i've never heard of neebs gaming before. however, in terms of AH, i think i'd be the most like gavin because i'm terrible at most games and i find myself in the most ridiculous scenarios, lmaoo.\n  \n  example ; i was tipsy and playing GTA V with my ex and our friends, and we entered a helicopter. we play on xbox one. to enter and exit vehicles, you have to press Y. so while we're like ... 100 feet in the air, my friend tells me, \"hey leigh, you can mount your gun if you press Y.\" so i go, \"OH, okay!\" i press Y and my character jumps right out of the helicopter and fall to their death. lmaoo.\n  ","394307":"\n  when i go to the store or 7-11, i seldom get carded so i suppose i look older than 21, at the very least. people usually think i look younger than what i actually am.\n  ","394308":"\n  nah, i seldom drink soda because i don't like the taste of most sodas, and also because the sugar in them is unbelievable (and the zero sugar ones taste horrible).\n  ","394309":"\n  i'd get a small rose twisting around my cheekbone and eyebrow.\n  ","394310":"\n  i don't have any photos from my childhood.\n  ","394311":"\n  i actually tried archery when i was upstate (new york) when my friends and i took a weekend vacation together. it was definitely fun, but i was terrible.\n  ","394312":"\n  you should probably consult jim jones or charles manson.\n  ","394313":"\n  no, i just finished eating breakfast.\n  ","394314":"\n  i'm self-conscious, and i also don't have the right equipment for streaming or recording videos. i think i would be more comfortable if i played in a group, like my friends when we play together, but those times are seldom these days.\n  ","394315":"\n  lol, yes that has happened to me on a few occasions, particularly in recent times considering i drink most nights out of the week at this point.\n  \n  cutting alcohol out of your intake will definitely decrease your tolerance level, so if you want your tolerance to lessen, i would suggest either cutting down severely or stopping altogether.\n  ","394316":"\n  i wouldn't choose any, lol. i don't have any desire to be famous, whether IRL or online.\n  ","394317":"\n  i've always wanted to set up a gaming channel, where i'd record videos of my playing different video games with my camera and mic, and then upload them to youtube.\n  ","394318":"\n  money is probably the most obvious answer. it would solve a lot of my problems and get rid of my debt.\n  ","394319":"\n  taco bell? lmaoo.\n  \n  i usually order a veggie power bowl, cheese quesadilla, and cheesy gordita crunch. i can't eat all of that in one sitting, though. i also used to *love* their nacho fries.\n  ","394320":"\n  as far as i'm comfortable going, i suppose. it

it could be either. i try not to think about it too much.\n  ","394326":"\n  yeah, there's nobody else i'm interested in at the moment.\n  ","394327":"\n  it's slang, obviously. god forbid i'm not grammatically correct 100% of the time, lol.\n  ","394328":"\n  LOL. it's not something i can just snap my fingers and do. it takes time.\n  ","394329":"\n  to a certain degree, i believe i still am. sigh.\n  ","394330":"\n  i'll just be saving it, although it's not like i'll be transferring that money into my savings account or anything. i'll just accrue money like usual without that extra bill.\n  ","394331":"\n  i purchased my car in 2014. i finally paid off the balance of the car, so i officially \"own\" my car and i don't have to make any more monthly payments !!\n  ","394332":"\n

is dependent upon their environment, how they grew up, their interests, etc etc. it doesn't necessarily correlate with their zodiac sign, so to judge someone based on what sign they are is ignorant, in my opinion.\n  ","394335":"\n  my parents are vastly different people, and i'm more similar to my father than anything else. we're both hard working, logical (to a point), and look at situations from multiple perspectives before making a decision.\n  \n  my mother, on the other hand, is narcissistic, selfish, and impulsive. she doesn't think before she speaks or acts, which has often led to hurt feelings. she never admits when she's wrong and she only sees things from her own perspective.\n  ","394336":"\n  this is similar to my previous response, so please refer to that answer for what being *in* love with someone can encompass.\n  \n  having a crush on someone doesn't mean that you love them or even in love with them. it's just an infatuation with a person with feelings that may not necessarily be very strong.\n  ","394337":"\n  you can love someone without being *in* love with them -- and it isn't necessarily romantic. you can love your friends, your family, your colleagues, your pets, etc etc.\n  \n  being *in* love with someone, on the other hand, normally happens when you're with a partner and the feelings of love you have are unlike anything else. it's different for everyone, but you'll feel a distinct difference between simply loving someone and then being in love with someone.\n  ","394338":"\n  haha, aw. i'm thankful that i still have a job amid this crisis, but having weekends is always nice.\n  ","394339":"\n  i'm doing well -- only 2.5 more hours of work to go, then it's the weekend !! :'))\n  ","394340":"\n  i like appetizers, lol. veggies & dip,

living in my parents' house. i don't remember how many i had, but it was probably in excess of 10-15 mugs.\n  \n  ever since i moved, i drastically decreased the number of mugs i own and i maybe have 5 or 6 at this point.\n  ","394344":"\n  haha, i pour them into a bowl. i'd like to have a serving size instead of accidentally eating the entire bag in one sitting.\n  ","394345":"\n  my ex, my ex's

you're hanging out to show your love, but no one ever does the same for you.\"\n  \n  it hit me hard because that's always the case with me. i'm always the person taking photos and videos, no one else ever thinks about it.\n  ","394367":"\n  uh, i'm not a girl and most definitely not a baby. lmaoo.\n  ","394368":"\n  maybe? i don't really think so, though. i've always had these types of mood

time and heart into someone or something without getting anything in return.\n  ","394382":"\n  i agree to a certain extent, but it really depends on my mood. i haven't colored my hair a red tone in a

have someone to help you do the back of your head, you should be okay. just use a reputable hair color brand instead of the box dye you'd buy at the drug store, those are horrible for you.\n

mature reasons. contrary to your belief, farting is something everyone does and there's no shame in farting in front of your partner or close friends. it's actually pretty humorous.\n  ","394395":"\n  funnily enough, the blonde wasn't even intentional. i've only purposely colored my hair blonde on one occasion over 10 years ago.\n  ","394396":"\n  swimming, most definitely. i do like to swim on occasion, and i feel very natural in the water.\n  \n  skydiving seems way too daunting and terrifying for me, lol.\n  ","394397":"\n  i don't trust people right off the bat to begin with anyway. but

some of my favorite games and i'm so excited that they're remaking them with the original maps and soundtrack.\n  ","394427":"\n  i used to when i wore my fitbit, and i honestly don't remember what the highest number was.\n  \n  i once walked 27 blocks downtown from penn station to a comedy club in manhattan, and then back up to penn station when the show was over, instead of taking a taxi. my

easy protein-packed breakfast, instead of cooking eggs on the stove, you can crack two eggs into a mug with a splash of milk and some salt, and then microwave for 90 seconds.\n  \n  the eggs come out scrambled and ready to eat, and they taste just as delicious & cooked as if you cooked them on the stove. it saves a lot of cooking time and things you need to wash later on.\n  ","394429":"\n  the USA is filled with civil injustice, hypocrisy, political divide, sexism, and racism, among other forms of oppression.\n  \n  people may see it as the mecca of the free world, but in reality, there is so much oppression and restriction against people of color, other races, those who are gay or trans, the disabled, etc etc. the economic system is plummeting as well.\n  \n  many other countries view the USA as a joke at this point.\n  ","394430":"\n  i highly disagree.\n  \n  ups & downs of relationships include stuff like getting into arguments, enduring hardship together, etc etc. cheating is a *choice* -- and in the majority of situations, there's absolutely no excuse for it at all.\n  \n  if your partner is cheating on you, then there's no reason for you to stay together (in most circumstances, although i known some have differing opinions). everyone deserves the respect of loyalty, and if your partner doesn't respect you, the relationship is built on nothing.\n

time, i prefer television shows but other times i'm in the mood to watch a movie. i watched sucker punch for the first time in years a few nights ago.\n  ","394443":"\n  i wouldn't necessarily say it's \"bad,\" but it can most definitely hurt you if you're around the wrong people. it's extremely common, though, and i'm also one of those people who panic when people are angry with me (or if i perceive them to be mad), so i'll apologize profusely for things that aren't necessarily my fault.\n  ","394444":"\n  i don't know your partner, so i can't tell you whether or not they'd take advantage of that. ideally, they wouldn't and they would help you work through your insecurities. they would reassure you that you have nothing to apologize for and help you see your own worth.\n  ","394445":"\n  it's comforting, i guess? i also have a short attention span so i don't feel as bad if i lose focus, because i already somewhat know what i missed and i don't have to rewind to watch it again.\n  \n  new shows are daunting to me because i lose interest quickly.\n  ","394446":"\n  quite the opposite, actually. i love this show.\n  ","394447":"\n  i have a terrible habit of

bridges, it's more of a feeling of animosity towards the other person, like if you two were to get into an argument or something and end the friendship in that manner. by letting the friendship go, there aren't really any \"hard feelings\" involved, it's just the natural progression of the friendship, or lack thereof.\n  \n  however, you should do what you think is best. if you think that it

Advice?\n  \n  --\n  \n  if you feel that it is best to end the friendship, then there's nothing wrong with doing so. it's natural for people to drift apart as they've gotten older, lose interest in the same things, and end up taking different paths in life. it's just a fact of life, and it's hard to swallow, but it's normal for stuff like this to happen.\n  \n  sometimes it's best to just allow the friendship to fade away, since that is how it appears it's going anyway (based on what you told me, at least). stop trying to put effort into maintaining it, especially if you guys have talked about it already and nothing has changed. friendships should be worked on at both ends, not just one, and it's unfair to you to keep working on keeping the friendship alive when she doesn't do the

anymore.\n  \n  as for the other part of her answer, i'm still unsure of my stance as to whether or not trans people *need* dysphoria to be trans. everyone has their own views on their identities, but i believe dysphoria is a large component of being trans (as least in my personal experience). i would have top surgery if i could.\n  ","394816":"\n  it's normally used to describe an urban area with things like poverty and whatnot. but some people may consider it a derogatory term towards poor people if it's used to describe people, not places.\n  ","394817":"\n  it's a parody of the 39 steps, a very old movie by alfred hitchcock. from what i remember, there were only 4 or 5 people in the entire cast, but several more characters to play, so the actors would constantly be switching from one character to another using various props.\n  \n  it's initially supposed to be a spy story\/thriller, but the play turns it into a comedy.\n  ","394818":"\n  all of my memories prior to the age of 11 (and at this point, even my teenage years) are sporadic and fragmented, and i can't recall most of my life. the things i do remember don't have specific time frames associated with them at all.\n  ","394819":"\n  my brain is composed of bizarre, harmful, intrusive thoughts on a daily basis, so i wouldn't be able to choose just one.\n  ","394820":"\n  during the work week, i wake up around 8:15-8:30am. on the weekends, i don't have an alarm set so i'll wake up anywhere between 8:30 and 10:30am.\n  ","394821":"\n  they are for me. the amount of carbs in some pasta dishes makes me full extremely fast, and i can only eat a small serving.\n  ","394822":"\n  cyberpunk 2077 looks massively awesome, but i'm most excited for assassin's creed: valhalla.\n  ","394823":"\n  lately i've been replaying fallout: new vegas. i've also been trying to level up in destiny 2, and i've been playing a bit of minecraft every now and again.\n  \n  my friends and i want to do a halo night since it's been a *long* time since we've all played halo together. also when i'm playing with my friends, we play speedrunners and ultimate chicken horse, ahah.\n  ","394824":"\n  at the moment, the lockdown in new york is supposed to lift on may 15th. i foresee them extending that though, tbh.\n  \n  i'm getting cabin fever a bit, but otherwise i'm doing fine. i've been working from home, busying myself with video games and television, getting more housework done, and sleeping much more often, lol. i think i slept for 10-11 hours last night in total.\n  ","394825":"\n  each person has their own definition of what the truth entails, and the journey towards that truth will be different for everyone.\n  ","394826":"\n  \"the grunge\" really freaked me out when i was younger -- probably because i was way too young to really watch that movie, and it ended up haunting me for months. i was having nightmares and everything.\n  ","394827":"\n  johnny depp, robert downey jr., jason statham, angelina jolie, mila kunis, and winona ryder.\n  ","394828":"\n  when i was in high school, \"napoleon dynamite\" was extremely popular. i watched it and absolutely hated it, i felt like it was pointless and not funny whatsoever.\n  ","394829":"\n  absolutely -- there are dozens of movies that are based on real-life events, particularly historical dramas. they give a unique insight into historical events and situations that are mostly factual.\n  \n  there are also documentaries which are movies, which are always educational as well.\n  ","394830":"\n  i've rewatched \"les miserables\" and \"sweeney todd\" a lot lately because they're comfort films to me.\n  \n  it wasn't really a good movie, but the other day i also watched a thriller\/gore movie called \"cabin fever\" that's on netflix.\n  ","394831":"\n  i've seen a few plays both on long island and in new york city, most recently including the 39 steps and harry potter and the cursed child.\n  ","394832":"\n  i'm thankful that i live close to new york city, so i've seen a few plays and musicals on broadway, including RENT, memphis, harry potter and the cursed child, the 39 steps, the lion king, and beauty and the beast.\n  ","394833":"\n  yes, my favorite disney movies are treasure planet and atlantis: the lost empire. i also really enjoyed moana.\n  ","394834":"\n  haha, yes. there are particularly heavy meals, like some pasta dishes, that make me incredibly sleepy when i'm done eating them. they're typically referred to as \"food comas.\"\n  ","394835":"\n  if you're questioning whether or not it's weird in the first place, then perhaps it *is* weird. it also depends on what your ex's sister would think of the situation as well.\n  \n  ultimately, you have to decide what's best for yourself during this time and disregard other people's feelings on the matter.\n  ","394836":"\n  you asked me this last night, and yesterday was an \"all right\" day overall. i spent most of the day working, and work was absolutely ridiculous with how busy things were with a lot of last-minute items and changes. it stressed me out a little bit.\n  \n  after work, i cleaned the house, which took my mind off of things, and then i pretty much spent the evening listening to music and browsing social media on my laptop. i fell asleep fairly early (around 10:30 or 11:00pm).\n  ","394837":"\n  i don't track calories, so i honestly don't know. i only eat sparingly throughout the course of the day, so i probably wouldn't be able to reach 10,000 calories at all. plus, i would feel disgusted with myself. lmaoo.\n  ","394838":"\n  we usually buy the \"cutie\" brand of oranges around here, but they're absolutely delicious and refreshing.\n  ","394839":"\n  i'm currently at 24% battery power, so i'll need to plug it in eventually to charge.\n  ","394840":"\n  lol, you already know about my experience with edibles the first and only time i tried them. :'))\n  \n  i was around 15 or 16 years old when i tried edibles, and back then, it wasn't something you can easily buy from a reputable person or corporation, especially in new york. me and a group of friends tried making them ourselves, and i ended up having an entire brownie -- which likely wasn't the best thing for me to do, considering i had little experience with marijuana at the time and it was a big dose.\n  \n  i essentially blacked out, LOL. i remember bits and pieces, such as being in the backseat of my friend's car and watching all of the street lights zoom past with the different colors, and then we ended up at one of my friend's boyfriend's apartment somewhere out of town. i don't remember anything other than that, though.\n  ","394841":"\n  i don't see why not -- you can still mark things off on the calendar or planner of things you need to get done throughout the course of the week, particularly with respect to necessary errands and household chores. you can also schedule virtual meetings with friends and family instead of seeing them in person.\n  ","394842":"\n  browse social media (askfm actually distracts me a lot from stress because i like answering the questions i receive). i also like playing video games as a stress reliever, watch television, read on occasion, and sometimes i'll draw or paint.\n  ","394843":"\n  different regions have various dialects that determine a person's accent and pronunciation of particular words. apparently, i have a \"new york\" accent when i speak, which makes sense considering i've lived in new york for most of my life. when i lived in massachusetts, i picked up on some boston accents as well.\n  \n\n   @dieselmom\n  \n  isn't \"ghetto,\" and it's silly to keep bringing her into conversations on my page when you already know that her and i are close friends.\n  ","394844":"\n  i'm at a stage in my life where i'm not involving myself in any necessary drama or complications in terms of either my personal life or other people's personal lives. i'm approaching the age of 30, and there are more important things to me than how someone else decides to live their life.\n  ","394845":"\n  depends on whether or not we have mutual friends. if we have a lot of mutual friends of people i know IRL, then i'll probably accept the request. however, if we don't have any mutual friends at all, then i'll swiftly deny it.\n  ","394846":"\n  when you're married, you're legally bound to another person through the court system and have exchanged formal vows. you own a marriage license and you're recognized as a married couple.\n  \n  when you're in a relationship, you're simply dating someone, either with or without the intent of marrying that person.\n  ","394847":"\n  i believe there are certain creams and oils a person can use to get rid of stretch marks -- for example, coconut oil or vitamin e oil.\n  ","394848":"\n  there could be things coming out because of the whole \"christmas in july\" trend, but i could be wrong.\n  \n  regardless, my favorite time of year is the autumn and halloween is my favorite holiday.\n  ","394849":"\n  pee-cahn.\n  ","394850":"\n  no, i don't know what that is.\n  ","394851":"\n  i don't really see anything wrong with that -- people are allowed to have friends regardless of their gender or their friends' genders.\n  ","394852":"\n  definitely not, lol. i don't trust anyone with my hair except my hair stylist. i wouldn't even want to try to shave my undercut by myself or have one of my roommates do it. it's overgrown, but i'd rather wait until everything is safe again.\n  ","394853":"\n  the best musical i've ever seen on broadway was RENT.\n  \n  as for musical movies, my favorites are les miserables and sweeney todd.\n  ","394854":"\n  i don't feel comfortable in my own skin, no. i'm honestly just disgusted with myself and the way i look all the time.\n  \n  however, i love my eyes, my hair (especially after i've colored and shaved it), and my cheekbones.\n  ","394855":"\n  i haven't been doing any projects at all, haha. i mainly spend my time working, doing housework, playing video games, and watching television.\n  ","394856":"\n  musicals, thrillers, dramas, and sometimes comedies. i also like gore films, which sorta transcends into the horror realm but i don't tend to like most horror movies.\n  ","394857":"\n  it depends on my mood. i usually watch an episode or two of a show every night, but there are some nights where i'm just not in the mood to watch anything.\n  ","394858":"\n  i love quentin tarantino movies.\n  ","394859":"\n  no, i don't believe i have any DVDs anymore. i didn't bring any with me when i moved out of my parents' house because i seldom watch them to begin with.\n  ","394860":"\n  definitely not, haha. i seldom watch movies unless i'm really in the mood for one. i mainly watch television shows.\n  ","394861":"\n  yeah, i've used netflix for a few years now.\n  ","394862":"\n  no, not usually. i've seen a few disney\/pixar films as well as a few studio ghibli movies.\n  ","394863":"\n  yes, i love documentaries !! particularly true crime documentaries.\n  "}}
