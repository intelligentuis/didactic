Appreciate their rights and abilities to be able to do certain things. Some people would die to be here in the USA. Where they can fully express themselves without having to hide and be  persecuted for things that they want to be.\n    \n    For me, being unappreciative of those types of things here in the USA seems embarrassing.\n    \n\n      View more\n     \n\n","38672":"\n  Yea.\n  \n   Sure! ?\n   \n    Followed.\n    \n\n      View more\n     \n\n","38673":"\n  \u2764Awe!

He ended up having to move away he ended up losing his family because he wasn't able to come back from it all and his whole life literally went downhill from being fired for no reason from a  incident whether it was an accident or not that was caused by someone else.

Who would have ever thought she would have went first?! ??... my heart broke when my friend came and told me what was going on. At the time she was in the critical condition room. Clinging onto her life.... my heart truly broke when I heard that she did not make it.. I cried so hard.. For days.. Weeks.. I don't handled close one's dieing... there's a lot of family members deaths that I did not handle very well. I took very hard. But she was my idol. Someone I looked up to in life. Someone that made me happy. Made me feel whole.. My way out.. Her and her sweet loving personality and beautiful voice.\n  \n  Life is so unexpected. We must live everyday of it to the fullest.

I love to get compliments on my food and I love to see smiles on I cooked food and serve it to people. I absolutely love to cook. I love making people happy with my food making.\n  \n  I learned how to cook from many different family members. In our culture that is how I grew up through. That is always something that we learn to in the end. We watched the grown ups cook. Helped. And of course watched the different techniques and how they did it. It's all very traditional. A kind of just comes natural to us as long as we did all of that. Just watch and learn. Take notes occasionally. Especially right down the recipes always and then eventually we start to learn to my heart. And then we learn the techniques and how they did it exactly. And it starts to taste like they did it. Cooking definitely runs in my blood. I'm Cajun French\/Creole so we definitely cook some good soul food. Good lovely food. Food of all kinds of flavors and textures.

My apology on the typo.\n  ","39051":"\n  ??\n  ","39052":"\n  The most?? Idk the most I've ever.. considering I have wwitnessed alooot alot...  but I will share this. While visiting the Myrtles Plantation located out in the middle of nowhere in St Francisville Louisiana. We walked around a little bit got to go inside of the gift shop and visit people. We got to look at the property real well. We went on our nightly to worm and after we were allowed to walk around the property. We went and walked out on this bridge that they have there and halfway through walking on the bridge one of the people that I was with randomly started having a breakdown. The thing that is very ironic is basically where she started to freak out, the spot on the bridge, this is where a young man passed away from a very sad death. I believe that she was feeling his sorrow before he died. She was feeling what he felt before he died. Sometimes on these paranormal investigations this will happen. You will feel what the spirit fell when it was dying. Or what it was feeling when it was alive. Which is usually something really angry or sad or traumatizing. In which I think this person was feeling he felt before he passed. The reason why I say this is because she said she did not understand why she started crying and panicking. She just said she started feeling really really bad and sad and she doesn't know why. I explained to her this and she didn't was like maybe you're right. But we will never know. Considering this is just me telling you what happened to us. I was there with her and two other people. They witnessed it also. Also while we were there another person sat down and was waiting for us and they got up, and started to run away because they said that they got touched. This is a lot of paranormal activity that happened at once. There's a lot of other stuff that happened but these were the two major things.\n  ","39053":"\n  We really like going to the Chinese buffet around here. We like their wong tongs and their sushi. The salmon there is really good too. They bake their salmon. They have pretty good simple Seafood.\n  \n  Down in south Louisiana where I am from there is a really good China Buffet that they have a night where you can have all you can eat seafood. But it's really expensive. For 5 people it was almost $100 dollars. You can have crab shrimp crawfish fish oysters. They have way more than this they also have tons of vegetables different types of sesame chicken rice noodles different types of potato and fried foods. They also have a dessert aisle and a salad tray aisle and Sushi and cold shrimp.\n  \n  And then they have a place called Golden Corral but they don't have too much Seafood there. But their food is good. I'm sure that they have some choices.\n  \n  They have a place called Mike Anderson's and they have really good seafood platters there. I definitely recommend that place.\n  \n  I love going to Oishi. They have the best Sushi and Hibachi place ever.\n  \n  There's a place called Bayou bronze and they have very good dishes there including seafood dishes. That is what you see in the picture below is a dish from bayou bronze. Eating at Hooters is good.\n  \n  Sometimes I even like to get the shrimp from Popeyes.\n  \n  I love to get some boiled crawfish and sometimes they add corn sausage room sometimes if you ask for crabs they will throw that in two different types of vegetables Onions mushrooms and way way more.\n  \n  There's a place over there where I used to live and it's called the jambalaya shop. They sell boiled crawfish and stuff I think and of course they sell pastalaya jambalaya and other types of things too. I'm sure gumbo. Potato salad. Baked beans. And way more.\n  \n  There is another place in BR called The Voodoo Cafe. Very delicious food. I tried their red beans and rice and it was golden!\n  \n  There are so many other places.

The only time you should ever try to end anything or anyone's life as if your life is being threatened.

Even if our partner's actingclingy, sometimes we try our best to not embarrass them. But if they want a kiss or a hug or to hold our hands we will let them. But we only do it out of respect. Though at the same time as Capricorns do you like our attention from our partners. But we try our best not to be too clingy or embarrassing in public.

I'm actually just try to stay away from people like that because usually bad things happen. I don't try to judge people I just tried to stay safe there's a difference. Why stay and then something end up happening when I could have just trusted my instincts and walk away. That's what I mean by if I meet someone and this is what I see first. I don't exactly try to judge people when I first meet them but if someone's trying to beat the crap out of someone I'm going to get away.\n  \n  And then smell of a person.

I don't answer those kinds of questions. Is none of their business. Don't let these people run you on here. But also don't be getting to mean with people. Not saying you did. It's just sometimes they will try to rile you up and get you mad so they can report you and get you banned. Also if they ask you too much of inappropriate questions be careful with the curse words and stuff that they put in the questions because people can report those too and get your account banned same with answers. I saw that you didn't tell them about your personal disability business and that but still I thought that I would stick up for you. I don't appreciate people asking people that kind of stuff. It doesn't matter what are disabilities are. Because honestly they're asking you so they can make fun of you. Why else would they be asking you what your disabilities are right? But like I said it doesn't matter what are disabilities are. What matters is that we it make through those things. That made my blood boil. I absolutely cannot stand people that are like that.

Because once he gets in like a year or two you almost want to go back to the beginning and do it all over again because it was so wonderful though being a year or two and is wonderful to just the meeting part is just the greatest. It's y'alls own story.\n  \n  The way me and Jason met almost sounds like it's not real.\n  \n  But I always tell people just look very carefully. Because you don't want to get stuck in something especially an abusive relationship. Especially a very controlling and possessive relationship. Some people can become stalkers and even try to kill you and you don't want that... not trying to get graphic with this but life is this serious. Life is too short. Life is precious. We must be careful with who we run into. And who we trust fully. But give it time. You don't seem like you're too bad. Especially the way that we've been talking back and forth.\n  \n  The biggest things in a relationship is communication and loyalty and trust and working together.\n  \n  To find someone you have to have confidence in yourself and confidence that you can take care of them. Respect for one another.\n  \n  If you don't have confidence in yourself then it's really hard to find somebody. Find what makes you truly happy and go with it. I always say try to find some hobbies. Something you're really good at. Try to impress people.\n  ","39203":"\n  It takes a little time to get meditation so don't get frustrated just off of one video and one session.

It will tell you more about this place and me.\n  \n  The Myrtles Plantation in south Louisiana and my experience and what I know from being there.\n  \n  This place is known to have 12 to 13 spirits inhabiting the place. These girls are said to walk the grounds. There are many different terrible and sad stories that have happened with the death of these people. This place has been around for almost two hundred years. It has been around during the Civil War times. There are said to the Indian burial grounds underneath this place also. Also aside from the 13 spirits that walk the grounds there are also unmarked Graves as I said the Indian burial ground. Plus other civil war people's buried around and I'm sure.\n  \n  The plantation that is today known as Myrtles was once known by a different name. Some people may have heard it called Whiskey Dave, but the original name of the plantation was Laurel Grove. This antebellum plantation is located in St. Francisville, Louisiana. St. Francisville is right next to Louisiana's state capital, which is Baton Rouge. The plantation was built in 1796 by a General named David Bradford.Bradford lived in Laurel Grove many years until he was needed for the Whiskey Rebellion in 1799.\n  \n  This is another picture from the Myrtles Plantation that I'm going to be sharing below.

So behind my back, in good way, they were online purchasing tickets to surprise me to go with all of them. All the sudden they said well we're going to go later on and I said what?! What?! Your kidding me? Right? And they're like no would you like to go later? And I said is that question?! What?! YES! OF COURSE! I was absolutely surprised and excited as ever to go and visit the place that I have always wanted to go to.\n  \n  For the ones that don't know what the Myrtles Plantation is it is one of the most haunted places in the United States of America. Top 10 most haunted. In Louisiana is the top number one most haunted place in Louisiana. Me, I love and have been researching the Paranormal for a looong time and love going to different types of haunted locatione to learn about the history and what happened there. I most definitely was excited to go to this location. It is always been my dream. The experience was amazing. And I would love to go back again during the day and stay the night.

I don't appreciate people being disrespectful towards me for what I do, especially considering it I help people.

Me too I hope everything goes well when we go on that trip. But I've always wanted to stay on the train. They have those little rooms that you can get on the train and spend the night and just travel. The bad part is my husband is like six foot to 6.3. A minnie giant and I hope that he can get comfortable in a little room like that. Haha.\n  \n  Anyway. You have a good night!\n  ","39308":"\n  Traveling long distances in a car without going insane. Basically going on a mini tour.\n  \n  The other thing that makes it super is because literally one of my dogs goes everywhere with me, but the type of trip we're going on is on a train and I don't think that I'm going to be able to take him. So the reason why I say super is because this will be the first time that we go on a trip and be away from my dog for a long period time. He has severe separation anxiety so I'm very scared about leaving him with someone. But the person I am leaving them with he absolutely adores so he should be okay. Hopefully.\n  \n  But also what it makes it super because it's something that me and my husband have always wanted to do together. Is travel the United States. All the way up to Alaska through Canada all the way down to the bottom. And maybe even Mexico. Considering me and him we're in a long distance relationship it kind of makes it really special for us. I don't know why but it has some sort of connection with all the distance stuff. Traveling. So that's why I say super trip. Me and him just love cruising in a car together. It just makes a really exciting Adventure type feeling for us. Knowing that we're going into a direction without knowing what could happen next but we're doing it out of love and wanting to do it together. Discovering together. Experiencing it together. ?\n  ","39309":"\n  I honestly love cooking for people and seeing their faces and reactions and smiles after trying my food. Very rarely will I get someone that doesn't like my food. Usually the only time I get someone that doesn't like my food is because they get jealous or something. This is not always the case. But I have gotten a few people like this. But there's no reason to get jealous. Practice makes perfect. Anyone can do it. I perfect my food and if it's not done right then I don't serve to people. Every now and then I might get someone saying that it's a bit spicy but that's just how I am. I love spicy food. But I don't always try to make it really really hot. I try my best to make it mild tasting or just regular tasting. But I always warn people before they eat my food that it could possibly be a bit spicy. I don't mean to. This is just how I have always known to prepare food. But I definitely tried to be more of a person that cares for other people's needs first. But at the same time I still take care of myself too. I guess you could say I'm a bit selfless sometimes. I definitely do not take myself as a selfish person. I can't stand selfishness. I try my very best to not be.\n  ","39310":"\n  Though I never really skipped rocks a ton as a child I did do this a few times. I really enjoyed skipping rocks. I don't know why but I just got some sort of joy out of skipping them. But I really like different types of rocks. I put a big interest in them and in gem mining.\n  ","39311":"\n  Going on a super trip.\n  ","39312":"\n  ?\n  ","39313":"\n  ???\n  ","39314":"\n  ? to this shoutout ???\n  ","39315":"\n  My husband said hi. ?\n  \n   Bye\n   \n   Going cuddle with him . lol\n   \n\n     View more\n    \n\n\n","39316":"\n  Sorry I'm late.

Me and my sister were dancing in the room and I was dancing on a chair singing Avril Lavigne with her and that's the day that I really decided that I wanted to try to really work on my voice. She gave me a little bit of advice and every day since then I'm always practice and saying every day. I don't exactly know where it'll bring me but all I know is I enjoy entertaining and making people smile with the sound of my voice.\n  \n  This is something that I'm very passionate about. I love to sing. When I am down, I sing it always cheers me up. Of course other things do too but this simple thing always turns my day around. Because it is something I enjoy to do.\n  \n  I have sang for many different places and people. Many different events. I have sang for schools, churches, football games, karaoke, night bars, at funerals and way way more.\n  \n  I was going to do some sort of American Idol type thing but I decided not to. There's so much mone,  traveling and time and so many sacrifices you have to make and in the end you could not succeed. It's a really big thing to take. Risk.

I think they were just jealous. Maybe it was b\/c the way I looked? Who knows? ? lol my appearance was a little intimidating people told me but I never understood why. My other nickname was the crazybigbootywhitegirl. ? Idky my butt wasn't\/isn't that dang big. I think they were just messing with me. Some. Or maybe I am wrong? Idk. I think the crazy part because I never really let anyone pick on me or at least I tried. So I guess that's why they would call me crazy? Cause alot of people wouldn't say nothing back.\n  ","39410":"\n  Pancakes are okay.\n  \n  But my favorite are waffles! When I make my waffles.\n  \n  I like chocolate chips and a little bit of melted chocolate syrup in the batter.\n  \n  I add a little bit of sugar and a little bit of salt.\n  \n  And then I cook it down and it's perfect tasting.\n  \n  Then on top I like to put a little bit of butter and syrup.

This year we stay for the second half. So it felt like we were at 2 parades. It was also to people's birthdays. So it was a pretty good party.\n  ","39414":"\n  I really admire random acts of kindness. Loyalty is a very big thing for me. Trust. Having people's backs. When I tell you to not say something about something I trust that you aren't going to say anything unless of course it jeopardizes my life or yours. That is different. But sometimes people like to hear things from you and then go tell the world. If I tell you something it's in between me and you only. Vice versa. If you tell me something it's going to stay with me unless of course it jeopardizes me or your life. In that way I am caring for you.\n  \n  I enjoy confidence in a person.

I went and put a review up saying...\n  \n  Like... If you guys need us to download the app first before making the quiz then you need to make it to where that sequence of events happens 1st. Like... It say... DOWNLOAD 1ST THEN START YOUR QUIZ HERE or something?? If you allow people to make a quiz before downloading it and it not work.... then we spend all the time making a quiz and then it not work?! What's the point! Because I made a quiz for about an hour and 15 min or longer and I submitted it and then all the sudden the page decided to not work? Not load? Have an error? Why didn't it at least save it or something? Draft? In a tab? Idk! Then when I went back on the tabs and everything? Nothing. Gone.\n  \n  I was really angry and was not going back and restarting. Plus, I wasn't going to remember half of my answers that I originally had. I probably wasn't going to even remember all 10 questions. But the quiz was hilarious. Because some of the questions we're well thought-out and so are their answers. Some of the questions had five to six to seven answers just to make it interesting.\n  \n  But I figured it out.. AFTER THE FACT. Lol.... I think I was supposed to download the app first, but like! UGH why did it give me the option to go ahead and make a quiz first?! that's my thing?! If they know it's not gonna for some?! Or worse everyone? Why have that error?! Why not fix it?! It's clear that it's there! Dangit. Lol. Cuz I thought that maybe I can make the quiz and then it go ahead and register me and then start like a regular app would right? Nooooo. Ohhhh noooo. THAT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE AT ALL. Lol I'm not really that mad. More laughing at how stupid... Ughh. More aggravated with the fact that I took almost an hour doing it. Also because I'm an admin\/page owner\/creator too and I just don't know how people can miss such simple things like that and not fix them? Ya know what I mean? Like come on man! Whatever. DX FUK.\n  ","39421":"\n  I can but it depends on what is going on.\n  \n  I get really overwhelmed easily with most asking.

Sometimes it can cause me to have a really bad panic attack and get really frustrated and overwhelmed.\n  \n  So I can definitely multitask, even some hard things, but really... I only simple things to multitask with. My brain can only handle so much. If that makes any sense?\n  ","39422":"\n  You want to know something? I went ahead and made me one right?

But usually when you get your ears pierced at first usually only start with really small stubs in your ears. It helps for cleaning and irritation less. Plus you have to change them and clean your ears and I don't think you want to keep changing out earrings that are hanging and stuff like that. Plus hanging earrings my irritate your ear at first. Plus it's good to learn with the regular little stubs first. Unless you are already familiar with putting in and removing earrings.\n  ","39434":"\n  I thought they were all really cute. You can get your ears pierced in real life you know this? Unless they don't do this there. They don't hurt that bad. But I wouldn't know. I've never gotten my ears pierced before although I have tattoos and they don't hurt. I'm sure they wouldn't hurt that bad if you got some. But the only thing is you got to make sure you take care of them very well.

Think... is this worth it? Getting angry or frustrated over? And then I think no. Get over it.\n  ","39546":"\n  You know... I think it's really ironic that I just talked about this in an answer and I didn't see this question until just now right after I answered the question the way that I did. Because I am actually on holiday in south, in Louisiana visiting family and friends and celebrating the wonderful celebration in the South, part of the culture I was raised in two, we are celebrating Mardi Gras. If you are unsure what Motocross is I explained it in the answers way below if you want to scroll a bit. I also explain what king cake is. It's a popular baking item that we serve during the time of Mardi Gras down here.\n  \n  I'm having a blast.\n  \n  We just went to the Myrtles very popular haunted Plantation down here in the South. It is top 10 most haunted places in the USA and I got to go to it. Louisiana's most haunted place. I have been having a blast the past couple of days. Spending time with family and friends and reconnecting with people and nature. I'm really enjoying it.\n  \n  But yet answer your question I am kind of trying to take a small break from social media and focus on family that I don't get to see all the time. I love my family from Louisiana. Also love my family from Mississippi. But I don't get to see them from Louisiana a lot so when I do get to visit the few days that I do or the week that I do I try to spend as much time as I can with my peoples I don't get to see a lot and less time online. It's nice to take a small break but I still come on a little bit. I don't cut out cold turkey because I don't want to leave y'all hanging.\n  \n  But yes. Sometimes it's nice taking a break from social media for a little while. Especially YouTube. I also uploaded about 8 to 10 new videos if anybody wants to check that out. One being a Spirit Box session at the Myrtles Plantation home. Check it out the video is raw and awesome! Another one being some videos of Mardi Gras down where Another one being some videos of Mardi Gras down where I visited. Another video being a beautiful beach.\n  ","39547":"\n  I usually am always constantly active. Just the past couple days I have been visiting family in a different state. I don't get to see them a lot so I am trying to spend as much time as I can with them before I go back home. So I'm trying to spend a little less time on social media and a little bit more with them. How to get is quite more important. Considering every day I get on this app and all my phone. Just try to click with dater in family I guess. But yes I am active everyday multiple different times of the day on here. I enjoy being. I do not find it a job. I enjoy coming on here and talk to you guys and answering and asking y'all questions.

He also likes to sleep nearly on top of my face every single night and morning. He loves his mama. He loves his dad too. Same with the other dog.

I want to apologize and let you guys know that I know not mean to repeat myself in the answer. My phone is just being strange I guess. It's also not letting me copy and paste my question. Which is odd. Idk. It has it's days I guess. Idk. Lol.\n  \n  I hope that you all enjoyed the answer. Because this really is my dream bathroom.\n  ","39645":"\n  ? Umm idk honestly.\n  \n  A King Cake is a circle like, oval like, snake type looking cake. It's a donut kind of cake. Usually inside of it will be some sort of jelly or just bread. King cakes usually contain cinnamon. Which those types I can't have. But that is what your average traditional king cake contains. But when I order one I usually order mine without cinnamon. It just depends on what you want. There are hundreds of different types of King Cakes you can have. Including the famous and traditional praline King Cake.\n  \n  Usually a King Cake can be about 1-2 ft long and a foot wide and the center is empty. They usually decorate the cakes with beads and on top there is usually icing and sprinkles. The king cake colors are green yellow and purple. Usually inside a King Cake will be a hidden little toy baby when you were eating it it's very obvious when you get the baby and if you get the baby then that means that you have to buy the next king cake. So say you're in a group of 20 people and everybody gets a slice whoever gets the baby has to buy the next king cake for them all for the next time. For the next celebration. Well of course there are different ways that everyone does it purpose is usually the everyday traditional way in doing it.\n  ","39646":"\n  I am really not sure with what picture you are referring to... considering I have posted about four different pictures of food... But maybe I will guess.. you're referring to maybe (but idk.. not sure which pic you mean..) but.. one of the pictures is a country fried steak. That is not pork. Is steak. That is just fried steak basically. It's a popular food in the South. It's actually really really good all it is is just a battered steak.\n  ","39647":"\n  We just rearrange the room and stuff so everything looks a different and new.

Thanks for sharing.\n  ","39650":"\n  The oceans down here in the Gulf War kind of contaminated so we're not really able to swim down here anymore like we used to. So I'd rather swim in rivers lakes ponds and pools. Sometimes I even like to swim in the bayous. But it just depends\n  ","39651":"\n  They have ones here but we only have two stalls and the bathroom is like really tiny and completely not private. Only one sink and they never have napkins in there. And sometimes I don't have toilet paper... So like you have to like carry your own in your purse almost. Really sad.\n  \n  And the people around here are really gross. They clean the bathrooms... yes but these people will go in there and literally blow the bathroom up and it will be completely disgusting and gross and you can't use the restroom unless you clean the entire bathroom and when you go to the bathroom you have to pee you don't have time to sit there and take 10 15 20 sometimes... 30 minutes to clean the entire bathroom before going to the restroom. When you got to go you got to go. Especially considering when I go to the restroom I only have 3 minutes to get back to the front because I am a cashier I don't think if they would like it if I sat back there cleaning a bathroom.\n  \n  I wish they would make a bigger and wider bathroom with maybe four or five sinks and a couple of are dryers maybe? Or maybe just have more toilet paper and paper towels? Because when you go to the restroom there should always be more paper in there than needed. Better to have more than close to none. And at least have five or six stalls or something? More than 2?? Maybe 4? Sometimes I don't even go to the restroom there. We have a Subway right next door and I like to go there because their bathroom is extremely private and it is a single bathroom. But they have another single bathroom that is separate. That is nicer and more private. They never run out of paper and they always have paper towels. And is always cleaned. 85% of the time.\n  ","39652":"\n  Connecting with nature and creativity like picnics and going on boat rides and going fishing. Park walks. Bring pets. Doing things connecting with nature are always good ways to figure people out when you're our first with them. I find those kinds of dates the best but that's the kind of person I am. I'm not sure how the person you are with is like.\n  \n  Ummm... going to fun and productive places. Like museums but fun museums.\n  \n  Crazy enough. The zoo is the bomb when you're on a date. They have food and of course nature and animals are awesome.\n  \n  Going ice skating because you are trying something that you're not really the greatest that and they might not be either but if they are then they can help you. Working together is always a good thing and trying to connect with another person. Working together I've been trying to help one another not following your butt. Crazy enough that I can actually become pretty romantic.\n  \n  Sometimes taking them to a really beautiful spot around where you live at it's always a really good way to start a good first date or second date.\n  \n  Telling them what makes that place so special to you and why you took them there. Because you wanted to share that with them. And again... maybe bring a pizza or what are some kind of food that's delicious. Picnic time. Get you some cut fruit like a small mini mini fruit tray or something that's easy to tote and you can eat that with her. Cheese and crackers. Sammich! ?\u270c\n  \n  Boat rides are awesome first and second dates.\n  ","39653":"\n  I love Adam Sandler. He's one of my favorite actors.

I am not too picky of a person. But I'm not really a fan of oysters much. Don't like bananas. Not a a fruit pie person or a fruit Pop-Tart person. I'm not really a fan of jelly. Textures.\n  \n  There are a few other things I just can't think of anything atm.\n  ","39656":"\n  Double sinks with tons and tons of room. A huge mirror on the wall and then all around the mirror dark cabinets and cupboards you can put stuff on. And then there are really nice lights around the mirror and they are LED they can change colors. And there is light all up in the roof and walls. All LED again. It's one of those stretch hallways that has a closet in the middle. It goes from the bedroom closet to bathroom. And then a giant jacuzzi tub that is centered in the Middle with tons of room to walk around it and windows all surrounding it that you can open and close and then a giant jacuzzi tub that is centered in the middle with tons of run to walk around it and windows all surrounding it that you can open and close and make dark then it has a huge upper ceiling that has a skylight. A giant flat screen 4K TV on the wall. All waterproof. Then one more closet in the bathroom that is stretched down with tons of space. Some more cabinet space all around. A whole separate room with a bidet and toilet. Then a giant rain shower (8 by 10 space) with huge indoor seats and space and an indoor bar. The bathroom it's self being huge. And then a in wall speaker system to listen to music. Waterproof. And a place to put my phone in the shower that is completely waterproof.\n  \n  And then lastly in the shower there is a huge Rockside waterfall wall. Basically it looks like you are in a waterfall and you can step in it and the water just comes down like a waterfall so if you get tired of the rain shower you can use that as like a shower head but it's like a natural-looking shower head. It can make the water hot and cold and it can come down completely on your entire body. ??\n  \n  Yeah. ? lol that! would be aweome!\n  ","39657":"\n  Honestly I would just want to watch my favorite series with my husband.

We can celebrate it in many different ways. Usually with family and friends.\n  \n  Considering the South has a big melting pot. Full of hospitality and good soul food. Cajun and Creole folks. Good people.\n  \n  Mardi Gras is actually French for \"Fat Tuesday,\" also called Shrove Tuesday. It is the day before Ash Wednesday, which marks the start of Lent season leading up to Easter. During Lent, us may fast, and the name Fat Tuesday refers to the last day of eating richer foods before the leaner days of Lent begin.  Because during Lent we usually fast and give up things.\n  \n  Basically we are appreciating life and celebrating living before Lent. Lent is a sad time in the Church for us. If you want to know more about that please look it up. Respect.\n  \n  But Mardi Gras is just many different types of parades and parties, celebrations and cooking lots of food and spending lots of love and time with family and friends. During the parades people will throw candy, different types of stuffed animals and beads. Different types of gifts and even sometimes money. Even foods and drinks can be given out. Little Trinkets and toys for children. Hats and masks can be worn also. Usually there are nice floats and cars in the parade sometimes there are animals. People dressed up and more. There's usually lots of music everyone is having just a great time. A lot of the time people bring their animals to the parade also. Everything is supervised. Tho Mardi Gras can be dangerous you need to be careful with where you go and who you bring. Children need to be fully supervise the entire time. Be careful.\n  \n  We cook things like like shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e, jambalaya, or red beans and rice or fix something unexpected for a group of party guests like warm gumbo dip or stuffed catfish filets with a spicy r\u00e9moulade.\n  \n  We also have Crawfish Boil sometimes and have lots of side dishes for people. Sandwich trays vegetable trays fruit trays and more inside waiting.\n  ","39687":"\n  \u2764 I met Jason ? 6 years ago very unexpected on Xbox 360 on a game called Grand Theft Auto V. We were in a long distance relationship for four and a half years and we're very close friends. We battled through all the distance and obstacles. Made it to the Finishing Line. Never thought we would get there. But we kept fighting. Best friends. And now we are together ? and married and happier than ever and have two pups. It's crazy how things happen. Sounds like something out of a storybook.
