? idk the most i ve ever . . considering i have wwitnessed alooot alot . . . but i will share this . while visiting the myrtles plantation located out in the middle of nowhere in st francisville louisiana . we walked around a little bit got to go inside of the gift shop and visit people . we got to look at the property real well . we went on our nightly to worm and after we were allowed to walk around the property . we went and walked out on this bridge that they have there and halfway through walking on the bridge one of the people that i was with randomly started having a breakdown . the thing that is very ironic is basically where she started to freak out , the spot on the bridge , this is where a young man passed away from a very sad death . i believe that she was feeling his sorrow before he died . she was feeling what he felt before he died . sometimes on these paranormal investigations this will happen . you will feel what the spirit fell when it was dying . or what it was feeling when it was alive . which is usually something really angry or sad or traumatizing . in which i think this person was feeling he felt before he passed . the reason why i say this is because she said she did not understand why she started crying and panicking . she just said she started feeling really really bad and sad and she doesn t know why . i explained to her this and she didn t was like maybe you re right . but we will never know . considering this is just me telling you what happened to us . i was there with her and two other people . they witnessed it also . also while we were there another person sat down and was waiting for us and they got up , and started to run away because they said that they got touched . this is a lot of paranormal activity that happened at once . there s a lot of other stuff that happened but these were the two major things .","33869":"we really like going to the chinese buffet around here . we like their wong tongs and their sushi . the salmon there is really good too . they bake their salmon . they have pretty good simple seafood . down in south louisiana where i am from there is a really good china buffet that they have a night where you can have all you can eat seafood . but it s really expensive . for people it was almost dollars . you can have crab shrimp crawfish fish oysters . they have way more than this they also have tons of vegetables different types of sesame chicken rice noodles different types of potato and fried foods . they also have a dessert aisle and a salad tray aisle and sushi and cold shrimp . and then they have a place called golden corral but they don t have too much seafood there . but their food is good . i m sure that they have some choices . they have a place called mike anderson s and they have really good seafood platters there . i definitely recommend that place . i love going to oishi . they have the best sushi and hibachi place ever . there s a place called bayou bronze and they have very good dishes there including seafood dishes . that is what you see in the picture below is a dish from bayou bronze . eating at hooters is good . sometimes i even like to get the shrimp from popeyes . i love to get some boiled crawfish and sometimes they add corn sausage room sometimes if you ask for crabs they will throw that in two different types of vegetables onions mushrooms and way way more . there s a place over there where i used to live and it s called the jambalaya shop . they sell boiled crawfish and stuff i think and of course they sell pastalaya jambalaya and other types of things too . i m sure gumbo . potato salad . baked beans . and way more . there is another place in br called the voodoo cafe . very delicious food . i tried their red beans and rice and it was golden ! there are so many other places . this is just a few .","33870":"mhmm ?

us capricorn s , we are traditionalist , which means that we are not much of a fan of pda or anything that could end up being embarrassing for our other . even if our partner s actingclingy , sometimes we try our best to not embarrass them . but if they want a kiss or a hug or to hold our hands we will let them . but we only do it out of respect . though at the same time as capricorns do you like our attention from our partners . but we try our best not to be too clingy or embarrassing in public . but like i said more or less out of respect for our partner . that is some more on them .","33874":"god . he guides all zodiacs . but that s only if you believe . if not . that s okay . but he is truly the maker","33875":"can be","33876":"yeah . that is sad tho . some people need to watch what they re doing when they re driving . there are so many animals that get killed by cars every day","33877":"?

? if you allow people to make a quiz before downloading it and it not work . . . . then we spend all the time making a quiz and then it not work ? ! what s the point ! because i made a quiz for about an hour and min or longer and i submitted it and then all the sudden the page decided to not work ? not load ? have an error ? why didn t it at least save it or something ? draft ? in a tab ? idk ! then when i went back on the tabs and everything ? nothing . gone . i was really angry and was not going back and restarting . plus , i wasn t going to remember half of my answers that i originally had . i probably wasn t going to even remember all questions . but the quiz was hilarious . because some of the questions we re well thought out and so are their answers . some of the questions had five to six to seven answers just to make it interesting . but i figured it out . . after the fact . lol . . . . i think i was supposed to download the app first , but like ! ugh why did it give me the option to go ahead and make a quiz first ? ! that s my thing ? ! if they know it s not gonna for some ? ! or worse everyone ? why have that error ? ! why not fix it ? ! it s clear that it s there ! dangit . lol . cuz i thought that maybe i can make the quiz and then it go ahead and register me and then start like a regular app would right ?
