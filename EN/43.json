Be able to sit down and vent to them when you're upset about anything. Listen to one another. Always have trust for one another. Loyalty must be there. You have to have patience in any relationship.

You just always have each other's backs. Protecting each other from anything and everything. Being able to work together is a very important thing in a relationship. Be fair with one another. Give each other attention. Affection and romance. Have your own type of chemistry with one another. Make things interesting. Be spontaneous. Don't always do things the same. Surprise one another every now and then. If you get in an argument with one another step away take a moment out and then come back to one another and reason with each other and talk about it. Everything should be able to be worked out in a relationship. You should not stay mad at one another about anything. And final just love one another fully. Give it your all.

Over the years we lost communication with one another. I wish that I could talk to him again and know that he's doing okay. But idk. Who knows..\n  \n  __\n  \n  And I have a very big soft spot for special need folk, especially ones that don't know any better.\n  \n  If you know what I mean by that.\n  \n  Like for ex:\n  \n  When in high school one time at P.E. we were playing basketball and exercising and stuff and someone decided to start picking on one of the autistic fellos for no reason.\n  \n  This fello I think was autistic, on tendency has tantrums and he has certain ways that he has to do things.\n  \n  He does not like to share.\n  \n  He will attack you even and come at you if you don't leave him alone. He will even have outbursts and attack you randomly.\n  \n  He literally does not know any better and cannot fend for himself. Clearly... And this other kid in our class, he was making fun of him and trying to take the ball from him bothering him much as he could purposely trying to make him angry and he just wouldn't leave him alone..\n  \n  He was playing just fine on his own.. And this kid has to come over and bother him and make it a laughing manner? A joke.\n  \n  I actually got pretty pissed off and walked up to him and immediately squared up and defended the guy and I made it known that if he wasn't going to leave him alone that day I was going to beat his ash.\n  \n  I just don't appreciate people that take it as a way of joke for themselves.. considering the people with the disabilities never chose this life it was brought to them from birth.\n  \n  I take big deal in it.\n  \n  Keep being wonderful you. ?\n  \n  Always so nice!?\n  ","46862":"\n  Yeah!

But you better make it known that it's you. Sometimes people TP people's houses around here but it's usually because they don't like them and you can get in a lot of trouble for it.\n  \n  Me and four or five or I think it was six people at our school we were behind the school pranks and we TPed the hallway and dis a bunch of other stuff.

Just because I'm really open-minded and some people don't like people like that. I think people should be like that. I think it's cool to just respect everybody. That's more or less how I look at it.\n  \n  But when it comes to an argument I mean... unless it's really that important I usually just try to pick my fights very well. Most the time I just ignore people.\n  \n  Bur if someone tries to say something about me that is false and I'm right there, then I'm going to justify what it is and what the truth is.\n  \n  I'm not afraid to expose somebody. I'm not afraid to tell somebody something but I'm not going to sit there and get angry about something that's not worth it.\n  \n  But a lot of the times I just kill people with backs. Kill them with kindness. Or ignore them. Ignoring is the best comeback. Ignoring someone can piss somebody off completely.\n  \n  It is very hard to get me at a high temper and angry.\n  ","46881":"\n  I don't try to be particular about anything or be too opinionated.\n  \n  I try to like..

Find them.\n  \n  You don't have to do it exactly the way I'm saying. You can just put two pictures up and let him vote. You don't have to put a description at all, but to me I feel like it's better. But again you can do it however you'd like.\n  \n  Here's an example below of where you need to go to create the voting poll and this is an example of what you can do.

Then we save up a little bit of money and periodically throughout October, November and December gather gifts for one another and wrap them for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. We usually cook for Christmas day. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day we usually have some goodies for breakfast. Christmas Eve we always open one early gift. One my mom got us. And then Christmas morning anywhere from seven eight or nine in the morning we open gifts at the house and then around 10 to 11 we go to my Maw maw's and Paw paw's and we wait around an hour or two and then we open gifts there and eat and chit chat until about 1 or 2 or 3. Sometimes we will go to a few other families houses and friends houses and exchange gifts. Attend Christmas parties with the family and more.\n  \n  We usually decorating go all out for Christmas. Christmas is my favorite time of the year and is also when I was born. My mom said I was due for Christmas morning and I was a few days late. My birthday is on December 29th.\n  \n  Also you can never forget the Christmas music and Christmas activities! They're always there!\n  \n  I love the winter it's cool out. I love cold.

I think they should stick to the way that they do it as long as you're not beating the crap out of their children out of anger and hate.\n  \n  They are not neglecting child in anyway.\n  \n  I think it's important throughout the child's life to always try to regulate certain rules, morals, regulations and responsibilities in order to teach them when they get older what they need to do.\n  \n  Kids should be taught patients at every bit they can. Try to get kids to understand what self-respect is. Then to respect others also.\n  \n  Not to reward bad behavior. I see this so much. Yes raise your kids the way you want. But I think in any situation you should not reward bad behavior. That's just my opinion though.\n  \n  I'm sure these are all popular opinions... but these are the things that I feel like should be in kids lives while growing up.\n  ","46955":"\n  \u0130yi yap\u0131yorum.

I think people need to give themselves more credit. I once was by myself and everything was fine. It gives you time to figure yourself out. Focus on yourself. Adapt and take care of yourself.\n  \n  Of course over time you figure out what you were purpose is and you go with it. In life you'll find your soulmate sooner in and sometimes it takes a little longer. Sometimes you'll find out that being alone is better for you. Maybe just owning a pet or two. It just all depends.

To be hated by someone you 100% do not know, haven't ever done to before, have no affiliation with ever have is absolutely and utterly confusing, and slightly hilarious. Because most of the time it's based off of Envy or jealousy or because they don't like their life. Again Envy or jealousy. They are spoiled. Don't get their way.\n  \n  Or occasionally have something wrong with them mentally and they can't help it. That on the other hand is not a laughing matter. I take that seriously. I usually just try to brush it off and understand that they don't mean it.\n  ","46963":"\n  This, considering I took my time painting. I had a lot of fun painting this. I painted it with with sponges... lop rags... brushes (of all sizes) my fingers and other items.\n  \n  Took me a few years. (2?)\n  \n  As I said before I took my time with this painting. I enjoy it so much I would take breaks.\n  \n  I painted it for my husband and me. (For him)\n  \n  Him, always representing the blue and me representing the red. And we were in a long-distance relationship for 4 and 1\/2 years, finally ending it a little more than a year ago and getting married too! ?\n  \n  We've been together for 6 years. And what does blue and red make when they come together? purple which if you look really close underneath the heart where the blue and red come together it has a little bit of purple.\n  \n  Why does it have the saying.. \"Had me at Hello\"?\n  \n  Because it is just the same saying I've always said about him. He's always had me at hello. \u2764 It is saying that I've always said when we first started dating and I still say today. Sometimes I wish I could go back and meet him all over again.\n  \n  Absolutely love this painting. I look at it all the time and think back and think now and think the future. All wonderful. So excited to what has to come.\n  ","46964":"\n  I do have a lava lamp.\n  \n  I've had many in the past also.\n  \n  This was, I think the first gift my husband ever got me or I think it was the first Valentine's Day we spent together. One of the two or both.\n  \n  His favorite color is blue. So blue it always represented him and my favorite color is red so red as usually always symbolize me.\n  \n  So he got me this lava lamp and it is blue and the lava inside of it is red, so when it turns on the colors comes together and makes a purple pink. We were in a long distance relationship when he got this for me. We were always wanting to be together. So it was a very sweet and thoughtful gift.\n  \n  Plus I love lava lamps. They can keep you warm when you're freezing.\n  \n  I love the gift and still have it! I treated like a baby! Next, I want to get a black one that has white lava in it next! Or a glitter one! That would be cool!\n  \n  _____________\n  \n  You do have to take the caution with using\/having lava lamps. You do not want to have them on for too many hours. It usually takes about an hour and a half for them to actually make the lava move in them. After having them on for about 2-3 hours after the lava starts to move I would turn them off...\n  \n  Put lava lamps in an area where you know they're not going to fall and break because the chemicals inside of it are very harmful to the skin. (I'm sure) The eyes. (I'm sure) & obviously.. because it's hot. Plus you don't want to get that on your floor wall or carpet...  I would keep lava lamps away from anything plastic and metal related. Considering the hot heat couldn't heat up other metal and could melt the plastic around it.\n  \n  Yes you have to take precaution. But everything in life can be dangerous. Even a simple straw is becoming world-wide disastrous and dangerous. Lol.

Though not all ex relationships are horrible.\n  \n  I'm friends with a few of mine just because I grew up with some of them. But we aren't associated ALL time, every single day with one another... That is not good. No. And I don't want to be. That's my ex. But I'm not going to be ugly to anyone. I just check in every now and then with some of them. But that's a personal thing. I just like to make sure everybody's good. Some my exes have been troubled in life and some of them are moving along good with their life. All good to hear when someone is doing well at least. Even my husband is good friends with some of them. As I said not all exes are horrible. There are a few that I choose not to talk to? Yes. But I don't really mind talking about any of them. But some people may have went through way worse things than some of us. Some people have been raped, abused, practically killed, tortured, etc... You just don't know... but it definitely depends on how they're going about the situation. Because I mean anything could happen.\n  \n  What you're saying has different ways that it could go. But some people just might not be comfortable with talking about it.\n  \n  But definitely just don't assume too much. Assuming too much in a relationship can ruin a relationship. There should just be constant communication and trust.\n  \n  Maybe ask them what's the reason why they don't want to talk about it. Is it because they're uncomfortable? or is it because maybe they still like them? I mean... It's okay if it's still like them. Because that person might have been in a really good relationship with them and the other person just might have threw them out or something? Really sad.. But they don't need to be thinking about them fully like that anymore, they need to be moving on. Especially if they're in another relationship with you. I could see why you could be discouraged.

Prepare a simple Thanksgiving at home. I feel that people would want this. I wish I could have had it more in school because I like cooking. Even before I went to HighSchool I love to cook. And sewing is important. I don't care who says it's not. I feel like that is a small but important thing to know that comes in handy.\n  \n  If I could teach something in school.
