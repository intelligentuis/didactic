However if a random stranger just abandons their baby at the doorstep of someone else's and that person finds a baby by law you must report it to the police and let them have the child while they search for the parents and the reason why they abandoned their child. Their will also be an investigation in the case to see if there is any reason why she would abandoned the child.
