Going to the doctor and making sure that you're healthy. You take care of yourself. Try not to bite your nails. (I myself am working on) No drugs or nothing. Just natural. Not too much makeup. It's okay to wear base\/foundation every now or maybe to put some eyeliner on to bring out more features... or little eyeshadow or something...

There's always going to be obstacles. You just always have to be talking back and forth, constant communication is important in any relationship, but especially for a long distance relationship. We would always be video chatting and calling one another and playing video games with each other.\n  \n  And yes, yes we've had a lot of good experiences on the road in Louisiana and Mississippi. We met 6 years ago on Xbox 360 on GTA V randomly and unexpectedly. We played games for a while and right at the beginning we hit it off. We're really good friends and play games for a while and really started to like one another. About six or seven months dating we finally ended up meeting one another. We knew everything about each other's families both of our families liked each other. When we met it felt like any other day. It was awesome! Finally meeting.\n  \n  He's my best friend. Always has been.\n  \n  We have been married a little over a year. Been living here in Mississippi for about a year and a half. We will be celebrating our 6-year anniversary being together April 2nd.\n  \n  And yes it was really hard being in a long-distance relationship. At one point we were away from each other for 13 and a half months I think. That was reeeally hard going through. I always tell people nothings impossible if ya just try and set ya mind to it. Patience is definitely one that you have to have with a long distance relationship. It's never going to be easy. It may take two years 3 years 4 years or even five years until you get to be together or longer. You just have to be patient. Trust is another one. Loyalty.

Me and my husband travel down to south Louisiana about 4 to 6 times a year to see my family and friends. That's where I am from originally. But other than that me and him want to travel all over the United States of America. He can't really fly much and he doesn't like boats so if I was to visit anywhere outside of the USA I would have to visit alone or with a friend or family member. I hope to visit many places outside of America. But I do love to travel very much. My favorite way to travel is my car. I love her trips. I love visiting different gas stations and seeing some of the things that they sell. I like seeing different pawn shops and antique shops on the way. The Landscaping is beautiful. This sky's are awesome. The weather makes it interesting. We also bring my dogs occasionally. So they make the trip really fun and exciting. They have fun also. We like to stop a different rest stops and let them walk around and play with them. I want to one day travel from North Carolina all the way to California. That is a straight shot completely across USA. I would like to visit Alaska and Canada one day. I would like to visit the UK. I would also like to visit Australia and many different places within Australia. I wish to visit Japan, India, Malaysia, and so much more. Pakistan. Bangladesh. Brazil. Argentina.\n  \n  I want to go to Antarctica one day. But I really do love to travel.\n  \n  Me and my husband were in a long distance relationship for about five years so we constantly had to travel back and forth from where he lived and where I lived to see each other.

Learning them and about them. I try to dis-promote using them because 80% to 90% of hauntings are caused by them.. they cause nothing but negative energy and ruin people's lives. Even in the correct way of using them you're not sure who you're talkin to truthfully... If you were talking to something negative and unhuman it can follow you and caused a lot of grief in your life... it's very hard to get it away from you once it clings to you. I don't promote using them because they are no joke. They are hard to use also. Alot of those negative energies make people go insane and do things that they're not even meaning to do and they turn into really dangerous people. Black out.

Things you'd never believe that could happen.\n  \n  One of my user names I go by is Bella Ouija. Because I want people to talk to me about the boards so I can tell them these things.
