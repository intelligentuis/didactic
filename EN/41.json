baby cries it may not even be really you . it just might be them upset about something like being hungry or tired or going to be changed . they can be hurting with their teeth . bored and wanting attention . crying from being uncomfortable . may not be feeling well . one never knows considering they don t speak because they re so young . other times it could be your fault but not meaning to be . you may not be holding the baby correctly the way they want to be at the moment . try changing them . you could be late on her changing . they use the restroom randomly . you can change them in minutes later they use the restroom again . they could go hours without using the restroom . you have to continuously check them . keep up to date with their shots and doctor visits . they could not feel well . when s the last time you fed them ? what did you feed them ? they may not have had enough or they could be ready to eat again . so much .","37931":"thanks . you too . hope your day has gone well .","37932":"of course . they are nice .","37933":"a week that is fully dedicated to our pets . i would like this very much .","37934":"every christmas eve we open a present under the tree . one usually from my mom . one that she s really excited about us opening and she can t wait so we open it for her and it makes her very happy . may i remind you , i have three sisters so there was four of us . so four happy faces , presents from mama are the best . the reason why we were always so excited about opening that present is because it s mostly the present that best describes us from her so it s very special . very sweet . christmas is not always about getting and giving but when it does come to that and this is what it means to us . it s very special to my family . in this way . another good thing that we do is every christmas morning when we used to wake up my grandfather would be waiting on the porch petting the dog the dog at the time that we have is a very good dog . her name is angel , golden retriever and was my mama and grandfathers baby . she loved him very much . my family and my grandfather and we would go out and visit him for a few minutes before opening the christmas presents in the living room from santa . he would watch us open our presents . we would wake up around or in the morning and open presents . check out what santa had brought us , check out the stockings . open the presents and then we would all go lay down for a little bit . we would either have donuts or breakfast or beignets in the morning . then we would play with our stuff for a little while and then go to my grandmother s around in the morning and do christmas with the entire family together . the family would get together and socialize . the younger ones would play outside or with toys in the living room at my grandmother s . have fun and catching up with each other . open the presents from one another . and then go house to house and visit people . sometimes we may go out at the end of the day it just depends . go and look at houses with the christmas lights out . that is a tradition . making christmas cookies together .","37935":"? just do ? idk how to answer this

area because it seems that everybody s dating one another and it s odd . but like people that just randomly hook up with people without even getting to know them is not good i feel . i have seen it happen to different people and it usually never works out . it takes time and patience . you have to get to know a person and their family , their background , the environment that they live in and how they are before just meeting up with them . a relationship is something very special . you re supposed to make it very special . to help it last and stuff . and so much more . i say , if you did online be extremely careful . you shouldn t be online if you re not going to try to take the certain types of precautions . just meeting up with random people can also get you sick , give you stds , and can be deadly in the end . can meet up with someone that s completely insane .","37943":"i honestly wouldn t want to travel in time .","37944":"i feel being there for one another and listening and

mucus in your lungs prob . it sounds like it hut i idk . . i am not there . i could probably tell if i was there . but if you have mucus in your lungs . . it s irritating them and causing you to cough a lot . when you re sitting up the mucus isn t just sitting there . when you set up a may take about minutes for you to calm down . usually you have to go to the doctor and get steroids or something for it . they usually prescribe you a type of mucus dm if you re able to take it and give you breathing treatments . even after all of that you usually have a bronchial cough for almost a month before it goes away . . . that s about all they do for bronchitis . at least for me . you can get you some tea and raw honey and lemon . i m not sure how old you are but some people use wild turkey or some type of whiskey and put it in there a little bit helps numb your throat if your throat is hurting . if your throat is not hurting then it s probably a bronchial thing . then what you would have to do is probably what i said above before the tea and lemon part . i am not a doctor i am just telling you based off of experience . i would more than likely go to a doctor and ask them first . but if you are having sinus problems and your throat hurts and that s why you re coughing i use ricola cough drops that help numb your throat too . vitamin c and d . maybe some mints . chloraseptic spray . dm medicine . sinus medicine . that s about all the remedies i can think of at the moment . i hope that i helped . do you remember both paragraphs or two different types of coughs . those are ways to

cultures in the world other than their own in which they were raised through . foreign cultures , and which i would like to see as many as i can before i go . i love different culture . i find it so interesting . i get a type of joy from learning another person s culture and living in it and accepting it . i get some sort of peace feeling like . you don t understand how wonderful it is to have someone accept your culture and like it . it is so respectful .","38377":"same with you from me . i believe in ya .","38378":"eh . . depends . because people usually roast cajun folk in the comments . ? at the same time i don t really care but , we do things very strange and different when cooking . down to trying raw meat when it s seasoned . down to smelling the food and trying food when it s cooked and not cooked . punching and throwing ingredients around based off of thought and gut feeling . sometimes just knowing how much you re supposed to put . though that s how life is and everybody is a critic but . . . i already have a youtube channel where i put all kinds of things on it . mostly the vloggs of my life . bellamariestarswan is my channel .","38379":"thank you kindly for all the sweet words . i really do love to cook . i enjoy teaching people too . i also like cooking things kind of a little crazy like . . . ? . . . like crawfish . when you get them they re alive still so it

and some of them are just having a blast playing with them . and at the end of the day when you cook them they re delicious . you see the smiles on people s faces .","38380":"sure . your at the right

.","38390":"you are not the problem . people do not see different a lot . some people are not raised to where they mind those who cannot help the way that they were born the way that they are . just look at it as that . people have a lot of insecurities . when i get the opportunity to pick on whoever they can they do it . it s a way of making them feel better for some reason . that s where malicious people come from . sometimes they don t even realize they re doing it . they re so full of themselves that they don t even care to listen to anyone . it s almost like they can t help it themselves and they have a problem of their own . maybe look at it like that .","38391":"thanks . though i didn t really exactly answer your question . my most favorite dish would have to be homemade macaroni and cheese . i also really like homemade stuffing . usually two kinds . i love chicken and rice dressing . i really enjoy a nice homemade pie . my grandmother when she was alive she used to

question . also , i followed you back . thank you for following me ! you rock !","38392":"you re not . i enjoy talking to you . you are a good friend of mine . do not feel that you are annoying . if

bring you down . socializing is a very healthy part of life .","38393":"usually will sit here and decorate the entire house the day after thanksgiving . if we feel really festive we will decorate a

will put the nativity scene up somewhere in our house or outside . we will go every now and then and go christmas shopping or window shopping to see what they want . take a few days to wrap presents and put them under the tree . by candy canes and put them on the tree . every day counting down to christmas we eat a candy cane off the tree . we do stocking stuffers and candy and each stocking . put a favorite candy of each person in their stocking . at least three or four stocking stuffers . usually get everybody a few presents . everybody gets to open one present on christmas eve . we wake up around , or in the morning and open christmas presents and then go to my grandparents and open more with the entire family and enjoy dinner and talk to everybody . since i live in mississippi now we don t really do that . will either go a few days before christmas or after christmas and do that . also since my grandparents have passed now we just go to my mom s and then after we go to different family members houses . we still cook for christmas eve and christmas . this is just a few traditions that we do . we usually do at least of these every year . i absolutely love christmas .

jean","38439":"i don t really think any of this is really too heroic but it s something that we should all keep notice to . and to what exactly ? anything and everything . because anything and everything can happen . life is short . people take it for granted . healed many wounds . and also help people heal wounds over the phone . caught people from falling . watching the road when someone wasn t and warning them that something is about to happen and they maneuvered a way to avoid . if i wouldn t have told them way more than likely would have crashed . taking care of as many animals . help people they don t have anything . feed people . keep people clothed . helping people through natural disasters .","38440":"swimming with dolphins . money and getting there","38441":"attitude . smell .","38442":"to live it as stressless as possible and at the fullest extent . going with the flow .","38443":"it definitely depends . sometimes i just like going with the flow and then other times i do like to plan things out .","38444":"eh . . can be . depends . . . it depends on if your family members are doing something to upset your friend s . at the end of the day it really shouldn t matter if they accept your family , they really should just accept you . of course if they meet your family they need to remember to be respectful regardless . especially to adults . it doesn t matter if they accept them or not . but if the family members are being downright ugly to your friends or maybe your friends see some sort of mental or physical abuse being done from your family towards you and they feel that you are unsafe . then i could see why they might not want to accept them . . . it definitely depends . if they feel concerned that i need to go to a higher up or some type of authorities if they feel that you are unsafe . but at the same time they need to take this situation seriously cuz this is life and that is your family . they need to have evidence and be very serious about their approach to upper higher authority . aka reporting . but if the people your friend s are just being disobedient to certain rules and regulations that you re family members have , then that is the part where it depends because that definitely does not matter as into the person that is your friend . they should accept your family members as so with their rules and regulations . especially towards you in safety terms . i hope that you understand my answer . this also can be good advice towards dating . if you are dating someone and they don t accept your family and by the rules and regulations then there is something wrong . but at the same time that everyone gets along and it could literally be over nothing . sometimes people just don t like certain people . and also sometimes parents get jealous when they see their baby growing up . it s hard for them to catch reality that they are growing up . again i hope that you understand my answer .","38445":"jason ? always","38446":"haha .","38447":"oh okay .","38448":"when we were in the process of decorating the christmas tree .","38449":"i miss so many of them . i definitely miss the playstation one . there s

.","38455":"yeah and i also recommend the muscle rub and icy hot because they re good too . the only thing about icy hot is you have to like apply at every hour for it to work . plus icy hot only really affects the top layer of your skin and underneath a little . this works , bengay . maybe try to see if your doctor can prescribe you some muscle relaxers . but usually you have to get a high dosage for them to work .","38456":"i like paranormal and adventuring type videos . i like to watch cooking videos . people doing different types of challenges . i really love music . i love the vlogs

uncomfortable . i can t really see that well anyway at night . around or so i can t really drive at night . but the reason why i mostly don t drive is because of this really bad incidences that have

weeks , significantly improved the mice s memory . the treatment also reduced some of the harmful physical changes in the brain that are associated with the disease . they are totally trying to take control of alzheimer s disease . no , it is not just in elderly folks , it is also common and young folks . though it does affect more of people years or older , it can affect others too . alzheimer s
