relationship , made people feel bad about themselves , made my teacher cry , said mean stuff . . . . you get the idea . . .","803992":"no","803993":"she aight","803994":"i don t swim at all , so i

thin so i look a bit younger probably , but i m . i m super chill , easy going , tomboy and i like to laugh and makes other laugh . i also like marvel movies , dance , music and computer coding . i m a bit quiet and socially awkward at first but i try not to be . just looking for someone who enjoys being with me as much as i do with them .","804004":"sorry , i don t own a tumblr acc , but just to let you know , the amount of followers you have doesn t define your importance","804005":"the way society is , the way school in designed , my failures . .","804006":"i m not","804007":"had a pretty

private like instagram","804011":"i was giving you the real answer . it s not always the one you want","804012":"because you asked","804013":"no , but i have given my number to a person that i met on a bus once who told me i looked like a cool person and we talked for a bit .","804014":"happiness","804015":"no , it means you murdered him","804016":"never tried it","804017":"parks and recreation

like randomly or demanding . . . . unless you think that will work out for you better","804021":"i m not much of a movie person tbh , so i ve hardly watched any movies and my favorite out of what i watched has been probably spiderman far from home and endgame and the incredibles was good too i guess","804022":"well , that is a loaded question . . . . . if i were to talk about everything in detail , it would be a lot of text that you probably wouldn t want to read it , but basically it s family , school , fear , self hate , anxiety , lost , lonely , ashamed , failing , pressure , abandoned , unmotivated , tired , anger , hurt , invisible , longing for what i never will get . . . .","804023":"no gossip about me makes me laugh . but i don t believe i ve heard any gossip about me ever . i m not popular","804024":"he s not better looking than you . and if you like him , go for it .","804025":"hey ! pretty bad , unfortunately . how bout you ?","804026":"i would anyone a chance who makes me happy , laughs at my jokes , cares , listens and loves","804027":"sorry , i don t get the question","804028":"neither unless the self driving cars have tested and proved to be safe on the road bc i don t want to hurt anyone else while i m in one","804029":"ohh there s so much i would love to hear rn that i will never hear in my life","804030":"well this is sort of a personal question bc i feel like everyone s answer will vary based on how they are as a person . personally , i don t have very many friends at all so out of desperation , i say yes to pretty much anyone who asks for my number which is like no one that doesn t seem like deranged or something . but if i was more picky , the biggest thing for me is probably genuineness . the people i would like to be friends with get to know better are people who are free from judgment and are very geniune . i find that a lot of people tend to be fairly fake . they act one way around some people and change around others or they lie to please different people . . . . i like people who are just themselves and are loving , accepting and friendly no matter what , not just if you look pretty or handsome fit the society s social norms or not just if they like exactly what you like or are smart or are a certain race , etc . so i am a lot more likely to want to befriend someone who is like that and someone who i feel like i can relate to in some way so i know we will get along . but ik a lot of other people out there aren t like that and some will say they are , but aren t . . . it s that genuine thing","804031":"crossant i guess sorry , idk how to spell it","804032":"ahh i see have you tried finding him on social media ? like facebook messanger , instagram or snapchat for example ? because that s a good way to start conversation . by messanging him from there and saying something like ive seen you around . . . . i m insert name , etc . bc i feel like just slipping someone a note and then disappearing could potentially be giving someone the wrong message","804033":"cool haha . you re probably gonna regret letting me tho bc my best advice is to not mess around with notes or flirting or anything , just talk to the person and try to get to know the person and if that s going well , trade off numbers . i would say you re more likely to get genuine messages from someone who feels like they know you and if they don t want to talk or trade numbers after knowing you better , the results gonna be the same if they don t know you , so there s nothing to lose either way , just more to gain by talking in person .","804034":"i m not a guy , but i m gay . . . . . would my opinion be valid ?","804035":"pretty horrible in many different ways","804036":"not sure honestly . one or two i think , but maybe i haven t . . .","804037":"of she asked me verbally i d be much more likely to give mine and text back . bc she didn t in this hypothetical situation , i would text her back if she seemed like a cool person . if she didn t seem like someone i would want to hang out with as at least a friend , i wouldn t bother","804038":"sure , he s cool i guess","804039":"sure","804040":"because i want questions from anyone and everyone . i like to hear what people are interested in knowing","804041":"to turn invisible","804042":"being with the perfect

i keep it to myself bc ik there s nothing she can do . talking about it with anyone honestly just feels more depressing bc no one gets it","804049":"never","804050":"so truee","804051":"i ain t

that would be rude . but i wish i could understand certain people better","804087":"i dont really follow football so i wouldn t know","804088":"yeah , i feel that . no , i m not , but to explain

them","804143":"stop dreaming","804144":"go on my phone","804145":"it depends on what the waiting is for . when i originally answered the question , i thought waiting was meaning waiting to have sex . if waiting means waiting until you re in a relationship with someone , yeah , i would call it faithful .","804146":"oh okay , i think i get it . you re saying if there was a long time gap in between when one person had sex with one person and another , would it be faithful bc they waited all that time in between , i think . if that is what you re saying , yeah , i think that could be called being faithful","804147":"i m still confused haha . if the other waited and slept , doesn t that mean they didn t wait bc they slept with someone ? and are these hypothetical people married to each other ? who was the other person pretending to sleep with ?","804148":"are you talking about like an open relationship ? or being cheated on ? sorry i don t get the question","804149":"well it depends on what they mean by waited bc if they are saying waited for sex , then they are lying . i think sex is more about lust","804150":"i don t know but i m not a big eater so it probably doesn t apply to me","804151":"no","804152":"holding hands is pretty common too . but i prefer holding hands","804153":"no , but i think some of them try to backup those morals","804154":"taller cus i m really

, we really should meet , that would be fun ! i m really tired now from doing absolutely nothing all day so imma knock out for the night . goodnight !","804172":"the uw . you ? and yeah about the timed tests . they are just another layer of stress and are pointless bc school is supposed to be about learning . why should it matter how fast we learn something or how fast we can do it after we just learned it ? if we eventually understand it , that s what should matter and if we don t , the teacher prob sucks . i ve been pretty anxious about starting school again . idek know when it s starts tbh . i think sept . but i haven t bothered checking haah . i had my first severe anxiety attack a couple weeks ago and had to go to the er , like i feel like that should be a sign that something isn t right about the stress level of college students these days . . . .","804173":"controlling thinking they are superior","804174":"zendaya bc she s awesome in every way . i feel like all i need to do is say her name and i ve explained enough . everyone loves her and if they don t , they have personal issues . aight that was harsh . . . . but i really like her haha .","804175":"computer science . the subject is a big interest to me , i ve been into it for a while now , but the cs classes and program requirements at my school are difficult and the major is super competitive so it s hasn t been very fun lately . . . plus i m not a very good timed test taker . i wish i could take the quarter off , but my housing had already been paid for and it costs money to withdraw it","804176":"we really do haha . i m down to meet fr though . sociology is what my brother is studying . sounds like we re in the same boat though for how school is going for us . have you started school already for the fall term yet ?","804177":"same tbh . when i came home for summer i said i didn t want to go back . my friend and i were talking possibly dropping out and doing a project together , but i can tell that s not what my family wants me to do and they have a point that i will most likely be more successful with a degree . it s just been very stressing . last yr was my freshman yr and it didn t go so well . what are you studying ?","804178":"i do work and school too . i only work part time though bc school completely drains me . my interests are mainly listening to music , sleeping , writing , drumming , computer coding , making people laugh and dancing d","804179":"anxiety and depression","804180":"because they don t get paid enough for the boring crap they have to do and bc of that , people are tired and angry and then become disrespectful to each other , only spreading more angriness and more hate . that s just one instance . but ofc it varies . some people hate their jobs bc their bosses are discriminative , some people hate them bc the people they serve are rude , some people hate them bc they work in crappy conditions , some people hate them bc they are extremely exhausting . . . . it all depends .","804181":"china i think . . . . . ?","804182":"so what do you do ? what are your interests ? do you work full time , go to school ?","804183":"i don t . i just sink deeper and deeper","804184":"no time of day","804185":"yes true . i might go back in december for few days so weather should be a lot better d . and it s cause my family is complicated . . . did you grow up here in seattle ?","804186":"it was great bc it s where my mom lives and all her kids my siblings and i got to see them all for the first time in a long time and got to meet nieces and nephews i hadn t met before . i wish i could go back just to be with all of them . but i didn t really get to explore much or anything bc of the heat . we had to stay inside pretty much all the time . we went to a park at one point , but didn t stay for that long","804187":"yeah i suppose so . although honestly i wouldn t mind if the power went out for a bit . plus it was nighttime anyway . and yeah , it s nice to have the low s degree weather back . i went to texas at one point this summer and it was like degrees there but it actually wasn t as bad as here bc they have air conditioning in their houses . in seattle summertime i m always having to sit right next to fan and if i move anywhere else i m sweating","804188":"ikr haha . yeah , but it came back on like immediately afterwards .","804189":"geez , i live in seattle too . yeah it was . i like the rain so i was happy to have it back after all the degree weather . the power went out for like seconds where i live","804190":"whaaat ? where in washington are you from ? did you get the storm last night ?","804191":"washington , us . you ?","804192":"samee","804193":"midnight , hbu ? and aww . how old are

living their best lives . and ironically , they seem to get more stuff for free than anyone else","804204":"i wouldn t date a guy haha . but i would let a girlfriend look through my phone if she wants

really","804455":"yeah , it s a valid question . i don t think they will be called african europeans precisely because europe is a continent while when we refer to americans we refer to the country .

engaging for users so that it isn t so dry all the time","804582":"eats me out ?","804583":"lips and cheeks","804584":"scientifically i believe everyone does by doing . but i like to watch and then try","804585":"shy but cordial","804586":"nothing great ever happens","804587":"my brother , but i have one for my adoptive mom that i will give her today","804588":"shoot me","804589":"short , but i m not romantically attracted to people of the opposite sex","804590":"failing","804591":"that s what people say but after experience , i just don t feel that way . i really wish i could love myself . but i can t . i hate myself and i hate being me and idk how to change that myself . i feel stuck trapped helpless hopeless . the only reason i haven t killed myself yet is bc of zendaya . she s my idol and i love her to death literally and i want to watch her new movie and show before i die . so hopefully i can be patient enough until mid august .","804592":"i want to stop caring about what others think but i can t help it . that s a lot of what triggers my anxiety . idk how to stop . and i feel like i can t love myself if no one else does . why should i ? if i m not good enough for anyone else then why should i be good enough for myself ? it s other people s words and actions that make us feel loved and belonging not our own . only other people can validate us bc if no one likes us but ourselves , we won t get anywhere . i wish i could enjoy my life but i can t bc i feel all these things and i can t help it . i ve lost all hope bc whenever i would feel hopeful , life smacked reality into my face and set me x farther down into my hole then i already was . being hopeful leads to too much pain bc i will always get hurt . nothing ever goes right . so now i m just waiting to be freed from this terrible world and all this pain , loneliness and sadness .","804593":"i like being myself and i need that dedicated time to myself . but i also need friends and someone to trust and talk to . so sometimes i m ok by myself and other times it s horrible . i want to have the option . but i typically don t take myself out . maybe i should try . i always feel like people are gonna judge me if them see me , especially people i know . and also when i m out it s hard seeing people out together laughing and messing around and eating together etc bc i really wish i could have that","804594":"i wish i could do i what would make me happy . i wish i could do that on the world . that s the dream ofc . but life is not like that for me . i try not to be alone but it s not that simple . not everyone can just exist and then make friends easy . i ve tried so hard . i joined clubs , i ve pushed myself , i ve met people , but in the end they leave me . everyone else has other friends and don t need me so they don t care . i join things but then i feel left out and they make me feel alone . other people join with friends so they have someone and then no one talks wants to talk me bc they don t know me . i auditioned for the school drumline but i probably won t even make it in . life is always like that for me . and even if i did , it turns out i have a scheduling conflict that i may not be able to fix . i tried joining the bsu and went to meetings for over a month , but always felt so isolated and different whenever i was there so i quit . i tried volunteering at a cs class but then there was a scheduling conflict and i had to stop . . . . . i could go on . the point is we can t control our own lives . people tell us that and they think it s true but it s not . some people just get to be happy while other s either can t be or have to lower their expectations so excessively to the point where being lonely makes you happy .","804595":"so many reasons that would is way too long for an ask answer to explain . but i ll say a bit . . some people get to be blessed or more blessed while others have to suffer and barely get by . . some people are born fitting the mythic norm while others don t and are therefore subject to more discrimination , hate , bullying , depression , isolation , feeling unloved by society , etc . . you can t be whatever you want or whatever you put your mind to when you grow up . people tell you that when you re children but the truth is in most of those cases you need to have a lot of money and or be ridiculously smart . not everyone is like that . some people take time to learn things , some people have disabilities , some parents don t have great jobs , sometimes life accidents happen that can destroy your future , sometimes people make mistakes they didn t mean to , sometimes people study work really hard and try their best but they still can t achieve it . . of people at most who apply at my university get into the cs program . that s crushing of people s dreams . . there s a lot of pressure , especially on young people to do everything right and be the best and accomplish all these achievements . . introverts are less likely to get into programs , schools , jobs , pretty much anything they apply for even though they are not any less capable than extroverts . being a quiet person is not a defect . . some people have so much hate in them and don t care about dragging others down and destroying them with their words . . discrimination , police brutality , racism , sexism , homophobia , xenophobia , gun violence , massacres . i don t think that needs explanation . okay that was a lot and that s just scratching the surface . but point is , i hate life and i want to die . i m tired of living in this cruel and unforgiving world . i don t get blessed and i never feel happy . i constantly feel lonely , anxious , worried , tired , alone , hurt , not good enough , ugly and most of all , sad .","804596":"i m on summer but not particularly enjoying it . i m kind of stressed out from an incident two days ago and i m nervous about a few things and i don t get much of a break before i have to start working . so yeah , summer kind of sucks . but school sucks too . so basically life just sucks .","804597":"in washington","804598":"i get a lot more sad bc i m never loved back or even looked at twice for that matter","804599":"keep unpacking and organizing and maybe do some computer science and go to my old high schools graduation to watch some people that i knew last year graduate","804600":"yeah definitely","804601":"nope","804602":"oh i definitely have someone in mind but i m not gonna name them . they feel so fake honestly . i m not sure if they actually are always busy or just lying to stay away from me but idk why , bc i m not a mean or bad person","804603":"i m not even close to tennessee , but life does suck .","804604":"sure","804605":"can you introduce me

an ass . even god .","804714":"dark , you ?","804715":"sure","804716":"read this clearly . we already covered that love is a feeling and feelings are not choices . people don t decide to disobey god and be gay . they are born gay and it s not their choice or their doing . no one chooses who they fall in love with or who they are attracted to . that is on god and how god created them . so yes , god is punishing them for god s own actions . god is punishing them for how god themselves created them . that makes your version of god an unfavorable ass .","804717":"what you think is the wrong path","804718":"eh . . . idc . either or neither","804719":"my old drumline director","804720":"honestly don t think there s anything more to talk about . it s just fact that there s no proof that god disproves of gay people not anymore than other everyday actions most people do and if god does , god is the one to blame bc god made them and is punishing them for something god themselves did , therefore making god a dick who no one should be proud of going to stay with during their afterlife . i definitely could never be . you have yet to prove any of this wrong and so i don t want to drag out this conversation if you re just gonna continue to excessively talk without actually being able to prove anything that i said incorrect or give legitimate reason to make anyone believe you without there being either an easy way to disprove it or going back to what i said above . you re just going in circles with no real backup , making unsupported guesses up as you go along and i have work to do so i don t have time to go in circles with unsupported theories .","804721":"sliced strawberries","804722":"i m not one of them so i can t really answer , but some of them who think they are hot probably do tbh","804723":"piano , guitar , drums","804724":"why ?","804725":"christmas but barely and thanksgiving . and sometimes new years","804726":"no , not annoyed , i agree with their choices","804727":"same answer i just gave below check those dancers out if you haven t already","804728":"i m not crazy about ayo and teo . they stole several of les twins moves without giving them any credit and then called them snakes . it was immature and disrespectful , especially to someone who inspired and created so many of their moves . they also have been doing the same moves for years now with no signs of improvement . it s gotten boring . i would rather watch professional dancers like kida the great , josh price , kaycee rice , gabe de guzman , fik shun , les twins , poppin john , lil phoenix , bgirl logistx . . . . the list goes on . you should check them out","804729":"acting like you re better than everyone else is cocky . i feel like confidence is when you believe in yourself . so i guess the difference is when you re confident it s more just thinking about yourself and what you can do and when you re cocky it s more about comparing yourself to others","804730":"yep , gimme yours and i ll message you with messenger","804731":"which one ?","804732":"i don t wanna put my number online , can i give you my email for google hangouts or a social media handle ?","804733":"do you have an instagram or any easier more private way to communicate ?","804734":", you ?","804735":"aww i feel you","804736":"how old are you ?","804737":"hmm iron man","804738":"just woke up . you ?","804739":"friend zone","804740":"watch it","804741":"yes","804742":"depends","804743":"no i haven t","804744":"nothing honestly , but i guess i always feel a bit better with my stuffed cow . i ve also heard guided meditations are good for that","804745":"what ?","804746":"winter is mine haha","804747":"lol","804748":"what does that mean ?","804749":"i don t"}}
