Being told if I'm \u2618 girlfriend that he is a cheater, and hes going to cheat on me and hurt me just the same as the others. I really think its messed up. I have feelings to, and he always been my entire world amd has always meant alot to me even when we were just friends. So for people to come after me because I choose to love him is wrong. I never once have been disrespected by him or even hurt by him. When I was down he was the first one to check on me and ask if I was okay. He was always there to talk to and lean on when I do desperately needed it. ... So its really wrong you guys believe a tea page just literally digs and digs for one little thing to cause \"drama\" out of. The other girls involved love the drama... Other ones had no clue about it... But were directly out into these allegations even though there was literally nothing said on their behalf. Y'all just want to believe a drama\/tea page instead of the actual person or an ex girlfriend that loves the attention and making up stuff for clout. The other ex said it was \"ages ago\" meaning it may or may not have been that person you assume is a cheater. And just because they no longer follow eachother doesnt necessarily mean the claims are true. It could be just to get away from the drama or try to just let it fade over time. No one really knows. But it literally hurts recievinf those messages saying if I'm him girlfriend hes going to do the same thing to me. another topic that's super annoying,  the roadies .... Some of them not all.... But give the other guy a break hes been through a lot as well with allegations being thrown at him to basically having to adjust to not having a member he spent tons of time with leave and another one joining shortly after... I know how I felt when lisa was home sick and we were on tour and ahe wasnt rhere beside me I literally was wanting to cry every second ... But the nonstop hate and disrespect towards all of them need to stop. They work so hard to try to give everyone what they want and expect to make them happy the best they can... And going to a show that they have worked so hard on to do and just try to make it a grest fun night for everyone and being a total fake is wrong. Literally calling yourself a roadie. The boys may or may not have made a mistake, but theyre humans, we all make mistakes get over it. But if you're just going to their shows, listening to their music etc. Just to pull up and allegation about them cheating on \"___ \"  and change the lyrics to the song YOU ARE NOT A TRUE roadie because a true roadie would not even think about pulling that card. And if that is your intention and you still are calling yoirself a true roadie I advise not to go a show, listen to their music, or even mention their names because the boys do not deserve any of this or to be loved by fake fans or any negativity. They deserve happiness and love\ud83d\udc9b\n  ","932398":"\n  Then out of the girls its\n  \n  Christina - me\n  \n  Katherine- dani\n  \n  Lisa -me\n  \n  Amy- ??
