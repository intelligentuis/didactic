Like say I want my hair just curled. Like 35 or 40 bucks?\n  \n  To be washed, cut and styled the way I like it. About 80 bucks. But again I give her more than what I am originally charged. Plus I bring food or flowers when I go. When I don't bring I give big tips for how well she does and just cause.. Like I said.. Because I know her well and that is just how I like to be. She is alot older and knows how to do old school scene hair. That's usually what I get. And sometimes a double cut.\n  \n  But if I get my hair washed, cut, dyed, extra care, straightened, and styled, eyebrows done. It's about around 150 to 180 dollars. 2 dyes 200 to 240 depending on what and how it's being done. Depends...\n  \n  But she only charges me 115- 125 for the 1 dye. And I tip with food or flowers. Haha. So.. Yeah. ? She even sometimes charges flat 100. Just depends. I like to give more so... but as I said she has cut my hair my whole life and I have been knowing her for a very very long time and she's good friends with me and I like to hook her up and help out.

And then just meeting up without knowing or see or even speaking to them. Just only through text and believing little details about the person online.\n  \n  That is the complete unsafe way of doing it all.\n  \n  And I did not meet him online intending to date him.

People get angry because we went through all that stuff and are perfectly fine and happy together. No problems. Always stressful towards one another. There for each other. Caring. Patient.\n  \n  Couples that are near each other, that met so simple. Not all. But I usually see it and couples like that or people like that. They get jealous.

I have never done anything to this person, clearly since I said from day 1, obviously they have always wanted* to be rude\/ugly to me.\n  \n  Jealousy maybe? They just don't like people and they are very rude to me because I am married into the family, so they pretty much treat me like I'm not family no matter what. Even tho I am? ? they literally treat me like everything and anything I say is impossible... They don't make me feel welcome. Make fun of everything and anything I do. Judge me for anything and everything I do. I don't know if this person is ill or something. ? But all I know is it is very discouraging to have someone do that to you every single day of your everliving life.\n  \n  I think honestly it is jealousy because I am happily married to their fam & maybe they are sad that they're seeing them grow up maybe?\n  \n  All I know is I have never done anything to this person for them to be the way that they are to me.\n  \n  Everything and anything that I have ever told them is it the truth about me, where I'm from, how I was raised, and how I made myself the person I am today. I guess they think anything that happens in their world, & if they hear anything different outside of their world and how it works, they think it's a lie? Idk  Some people are so used to their life and how everything works, they think everything else successful is impossible. I don't know if that makes any sense but at the end of the day I feel that this person is jealous in a way and I'm about tired of the games. I just want to live my life. It's a frustrating situation.\n  \n  This is why I am on here and try to be there for people. Because some people don't have anyone. I want people to look at the brighter side of things. I do.

Sometimes keeping them in a confined space, considering I feel, which is clear, that they are a a bit more than what the world probably is supposed to naturally have. Overpopulated. It's probably the best for the world. If only people wouldn't over breed certain..\n  \n  But all of those over bred dogs and cats... then we would probably have an issue because they would be more non-domestic and more aggressive towards people. Because if you ever seen stray dogs and cats are usually not very nice towards people. A lot of them aren't. Some of them are from a household and that have ran away and are slightly domestic. But.. There would be more of them is what I'm saying. I feel like the purpose of an animal shelter and these animal buildings is to keep them domestic and from overpopulating out in the wild. I don't always just look at the fact that they're in a confined space and possibly not treated correctly. Sadly we have people that work in that field that are like that. We have bad apples in every field. But honestly if they weren't so over populated then known. I would rather than just be out of wild. Some of these animals are made for Homes. At one point they weren't. It's kind of a big Theory \/ argument that I don't really like to touch the surface of very much because people like to argue a lot about it.

One usually from my mom. One that she's really excited about us opening and she can't wait so we open it for her and it makes her very happy. (May I remind you, I have three sisters so there was four of us. So four happy faces, presents from Mama are the best.) The reason why we were always so excited about opening that present is because it's mostly the present that best describes us from her so it's very special. Very sweet. Christmas is not always about getting and giving but when it does come to that and this is what it means to us. It's very special to my family. In this way.\n  \n  Another good thing that we do is every Christmas morning when we used to wake up my grandfather would be waiting on the porch petting the dog (The dog at the time that we have is a very good dog. Her name is Angel, Golden Retriever and was my mama and grandfathers baby. She loved him very much. My family and my grandfather) and we would go out and visit him for a few minutes before opening the Christmas presents in the living room from Santa. He would watch us open our presents.\n  \n  We would wake up around 6 or 7 in the morning and open presents. Check out what Santa had brought us, check out the stockings. Open the presents and then we would all go lay down for a little bit. We would either have donuts or breakfast or beignets in the morning. Then we would play with our stuff for a little while and then go to my grandmother's around 10:00\/10:30 in the morning and do Christmas with the entire family together.\n  \n  The family would get together and socialize. The younger ones would play outside or with toys in the living room at my grandmother's. Have fun and catching up with each other. Open the presents from one another. And then go house to house and visit people.\n  \n  Sometimes we may go out at the end of the day it just depends.\n  \n  Go and look at houses with the Christmas lights out.

Usually my coughs are caused from my broncular issues. Bronchitis. I usually have to sit up a little bit when sleeping. Basically put about five pillows behind you and make sure you're sitting upright a little bit. You maybe having mucus in your lungs prob. It sounds like it hut i\n  \n  Idk.. I am not there. I could probably tell if I was there.  But if you have mucus in your lungs.. it's irritating them and causing you to cough a lot. When you're sitting up the mucus isn't just sitting there. When you set up a may take about 10 minutes for you to calm down. Usually you have to go to the doctor and get steroids or something for it. They usually prescribe you a type of mucus DM if you're able to take it and give you breathing treatments. ( even after all of that you usually have a bronchial cough for almost a month before it goes away...) That's about all they do for bronchitis. At least for me.\n  \n  You can get you some tea and raw honey and lemon. I'm not sure how old you are but some people use wild turkey or some type of whiskey and put it in there a little bit helps numb your throat if your throat is hurting. If your throat is not hurting then it's probably a bronchial thing.  then what you would have to do is probably what I said above before the tea and lemon part. I am not a doctor I am just telling you based off of experience. I would more than likely go to a doctor and ask them first. But if you are having sinus problems and your throat hurts and that's why you're coughing I use Ricola cough drops that help numb your throat too. Vitamin C and D. Maybe some mints. Chloraseptic spray. DM medicine. Sinus medicine. That's about all the remedies I can think of at the moment. I hope that I helped. Do you remember both paragraphs or two different types of coughs.

Sometimes just knowing how much you're supposed to put. Though that's how life is and everybody is a critic but... I already have a YouTube channel where I put all kinds of things on it. Mostly the vloggs of my life. BellaMarieStarSwan is my channel.\n  ","43738":"\n  No. And if I did I would literally beat the sh- outta them.

Works to protect and knows many different types of martial arts. Also knows his rights. And so do I. Now don't get me wrong.

Sometimes if we have kids over they'll try to play with them. The little claws or pinch them and stuff. And some of the kids are just terrified of them.

When I get the opportunity to pick on whoever they can they do it. It's a way of making them feel better for some reason. That's where malicious people come from. Sometimes they don't even realize they're doing it. They're so full of themselves that they don't even care to listen to anyone.

If we feel really festive we will decorate a little bit before Thanksgiving. Usually will put lights up outside and we'll decorate the entire house with Christmas type stuff.

Christmas mats and tablecloth and the little place masks that you put at each seat for your food to go on. Will take out the Christmas hand towels. There's little ceramics that we put around the house on different furniture. There's a few pictures sometimes we'll put up on the walls. We might put the blow up things outside with the lights. Will put the nativity scene up somewhere in our house or outside. We will go every now and then and go Christmas shopping or window shopping to see what they want. Take a few days to wrap presents and put them under the tree. By candy canes and put them on the tree. Every day counting down to Christmas we eat a candy cane off the tree. We do stocking stuffers and candy and each stocking. Put a favorite candy of each person in their stocking. At least three or four stocking stuffers. Usually get everybody a few presents. Everybody gets to open one present on Christmas Eve. We wake up around 7, 8 or 9 in the morning and open Christmas presents and then go to my grandparents and open more with the entire family and enjoy dinner and talk to everybody. Since I live in Mississippi now we don't really do that. Will either go a few days before Christmas or after Christmas and do that. Also since my grandparents have passed now we just go to my mom's and then after we go to different family members houses. We still cook for Christmas Eve and Christmas.

Sometimes I just like going with the flow and then other times I do like to plan things out.\n  ","43805":"\n  Eh.. Can be. Depends... it depends on if your family members are doing something to upset your friend(s). At the end of the day it really shouldn't matter if they accept your family, they really should just accept you. Of course if they meet your family they need to remember to be respectful regardless. Especially to adults. It doesn't matter if they accept them or not. But if the family members are being downright ugly to your friends or maybe your friends see some sort of mental or physical abuse being done from your family towards you and they feel that you are unsafe. Then I could see why they might not want to accept them... it definitely depends. If they feel concerned that I need to go to a higher up or some type of authorities if they feel that you are unsafe. But at the same time they need to take this situation seriously cuz this is life and that is your family. They need to have evidence and be very serious about their approach to upper higher authority. AKA reporting.\n  \n  But if the people (your friend's) are just being disobedient to certain rules and regulations that you're family members have, then that is the part where it depends because that definitely does not matter as into the person that is your friend. They should accept your family members as so with their rules and regulations. Especially towards you in safety terms. I hope that you understand my answer. This also can be good advice towards dating. If you are dating someone and they don't accept your family and by the rules and regulations then there is something wrong. But at the same time that everyone gets along and it could literally be over nothing. Sometimes people just don't like certain people. And also sometimes parents get jealous when they see their baby growing up. It's hard for them to catch reality that they are growing up. Again I hope that you understand my answer.\n  ","43806":"\n  Jason \u2665?

Cleaning up my room and helping my mom cook or my grandmother cook was a great success to me. Just learning anything as a child was a success to me. Making my parents happy what's a success to me. Good grades.\n  \n  First disappointment... Again I keep saying I don't remember the first one. I remember asking for Tinker Toys a few Christmas is in a row but we weren't able to find any. Not really a disappointment but more or less just sad. Not really that big of a deal. It's a toy.\n  \n  I remember going to Mississippi beaches and having an absolute blast with my family.\n  \n  I worked at my family's grocery store for 7 and 1\/2 years.
