? ? they literally treat me like everything and anything i say is impossible . . . they don t make me feel welcome . make fun of everything and anything i do . judge me for anything and everything i do . i don t know if this person is ill or something . ? but all i know is it is very discouraging to have someone do that to you every single day of your everliving life . i think honestly it is

are to me . everything and anything that i have ever told them is it the truth about me , where i m from , how i was raised , and how i made myself the person i am today . i guess they think anything that happens in their world , if they hear anything different outside of their world and how it works , they think it s a lie ? idk some people are so used to their life and how everything works , they think everything else successful is impossible . i don t know if that makes any sense but at the end of the day i feel that this person is jealous in a way and i m about tired of the games . i just want to live my life . it s a frustrating situation . this is why i am on here and try to be there for people . because some people don t have anyone . i want people to look at the brighter side

is still at work until like or . when he gets home we will then open presents .","37774":"depends . sometimes keeping them in a confined space , considering i feel , which is clear , that they are a a bit more than what the world probably is supposed to naturally have . overpopulated . it s probably the best for the world . if only people wouldn t over breed certain . . but all of those over bred dogs and cats . . . then we would probably have an issue because they would be more non domestic and more aggressive towards people . because if you ever seen stray dogs and cats are usually not very nice towards people . a lot of them aren t . some of them are from a household and that have ran away and are slightly domestic . but . . there would be more of them is what i m saying . i feel like the purpose of an animal shelter and these animal buildings is to keep them domestic and from overpopulating out in the wild . i don t always just look at the fact that they re in a confined space and possibly not treated correctly . sadly we have people that work in that field that are like that . we have bad apples in every field . but honestly if they weren t so over populated then known . i would rather than just be out of wild . some of these animals are made for homes . at one point they weren t . it s kind of a big theory argument that i don t really like to touch the surface of very much because people like to argue a lot about it . look at people as their opinion is an awful thing towards them . i don t try to think more or less evil towards anything at all . i tried to look at the positives and everything . the good . what can we do to get better ? type thing . . .","37775":"lol","37776":"lol","37777":"collage i loove lsu mississippi state i root for cause i live here now
