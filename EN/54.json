I have auditioned for colleges. I have sang the national anthem for football games before. I was lead cantar for my Church for a few years & lead the Church for my school.

I have went to places that were most definitely haunted. I have had things get picked up and put down. I've had doors open and close. I've heard people talking and other people have heard it as well. Knocks. Bangs. Squeaks. I have seen orbs before. Black figures.\n  \n  I have had people tell me tons of different situations that they have had. I know how to work a Ouija board though I promote...not to use them. 80% of all hauntings are caused by them & I dispromote them because most of the time people don't know how to properly use them & it's dangerous. The problem is you don't always know if you're talking positive entitys. You can get ahold of negative energies & demonic things. Negative energies & demons prey on the living, the weak, the scared, tend to follow them so that's why it's not good to indirectly speak to the afterlife. If do, you have to be very careful.\n  \n  Use every type of thing to prevent negative energys. You have to demand it away, praying it away, holy water, angels, burning sage, have things that are blessed, believing in God, a huge relationship with him is very important when working with this type if stuff.\n  \n  Now. If you can't get as  intense as poltergeist activity and things being thrown. Doors opening & slamming shut. Faucets turning off, on. Doors locking, unlocking. Cars turning on, off. Picture frames moving. Even the entity is able to write. Like draw. I know that sounds silly but it is very possible. Books flying(thrown). People getting attacked. People feeling that they're being choked & scratched & shoved. People being shoved or scratched. Rooms feeling extremely cold & then temperature changes in seconds. Animals reacting at things the house like they're seeing or hearing something. Sometimes people get randomly angry or sad. Sometimes the entities can affect people & manifest energy. Sometimes your cameras will go out & phones will die. It'll mess with your screen audio.\n  \n  Lol here's some stuff\n  ","58208":"\n  I mean this is not the most angry I have been but this was a time back in school when I saw some kid teasing and making fun of a kid that was special needed at PE for no absolute reason.

My couch looked at me surprised because I looks dead-ass serious. He even told me to chill out because he thought I really was going to do it. I mean.. Didn't want to but like really?? The special needs guy wasn't even doing anything wrong to the dude. He just walked up to him and started taken the stuff that he was playing with away and teasing him. He was playing basketball and was having fun and the kid just walked up and started pissing him off and he didn't know any better, the special dude. Messed up... and me I was a good kid in school I never got cuz fights unless I had to. The seeing someone like that get made fun of. I just can't ignore it. It's not right.

I myself was in a long distance relationship for 4 and a half years and we are finally together and married and are doing amazing.\n  \n  But with long distance relationships you have to be very careful because not all of the friendships are fully trustful?\n  \n  There has to be constant communication and trust and loyalty and there has to be a lot of patience.\n  \n  You have to constantly be trying to spend time with them even if it's to call or video call. Again communication is most important.\n  \n  When spending time.. don't be controlling about the relationship and the times spent. You are far away from each other it's going to be hard. Do not let jealousy get in between the two of you. Let the other person know how much they mean to you constantly. You two need to be working hard to save money for situations.\n  \n  You need to build a friendship with that other person before you can have the relationship that is also very important for any relationship not just long-distance relationships.\n  \n  But that is what I think of long-distance relationships. They are very possible. They are not impossible. Are they easy, no. Can you get through them? Yes.\n  \n  I will have to say the younger that you are in a long-distance relationship the harder and the longer you may have to wait unless you have the support of your parents.

People get pissed now a day. Back in the day. You were to talk and acknowledged everyone and tell them, \"hello,\" and, \"good morning,\" and it was rude if not? If you walk into a building. You are to be kind and open. Positive. Today's society, you have to be careful who you speak to.\n  \n  But who do I choose to not speak to maybe based off of looks? Well see.. That's the thing. We don't know. I don't? I used to have a really punk type style and people used to be scared of me and they would usually avoid me, but i was mean or scary. I am, or at least I could say am not that.

When the time comes, it will be the right one. Then it's up to the two of you to make the communication work. Work together. Trust one another. Build both a friendship and a relationship together.

If this one doesn't work out, wait for some time and find yourself and figure yourself out. You don't want to get any habits of trying to constantly find someone to settle down with. That is not good for you. It can lead to you being confused like you kind of are right now. I am speaking from experience. I went from one guy to another once trying to figure out who I could settle down with. It hurts some of there feelings and yours also... And that's not right..
