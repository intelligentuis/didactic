talking about yourself correct ? you are dating somebody correct ? and your significant other that you just started dating is threatened by a friend of yours or x ? for one if it s an x if your

that . if it s not an ex it s just a friend that you are speaking of and you ve been friends with them for a while . if they re not doing anything wrong to your significant other , than i don t see the problem with you talking to them , still today . if they re just jealous . . like your significant other is jealous of your friend then that s not right . like if they are jealous in the way thay they are just the opposite sex you are they re friend . they need to let you have friends . . even if the opposite sex . they need to learn to trust you . that s hiw relationships work ? constant trust communication is key . . but if your significant other is scared because your friend is threatening them . . . then that friend is not a friend . your friend should make your significant other feel threatened . under any circumstances . . . no other human should make another human feel threatened . i have been with my husband for years , we are married and we both have friends of both sexes

respect the fact that your significant other is more important to you because obviously they are your significant other . this is how life works . if your firend doesn t get it . ? you then give them the ultimatum . but your friend could be looking out for you too in the long run . make sure that the person that you are with is right for you . they re not doing you wrong . treating you right .
