I've had plenty to make me believe they are real and out there.\n  \n  I remember I was 15\/16 years old and my dad was coming to my room to talk to me and I could hear him coming but I heard smaller footsteps too. And once my dad pop up at my door, I see this little 4 year old girl run behind him towards me laughing and as soon as she gets to my bed - she's gone, but I still could hear her laughter. I guess I made an expression on my face because my dad knew something was up and asked what? I told him and he didn't seem to think I was insane...\n  \n  Never saw her again though.\n  ","677018":"\n  My jacket is designer lol\n  ","677019":"\n  I would if I wasn't getting punched by satan in my uterus\n  ","677020":"\n  Thank you sweetheart\n  ","677021":"\n  My love\n  ","677022":"\n  Nah, but you can bet I'm wearing at least one thing designer everyday.\n  ","677023":"\n  Think what?\n  ","677024":"\n  I love them, they relieve stress.\n  ","677025":"\n  I want like 5000 followers on insta so I can feel okay with myself.

Normal people don't just like feet in or around their mouth. Something has happened in the past that fucked them up into thinking That's right, and sexy. nobody just wakes up one day and says \"I wish to be stepped on\"\n  \n  no theirs a part of you that thinks you deserve to be lower than those people and you deserve to be stepped on. And I honestly believe if you wish to be under someones feet, you are a weak dependent person. Almost pathetic.  I don't think it's okay, maybe it's because I'm trying to make myself on top.\n  ","677028":"\n  So many hugs. \u2764\n  ","677029":"\n\n   @savannahamess\n  \n\n  I want like so much more ):\n  ","677030":"\n  I think I finally understand Why people like foot fetishes and what type of people usually are like that.\n  \n  People who are submissive to feet think they are below the average person. They wish to be  walked and stomped on because they think their trash and so instead of getting mad about it, they made it into a sexual thrill.\n  \n  Just like serial killers. They can't have sex, but once they are ripping out your soul they feel this thrill because their all sorts of fucked up and their parents probably took their dignity when they were younger by touching them inappropriately, so instead of getting mad at it they made it into a sexual game of rape and murder.\n  \n  The people who are dominant over people with foot fetishes are like weak rulers of ancient history. Needs to feel power by making people lower or under their feet. But in reality they are the people you forget.\n  ","677031":"\n  That sounds awful\n  ","677032":"\n  Awwww Thank you.
