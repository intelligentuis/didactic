photography and art , primarily .","724482":"i dislike spicy food ! i ve always wanted to be able to handle spicy foods , but unfortunately they don t do me any good .","724483":"i never left work to go back in the first place unfortunately . i ve been working through this whole pandemic . my habits as a germophobe have been keeping me in good health !","724484":"no , i never have !","724485":"hearing distant noises on an otherwise silent night . at about half past midnight last night , there was some really unsettling noises off in the distance that are hard to describe . there was a couple of really heavy slams , and for the next ten minutes on and off there was uhh , , screeching ? ? it was really high pitched . it all sounded so far off that we couldn t tell which direction it was coming from . and eventually , everything fell silent .","724486":"thank you sm ! ! bless you for always being around to spread positivity . you deserve all of the light you shine to be reflected right back . have a wonderful friday and a great weekend ! stay safe and in good health .","724487":"no and it makes me so fckin upset because i really wanted to like it . fruits , spices , what s not to like . . ? it tastes gawd awful . awful . i have tried a few different kinds but i gave up . they taste wack asf to me . i don t really even like alcohol to begin with though , so that may also be part of it . i don t really drink .","724488":"nope . actually i m waiting to text my ex this weekend to see if i can drop his stuff off lmao . so to reiterate euuuuh . . nope !","724489":"much , much too expensive . new consoles have been too expensive for generations now , in my eyes . and all of that cost for significantly weaker hardware and software . and neither of those are exactly modifiable . a good gaming pc has quite the expense to swallow , sure . but i d much rather set myself up on a payment plan for a beefy upgradable pre build or heii just the parts for building my own . it s better than tossing out the window on something that will continually lose usability once the next one comes out . a good gaming pc and one with upgradable parts promises support for games of the past , present , and future . i ll take that over a console any day . it s just so much more worth it !","724490":"i m ? ? me ? cute ? thank you sm , you have no idea how much this made me smile ! also , i fully support you doing what you re comfortable with . i mean i don t bite or anything , but if you feel more comfortable saying so on anon then i fully understand .","724491":"if i was santa claus for a day , i d want to bring gifts to children in need , who could use some cheer . i would want to bring presents to children s hospitals , as well as to shelters and group homes .","724492":"while i m sure plenty of people have given you valid enough reason to feel that way , it s important to not be beside ourselves with anger . you should never let the pain people put you through change the goodness in you . don t let people of the past dim your light . don t let negative experiences blind you from the goodness to come ! there s plenty of good people out there who aren t full of cr p , who will care about you with full sincerity . just because you haven t found them yet , doesn t mean cr ppy people is all there is . have hope and patience .","724493":"i d vote rose gold . decorating your room around a special interest is pretty cool , but interests can change ! it d suck to put so much work into redecorating and then eventually not be into the other two anymore . but that s just my two cents !","724494":"i tend to prefer figuring out things for myself on most things . because who s best to find a solution to a problem than someone who s standing right in the middle of it , right ? but there is times where i have asked for advice and taken it . it really depends on the personal sensitivity of the situation .","724495":"not too bad ! i feel like the day is flying by , but other than that i m doing alright . it s been a really good day otherwise so far .","724496":"idk , i guess you should go ask him","724497":"i have quite a few !

! snow cones are pretty good , but the flavor can tend to run out of it . that can make it hard to finish eating ! also snow cones are the best if eaten before melting . that s awful to a slow eater like me . .","724501":"i ll typically go for ice cream that s smooth rather than chunky . don t get me wrong , i love me my cookies and cream ice cream . but i m usually only craving it when i want something more indulgent . typically , i prefer the smooth stuff .","724502":"i ve always preferred dogs ! i grew up with dogs as pets , and never really had a pet cat before taking care of salem . i just feel like i m more used to dogs and their behaviors .","724503":"idk who this is , i m so lost","724504":"i got your other ask about this , but i m not sure i know who you re referring to ? i just searched the name in the search bar and i can t seem to find a main account . could you drop an ? i won t post it .","724505":"oh , only every morning for me . i really wish i could stop that from happening .","724506":"i tend to prefer red much more than blue .","724507":"i unfortunately do suffer from rly bad anxiety when it comes to going to the dentist but it mostly just comes with the fact that i have pretty bad anxiety overall . i m prone to it .","724508":"i got this three hours ago , at am . it was tuesday for me","724509":"i don t have one . also , i have no preferences one way or the other !","724510":"i d like to learn how to do martial arts some day ! it s always been in the back of my mind to want to learn .","724511":"nope ! though i recognize the name , i have never seen it .","724512":"i ve gotta be honest , i d feel really weird about that ! it s almost as if they don t want you associated with their friends ? but then , i don t get the specific thing with them wanting you to post about them . it doesn t really make sense , but it also doesn t feel quote quite right .","724513":"you re on anon tho , ,","724514":"no worries ! have a nice day","724515":"i thought this was a really sweet and thoughtful message , but the last part caught me off guard . i m not sure who the her is that you re referring to !","724516":"feelings ? a cold ? a disease ? ? i m not sure , i m pretty stumped on this one !","724517":"don t worry about it ! i m not upset .","724518":"for me , it s usually a nay . i only like olives in very specific ways , like in homestyle puerto rican rice or beef empanadas ! but also , i have to be in the mood to have them . sometimes the flavor of them really bothers me .","724519":"that s my melody she s a sanrio character !","724520":"it d be pretty nice to have a figure of one of hatsune miku s holiday modules as an ornament !","724521":"ohhh okay gotcha . well , i think it s an interesting idea for catering . i m sure it d super shock any party guest to come into the room and find a sub sandwich as long as the table before them","724522":"i love chili ! mild only , though . i don t do well with spicy foods . i can t wait to learn how to make home made chili some day . . .","724523":"nope , i had no idea that was a thing until you brought it to my attention ! where could you even get one of those ? at most , i ve seen people order catering from subway with those plastic dishes full of personal size sandwiches .","724524":"if i learned it from another person ? oh , absolutely . there s few things worse than someone who is two faced and backstabbing . i d have to let that friend know that their other friend was talking to me about them , and precisely what they said . if it s just something i happened upon , however . . it s not up to me to call it out . secrets are made to be secrets for a reason . if i accidentally found out something personal that i should have , i d rather keep hush . it feels like the most respectful thing to do , if i found something out on accident . unless that secret puts that friend in danger , anyways .","724525":"nope that s a new one to me . if you can still see it , i d take a screenshot and send it to staffs email . explain to them what happened . they seem to have been having a lot of technical issues lately .","724526":"i ll send some your way ! .","724527":"i think the last time i got sick was when i got the flu . i believe that was some time last year ! in my adult life , i find myself rarely ever getting sick . i m really conscious of germs , and i keep myself and my more germy environments very clean . also , i have been this big of a germophobe since long before the pandemic , so it s not like i feel much different . the only new thing i m doing that i wasn t already is wearing a mask !","724528":"my phone , primarily ! it used to be my brush because i have super super long hair . but i don t even carry a bag on me anymore most of the time , so it stays in the car . my phone is always on my person , though !","724529":"that s actually called poiyamory and yes , i support it ! there s absolutely nothing wrong with healthy poiyamorous relationships . and when i say healthy , i mean two key important things everyone is in the know complete transparency . being involved with people behind the backs of everyone you re seeing is not poiyamory it is cheating . it s important that everyone you re seeing knows up front what your intentions are . everyone agrees and consents everyone involved knows that you are poiyamorous , and that you are seeing other people , and everyone is fully okay with that . be communicative and honest . as an example , i am poiyamorous actually . and my partner is monogamous . we have talked about my want to explore other relationships , and together we have agreed on it ! we have our own specific terms of do s and don ts that work best for the well being of our relationship . and it s about as easy peasy as that ! everyone is different though . if you yourself are in a relationship with someone who is monogamous and doesn t want a poiyamorous partner . . it s for the better to end that relationship . limiting yourself will only make you unhappy , which makes your partner unhappy . and going behind your partner s back despite them not wanting the relationship to be that way is just as bad , if not worse . anyways . yes , i support poiyamory . because just like with monogamous relationships , they can be healthy or unhealthy . it all depends on compatability and communication !","724530":"if i had to only pick one foreign language to learn , it would be japanese . i ve always had an interest in learning it ! but besides that , i do plan on traveling overseas some day . it s my life long dream to experience the richness of different cultures . and i d hate to stumble around ignorantly on my dream journey , so it s an absolute must that i learn it .","724531":"i did , yeah ! and i refollowed","724532":"here it is ! yeah sorry i missed this i kinda forgot about the button that temporarily hides shoutouts . i didn t realize how much direct stuff has been buried by them ! ! anyways , thank you so much for taking the time to wish me well . my sunday went okay , but i hope yours went even better ! ! tell me how it went some time , if you can .","724533":"oh no , i didn t ! o unfortunately my inbox has been getting spammed with a lot of asks since i ve started leaving anon on . the biggest culprit of it all right now is shoutouts . i ll look through my inbox to try and find it !","724534":"support her hustle , because that s her business . and also ask her for some tips , because working your body like that for a living is an active talent . i find it honestly impressive , and i wish i had it in me to have as much confidence as that ! seriously , we need to stop overreacting about s xwork . it s just a different kind of job that you don t understand ! nothing less , nothing more . it is a job . it brings money to the table . it pays bills . and these people out here doing that work are risking their personal safety day in and day out for a living . that deserves respect . i m tired of the sheer amount of people that ll w nk to s xworkers with one hand , and point in anger and judgment at them with the other . it s both moronic and ironic .","724535":"nope !

but yeah ! it really does sound like you had a busy weekend back then i m srry ur ask got buried in my inbox fkjdjdjd . but i hope it wasn t a bad or stressful one . hey at least you got some game time in !

and i don t think i ever would want to , if i m honest . i probably wouldn t be able to stomach them . . i ll stick to the standard meats on the market for consumption , thank yewww , ,","724549":"i just got settled in at home ! ! we set up all the groceries after going shopping and are back in where it s warm for the evening . . i m not up to anything special tbh , just watching some stuff on youtube and messing with my socials .","724550":"neither ! i don t like the taste of dark soda , and i try to avoid drinking any soda if possible .","724551":"definitely not the entirety of , no ! the first few months went by slower and slower . seriously april felt like it was a year in of itself !

! we ve been wanting to get some pet stairs to put against the bed . so when that comes in , niella can come up when she wants to !","724554":"with coffee , i m kinda in between disliking it and being indifferent . if i drink coffee , it s typically not because i crave it . i only ever drink coffee if i need a warm pick me up , usually before work !

adjust makeup , fix hair , etc . when people say that , it s typically to avoid describing menial things that aren t that important to share . don t look too deeply into it !","724561":"that sux i don t answer n fw questions for free so don t expect that from meee .","724562":"yessss it s so so so frustrating . i have had it happen to me a lot in fact this kind of treatment is one of the reasons i dumped my ex . i feel like it s important to hold oneself to a standard of self care , by removing people from our lives that agitate , upset , and hurt us . i m sorry that you re being subjected to that kind of treatment . i understand how bad it feels , and i wanna let you know that you deserve better .","724563":"some day , i want to learn how to knit ! i d love to be able to make blankets for the pups , at the very least .","724564":"i wouldn t say that my taste in music has changed much . i feel like the word developed fits the description better . i say my music taste has developed and not changed , because i still like genres that i liked before ! i m essentially just expanding my interests , or developing them , as opposed to changing interests i already have . i explore new genres all of the time ! now , there is bands and artists that i don t listen to anymore let s not talk about those lmaooo , but there still a lot from back then that i m still able to listen to and appreciate now ! a prevalent example is the band paramore . i ve listened to paramore s music ever since i heard pressure on the ps version of the sims .","724565":"i haven t gone swimming in many many years . so i m not quite sure !

and it s fun to find music you can really vibe to .","724570":"i don t necessarily celebrate christmas in the traditional sense , but i still prefer christmas overall . it s a very heart warming time of the year ! it makes me so happy to see the intricate decorations people put out . and it s even better if it snows around this time of the year . there s so few things more beautiful than the sight of colorful lights making freshly fallen snow twinkle .","724571":"yashahime princess half demon it s a sequel to inuyasha !","724572":"check previous answer for my response","724573":"yeah , pretty much !

i grew up in a sony household i suppose you could say . we had both the ps and ps , then the ps was given to me as a gift one christmas . and i myself got the ps . but i will say this here and now i have no intentions of buying the ps . i personally felt that the ps was a bad investment , and i do not want to continue buying consoles . i play on pc now , and on pc i plan to stay . at least with an upgradeable pc , i feel like i m getting my money s worth for generations of video games . both to come , and of the past .","724584":"no . i love s mores . they re the best campfire snack aside from just eating toasted marshmallows of course .","724585":"well , you ve already got the anon feature down , so that s one of the basics covered . i ll explain some of the other stuff shoutouts this feature allows you to send a question out to random users who are online recently online near you . i say near you in quotes because shoutouts actually cross a few states , so it s not actually good for reaching anyone local to you . also , shoutouts that you send seem to be stored somewhere to be pushed out at random intervals to random users . so be weary of what you send ! coins coins are the currency on here which allow you to buy emotes , backgrounds , promote your posts , etc . you can buy these with real money don t do that , i sure haven t because it d be a waste of money lmao , earn them by watching ads , or earn them by users rewarding your good answers . vip users who are vip status get this from applying for vip with ask . fm after being active for a while . vip users get bonus coins every week for continuous activity . at the moment this is all i can think of to explain . if you have any other questions , feel free to ask !

so i did some research on them and i found that they have quite the long history . and the ones from way back in the day are much different from what we know today ! after what i ve seen , i think i d at least be open to trying the modernized version of what we know as mince pies .","724590":"i would say so , yes ! and you ? how was your day ?","724591":"yep ! i ve mentioned it a few times earlier today , but again i m not actively using it so i don t care to share it .","724592":"let s be real here if i was an honest to god cannibai , do you think i would openly say so ?","724593":"i think i ll just use the rest of these to post some of my favorite holiday themed gifs !

i find it interesting to see how the split decisions add up on my polls .","724604":"tbh ? sometimes it feels like it s not my choice ! but i think it might be due to my eating habits and the amount i move around during the day . i m a very busy bodied person , most especially at work . the combination of my daily habits just kinda does that for me i suppose !","724605":"typically anymore , i ll eat as such light breakfast , medium lunch , small medium lunch depending . sometimes between those , i ll do some light snacking . i d say i eat an average amount . feels much more regular to me than how i used to eat !","724606":"i don t use twitter and insta all that often tbh ! also i tried vsco once and didn t really like it .","724607":"i suppose that depends on the rules you re both going by ! is the game set for best two out of three or three rounds ? if so , you lost . the person with the majority of wins , wins the game . by the sounds if it , the game already happened . so unless you re going by total wins from all games and you have more over your friend in that way , you lost . sorry .","724608":"oh !

i really don t even have the sweet tooth required for half of the sweets i post let alone the stomach for many of them . i just really admire what people are able to make ! ! it s interesting to see creativity in the form of foods . and i can only hope to be able to make some of the things i post , some day .","724616":"nope ! my hair pretty straight . i ve always wondered what it d be like to have curly hair , but either way . at the length my hair is at , having curls would be a pain probably . i ve heard that curly hair is tough to mangage !","724617":"yeah , you ll notice that when you have anon turned on , that s seemingly all you ll get . it s why i have it off most of the time ! ! it makes ask a whole lot more boring , because it limits the amount of interaction . you can see who sends stuff , so you can t follow them or ask them more stuff . interaction stops as soon as the anon stops . then it s like . . . who knows if you ll ever speak with them again .","724618":"and i can get seeing how shoutouts are fun ! it is kind of interesting to see just how far they can reach .","724619":"in my personal experiences . . hmm . . . nope ! i don t really think so . if i m honest , i ve never been the biggest fan of the shoutout feature . it could use some tweaking . plus i feel like the most unique interactions come from sending people direct stuff !

i m not doing too bad , overall . there s been a few iffy things happening here and there today , but i m focusing on the positives the best that i can . how are you ?","724778":"i actually just recently ended a relationship that was becoming rapidly toxic . it ended with me cutting ties completely , because the way i was being treated was poor . all of it was putting my mental health through the wringer , so when it was getting to be too painful and no hope was left i left . and yeah , i did put in the effort and time to try and fix it . but i want to really emphasize this you can t fix everything and that is okay . it s not your responsibility to try and fix someone s toxic behaviors . this kind of thing goes beyond just wasting time . doing this always ends up with you repeatedly subjecting yourself to pain . all at the sake of trying to fix someone else s emotional misgivings . the damage all of that can do to you is significant ! at the end of the day , sometimes you have to evaluate what it s really worth to try . and to also genuinely evaluate how much hurt you re getting into by trying . remember it s up to the individual to work on themselves and their growth . that s not really something you can just give to a person .","724779":"it seems like everyone has played cards against humanity at least once . meanwhile , i haven t . i think it would probably be one of my favorite table top game ideas . it seems really fun with the right group of friends !","724780":"translation what is your favorite song ? mi canci n favorita en este momento es tokyo flash . est hecho por vaundy . todav a necesito escuchar m s de su m sica , porque tokyo flash tiene mucha buena energ a . translation my favorite song at the moment is tokyo flash . it s made by vaundy . i still need to hear more of her music , because tokyo flash has a lot of good energy . help via google translate","724781":"thank you for understanding . but anyways how are you ? i hope things have been well in your part of the globe !","724782":"nope !

!","725138":"you sent this twice , so i ll answer this one too ! one of my other greatest fears pertains to being trapped in small spaces . but also , being trapped where there s no hope and only despair . i greatly fear being buried alive .","725139":"above all else , loss of many kinds . i mean this in the general sense like people i love leaving me behind and in reference to death .","725140":"thank you so much , you as well ! take care and stay safe .","725141":"a hot mug of peppermint tea is hard to beat !","725142":"i don t have one ! i just don t actively shop for active wear .","725143":"yep !","725144":"i ve always wanted to , but i ve not yet had the ability to experiment ! i ve made food before without following any real recipe , but that s quite different .","725145":"done !","725146":"it s actually funny that i m being asked this right now ! not like . . haha funny , i mean just oddly coincidental . because it is within the last month that i started realizing some things about my mental health , and how i treat myself . i came to the realization that i had not been giving myself enough patience and care , and i ve been treating my wellbeing as something that can be put off . i ve been putting my wellbeing last . so , i can say with confidence , that i ve made massive strides in self care ! i ve been much more patient with myself and all that i feel than i was a month ago . and i m actually majorly proud of myself for coming this far !","725147":"typically , i wake up at am standard ! sometimes i ll accidentally nod off , but i have alarms set for am am am am i do this in order to ensure that i at least get myself back up within that hour . some day i d like to configure my schedule a little bit better to be able to wake up earlier ! but as of right now , that s what my wake up time looks like .","725148":"you as well !","725149":"today , i spent a good deal of time browsing indie games on steam and itch . io ! i downloaded countless new titles to try , all of which were completely free . then i added the paid ones to my wishlist to consider some time . tomorrow i plan on giving some of them a try ! i m feeling ambitiously open to new things . i have an itch to indulge in the exploration of people s independent projects .","725150":"ohhh i can t pick an absolute favorite ! ! there s too many good ones out there . buuut i ll post one i really like , out of a bunch a recently found .","725151":"hey thanks ! i hope you have a good day as well as a good week ! .","725152":"i believe that it s worse to love someone that doesn t love you . why ? well i feel like the distinction comes in because it s about who s feeling what . it s not as bad to have someone love you that you don t love you can just distance yourself from them for your own comfort . but feeling unrequited love directly hurts you . i feel what s worse is what brings you more pain directly .","725153":"the . . i guess just the realization that there s so many major life choices that are being left all up to me . the sudden awareness that a lot falls into my hands to make choices on has been really overwhelming for me recently .","725154":". . .","725155":"yesss sign me up for all of your question spams ! ! i love getting a bunch of questions . plus , you ask some really interesting stuff . so yes of course , count me in ! .","725156":"i prefer tea all the way ! especially hot tea . there s almost nothing better than a hot mug of my favorite tea to pick me up .","725157":"oh yeah , i ask questions all the time ! i just rotate who i send them to every so often just to give in variety .","725158":"n ! .","725159":"i d highly recommend them !","725160":"i haven t read all the books in the world yet to fairly decide ! hehe um anyways . i think my favorite book so far is cornelia funke s inkspell trilogy . it absolutely captivated me as a story surrounded by mystical and magical things . they re lovely fantasy novels .","725161":"does anyone know what this notification was about ? when i opened it , it took me to my inbox on here . but i don t even have any questions related to polls or usernames . i m lost !","725162":"you re talking about jack kevorkian , right ? i feel like i heard about him on youtube years ago from some list channel . from what i ve heard and read on him , he only ever assisted people with suicide when they were in severely poor health terminally ill . i feel like i can agree with his ideology , keeping that in mind . if someone has no real chance of survival and they re just suffering to death , i feel that those people should have a right to choose their end .","725163":"glad to hear it . next to nothing beats a laxed friday !","725164":"haha , you may ! thank you again . i m not doing too bad actually , thanks for asking ! i m almost done with my shift , and the second i m out of here i ll be ready to jump start into a fantastic weekend . and how are you ? hope that you re keeping well !","725165":"aw thanks sm for saying so ! !","725166":"i understand how cliche this is going to sound , buuut . hm ! i don t care . it s just how i feel . for christmas , i don t actually want anything physical . by that i mean objects . things . i don t have a wishlist , and i don t have any expectancies of anyone to get me anything . all i want for the holidays is to be able to spend time with those i love . and i d love for there to be no more death around the holidays . i just want time to spend cherishing those that i care for .","725167":"i love to expand my music library as much as possible ! it s nice to be able to hear what other people enjoy for that reason , but also because you get to know a personal part of them !","725168":"i would , yeah ! staff has already sent me something saying they re waiting for me to send out a verification video ! i have to set aside the time to actually do it , but i m planning on doing it by monday . wouldn t wanna email them on the weekend and have it get buried while they re not checking emails ! i want my account verified just because ! it lets people know that i m a genuine person . on an app full of catfish and fake profiles claiming to be celebrities , it d be nice to be wholly confirmed so that people don t assume i m someone i m not .","725169":"nope ! this kind of piggy backs off of my previous answer buuut the point is just the same it would be a fat waste of my valuable time . i wouldn t ever want to stay with someone who i believe would be genuinely toxic for me . if a person can t treat other people right , then they shouldn t be getting into relationships . and they certainly don t deserve to be in one with me . but this should go without saying generally speaking it can be hard for people in abusive relationships to see just how bad the abuse really is . because like you said , it s wholly possible to get used to it . it s wholly possible to be convinced that thats what you have , and that s what you ll always have . it s wholly possible to be manipulated into believing so many good things surrounding an abuser because these toxic monsters are so good at what they do being bad . so please don t use my answer as a gotcha for anyone who is in an abusive relationship , or to ridicule anyone who is stuck in one . that would be absolutely unfair and downright sickening . people who are enduring toxicity from a partner or abuse need support , patience , and guidance . not ridicule . if you know a loved one who is going through this , be supportive . be kind . be the light they need to be able to see in the world .","725170":"no , and i really don t see how that s possible ! i enter relationships and stay in relationships because of genuine interest . i find those who my heart wants to love and cherish to be always worth my time . but i wouldn t ever put in that kind of time for someone i don t really have interest in . why ? well , because it s a waste of my time of course ! i value my time , and wouldn t ever waste it on anyone i don t like . not for any reason . being in a relationship with a person i don t really like would be quite the massive inconvenience .","725171":"yes of course ! onions and garlic are really tasty parts of anything they re in ! they add a little bit of interesting flavor to whatever they go with . i d never eat them raw , but . . i love them when they re prepared right ! i feel that same way with most vegetables actually .","725172":"nah . i mean i probably wouldn t even get the opportunity to have to choose on this moral quandary , even . that s because i push all of my enemies far enough from me that i wouldn t be there to witness them in need . or witness them at all to begin with , rather . well , either way ! i wouldn t really care to stress myself over people who are crappy . it wouldn t be worth my time or energy to , because i know the people who i hate , hate me plenty enough back to never do the same . it s best that way .","725173":"only every single day ! i miss my partner immensely every day since our visit ended . he lives in maine currently , and i came back to my home state in august . i have a life here and my financial health to attend to , so therefore i can t do much about this feeling . but we still talk every day , and have nightly bedtime phonecalls . aaaaand tomorrow we re having an online date via video call so there s ways to cope with that pain ! but yes i do miss him still , very intensely .","725174":"this one really cool indoor amusement park ! my parents would take me and one of my siblings out there every other year , and it was really fun ! they have a ferris wheel that is so huge it goes through the roof ! it s covered in glass at the top so when you get up there , you can see around the amusement park for miles .","725175":"nope !","725176":"jk rowling is a garbage human being from what i ve heard . transphobia is sickening , and i don t tolerate transphobic people in any sense . but the second part of this ask . . bothers me . to put it lightly . did you just bring . . okay am i reading this correctly ? ? ncest o phobic ? as in . . people who are disgusted by ncest ? the act of two people who are blood related having inappropriate relations ? are you seriously putting a sick freak s fet sh yes i m referring to ncest next to being transgender ? ? being someone who can t help who they are deep down inside ? ? do you genuinely feel as though nasties that fxck their family members being rightfully shamed even nearly compares to being harassed for simply being who you are ? get out of here . i don t know what rowling said about fam fxckers never heard about that . but you general sense or heaven forbid i actually have to refer to you are not at all oppressed for wanting to inbreed . transgender people actually face real problems . lncestuous freaks do not . lncestophobia is not real .","725177":"i think it s normal to be hurt by goodbyes . especially when you weren t even expecting it to happen , or you just genuinely don t see why . i can tend to get hurt from it too , but not severely unless they re super close to me . it just makes me feel confusion more than anything . i generally try to tell myself this when people leave , they leave behind room for something new . loss doesn t always have to hurt forever ! sometimes a simple change in perspective is what is needed to get back on track .","725178":"hello !","725179":"i mean , he did end up stealing back my stolen bike that one time . . but does that really count ? i m kidding . . something tells meee . . . that i smell a cheesy line coming . .","725180":"the last series i watched that i actually wholeheartedly loved was beastars ! i usually don t have it in me to re watch stuff , but i rewatched it through one full time and then a half ! it was a massive hyperfixation for me for quite some time . it s still sitting with me as a massive interest , as i m all caught up with the manga translation waiting on the next chapter !","725181":"hey , you too ! have a fun weekend , and be safe .","725182":"i ve tried them before ! the ones i had were a little peculiar in taste though , so i wouldn t say i enjoyed my first time trying them . but i think if i actually got some from a bakery that made them in house , i m sure i d really enjoy them !","725183":"oh , thanks ! you re on anon though , so idk uhh . who you are . but hey thanks regardless ! oh wait or you could have deleted your account . oof . well . .","725184":"strawberry cream oeil this song fills me with such intense waves of longing and deep nostalgia . and the best yet worst part of it all ? i can t even begin to figure out why my brain reacts as such upon listening to it . https oeil . bandcamp . com track strawberry cream here it is !","725185":"quite the contrary ! i appreciate sweets more than i can eat them . my teeth can t handle so much sweet stuff buuuut . . my brain can ! i like looking at pictures of confectionery creations . it s cool to see what things people create ! it s like an art in of itself .","725186":"my favorite halloween candy pumpkin shaped reese s cups . my favorite candy in general ? that s a tougher one ! umm . . i have a few favorites , and it s genuinely hard to pick ! i love haribo berries , haribo peaches , pocky , hi chew . . i really like fruit themed candies best .","725187":"i have three siblings , and i m the youngest .","725188":"i would immediately throw a quarter of it into savings . then i d spend some time paying off my medical bills . and then i d finally move out of this crappy neighborhood and find someplace nice to live . not too nice , so i can continue to afford to uphold the costs . but certainly some place nicer than where i am currently .","725189":"i ve lost weight , plenty of times ! but i ve never had an actual weight loss journey if that makes sense . i ve never actively sought out to lose weight , because i ve always been pretty light anyways . i m currently seeking out ways to gain , actually . my bmi could afford to be a little higher .","725190":"in my opinion , the best part about getting older is all of the knowledge you absorb along the way . every passing day brings new opportunities to learn new things !","725191":"a bed is furniture !","725192":"appliances are technology , and most of them aid in the completion of tasks like a dishwasher , an oven , or a microwave . furniture refers to large scale items that you place and move in the home , not technology . this includes chairs , tables , shelves . .","725193":"oh wow . that s a group i haven t heard about in yeaaars . i haven t listened to their stuff since the e . n . d . , around when their music would play on the radio all the time ! back then , i believe my favorite was boom boom pow . . ? i think , i actually don t remember . i don t have any real interest in their music today .","725194":"hey there ! for anyone who sees this , it looks like i have a relatively busy evening ahead . i ll do my best to be on a little later tonight or if i can , a couple times through the evening to answer some questions . i m aiming my focus on the asks a little further down in my inbox , since there s still so many to answer from my inactive period between late july through august . but for the meantime , feel free to keep on sending interesting and engaging asks my way ! know that i seldom ever delete things , i just skip around to whatever i feel i can give the best answer to at the time . thanks for being patient and understanding . i hope you re all doing well !","725195":"not too bad actually ! i m feeling quite content . about to go out and get food from one of my favorite restaurants . and it s raining ! so not only am i about to have major comfort food for lunch , but i m also gonna be able to eat it while it rains . how are you ? got anything going on today ?","725196":"this is tough ! as much as i prefer apple cider as a drink to pumpkin spice drinks , pumpkin has it beat in every other category ! there s so many tasty recipes involving pumpkin that it knocks apple and apple cider flavors out of the park .","725197":"i think that if my life were in chapters , the current chapter would be titled . . two sides to every coin . i want to leave it at that vague and up to interpretation .","725198":"we do this because it s hard to skew our focus towards the future , when stressful things are right in front of us . as little as those things might be , it s hard to move past them when we re in the moment .","725199":"i want my legacy to be a story of living life to the fullest , loving to the fullest , and leaving my mark behind in the form of creativity and art ."}}
