That just isn\u2019t possible. And you don\u2019t fall in love, that\u2019s just the feeling . You actually grow in love with someone as you get to know them on a deeper level and maybe even feel a connection to them. And honestly if you do \u201c fall in love at first sight\u201d it just means you have strong and immediate attraction to someone you have just met. Lust is just basically the desire for someone on a physical level. It\u2019s a overwhelming feeling of sexual desire.\n  ","957982":"\n  Bahahaha no I\u2019m not, that\u2019s childish\n  ","957983":"\n  Of course I believe in those things especially in relationships and friendships and even with family\n  ","957984":"\n  Thank you!
