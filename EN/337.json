something the other person does not , and they likely feel the same way towards you ! ! i understand where you re coming from though i often get down on myself because other people are smarter than me , but then i m also reminded that i have my own set of unique skills that others do not have , so that reassures me .","311734":"tbh i still love bernie sanders speeches and debates . he s incredibly charasmatic and blunt and isn t afraid to speak the truth . even mother nature approved of him .","311735":"is this supposed to mean something ? ?","311736":"well that accummulated fast

hard time making eye contact with people when i talk to them it s nothing personal , it s just something i ve always had a difficult time doing . it makes me feel as if they re wrongly judging me , tbh . but overall i do think eye contact is important . it shows confidence . but i also don t think people should be shamed if they can t make eye contact for their own personal reasons .","311741":"i have a brother who s years my senior . we don t have much of a relationship , but we get along just fine when we do see each other during family events .","311742":"i m not important enough for there to even be popular opinions about my existence .","311743":"they don t benefit nor disadvantage me . i simply receive questions , and i answer the ones i want while deleting the ones i don t want .","311744":"no ? it s not exactly something that concerns me , lol .","311745":"i m fiercely protective of my loved ones i care about them more than i care about myself at times , and i d risk anything i own to ensure their own happiness .","311746":"i m hoping to lose pounds .","311747":"i ve been eating somewhat healthier , but i m not trying to go overboard with it because i have tendencies towards disordered eating and an obsession with numbers . going to a vegetarian or vegan diet would be too restrictive for me .","311748":"thank you .","311749":"i d hate to disappoint you , but i don t smoke that much .","311750":"i literally just said i only smoke cigs per day lol .","311751":"i totally understand how that feels , trust me . idk man most of the time i just go to bed until i have to wake up and go to work , because at least it keeps my mind off of things . which probably isn t the healthiest thing to do but it s at least much better than my previous coping mechanisms , lol .","311752":"my life is completely different now compared to when i was , haha . when i was , i partied all the time , i was going to school , and i had a part time job . my life was hectic and chaotic and irresponsible and i preferred it that way . now at , i have a full time job with a degree and adult responsibilities . i feel like i ve grown up a lot in the past five years , and i know for sure that i ll continue growing by the time i m . hopefully by that time , i ll be living independently in a different state with a family of my own .","311753":"i ve always been left aligned in my political beliefs , i just never really associated them with feminism until i became more active on askfm twitter . joining this website introduced me to intersectional feminism originally , and although i don t necessarily align myself with feminism anymore , i m grateful for being introduced to this community because it s made me more aware of things going on in the world .","311754":"thankfully those are two topics that seldom come up during family gatherings my father s side of the family is fairly conservative , so i feel as if i would accidentally get into an argument with somebody , lmao .","311755":"i don t know myself well enough to know how i look from a third person perspective . i d like to think that i m confident on the outside because it s simply a defense mechanism for how utterly chaotic everything is for me , lol .","311756":"i clash with people who have arrogant selfish personalities people who don t think about anyone other then themselves or have nothing productive to add to conversations that don t somehow revolve around them . i ve also clashed with people who would prefer to talk about drama and people as opposed to things like music , art , politics , education , etc etc . i ve always found that those people lacked substance and i could never find a common ground with them .","311757":"any time i m in the wilderness is a time of happiness for me . i feel the most like myself when i m surrounded by nature .","311758":"i don t think i m in a place to give healthy advice on this topic because my parents method of discipline was unorthodox , to put it lightly , and i have no clue how teenagers are treated these days .","311759":"i ve been driving since i was years old . initially i was terrified of driving , but it was something i needed to do so i had to force myself to do it . i still don t like driving to this day , but i tolerate it .","311760":"i do like chocolate truffles occasionally , but i m not really a big dessert person . i love rainbow cookies with coffee though , haha .","311761":"ask has gotten really lifeless and lately i haven t been finding any reason to stay here .","311762":"let s not go there lol . lately my sleep has been plagued by nightmares and abstract imagery , and its been somewhat distressing . i ve been sleeping hours per night but waking up exhausted because my nightmares have been so vivid .","311763":"bones , criminal minds , supernatural , how i met your mother , parks and rec , ncis , orange is the new black , and stranger things .","311764":"i would assume so , yes you re bound together legally through marriage , so the responsibility of commitment is a lot more bearing than if you were in a relationship alone . to separate would mean to get a divorce , which costs a lot of time and money . so people are essentially taking a risk , and a leap of faith , when they get married which makes it even more important to ensure that you are certain , without a shadow of a doubt , that you are to remain committed to your partner .","311765":"hey there ! ! not too much , just waiting to clock into work . i m going to the gym tonight and strangely looking forward to it and then seeing my boyfriend afterwards , so i m expecting it to be a good day ! ! as long as work is kind to me , lol .","311766":"coffee and a cigarette , every morning . i can t function otherwise .","311767":"no but i m going to be the maid of honor in my best friend s wedding ! !","311768":"not necessarily . honeymoon phases are when you first enter a relationship and haven t established a history with your partner you re living off of the fumes of new love , new experiences , new everything . when you re in a seasoned relationship , however , it s not as if those feelings disappear they just take on a new form . the level of intimacy you have with your partner can take your breath away , they begin to know you better than you know yourself , and you feel as if you have the strongest support system because of your strong foundations . there s an unmatched feeling of comfort when you re around your partner and it s liberating .","311769":"i m a much better listener than i am a speaker , so i prefer to listen to my friends problems rather than speak about my own .","311770":"i m going to start working out tomorrow , so i bought fitness clothes today . it made me realize i literally have no idea what the fuck i m doing lol .","311771":"haha thank you ! !","311772":"if you still have friends who attend college , then no , that isn t weird at all .","311773":"this sounds like a college essay question .","311774":"i think it s ironic that i got this question after i had a discussion with my best friend about finally joining a gym lol .","311775":"i want to color my hair tonight , but i m really tired and idk if i m going to have the mental capacity to sit there and do it . but i really need to because my hair already faded from last week and now it s back to a gross brown color .","311776":"he honestly just sounds like an asshole who s deflecting blame off of himself and trying to excuse his own racist behavior by pointing out that other people are also racist which doesn t justify his racism at all .","311777":"i agree with you . i ve been keeping up with the news everyday and the things i ve been reading has me sick to my stomach . someone tried to burn down a mosque over the weekend , it s as if these acts of violence are getting more frequent .","311778":"people s worst colors have come out over the past week and its honestly terrifying .","311779":"this is not a question .","311780":"lol thank you celine .","311781":"it s ok to punch anyone you want to punch , how about that for consistency ? ? besides babies , naturally .","311782":"that awkward moment when people are literally defending nazis .","311783":"i m sorry , friend . at least you have another upcoming interview ! !","311784":"it s okay to punch your local nazi . nazis don t deserve your fucking sympathy .","311785":"other people s sexual fetishes aren t exactly my business , but like i said in my previous response , the concept has always made me uncomfortable regardless of the context . i don t see how you can view someone as a father figure and have sexual feelings towards that person without having some weird conflict of interests . but that s just my personal view , it s not something i would ever be interested in .","311786":"do nazis like scalping ? ?","311787":"obama wasn t the perfect president a lot of liberals make him out to be , but he s never done anything as bad as what trump is alleging to do .","311788":"cotton candy , actually . i haven t had it in years but i used to love it .","311789":"i don t think it s appropriate to ever make jokes about abvsive relationships .","311790":"not posting the lyrics , but you can listen to them yourself . uprising muse . https www . youtube . com watch ? v w

when i was a teenager i m not going to sit here and say this band saved my life but they all bridged the gap between suffering and help for me personally , and more importantly , they introduced me to communities which gave me a sense of hope when i lacked it the most .","311792":"yes , that s the correct way to say it . now let s put that quote into action .","311793":"leash boy . ? ? ? i have no tolerance for anons who try to spread their fetishes all over my own page . i m not against fetishes by any means , but there s a huge difference between having a fetish and then shoving that fetish into people s faces . it s just decent respect .","311794":"lipstick and eyeliner . you can never go wrong with a bold lip and sharp wing .","311795":"lol i d laugh in his face and walk away . get your fetishes away from me .","311796":"i don t think one automatically invalidates the other . they re both important topics for discussion in current events today . however , i do agree that antisemitism isn t discussed more often in feminist circles . the only people i see on my twitter feed talking about the holocaust remembrance day are famous activists and the jewish people whom i follow . fact that i wasn t aware of before today many muslims actually risked their lives to save jewish people during the holocaust , like this woman","311797":"whether people like the job or not is immaterial to the argument service jobs are necessary for the economy , and the fact that unemployment rates were extremely low while obama was in office is something that can t be denied .","311798":"this is probably really unhealthy , but the best way i ever personally got over a crush love relationship was by becoming interested in and pursuing someone else . i ve never had a moment in my life where i wasn t interested in somebody romantically .","311799":"the love a dog has for its owner .","311800":"my best friend is getting married by the court today so when they re done , i m going over their house to celebrate and sample wedding cake that they picked ! !","311801":"the only people i know who joke about trump like that are people who voted for trump i don t see anyone joking around when it comes to his ideas and executive orders because they could very much become a reality , and that reality is very real and terrifying for millions of people especially the lgbtqia , black , latino , muslim , jewish , and native communities .","311802":"https www . bbc . co . uk news amp this article explains it all .","311803":"i was literally stating a fact about the doomsday clock , but okay .","311804":"nuclear weaponry , most likely . this reminds me the bulletin of atomic scientists updated the doomsday clock recently , it s now . minutes to midnight instead of minutes to midnight . the reason why they moved the hand closer to midnight is due to trump s recent statements regarding nuclear weapons and lack of regard for climate change . this is the closest the hand has been to midnight since the testing of the hydrogen bomb in .","311805":"i slept for about hours last night , and i m still exhausted . i also have a headache , probably from nightmares and too much sleep , and i just feel awful . i wish i could go home and relax .","311806":"i ve been asleep for the past four hours and all i want to do is go back to bed .","311807":"i ve been watching a show on netflix called the killing , it s actually really intense . it follows a detective in depth as she investigates murder cases and you learn all of the intimate details of everyone involved . the first two seasons focuses on one single case , so it s very intricate and compelling .","311808":"not generally , no . i have no interest in making new friends or forming new connections . i have

day i wake up with less and less faith in the world . but then i m always reminded that regardless of the strife we ve endured , we have always overcome . the women s march was the largest protest in

trendy to be depressed or anxious or svicidal or to have a personality disorder and it sickens me so much . you guys want my disorders ? ? fucking take them . i don t want them . my life would be so

person who s threatening to take away basic healthcare that has saved the lives of millions of people , a person who plans on defunding a government program that provides free education and healthcare to millions of women across the country . i have a lot of words for a person like that , and respect is not one of them .","311852":"no . you don t have to agree with or respect your leader simply

because it ll be defunded . if we think healthcare now is terrible , it s only going to get worse . and it scares the shit out of me because so many people are dependent upon the healthcare system and so many people will die from these changes .","311859":"i wish i could have gone to the women s march , but i couldn t and i cheered on all my friends in spirit . apparently the nyc one was wonderful

marching right now .","311862":"i don t have to identify as a woman to stand together with women during the women s marches . also , it was an example obviously someone telling me to shut up online isn t going to make me go away , but it s just a microcosm of what s currently happening around the world . people are protesting , and then there are people who are protesting the protestors . regardless of what people will say , the numbers of people protesting outside right now is strong and overwhelming and proves that we will always come together in times of struggle to prove a greater cause .","311863":"i logged back onto twitter for the first time in about a month to tweet about the women s marches . i made one tweet about solidarity and i already have a man telling me to shhh .

fight off the rash inflammation so hopefully that kicks in by tomorrow .","311889":"and what s even worse is that the perceptions are wrong even down to the name of the fucking disorder . but people refuse to educate themselves and do their own research or listen to people , like yourself , with did who actively advocate against movies like split because they don t have to suffer with this shit

day and loved him the next , i must have multiple personalities ! ! bangs head into wall","311890":"exactly . it doesn t matter that it s a cool storyline , people are going to interpret it how they want to interpret it and put people in literal danger due to the stigma that already exists . idk how people don t understand that .","311891":"you can promote a horror movie about a killer without putting blame on a mental illness that s already highly stigmatized to begin with . people already think those with did are violent and homicidal when they re not , and this movie is promoting that stereotype . there s no reason to use a mental illness which afflicts thousands of people as a plot device . it doesn t matter if the movie is trying to say yeah well only this one guy is nuts . humankind doesn t work that way . and now thousands of people with did are going to be walking around in fear of their safety because everyone is going to assume that they re also murderous and violent . don t use mental illnesses as plot devices . don t use mental illnesses as plot devices . don t use mental illnesses as plot devices .","311892":"so i just got back from the doctor and

trembling ball of anxiety anymore and i can do a lot more things now than i never thought was possible . my recovery from sh , even years later i have temptations and urges because it s so innate in me to fall back on that previous behavior . but i haven t relapsed in a while and i m proud of that . i m proud of my writing style and the progress i ve made in my talent over the years . the more you write , the better you write , and that s become evident to me over the past few years when i look at my past work . idk if this is something i should be proud of or not , but my ability to cut

even though the way they raised me wasn t the most ideal , it at least taught me what not to be or what behavior is unacceptable when interacting with others . my schools and education , i place a lot

a better phrase . i feel like i raised myself more than i was raised by my own parents , so i developed my own moral code and sense of ethics through my observation of others and through reading

relationship .","311899":"i would never become a teacher myself , but i suppose each one has their own reason to doing so i have friends who are teachers because they want to make a genuine difference in young kids lives , they want to open the doors of education for them , and they want to see students succeed . teaching takes a lot of sacrifices , so you have to truly be passionate for the job .","311900":"likely due to societal pressures our society is revolved around sex , as if it s the greatest thing to happen to humankind . from such young ages , we re taught that sex is something to

this was one of the first novels that made me interested in writing , her writing style is extraordinary , and the way she weaves her characters is great . i think you d really dig the timeline .","311902":"i ve never watched any of the star wars movies . not necessarily because i didn t want to , but i just never had an opportunity to watch them at all . i have a bachelor s degree in professional writing communications with a minor in english literature . i m a tattoo enthusiast , and i have five tattoos and tons more to come ! ! i ve also had my labret and nostril pierced i ve taken both out since then . i ve been in a relationship for the past seven years , and i m happier than i could ever be . he s my entire support system and i m so grateful for our connection . i used

invest in their merch and cds ! ! if you cannot care for an animal , do not return them to the pet store . please take them to an animal hospital where they can be properly treated . better yet , don t buy animals as gifts unless you are certain you can care for them . there are so many animals who have been returned because they didn t turn out to be what the consumer expected , and it s so so wrong .","311905":"i don t recall asking for your opinion ? ? if you didn t care , then you wouldn t have bothered to write on my page .","311906":"third wave feminism has become somewhat of a joke these days , and most internet feminists adhere themselves to causes which don t make much of a valid difference in the world e . g . , free the nipple campaign , making everyone feel inclusive , etc . there s a lot of rhetoric about accepting people regardless of who they are , which is a bit counter productive considering how feminism began due to a dire need for radical change . i strongly oppose the death penalty , regardless of who it is who s on the chopping block . i don t want to waste taxpayer dollars on criminals who are getting the easy way out of their circumstance they deserve to rot in jail and be victim to the other inmates for the rest of their lives . lifesaving medications should be free of cost or , if not , at least extremely affordable . the games that insurance companies play with pharmaceuticals and doctor offices is asinine , and it prevents a lot of people from obtaining medication which can literally save their life . diabetics shouldn t have to empty their wallets to pay for their insulin , just like how a mental health patient shouldn t go without their mood stabilizers because they can t afford it .","311907":"anancitae heartofstitches

choices , regardless of what they are . even though you re still under their roof , you should be able to express that freedom as long as it s also not infringing on their privacy as well e . g . , if you took someone home with you .","311909":"a lot of americans only know of female and male bathrooms in public settings , there has never actually been a gender neutral bathroom that anyone could use regardless of their gender . as such , when the topic of transgender people using bathrooms became a hot topic , a lot of americans were up in arms because they didn t know which bathroom they should use . point blank , if we introduced gender neutral bathrooms as a third option , i think it would eradicate a lot of the mass hysteria that exists regarding the whole bathroom issue .","311910":"i think it s wildly inappropriate , especially given what mlk stood for in his time and what his ideals still stand for today . it s a spit in the face to all people of color who continue to spread mlk

environment they live in , crime rates in the area , how far the distance is between home and school , etc . ideally , i don t think any child should walk to school alone , but that may be me speaking out of bias because i grew up in a dangerous neighborhood and was constantly afraid of getting assaulted on the street every time i had to walk somewhere .","311915":"i m a legal writer for a law firm

overall violence , yeah . if a person already has violent tendencies , playing violet video games will only condition them into thinking that violence is acceptable and normal we ve become so comfortable with the idea of violence through violent media that we hardly blink an eye when we see violence in real life .","311924":"imagine all of the dark and ugly parts of yourself your past trauma , your character flaws , your mistakes , and your regrets . imagine taking all of these bits of yourself and tossing them into a box where nobody can touch them , nobody can take them away from you . they re yours and yours alone . now imagine giving that box reluctantly to someone , because they promised they would help you sort through the box and find all of the goodness left when the box is empty again . imagine trusting someone with that box with every ounce of your being , and being able to sigh in relief because that person would never let that box out of their sight , let alone allow it to fall into the wrong hands . imagine someone cherishing that box because it s part of who you are , and imagine the kind of comfort that would bring you , knowing that there s a person in the world who will treat it with the kind of care that you deserve .","311925":"my favorite mug is my montauk mug that my boyfriend bought for me last year . it s a big size , holds a lot of coffee ,

having the true active experience of being outdoors , running around and playing with friends , learning new games and sports , etc . like , when i was a kid , we used to fight with our parents because we didn t want to go inside when the sun was setting because we were having too much fun playing outside with our friends . you don t really see that anymore . the streets are empty . and i think that s such a vital part of childhood because it s as if kids today are missing out on having those opportunities to be active and develop proper social skills .","311934":"ah thank you ? ? i m

lately it s been more pronounced than usual , it s one of the few things that can capture my interest these days . i just find it compelling why people choose to commit certain crimes , what

word and what it means because it erases the experiences of sxxual abvse survivors . it takes a concept that s supposed to be simple and complicates it due to something that was out of their control .

upgrade instead of fixing it , thereby giving the company more power and more money . it s a horrible system that isn t at all revolved around the consumer at all . it s all part of a power trip to

know that they re going to reject my ideas anyway ? ? it s simply better for my mental health when i don t involve myself in drama , especially askfm drama . people come and go in waves here , and allegiances are always changing , which can be mentally draining . i know whom i can trust from askfm , so if i ever do have anything bad to say about someone , i know it s not going to end up on someone s receipt or something silly like that .","311998":"i ve been in a relationship with a cis man for years .","311999":"have you ever considered that those who are trans are most susceptible to violent situations because of the fact that they re trans ? ? studies done on the topic have not made any positive or negative correlation between being trans and having a history of abvse because

abortions in the past .","312006":"it s better to forgive both for your own mental health and for the sake of the person who has wronged you . if someone has intentionally hurt you , it would be hypocritical for you to stoop down to their level in an act of revenge . they re not worth the energy that would take to do so , and a much better use of your time and energy would be just to simply

that people aren t angry with me . i need others to validate what i m doing so that i don t end up one giant , anxious mess because i don t know my ups from downs . so no , i don t think it s weird at

regarding mental health , and just simply being supportive when i needed it . ?","312054":"it was . i don t feel comfortable answering questions about my past , though . it s something i generally avoid talking about on askfm because people can be cruel , and the last thing i need are people harassing me for my story or questioning the validity of what i ve gone through .","312055":"i m honestly not too worried about it for every advancement in technology , we will always need people to act as technicians to oversee those advancements and to ensure that they re working in proper order . not every technological feat can be independent , so there will always be openings for jobs associated with maintenance , cleaning , etc . in addition , there are simply some jobs that cannot be replaced by technology , such as being a doctor or a nurse or social worker . having the human ability to empathize with others is important to physical and mental healing .","312056":"what monster pours the milk before the cereal ? ?","312057":"why would i continue holding an opinion if that opinion was proven to be wrong or misinformed ? ? i m not prideful like that if i hold an opinion and

your trust and slept with another person . you seem like a good person , and you deserve someone who will treat you with the utmost kindness and respect . this is something you need to discuss with him there s no avoiding it . and even if it does result in a conflict , it isn t your fault that he cheated on you . that decision was entirely on him , and he needs to know there are consequences to his actions .","312060":"of course i would be comfortable someone s past history does not determine the type of person that they are , and what s in the past stays in the past . as long as they re not

i haven t cracked it open yet , but i can only imagine how wonderful it is because the movie was so great .","312065":"i think sex education should teach students about the human anatomy , methods of birth control , stds , different sexualities , and laws of consent . i don t think it should teach anything regarding the abstinence method because it s an antiquated idea and leads teenagers to

gender is how you identify yourself based upon sociological expectations . for instance , someone who is cisgender aligns their gender with their biological sex while someone who is transgender does not .","312074":"male is a sex determined by chromosomes . you re thinking about gender , in which someone can identify as a man .","312075":"idk the statistics on the topic , so this is something you ll have to research on your own . the term most is just an assumption and its probably inaccurate . the pill isn t an ideal form of birth control for many people , and generally it takes a few doctor visits and trial and errors to determine what method of birth control is best . in addition , condoms prevent stds while methods such as the pill or the patch do not . so medical professionals suggest that couples use at least two methods of birth control to protect against diseases and unwanted pregnancy .","312076":"considering i m not a male , i wouldn t have any idea of what it feels like to

afterwards , we re meeting up with her fianc and my boyfriend .","312084":"while there is a stigma surrounding the black community and mental illness , that doesn t mean my mental illnesses magically disappear . you can t invalidate a person s illnesses due to their race when their race is immaterial to the development of those illnesses .","312085":"i can see where the notion comes from . whether or not the two people intended on creating a person , the idea originated with the thought of them having sex . ?","312086":"i must have forgotten that my chemical imbalances determined how depressed i am based on my race . you should probably inform my psychiatrist too .","312087":"aw thank you . tbh it s always something that has concerned me and has deterred me from the idea of kids , i would

of recognizing that the person is toxic to me i ve always had a hard time with that , but i ve been trying to live by the mantra of keep people in your life who make the effort to keep you in theirs . if someone doesn t make the effort to see how i m doing , and if they don t respond to my efforts of calling attention to it , then i don t need them in my life anymore . i don t have room for anyone who won t promote positivity or better well being . that being said , thankfully i ve never had a problem with cutting those people out of my life . generally , once i recognize that someone is bad

witness to violence . the dog isn t to blame they re just working off of their basic instincts that has been instilled in them as a result of their environment . obviously this isn t the first time the family put this dog through great stress for their own amusement , otherwise he wouldn t have behaved so aggressively . an investigation into the household is warranted . as for the dog , i personally believe he should be re homed . but because society sucks and doesn t understand basic behavior , he s likely going to be put down and not given a chance for redemption .","312099":"jfc , shit like this pisses me off so much . there s diagnostic criteria to mental disorders for a reason . people go to school for years and study mental illnesses for a damn reason . to properly assess and diagnose illnesses for those who are legitimately suffering from them , to offer them the best course of treatment available so that they can have the best quality of life . the fact that people are jokingly saying they have ptsd is such a kick in the face of survivors who do experience all of the classic symptoms of ptsd , every day , without warning . this is why there s still so much stigma revolved around mental illness . because people view it as a fucking joke and ignore those who are genuinely struggling .","312100":"my gillbaby s new tank .","312101":"i feel like feminism has turned more into a social trend as opposed to a form of activism , which disappoints me because it s led so far astray from its original intentions . it s part of the reason why i don t identify with feminism anymore there are so many feminists who don t do their research , ascribe to trains of thought with no intellectual meaning , and regurgitate false information just because it s something that s on buzzfeed now . people who force themselves into communities in which they don t belong , like feminist communities or communities revolving around specific mental health problems , are disgusting and are the reasons why there is still so much stigma revolved around mental illness . you can simultaneously support your friends with mental illnesses i . e . due to trauma without infringing upon their communities . it s the reason why i don t tell people i have a personality disorder , because while my doctors have been alluding towards it in our sessions , i haven t been officially diagnosed and i wouldn t want to step on anyone s toes . stop romanticizing and fetishizing unhealthy and destructive coping techniques . stop making aesthetics out of people s genuine mental health concerns . if you ve never suffered from an ed or sh or anything else , you have no right to wax poetic on what they truly are horrible addictions .","312102":"going to doctor appointments always mentally drains me and idk why .","312103":"i never make resolutions because i just get disappointed with myself when i don t stick with them . however , some long term goals that i have are to continue to remove distance myself from toxic people from my life . to work more on my mental health and develop healthier coping mechanisms and recognize unhealthy thought patterns . to reward myself when i do good work without associating guilt with it . to read more books . to drink more water . to communicate my needs better without feeling insecure or worthless about those needs .","312104":"dunkin donuts because i m a basic white bitch who s addicted to coffee .","312105":"because the prospect of being hurt by someone is a lot easier to deal with than the prospect of that

ve ended friendships because most people i used to associate with only bothered with me because they were using me for their own personal gains like getting alcohol or drugs , or getting free rides to places , and other such things . there came a point when i realized they never asked me how i was , they never asked how to compensate me for what i was doing for them , and they never contacted me except to ask when i was going to the bar or if i was free to get them . so i broke off those friendships and haven t looked back .","312107":"although burning the flag is protected under the first

s disgusting . there s no hierarchy regarding console gamers versus pc gamers . i never understood why there was such a competition between the two . we re all gamers with a love for the craft , who gives a shit whether we play it on pc or console . self diagnosis should never be used as a substitute for genuine mental health treatment . there s so much more to treatment than putting a name to your symptoms and running with it , and you run the risk of infringing on specific communities by self diagnosing a complex disorder that normally takes months for a licensed professional to distinguish .","312117":"hazel green .","312118":"tbh , i think it s a bit borderline rude . you don t know if english is even their first language , and its a hell of a lot harder to learn english

movement from whence it originated . it s exploded online and has guaranteed people likes and follows , when the origins of the movement were about bringing about equality and awareness regardless of how radical their ideas seemed . and as a result , feminism has become somewhat of a joke for people to poke fun at and ridicule because of the mass quantities of people who misinterpret feminism as a whole and use it to further their own gains . i ve stopped aligning myself with modern feminism for that reason , i don t want to be seen as another trend follower when my beliefs and opinions are

so much .","312152":"think about how we are as humans , with our flaws and nasty traits that we wish we could change but can t . nobody is perfect and its impossible to find someone worth who you ll agree on things . it s normal for couples to butt heads on issues , and its expected because that shows that you at least are open and communicating with your partner . compromising is actually a good thing it shows that you both are aware that you have different opinions on something but you respect that other person s opinion . if couples didn t compromise on important things and weren t able to

be stuck .","312200":"it s perfectly okay to cut toxic people out of your life after some time , you ll realize that some people in your life don t allow you to progress into a better version of

about the health of my teeth than i am ? gosh .","312265":"of course not . that s awfully shallow . if money was my main concern with respect to relationships , then i probably wouldn t have started

person struggling with those triggers . i ve never suffered from an ed myself , but i ve had close friends who have and food can be just as much of a trigger for people with eds as loud noises or certain smells are for those with ptsd . making fun of a person because their trigger is a certain food is blatantly misunderstanding the concept of what a trigger is , and i hope everyone who has laughed at a trigger realizes how harmful their attitude can be to people who are in recovery . people have turned triggers into a joke , and its done so much harm to the mental health community .

no other alternative . i agree that you shouldn t probably be on your phone as often as you probably were , but he should have sat you down and talked about how it was affecting your relationship first . then you could have acknowledged that it was a problem and learned not to be on your phone as often when you two are trying to spend quality time together . at the very least , you can take

emergencies . or in a regulated environment , if they want to go shooting or something . i definitely am for stricter gun control , though . it should be harder for the average citizen to obtain a gun

hallucinations fall under symptoms of psychotic disorders , but you don t necessarily have to have schizophrenia to have those symptoms . there are also disorders like schizoaffective disorder or simply just having a psychotic episode that can make those symptoms arise . however , having those symptoms is obviously indicative that you do have something going on if you could talk to someone

know she probably won t judge me , but it s moreso a reflection of my own mental health issues . however , i do understand where you re coming from . i ve had therapists in the past whom i felt i couldn t be entirely truthful because i didn t think they would understand , there was a generation gap , etc . it goes on a case by case basis . . . if you feel like you re not connecting with them

really wanted to take off thursday as well , because i still wasn t feeling my best even after taking a personal day , but i forced myself out of bed and went to work anyway . it s small and stupid and meaningless to most people , but i was proud of myself when i got to work . i felt horrible and i still managed to make it , when a year ago , i would go days where i wouldn t show up to work due

stay awake because of the writing i do is critical thinking , so if i ever need to make an emergency bathroom run , they re few and far in between .","312497":"it s a real issue in my household , lmao . i went to a discount store the other day for christmas wrapping paper and tags , and i ended up spending like on other miscellaneous shit . i almost bought a really cute tall frida coffee mug with a large handle because i don t own any tall mugs , but decided against it because my mother would kill me .","312498":"yikes . i understand there may be some medical circumstances where it may be necessary , but circumcision is usually a cosmetic procedure and has no real benefit . this may sound odd but it s just the type of stuff i talk about with my friends lol but one of my friends isn t circumcised , and he says it s absolutely fine and it s easy to keep it clean as long as you re taught how to clean from an early age . he s never had any issues .","312499":"i honestly forgot that i bought one for you , because my memory is shit lol . i hope you enjoy it , though ! !","312500":"haha , terrible . i m borderline legally blind . i ve been wearing glasses since i was years old , i have pretty bad astigmatism , and my eyesight gets worse each year .","312501":"sounds pretty harmful no doubt the child will grow an attachment to you before the lease expires , and they won t want to be returned for a newer model .","312502":"arnold palmer , coffee , and bud light .","312503":"depends what you mean by recognition obviously we should recognize that people celebrate various religions and holidays , and i think there should be more education about holidays other than typical christian holidays such as christmas and easter . however , if you re implying that we should give kids off from school for every single holiday imaginable then no , that s just counterproductive .","312504":"babyyyyyy . ?","312505":"that s one extra second of me hating myself everyday , lolololol .","312506":"i was always good in school i never really tried very hard , but i always ended up getting good grades , even in my advanced classes . i was that asshole who never studied , but always ended up getting near perfect scores on exams and ruining the curve , haha .","312507":"i feel like this is the question that prompted people to delve into otherkin , lmao .","312508":"no , i looked it over and i have questions about it so i m just going to wait until i see my therapist and see if i can t take it with her in her office on our next session . it makes me incredibly nervous and i don t think i can take it alone , lol . thank you though that s really sweet of you .","312509":"haha , right ! ! i was supposed to go to ak when my best friend still lived there , but unfortunately she had to move back to ny due to a family emergency and i never ended up making the trip .","312510":"australia , new zealand , alaska , england , and ireland .","312511":"considering its a well established fact that pornography objectifies women , i ll have to say i do agree .","312512":"tbh my friends who are are hella mature for their age , which is why we get along . idk if i could be friends with the typical year old though , that s a bit too young for my liking .","312513":"hello it is i , the one with eye bags so huge i look like i m always punched in the face","312514":"an advocate is someone who acts on behalf of a cause i m an advocate for those who are disabled due to my job , but i primarily like to focus on mental health because it s something that s personally meaningful to me due to my own mental health issues . i like spreading awareness , dispelling misconceptions , and erasing the stigma associated with mental health conditions .","312515":"i didn t realize answering one question about hypermasculinity meant i spent all of my time talking about issues revolved around men lol . you obviously don t visit my page frequently . your confidence is amusing .","312516":"i think we actually mature depending on who you are , i suppose . when i think about how i thought and behaved a year ago , it s remarkably different from how i am now . in another year from now , i ll likely be even more well rounded and mature . the more we experience , the more knowledge we have off which to base our thoughts and decisions .","312517":"unbreakable kimmy schmidt ! ! ?","312518":"honestly , yeah . unfortunately , boys grow up in this gendered society where men aren t supposed to show emotion . hypermasculinity as prompted by the media makes people believe that they re not a real man if they show sensitivity . so when it comes to boys with depression , they re often told to get over it or they re not even taken seriously . obviously this doesn t mean that girls and nonbinary individuals don t face societal pressures due to mental health","312519":"i ve always wanted my social media accounts to be a teaching ground for tolerance and mental health awareness . i can only hope that those who visit my page learn how to think from different perspectives and how to accept others for their beliefs or opinions . i also am really passionate about mental health awareness , so i hope people can walk away from my page with more knowledge and understanding .","312520":"gender neutral bathrooms . everyone has one in their house ,

there was also a science museum my grade visited somewhere on long island when i was in school , i can t remember which one it was though but it was really fun and interactive ! !","312524":"i totally agree ! ! my educational field trips were a lot of fun , we ended up going to different museums in new york city at times and that alone was a blast .","312525":"i don t even know what it feels like to go on a field trip for fun and how schools are even allowed to do such a thing when that money is better used to go towards educational pursuits . i grew up in a bad neighborhood so we rarely went on trips , and when we did , it was purely educational . it enriched my learning experience .","312526":"i m not being dragged into this debate . i already offered you my opinion and i agree with morgan . school is a place of education . i m not discussing this further .","312527":"i don t care about your opinion of morgan s opinion . you don t get to dictate what someone does and doesn t do with their child . it s ultimately the parent s decision . when you have children , you ll be able to raise them the way you see fit .","312528":"before i read her answers , i honestly didn t even know that schools are allowed to authorize trips that weren t educational in nature . when i was growing up , my districts were so poor that if we were given money for a field trip , it was to be used to go to a museum or something worthwhile . so in that vein , i totally agree with morgan . i don t see the purpose of a field trip for school if there isn t educational value in it .","312529":"to be perfectly honest i like talking about myself , i like the attention it brings me , and i like the validation i receive from some people who like my answers . i ve always been like this on social media though , lol .","312530":"i think people have an obligation to tell others if they have any illnesses that can be contracted through bodily fluid or contact it s just basic human decency . he should have told her before they decided to be intimate , he obviously knows how life changing such a diagnosis can be . as for those on the other side , there obviously is always a risk of contracting a disease , but the blame shouldn t be put on them for not asking first . it s common sense .","312531":"this is what i look like today .","312532":"both , i suppose . i have friends , both in real life and on askfm , who are younger and older than me . age doesn t really make much of a difference to me , i like conversing with people who are interesting and mature .","312533":"what the hell happened

.","312537":"hi friends pls send me good vibes that i ll be able to make it through today .","312538":"i think too many variables go into driving a car , and a self driving car may get into more accidents because you can t predict everything that ll happen on the road .","312539":"i do , actually . it took me a while to find a therapist i could trust , but i love my current therapist and she s helped me so much in the past few months in terms of how i view myself . i m still in the very beginning stages of everything , however , but i m looking forward to talking with her every week .","312540":"talk about my past and how its reflected in who i am in the present , how my past has influenced my behavior , restructure my thought processes to positive self talk and mindfulness , etc . we also discuss things that are happening in my everyday life that influence my moods and behavior , and how i can view these situations differently so that i may react in a more positive manner the next time a similar situation occurs .","312541":"i m attending weekly cbt and biweekly to monthly medication management .","312542":"uh , a lot of personal reasons that i m not obligated to discuss on askfm . so to put it broadly , the regular tribulations of mental illness . i just have to keep reminding myself that recovery doesn t always have to mean no more bad days . i m still progressing i m still moving forward . and one bad day doesn t take away all of the strides i ve already made thus far .","312543":"bioshock infinite is such an intense fucking game","312544":"smart enough that i have a iq and graduated college on the president s list and with a magna cum laude honorary title .","312545":"yeah , that s cheating . if they didn t discuss the idea beforehand and he wasn t aware

?","312547":"i hate waking up and not feeling real i hate questioning existence i hate existing i hate living on this plane of reality i hate myself i hate everything i stand for i hate my body and my mind and my soul and i fucking hate this so fucking much","312548":"that s been me for the past few days . . . i ve been in such an irritable mood , which is discouraging because idk if it s just a one time thing or its because my period is coming or my medication isn t working . i m on a mood stabilizer which is supposed to make my mood swings disappear . either way , i ve been so fucking cranky and i don t want to talk with anyone .","312549":"plot twist i am the white rabbit","312550":"another thing that sucks about my new medication is that it prevents me from falling back asleep i just woke up and its am and i don t even have to be awake right now , but there s nothing i can do about it because now i m awake for the day . fml .","312551":"thank thank .","312552":"coffee , tea ,

that seems to be the new trending q a site ! ! and a lot of people from askfm have already migrated there , it seems .","312556":"somewhat , but not entirely . we can be friends with people without agreeing with their opinions , so that isn t necessarily a reflection of who you are . however , i also believe that if your friends are stating racist or otherwise harmful ideas , it s your responsibility as a friend to sit them down and explain to them why they re being hurtful . it s hard for us to grow adapt if we can t learn to accept other people s perspectives on our views , and often it s difficult for us to be critical towards ourselves to realize when we re wrong .","312557":"i m sorry you ve been feeling this way please know that your feelings matter , and your struggles have always been valid . i m not disabled so i wouldn t know first hand , but my clients are all disabled individuals , so i know a little bit of the struggles one may go through . if you ever need to talk , please know that my inbox is always open or you can message me on other social media i have twitter , tumblr , and instagram . stay safe , friend . ?","312558":"that s the only thing i was worried about , which is why i stayed quiet for so long . thank you .","312559":"i m not a professional writer for no reason . lol , just kidding . idk i just felt obligated to write a response to this whole situation . i m not saying that marissaravengrove isn t entitled to her own opinion by any means , because she totally is . and i m obviously too old to call out people , and i didn t want to tiptoe the issue any longer , especially considering i work with disabled adults and children for a living . idk , also part of my mental illnesses have to do with acceptance and abandonment , so a large part of me was afraid of backlash from everyone . i hope i portrayed myself correctly , because i m not attacking anyone by any means .","312560":"ok so you guys know that i generally don t involve myself in drama , but considering i m a feminist as well as a disability advocate , i felt the need to say something . the way marissa went about portraying her opinion was wrong that , i agree with . you collectively do not get to decide who does or does not get offended by what you collectively say that doesn t make people too sensitive , it makes them human beings . by stating what she said , it gave an incredibly bad name to those with disabilities and only furthered the stigma that those with disabilities are somehow lesser human beings . and , as you know , that isn t true . i think what s crucial here is language the term burden has many heavy , negative connotations . and while i think marissa had a logical theory in mind , she went about portraying that opinion in a very negative fashion . obviously being disabled places a person in positions of medical or financial destitution , but the term burden has always meant something deeper more intimate than that , and i think that s why this entire situation went awry . people with disabilities are not burdens in the negative context of the term , and if you ask parents with disabled children , they will tell you that they re thankful for what they have because having a child when you want one is better than not having one at all . if you re the type of person who could not handle having a child with a disability , then to me that indicates that you re simply not ready to handle parenthood . that s just my two cents","312561":"i think askfm s expiration date is fast approaching , tbh . a lot of people have been leaving and i ve been noticing that it hasn t been as lively as it used to be in the past . if anything , it ll be a domino effect one person leaves , which prompts another to leave , and so on and so on . personally speaking , i m already giving up on askfm . half of the time , idk why i m still here because of what i receive in my inbox is either spam or harassment .","312562":"i love this quote , and i agree . you do not have to necessarily agree with a certain viewpoint in order to look at it from that perspective and contemplate how other people can agree with it . a major part of education is learning about perspectives and opinions other than your own , as well as learning how to play the devil s advocate , so to speak , in balancing all of these views . it s important to see things from all sides it would be close minded to only want to view an issue from one side only . if you feel strongly about a subject , you have every right to hold your own opinion , but it s important to consider all facets of the topic first .","312563":"i ve never had an eating disorder , but i agree . nobody should aspire to have any illness , whether it s anorexia nervosa or bipolar disorder or personality disorders or did or psychosis or ocd or anything else . it takes away from those who are legitimately suffering , because we damn sure don t want our illnesses .","312564":"my medication canned goods a fucking boat","312565":"why was this sent to me of all people","312566":"? ? ? i assume you meant friends , right ? lol","312567":"so you guys convinced me , i m starting unbreakable kimmy schmidt","312568":"i knew answering that question would bring the trolls out of the woodworks . ? all i said was that i wasn t stating my opinion for all to judge , and i wasn t picking sides . sooooo if horcruxes and hallows or marissaravengrove think i m not a feminist anymore for those reasons , then please let me know . ?","312569":"tbh i think we all know who the anon is already . ?","312570":"hey alychonga , apparently you re old now . ? i think people tend to forget that i m in my mid s and a majority of the people i talk to are either in their s or s . most of my coworkers are married and have children . it s just a part of growing up .","312571":"obviously not , considering what he s done to cuba . however , i hope the country will improve now that he s deceased .","312572":"i know you mean well , but using the term crazy isn t exactly appreciated on a universal scale , especially on this side of askfm where many of us have mental illnesses and feel the negative connotations that the word has to offer . i don t know if you meant crazy as in mentally ill , or as ridiculous , or as obnoxious , or as dangerous , or as any other connotation of the term . . . but i just wanted to forewarn you that its seen as a slur for many people , myself included , and that i hope in the future perhaps you can use a different adjective to describe these feelings .","312573":"quiet , humble , and contemplative . all i d need is my significant other , my xbox , my coffee maker , and perhaps a park to visit if the weather is breezy and cool . i m not a people person by any means , and i d always rather spend my weekends off for recharging and unwinding .","312574":"yes , i have a tendency to be extremely competitive when it comes to work and or school i always feel as if i need to prove to others that i m the best at what i can do , as much as i probably need to prove to myself that i m good at what i do . when other people get recognition , i do admit i become jealous . but it s not something i ever outright say to others , i usually just let it simmer in myself and use it as fuel to try harder .","312575":"i guess i can understand why people choose to catfish , because they re too insecure to be themselves in a world where appearances are unfortunately everything . however , i ll never understand why people would go to such lengths to pretend to be other people or even steal other people s images and then lie to suitors about who they are . . . i feel like on some level it s manipulation and its also incredibly misleading .","312576":"it was a joke , lol . caffeine is technically classified as a drug , but i was insinuating that there are a lot worse drugs out there than caffeine .","312577":"sure , let me just whip out my scratchpad and tally all of the times i ve engaged in sex because people love to ruin the mood by keeping count of all of the times they re about to get jiggy .","312578":"why do people like this exist ?","312579":"like i stated in my previous answer . . . i don t make it a habit to involve myself in other people s personal affairs . i don t care about other people s sex partners . as long as my friends are happy , then that s fine by me .","312580":"i was making book covers earlier , and i m excited to edit my other stories tomorrow so that i can upload them with the covers . i m

disrespect those who consider themselves feminists . it used to have positive connotations , but these days , the term is used in an often jokingly manner that diminishes the credibility of social

an eyebrow gel . they re actually kinda messy underneath but you can t see it in the photo .","312597":"my current profile photo requires attention thank you","312598":"tbh i think that s perfectly acceptable especially if the dark humor lol helps you cope with what you re struggling with . i joke about my illnesses at times , it makes it easier for me to deal with them and it lessens the tension in the air if i m trying to talk to someone about what i m currently experiencing . i probably should have specified in my last post , though people who usually use triggered ! as an insult or to make light of mental illnesses are usually neurotypical and have no idea what it s like to actually have real triggers .","312599":"this is one of my pet peeves being triggered by a situation , smell , person , object , etc . is a very legitimate and valid notion . it s something that s been studied in the mental health field for dozens of years . people s triggers are very real to them , even if it may not necessarily be real for someone else . it disgusts me how jokingly saying triggered ! has become such a hot trend these days because it s been taking away from the legitimacy of those who suffer from real triggers . mental health patients are literally afraid to tell their doctors their triggers because the internet has turned their triggers into a humiliating joke . it s pathetic .","312600":"tbh there s nothing wrong with taking a day off from school or work on the rare occasion if you re feeling burnt out . i just don t think it should be called a mental health day because that insinuates that they re missing school or work due to their mental health , which may not necessarily be the case . i mean , i take a lot of mental health days , but i m also very mentally ill and my mental health days comprise of me simply attempting to get our of bed or not kill myself , so . . .","312601":"well , this is actually two fold because these two situations are extremely different . people who claim to have a mental illness but actually don t tbh i think they re disgusting human beings who have no idea what sort of life they d actually be living if they were , in reality , mentally ill . mental illnesses take reign over every little detail of someone s life , and for someone who s neurotypical to make a commodity out of mental illness means that they re spitting in the face of survivors , neuroatypical type , and other people struggling with illnesses . people who have a mental illness that dramatizes their illness for attention this situation is something i have more sympathy towards because it could simply be a symptom of their illness . i require a lot of attention myself , and i m not afraid to tell a person that the attention they re paying to me is inadequate . i know it s a symptom of my mental illness and there s nothing wrong with requiring attention if you ve lacked it your entire life .","312602":"no , i make it a point to not go shopping on black friday . i don t care what kinds of deals there are , i d rather wait until cyber monday if i needed something that badly . black friday is the epitome of capitalist greed people literally go to such lengths as to hurt complete strangers because of something as obsolete as a sale on an item that nobody genuinely needs . retail sales associates who are forced to work on black friday are spit on and disrespected for working , are not looked upon as human beings , and are outright insulted by total strangers for being in the position that they re in . even though of the time , they have no other choice . i highly dislike black friday . as a former retail worker who used to work on black friday , i can say with confidence that the worst of people comes out on this day . for everyone who follows me or whom i follow who is working in retail today please know that you are doing as much as you can , you are loved , and you are respected . don t let the things

whether or not you want to adhere that label to yourself . that being said . . . you have to take some time to think about why you feel uneasy about this situation . it s easy for us to get caught up

identify why it makes you uneasy so that you can properly address it . it s hard to un learn things that have become so accustomed to us over the years . that s understandable . but now that you recognize that this is a problem , you should address it within yourself .","312641":"guys ! ! i m ! ! writing ! ! creatively ! ! for the first time ! ! in years ! ! granted it s to finish a story
