We have facts in our faces, doctors being covered up and silenced, with GAG ORDERS, Think about that for a second.. we have been scared into thinking it IS a plague\n  ","302625":"\n   And wrong.. biden passed a bill he helped right in fact.. to make it so that African Americans are more likely to be arrested and he made tons of money off of it with private prisons, even Kamala, his running mate called him out for this in previous debates. Now theyre best friends. And I'm the fool\n  ","302626":"\n   Oh and who told you this was the worst thing next to the plague, Its far from the plague.. the news did its job in scaring you.

Not trumps\n  ","302630":"\n   You're right because when Joe was in office he passed bills to make African Americans more likely to be arrested than any other race, also the evidence of his business deals in Ukraine are Damning and speak for themselves but you won't find any of that on traditional news because they favor biden\n  ","302631":"\n   Well he didn't avoid every question he's asked\n  ","302632":"\n   Shoutout to sleepy joe dodging all the allegations and questions once again.
