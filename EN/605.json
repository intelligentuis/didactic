So many people will throw away the chance to experience love because they rather not getting hurt somehow. I dont understand why a person wouldnt want to truly experience the feeling of something fluttering in their stomachs every time they are around someone, or the feeling that your heart stopped, pooped its pants than restarted because it wants to live that much longer for that person. I would take all the pain in the world just to feel the love i have for him for a moment, because its so powerful. Your whole body feels alive and nothing will stop you. The world isn't shattering on top of you. Everything is colorful and brighter. I fear for those who wont accept love into their life because thats a dark lonely road. Love is incomprehensible, its something that has been discussed lifetime after lifetime. Im one of those people who will say \"at least i got to experience what hundreds will never even witness due to fear or inability\" if i ever get hurt. Love makes you want to live for as long as you can. If there was more love, there would be less pain.\n  \n  DEATH: i fear death, but not because of the fear of not knowing what comes after. I fear death because when i see a video or read something where a person dies, i dont feel grief - it feels like a memory. It feels like ive experience death before and i dont want to relive it and it puts pain in my soul to see someone have to experience it.  I think this fear is what drives to me live as long as possible. As long as im living, i wont experience death. I know i cant live forever, but maybe there will be a time in my life where ill say \"im ready\" but not now. Im not done yet. I havent seen enough yet, i havent learned enough, i havent loved enough. I also wont spend my time living discussing what will happen when im dead, ill figure that on my own when the time comes.\n  ","649287":"\n  I believe in youu\n  ","649288":"\n  Thats ok \u2764\u2764\n  ","649289":"\n  Didnt see it, but he probably had some really good pauses in there\n  ","649290":"\n  \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\n  ","649291":"\n  Tbh i love all my followers, the end.\n  ","649292":"\n  And you enjoy your slumber \u263b\u263b\n  ","649293":"\n  I hate cooked fish, i only like raw.lol\n  ","649294":"\n  Omg sushi..\n  ","649295":"\n  I cant wait to lay in bed with my book ?\n  ","649296":"\n  Touch\u00e9\n  ","649297":"\n  Red, black, purple, mint.\n  ","649298":"\n  OMG SOMEONE ACTUALLY GOT IT RIGHT\n  ","649299":"\n  Im excited to see \u2764\n  ","649300":"\n  Im pretty swell, im craving meat and its weird.\n  ","649301":"\n  But who am i?\n  ","649302":"\n  Id run over a baby for a western bacon cheeseburger right now.\n  ","649303":"\n  Marijuana\n  ","649304":"\n  In chocolate gold coins\n  ","649305":"\n  I dont know him nor do i give a shit.\n  ","649306":"\n  I love my butt too.\n  ","649307":"\n  1.
