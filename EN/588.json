They weren't supposed to get old and we were never supposed to grow up. The lost, the unwanted, and the abused came here with the purest of intentions, to build a place where there would be no rules, other than a peaceful existence. There are no couples for them. For them, there is only the moment. They tried to raise us to be perfect in their perfect new world and for a moment, maybe it worked. But I think they finally saw their own shortsightedness and failure in us. We always saw it in them. They attempted to unlearn jealousy, want, and hate, to not possess anything, including each other. They tried to free themselves from materialism, but soon they were drowning in it.
