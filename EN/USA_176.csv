  The Great Hack. I thought it was very interesting and eye-opening to a worldwide vulnerability that it is easy for big companies to victimize us to right under our noses. It makes apparent the need for our personal data rights to be human rights now that technology is a very significant asset in our lives

   Whenever people post about something bad going on in their lives often a random person will respond with an offer of ""DM me if you need to talk""; has anyone ever taken up a stranger for that offer and was it helpful?
  ","
  Not ever to just a random person.... When I tell someone that, I mean it, bc I'm an empath...which kinda sucks, but I feel like many others use it as more of an empty gesture, and I'll admit, I can listen well, but I'm not the best problem solver. I have talked to many strangers online before (bc I have no life), and a lot of them either aren't very talkative or good at keeping a conversation going, or [specifically guys] only wanna talk about getting into relationships and/or porn, and want me to get dirty or at least send them lots of pics of myself. Then that just becomes stressful and more depressing.... Plus, I think it's hard to imagine others will understand your problems bc everyone has such different lives. But I think that if you get to know someone for a bit and then start opening up about your problems, it's more likely to be helpful than just spilling everything to a complete stranger. That way, you know them a bit... I've talked a to few people about my problems like that before.....and tbh, only rarely has it been helpful tho....

  I think if there is a God, they aren't very fair bc they let some people be blessed while others live in places with unhealthy water or don't have a home or die too early than they deserve....it feels kinda messed up to me.

I feel like life is just life, and some people get cancer and some people are dicks and some people get hung....and when it's all over we are nothing for eternity. Otherwise, I feel like I'm believing in magic. I wish I could believe in such a thing tho bc I feel like people who do believe there's a God tend to have less fear and more hope

   What's your happiest memory so far in life❔❓❔
  ","
  I have no idea. There is no point of my life that I can think of that I felt euphoric or estatic. I've been angry all my life even if sometimes it wasn't shown as much, I just didn't know why when I was younger. Nothing really sticks out to me as a 'happiest memory.' It's hard to think of just goo memories.
  
  The first (and only) good memory that came to mind rn was back in the summer of 2017. It was on my half-birthday (coincidentally) and I was on this small island that a friend of dad owns. That night I got in this guy on the island's motorboat with a few other kids (although none of were around the age, so there was that 😐) and we traveled a bit till we got to this place they were doing US Independence day celebration fireworks over the water. Since we were on the water, we were right under the fireworks show and it only lasted 15-30min I think, but it was just really cool to just sit and watch; they were very pretty, soothing and mesmorizing and just took my mind somewhere else from all the troubles of life. But then it ended and life went back to the same old hell

Before that, I had this weird mohawk thingy that I'm never gonna get again starting in summer of 2014. Before that I had probably my favorite style I've ever had since the end of 2013....it was before I cut my hair. It had this whole design all around. The issue was it was too difficult to maintain (the appts were very expensive) 😢 before that I had cornrows since 2008 I believe.....so basically, one could say I don't change it very often. I don't plan on giving up this short clean cut hairstyle anytime soon, but the barber really dropped the ball a few days ago...I got this ugly looking shit on my head rn, so I gotta wear a hat till it grows back and I can get another haircut 😒

  ","
  Well, it depends on what small and personal is. I don't really want a wedding, just a legal marriage that includes me, my wife and the person who marries (a minister?) people. Then my soon to be wife can invite a few friends and family if they want, but I probably won't be inviting anyone. So, I guess that's small and personal? Either that, or it's eloping I guess, if she doesn't invite anyone....idk. But I want it to be one of the two

   How come everything in america is made in other countries ?
  ","
  Bc colonizers killed out nearly all of the Native Americans and the White Americans who took over enjoyed stealing things from others and pretending like it was their own creations or like they had a right to be using the creation in the first place, but since they had the most power, there wasn't nun anyone could do, and now, after centuries of oppression of everyone in America who wasn't white, we have a lot of aftermath and even still having issues cleaning up some ignorant White Americans. At least they are mostly older people now tho.
  
  Basically, everything goes back to selfish, cruel, arrogant Europeans who voyaged to America centuries ago and decided to stick around.
  
  And bc of trading.

   What’s your morning routine like?
  ","
  Well, these quarantine days, I guess it's most wake up at around 6:30am, maybe a little earlier, maybe a little later. Go on my phone, check Instagram, then check YouTube, then go back to sleep or just lay in bed trying to go back to sleep. Then typically between 7-8 am, I eat some frozen waffles (not like frozen while eating them, you know what I mean...), then go back to my bedroom and either lay down in bed again while listening to music or not, or doing Sodoku, or go on my laptop and work on the video edits for my Instagram page

There were some popular online people there....and my annoying ass 4th/5th grade teacher was there also as one of the guardians. And the buses filled up or something so me and some others had to ride in the back of a truck.... And then we were going to some jungle I guess 🤔 that's kinda all I remember

  That's hard to answer for me because I can't think of any event or memorable time in my life that I had felt good, happy or content all the way through. There would always end up being something that would set me off. I would not want to revisit my past at all. I guess can say like 3 days ago I just started thinking about this friend group I had back in middle school....there were 5 of us....and we would always eat lunch together walk around outside together and, idk, we didn't do much, but we always were all together at school whenever be could be.... I was rehashing that a bit....the thing is, the group was of kind of toxic, especially by 8th grade year. There's only one person in that group that I fw now. So, I I didn't feel nostalgic about our times together, but I think I was feeling a little nostalgic about the idea of having a group of friends like. It's hard to make friends when you get older bc people become more judgy, more interested in relationships, more sexually attracted rather than a good friend, and then many people still hang out with friends that they have had for years so they don't accept new friends....so it was nice having people I could think of as my people, even tho the group was a low-key toxic.

  There lived a lil' boy who was misled
  
  By anotha lil' boy and this is what he said
  
  ""Me, Ya, Ty, we gonna make sum cash
  
  Robbin' old folks and makin' tha dash""
  
  They did the job, money came with ease
  
  But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
  
  He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha
  
  Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
  
  The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
  
  He said ""Keep still, boy, no need for static""
  
  Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
  
  But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped
  
  The kid pulled out a gun, he said ""Why did ya hit me?""
  
  The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
  
  The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
  
  ""I'll do years if I pull this trigga""
  
  So he cold dashed and ran around the block
  
  Cop radioes it to another lady cop
  
  He ran by a tree, there he saw this sista
  
  A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
  
  Looked around good and from expectations
  
  So he decided he'd head for the subway stations
  
  But she was coming and he made a left
  
  He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath
  
  Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
  
  Then he made his move to an abandoned building
  
  Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
  
  Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?
  
  Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope
  
  Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
  
  He said ""I need bullets, hurry up, run!""
  
  The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
  
  He went outside but there was cops all over
  
  Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova
  
  Raced up the block doing 83
  
  Crashed into a tree near university
  
  Escaped alive though the car was battered
  
  Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
  
  Ran out of bullets and he still had static
  
  Grabbed a pregnant lady and out the automatic
  
  Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead
  
  He told the cops ""Back off or honey here's dead""
  
  Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
  
  So he let the lady go and he starts to run on

  ","
  I would first doubt the credibility of the source I was hearing this information from.
  
  I would do pretty horribly bc I don't like zombies and bc I'm very small and light and a weakling bc I don't eat much, so I'm pretty easy to be thrown around....it wouldn't take much for one to beat me up. Although, can zombies run? Bc if not, maybe it wouldn't be so hard to avoid them...plus guns would be producing, marketing and selling like crazy, so I don't if the zombies would stand a chance. Don't they just slowly stagger after living people thinking about nothing but eating  brains? Idk....I've never really researched or watched much about zombies.
  
  But if there was a zombie apocalypse, I would likely just commit suicide right away bc that's too much to deal with in this already sh*tty enough world. I think at that point, God must have moved to a while new universe if God was ever present around here in the first place. And that would possibly mean that we deserved to be taken over by zombies so at that point, it's time to just give up on any hopes of a happy ever after. Plus, if I committed suicide, then I might become a zombie and we would all slowly turn into the new Earth population.... wait, what if we all are zombies rn after coming back from long ago deaths and taking over the past population!?? 😮😮

  Well, this is probably gonna sound all messy and long... but one big decision I'm having trouble with is deciding what I should do about school/my future... The CS program (my intended major) at my university is super competitive and I already applied once and didn't get in and I can reapply, but honestly don't think I will get in with the grades I have.... I applied to a different school to transfer to and got in, but now the campus is closed so I can't check out the school... It's a few hours from home and I don't really like living at home, although I also have problems w/ sadness and anxiety and being far away might make things harder to handle, idk... I would be far from my dr & counselor, for example. I thought about maybe trying an online school instead, but some say that employers aren't as likely to hire you then and also that would mean I have to stay at home... + The school I'm at now is known for their very good CS program, so I am worried about what opportunities I might lose by leaving the school. I'm afraid that if I go to this new school tho, the sadness and anxiety will just follow me there and finding/making friends will be as difficult as it was at my current school, and all this will mess up my school life there too like it did here, and nothing will get better and I will feel even more isolated cus I'm in a foreign town. Rn, I'm taking a quarter off, but I have to decide if I'm gonna try this new university or not by May and it's just not a decision I feel prepared to make bc idk how things will be for me by August...at this rate, it doesn't feel like things will be any better by then and I don't wanna be struggling there as much as I did here...

   How are y'all handling quarantine?
  ","
  So so, I guess. I have been staying up late-ish and then napping during the day like most each day and I always feel so lethargic, but that's nothing new i guess. The hardest part for me not having my current favorite show airing bc of delayed episodes and anxiety about what happens for me once this quarantine period is over + anxiety/stressing about a big decision I have to make by the end of next month. And then also just loneliness and lost, but that's not really new either. I'm kind of at a crisis or mess I guess in my life rn and I just don't know how things are gonna turn out or if things will get better or feel better, or if I'm too messed up.... So I guess I'm not even really worrying about the quarantine, mostly just personal stress that I already had, but being stripped from the new episodes of my favorite show isn't helping ,😒

  Ugh...okay, here are my thoughts rn... How come everything I do is just wrong in one way or another? Like I can never win? Whenever I try being bolder, braver or showing more confidence or trust or belief, or less trustful, or getting outside of my shell, being more careful, taking risks, trying new things, being the best kindest person I can, reaching out, working harder, laying low, following all directions best I can... doing anything really, it's always the same failing result? I would rather be dead then consistently a failure like rn. How come some people can do so much wrong, but then still get to be happy and successful like nothing happened. How come some people get to naturally be the society's version of attractive, smart, pretty, fit or whatever, while others don't? Some people are set up to succeed more or easier than others. If there's truly anyone spiritually believing in all of us out there or guiding us, they are slacking real hard on some more than others and for no good reason... I can't believe there's any kind of God or higher existance when I notice all this, no matter how hard I try, bc then that makes me feel as if that spirit is biased and doesn't care for me and many others, and that's just messed up. Then that makes me wanna die even more. I don't think there is anyone looking after me or else why would it be the same results for so many years now? And why for some but not others?

   A person's eyes are the windows to their soul. Do you agree with this statement? Why / why not?
  ","
  I kind of depends on what this statement is saying. Like I would wanna say, no, I think their heart is. I believe you have to touch someone's heart (figuritively) to be able to reach their soul. I would not say the eyes are bc some people are visiually impaired, and that could entail having two fake eyes or wearing sunglasses at all times. Those people are definitely not all soul-less though.
  
  But maybe what this quote is really trying to say that how a person sees something as in perceives it or whether the person seems trustful or not after observation of everything you notice about them. I would then put my answer as more of a yes ....

   If you could create your own job, what would it be for and what would the title be?

  I have this kind of idea, but I don't know what the title would be for it , but it would be something to do with helping/supporting mentally struggling kids and teens, but in less restrictive ways then like worksheets or something. But I feel like there are more beneficial ways of helping with certain kinds of anxiety or depression than just cognitive behavioral therapy or worksheets. So, for example, going out to do something with them everyday that would uplift them or their confidence or something, idk (and ofc there would be legal restrictions to prevent unlawful incidents).... just something different and more effective than the way it's typically done now...or maybe I just have to wait a bit longer before I notice worksheets showing improvement...?

   What’s something that is very wrong but isn’t illegal?
  ","
  Using derogatory remarks on people. I don't get all the random hate, rude remarks, approaching people with dislike...feel like people should aim to be more loving rather than offending, more sweet rather than being pushy than dry, more warm-hearted rather than cold-blooded, more understanding rather than aggressive, smoke at others rather than glare... That's just one of the many problems of this messed world. People just don't wanna be kind, and when one is treated with rudeness, then they may get attitude and continue the rudeness, then it gets spread. I mean...maybe it's just me with this wishful thinking, idk...sometimes it's hard to tell

   You've said it beautifully, but I think, however, that you've left out some other important categories - Race, religion, age, social class, for example. No one should be judged for who they love. Love is only wonderful. :)

  "
945089,"
   What do you mean when you say that love is love?
  ","
  Well, to me, I would say it means that we love is the same in any instance. We love who we love and that's not our choice bc love is a feeling/sensation that comes from within us; we can't control it.  So, whether it's a girl and guy, girl and girl, or guy and guy, or non-binary and non-binary, or whatever labels,... the love is the same idea; the sexual excitement one gets for anyone is not their choice, it's what their body is naturally reacting to. Because of this, it's unethical for anyone to be telling others who to love and which loving is ""right"" and which is ""wrong,"" or discriminating against people who don't love who you think they should. Love is just love, there's nothing more to it. It can't hurt nobody, love is not danger, love is not from a rule book.... It's just love. No matter how hard anyone tries to reject a sexual orientation, ignore it, hide from it, abolish it... , it's never gonna change. Love is just love. ❤️

I may end up shutting down javacow soon tho bc I use this one a lot more and they are getting a lot of the same recently so it's kinda dull

  ","
  Hmm, not neccessarily ""hated or disliked,"" but there used to be someone who I thought was a bit irritating and immature/rude for the first two years that we knew each other but then after months of not seeing each other for a bit then when we met up again, he was a lot more mature and chill and he's one of my best friends I guess....well he's one of my friends and like all my friends are pretty much my best friends bc there's such a population of them and I don't trust any of them very deeply. He is probably the one I trust the most tho. He's told me a lot of his secrets and I've told him a few of mine and that made us a lot closer, but now we haven't seen each other since 2019 :(

  Oh yes, my city is like the infected from it in the US rn I think. Or at least we had the first few US deaths. The campus I go to to shut down for the last week of the quarter and finals week and decided everything would be online from then on. I have an online final and had a online present today or something... We we supposed to put all our presentations on a Google Doc and then look at everybody's 😂😂 Some people just got their finals cancelled which kind of sucks bc that was their last chance to bring up their grades. And others had optional finals. I just heard that public secondary schools in my city have shut down for the next two weeks too. And public events....it's a whole new experience here

  Let me tell you a story
  
  About a boy and a girl
  
  It's kinda short, kinda boring
  
  But the end is a whirl
  
  They were just sixteen
  
  When the people were mean
  
  So they didn't love themselves
  
  And now they're gone
  
  Headstones on a lawn
  
  And when I was younger
  
  I knew a boy and a boy
  
  Best friends with each other
  
  But always wished they were more
  
  'Cause they loved one other
  
  But never discovered
  
  'Cause they were too afraid
  
  Of what they'd say
  
  Moved to different states
  
  Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
  
  It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
  
  Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
  
  But I think that it could work for you and me
  
  Just wait and see
  
  It's not the end of the story...
  
  Now it's on to the sequel
  
  About me and my friend
  
  Both our parents were evil
  
  So we both made a bet
  
  If we worked and we saved
  
  We could both run away
  
  And we'd have a better life
  
  And I was right
  
  I wonder if she's alright
  
  Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
  
  It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
  
  Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
  
  But I think that it could work for you and me
  
  Just wait and see
  
  It's not the end of the story...
  
  And the movie's always running in my head
  
  All the people, all the lovers, all my friends
  
  And I hope that they all get their happy end
  
  In the end
  
  Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
  
  It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
  
  Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
  
  But I think that it could work for you and me
  
  Just wait and see

  ","
  It doesn't seem that bad when I say it, but when I was really young, probably like 6 or 7, my family went shopping at Goodwill. The thing we always loved about Goodwill is that everything there was relatively cheap so my parents would let me get more stuff that I wanted. So, on this particular day, we were shopping and we had a cart full of stuff and we were all just kind of in our own aisles picking stuff we wanted while the cart stayed in one aisle that we would go back to when we found something, and put it in. Well, eventually, I guess either it took us all a long time to find whatever or someone was just not doing their job right maybe, idk... But we went back to the aisle at one point and the cart was missing.... so all of our stuff was missing. No one else in my family really minded that much, but I remember that I was really upset bc there was this toy I put in there that I really wanted and then it was gone.... So me for as a child, that was rough haha, and I don't like remembering the sadness I had even tho the situation now just seems dumb

That's why I can't really trust anyone. And what sucks is those qualities are just me, like I can't stop. so  then I'm taken advantage of by the same people over and over again. Maybe it's bc of desperation, idk.

I stopped that in middle school so ever since, he just hangs out in my room all day so the only people who see him now are my roommates and I haha.
  
  During high school he mostly just hung out on my bed, but I think once I started college, I started giving him more attention bc having him/holding him/snuggling with him just makes me feel more comfort and there's been a lot of sadnees, hopelessness and anxiety lately but having him around just helps a bit for some reason. Idk how psychologically that works, but it's just something I've noticed. So he sits with me while I do homework, or eat or pretty much anything I do in my dorm room. If my roommates were to make fun of me for that, that would suck, but they are very nice and probably understanding.

   Is there such a thing as your real self or does your self change as time passes and given the circumstances you are in?
  ","
  I think we all change throughout time, but there still is such thing as as real selves. Our real selves just change over time. I think for a lot of people, it's hard to always show your real self because you're afraid of being judged or getting ourselves in trouble or not being liked or something so we give different people different versions of ourselves, but there is the true us inside. I try to always show my real self bc that's the kind of people I like to meet and feel more comfortable around, but it's hard to always be myself bc of some of the reasons above and I get a lot of anxiety and I'm always trying to get along with everyone bc I'm so lonely and want friends. I think it mainly just makes me get used by people rather than gets me friends tho

  I'm not completely sure what defines a demonstration tho. I guess I liked participating in them because they are for good causes and actually can make a difference sometimes, but I live in a rainy city and it rained and was cold for almost all of those, so that wasn't great. Also, I'm not really a crowd person. I likely wouldn't have gone if no one I knew was going.

  Well it depends on what you define as ""tiny"" and what the liquid is. If it's super tiny, I doubt it make do anything bc the iPhone 8 is IP67 dust/water resistant and so I don't think a very small amount of whatever you put in there can do too much damage as long as it isn't some chemical. Plus, if you do mess up your phone you can upgrade to Samsung or OnePlus which is everything but more and for a better deal then your iPhone 8 was.

She's a perfectionist so she puts her heart and soul into everything she does and she always stays true to herself. I could never be like her, but I support her a lot.

  I haven't got the update yet, but I think it's a great idea.

   What makes you say yes or no to somebody who’s asking for your number? (You’ve seen them around but has never talked to them)
  ","
  Well this is sort of a personal question bc I feel like everyone's answer will vary based on how they are as a person. Personally, I don't have very many friends at all so out of desperation, I say yes to pretty much anyone who asks for my number (which is like no one) that doesn't seem like deranged or something. But if I was more picky, the biggest thing for me is probably genuineness. The people I would like to be friends with/get to know better are people who are free from judgment and are very geniune. I find that a lot of people tend to be fairly fake. They act one way around some people and change around others or they lie to please different people....I like people who are just themselves and are loving, accepting and friendly no matter what, not just if you look ""pretty"" or ""handsome/fit the society's social norms or not just if they like exactly what you like or are smart or are a certain race, etc. So I am a lot more likely to want to befriend someone who is like that and someone who I feel like I can relate to in some way so I know we will get along. But ik a lot of other people out there aren't like that -- and some will say they are, but aren't...it's that genuine thing -_-

  ","
  Ahh I see :) Have you tried finding him on social media? Like Facebook Messanger, Instagram or Snapchat for example? Because that's a good way to start conversation. By messanging him from there and saying something like ""Ive seen you around....I'm [insert name], etc. Bc I feel like just slipping someone a note and then disappearing could potentially be giving someone the wrong message
  "
946642,"
   Ofc!
  ","
  Cool haha. You're probably gonna regret letting me tho bc my best advice is to not mess around with notes or flirting or anything, just talk to the person and try to get to know the person and if that's going well, trade off numbers. I would say you're more likely to get genuine messages from someone who feels like they know you and if they don't want to talk or trade numbers after knowing you better, the results gonna be the same if they don't know you, so there's nothing to lose either way, just more to gain by talking in person.

  ","
  It depends on what the waiting is for. When I originally answered the question, I thought waiting was meaning waiting to have sex. If waiting means waiting until you're in a relationship with someone, yeah, I would call it faithful.
  "
946756,"
   Say the married lady was sleeping with husband so other lady slept waiting for her ""girl"" 2chose her as option 1 & not back up plan, slept w 1 (screw buddy) rarely until she decided. 5 years no sex or contact bc platonic sex w 100 hurt them but waiting w no sex or kissing for 5ish yrs. I'd say waitn
  ","
  Oh okay, I think i get it. You're saying if there was a long time gap in between when one person had sex with one person and another, would it be faithful bc they waited all that time in between, I think 🤔. If that is what you're saying, yeah, I think that could be called being faithful
  "
946757,"
   *were  I didn't ask original question. I was asking 4clarification. Say 1 was married & the other waited, yet, slept arnd bc the other was married & trying 2get pregnant &/or poly, open, just fell in love on accident, married was sleeping w SO, othr waited then slept arnd & pretend it was her (him)?
  ","
  I'm still confused haha. If the other ""waited and slept"", doesn't that mean they didn't wait bc they slept with someone? And are these hypothetical people married to each other? Who was the other person pretending to sleep with?
  "
946758,"
   Where you in a relationship & maybe having sex too? Did they pass time & as f'd up maybe pretended it was y o u. ...a thought.

  Are you talking about like an open relationship? Or being cheated on? Sorry I don't get the question 😅
  "
946759,"
   Can a person be faithful and say that I waited for you, if they had sex with 100 people? Is that an false claim? Is sex about love or lust?

  Well, I feel like this is more of an expression, not meant to be literal (just gathering my thoughts). I would say, I think it's not true. The rich, at least in America, seem to be living their best lives. And ironically, they seem to get more stuff for free than anyone else

   Remember you are the only one sorely responsible for your own happiness. Never care bout  others opinion bc not every one  who enjoys your successes in life. Loving oneself is the surest source of JOY n HAPPINESS.
  ","
  That's what people say but after experience, I just don't feel that way. I really wish I could love myself. But I can't. I hate myself and I hate being me and idk how to change that myself. I feel stuck; trapped; helpless; hopeless. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is bc of Zendaya. She's my idol and I love her to death (literally) and I want to watch her new movie and show before I die. So hopefully I can be patient enough until mid-August.
  "
947210,"
   What you need to do is stop caring about what others say about you, You gonna live happily by doing so. Secondly, it's your life, go out n enjoy to the fullest n stop hating yourself because no one will love if you fail to love yourself.
  ","
  I want to stop caring about what others think but I can't help it. That's a lot of what triggers my anxiety. Idk how to stop. And I feel like I can't love myself if no one else does. Why should I? If I'm not good enough for anyone else then why should I be good enough for myself? It's other people's words and actions that make us feel loved and belonging not our own. Only other people can validate us bc if no one likes us but ourselves, we won't get anywhere. I wish I could enjoy my life but I can't bc I feel all these things and I can't help it. I've lost all hope bc whenever I would feel hopeful, life smacked reality into my face and set me 10x farther down into my hole then I already was. Being hopeful leads to too much pain bc I will always get hurt. Nothing ever goes right. So now I'm just waiting to be freed from this terrible world and all this pain, loneliness and sadness.
  "
947211,"
   I too I'm an introvert and feel OK when I am alone. WHY? Because I assured myself that being happy is the only thing I have left. So I do take myself out, go on hiking, adventuring and even take myself to  movies. You should try it too. I am sure you gonna love it.  Believe me.
  ","
  I like being myself and I need that dedicated time to myself. But I also need friends and someone to trust and talk to. So sometimes I'm ok by myself and other times it's horrible. I want to have the option. But I typically don't take myself out. Maybe I should try. I always feel like people are gonna judge me if them see me, especially people I know. And also when I'm out it's hard seeing people out together laughing and messing around and eating together etc bc I really wish I could have that
  "
947212,"
   I believe joy comes from within and being able to  do what really makes you happy will help you a lot.  Also avoid being alone most of the time. Get out n interact with other people n also find something to keep  you busy like joining a gaming club or sports.
  ","
  I wish I could do I what would make me happy. I wish I could do that on the world. That's the dream ofc. But life is not like that for me. I try not to be alone but it's not that simple. Not everyone can just exist and then make friends easy. I've tried so hard. I joined clubs, I've pushed myself, I've met people, but in the end they leave me. Everyone else has other friends and don't need me so they don't care. I join things but then I feel left out and they make me feel alone. Other people join with friends so they have someone and then no one talks wants to talk me bc they don't know me. I auditioned for the school drumline but I probably won't even make it in. Life is always like that for me. And even if I did, it turns out I have a scheduling conflict that I may not be able to fix. I tried joining the BSU and went to meetings for over a month, but always felt so isolated and different whenever I was there so I quit. I tried volunteering at a CS class but then there was a scheduling conflict and I had to stop.....I could go on. The point is we can't control our own lives. People tell us that and they think it's true but it's not. Some people just get to be happy while other's either can't be or have to lower their expectations so excessively to the point where being lonely makes you happy.
  "
947213,"
   👇🏾
  ","
  So I hate being here. And no, you probably can't help. Idk how you could. I've tried to get help, I've pushed myself, I've tried to be what people wanted me to be, I've tried to be what I want to be, but it's just unachievable. So now I just cry and take drugs until hopefully someday I die.
  "
947214,"
   Why does life sucks, I can help you out?
  ","
  So many reasons that would is way too long for an Ask answer to explain. But I'll say a bit.
  
  1. Some people get to be ""blessed"" or ""more blessed"" while others have to suffer and barely get by.
  
  2. Some people are born fitting the mythic norm while others don't and are therefore subject to more discrimination, hate, bullying, depression, isolation, feeling unloved by society, etc.
  
  3. You can't be ""whatever you want"" or ""whatever you put your mind to"" when you grow up. People tell you that when you're children but the truth is in most of those cases you need to have *a lot* of money and/or be ridiculously smart. Not everyone is like that. Some people take time to learn things, some people have disabilities, some parents don't have great jobs, sometimes life accidents happen that can destroy your future, sometimes people make mistakes they didn't mean to, sometimes people study/work really hard and try their best but they still can't achieve it…..30% of people at most who apply at my University get into the CS program. That's crushing 70% of people's dreams.
  
  4. There's a lot of pressure, especially on young people to do everything right and be the best and accomplish all these achievements.
  
  5. Introverts are less likely to get into programs, schools, jobs, pretty much anything they apply for even though they are not any less capable than extroverts. Being a quiet person is not a defect.
  
  6. Some people have so much hate in them and don't care about dragging others down and destroying them with their words.
  
  7. Discrimination, police brutality, racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, gun violence, massacres….I don't think that needs explanation.
  
  Okay that was a lot and that's just scratching the surface. But point is, I hate life and I want to die. I'm tired of living in this cruel and unforgiving world. I don't get blessed and I never feel happy. I constantly feel lonely, anxious, worried, tired, alone, hurt, not good enough, ugly and most of all, sad.

  Read this clearly. We already covered that love is a feeling and feelings are not choices. People don't decide to disobey God and be gay. They are born gay and it's not their choice or their doing. *No one chooses who they fall in love with or who they are attracted to.* That is on God and how God created them.

  Honestly don't think there's anything more to talk about. It's just fact that there's no proof that God disproves of gay people (not anymore than other everyday actions most people do) and if God does, God is the one to blame bc God made them and is punishing them for something God themselves did, therefore making God a dick who no one should be proud of going to stay with during their afterlife. I definitely could never be.
  
  You have yet to prove any of this wrong and so I don't want to drag out this conversation if you're just gonna continue to excessively talk without actually being able to prove anything that I said incorrect or give legitimate reason to make anyone believe you without there being either an easy way to disprove it or going back to what I said above.

  What qualities from my imagination? I'm only going off of the God that your saying right now.
  
  Here's some of the thing God thinks are sins. If you're guilty of any of this, apparently you're going to hell. And there's a lot more too, like showing your skin (think about times people go to the beach). You can do your own research on Google.

You are in another life
  ","
  Maybe you live life as a test. I don’t live my life as a test. I live it as if it’s the only chance I get (which sucks), but that’s what I believe bc again, I don’t believe in afterlife. Most people live their lives as if they only get one life (yolo) because no one knows what truly happens after death.
  
  Then why make the person disabled in the first place? Why do they have to wait till another lifetime to excel? All that does is bring a lot of pain to the people who lose the person who God decided to kill off for no reason, for the rest of their lives. You can come with “perhaps” and “what if” for anything for the rest of your life doing so, but the point here is, there’s no proof or anything that leads to God thinking gay people are bad. Anyone can die. People die at different times with different amounts of innocents. That’s just how life is. If God is controlling all of that because of who God likes and who they don’t or whatever reason, then there’s no explanation that you or anyone can think of to justify God not being an a** in some way or another for doing so. Every possible way, as you are showing an example of now, leads to God being unjust in some way. So either God is overall a bastard or your theories about God are all messed up in some way and it’s time to rethink.
  "
947404,"
   You understand my intention wrong God does not punish a person is not expensive, and the commission begins at the age of puberty, because the mind is complete so those who died before puberty, will enter

  And who says people decide whether they live or die right before puberty? Where did you get this from? And the mind is never complete. Time to do some research. We are always trying to find ourselves and are always learning more about ourselves and becoming wiser.  That definitely doesn’t stop at puberty. So that kind of disproves this theory of yours you just presented.

947405,"
   You are proud now because you do not know that he is wrong, but when you know you will not be proud. As for the committee, our Lord said that you will be happy there and our Lord knows everything.

  I don’t want to be somewhere where I don’t belong and I don’t belong in world where I can’t be myself and be accepted. I don’t belong somewhere where it’s okay that people I love get oppressed. So I am proud not to go to your God’s “heaven.” The way you put them, both heaven and hell sound like dystopias. So being in hell wouldn’t be much different for myself and all the other gays. There is nothing that makes every single person happy in the same way. So there is no one place wirh certain and restricted conditions that could fully satisfy everyone. If God says I will be happy in heaven then that’s because I will be with the people I love there. If they aren’t there and I can’t be proud for being myself there, then I won’t be happy and in contrary to what you say, God does not know everything.
  "
947406,"
   If God created you so is for the purpose, God does not create something without a goal, perhaps to challenge yourself and resist your desires may not control your feelings, but will control in your desires and stop what God forbade it and you get a prize better than everyone
  ","
  Then God is still an unjust a** for giving some people the chance to get better prizes in the end than others. You said God does not favor anyone, but he has to be either favoring people who are gay or people who aren’t gay in that case because some people are being born able to succeed more than others in the end. That’s an unfair set up. And desire is a feeling, so that part of what you said does not make sense. If we can’t control our feelings, then we can’t control our desires. If God does not create something without a goal, then maybe open yourself up to the possibility that God created gay people because God is okay with them. Why do you demand that being gay has to be a bad thing in God’s mind? (This brings us back to where our conversation started). Might I remind that not everything in the Bible is followed to this day anyway and God does not seem to mind. If he did, then just about everyone would be getting punished.

There are a lot of things in the Bible that God says is a sin, that people do in modern times. I’m sure you are guilty of several of those things.
  
  I will proudly disobey someone who is bigoted and selfish and oppresses people for nothing but their own amusement (or just who oppresses people at all), and I will do it along with the millions of others who support me and agree with me and fight for equal rights. I don’t think anyone who is gay finds going into this God of your hell a punishment.
  
  And these are your beliefs. Not everyone believes the same thing you do and everything you believe about death and afterlife could quite fairly be false.
  "

   -----You say that God is not fair unless you know the conditions of all people, and I do not know those people whom I mentioned
  ","
  Who are the people you mentioned? I say that this version of God that you seem to believe is not fair because they aren’t ting some people be born either better futures than others. This God you say, makes some people have to be oppressed and not allowed to be themselves for their whole lives while others can be themselves. That is unjust.
  "
947413,"
   Everyone has an option. Maybe you also had an option at first to live or to die and you chose to live. Now you have the option of walking in the right or wrong way. For the people who have died, you have lost their chance and will be held accountable for the actions you have made. You say that----
  ","
  Now you’re implying that everyone who was born decided to live, but then not everyone who was born lives because some people die early. So that makes no sense still. So, the five-year-old who caught cancer lost their chance and are now being punished? Why? They did nothing wrong. They were just an innocent five-year-old who never got to live their life. Let’s say they were battling this cancer for 3 years before they past away. They never got the chance to even walk yet. So that’s just God being an a** in that case.
  "
947414,"
   Living in hell is not as simple as remembering it, can not be happy to remember with hell and believe me you will not be proud of the wrong belief
  ","
  But I am proud of my belief and so are millions of others. So, you are therefore incorrect. It cannot be happy for me to live in God’s Dystopia that God calls Heaven either, if God is such an a** as you say, so I might as well be unhappy in the same place as the people I love than just unhappy.
  "
947415,"
   I have already told you that having sex with a woman is also action that you can control it so when God tells you not to do so you can stop him
  ","
  Exactly, actions can be controlled. That’s what I have been saying (geez, you’re impossible). No one has to have sex with someone of the same sex, they can control that. But they can’t control their feelings about that person. If they are in love with that person and that gender, that is how they are. If they choose to have sex with someone of the same gender, that is because they are just choosing to be their true self and express their genuine feelings instead of faking their whole life. So, people should not have to hide who they are for their whole lives just because they were born a certain way. They can’t control how they were born; they can’t control how they feel. So how is that fair? That’s I’m saying God is an a** if they are purposefully setting some people up to fail before they are even born. And I don’t want to be living in God’s place if that’s the kind of guy God is.

   You are a physiological example of your body as a woman possess a vagina and is designed to enter the penis but when you practice sex with a woman, is not this a change in human nature
  ","
  It's not changing nature because nothing is changed when you have sex with someone of the same gender. Nothing happens except joy from the two individuals. A vagina doesn't have to go into a penis. That's just how making babies works. If you want to have a baby, you put your vagina in a penis. If you don't, you don't. Not everyone has to have babies, in fact, not everyone can. And putting your dick in a vagina is a sexual desire. If people aren't sexually desired to do that, they won't (or they will, but they will feel like trash while doing so). If they are sexually desired to have sex with someone of the same sex, they will do that instead.
  "
947417,"
   Did you try to change yourself
  ","
  We already established that love is feeling and feelings cannot be controlled or changed by ourselves. Our feelings are involuntary and are part of how we are born. I am gay and that cannot change. I'm am attracted to women and that's how I was made. Just like you were made attracted to the opposite sex of yourself (I assume). You can't just change yourself and decide to be in love with someone else. That's not how love/feelings work. So stop going in circles and get that through to yourself.

  What's to say I haven't felt in my heart that I'm doing the right thing?
  
  Let's just say there is a right and a wrong way. It just brings us back to the question why would God create gay people at all if it was the wrong way? This seems to be something you don't have an answer for and if you can't find it, it makes more sense for you to question what you're believing rather than me.
  
  Since I'm here along with millions of other gay people, it must be fine. Otherwise how did we get here?
  "
947419,"
   For the child, maybe he has the option of what I know. Maybe he chose to live in a good place from the start. As for why people did not die now perhaps because God wants to give them more opportunities, whether to increase their reward or increase their punishment.
  ","
  But why doesn't God not want to give the people who die earlier more opportunities? That's just unfair. You think all young people who die early wanted to die? You think Nipsey wanted to die? Martin Luther King wanted to die? Trayvon Martin wanted to die? I've wanted to die, but I'm not dead so clearly just wanting to die isn't the answer here.
  
  You can keep trying to come up with answers, but you will realize there's no logical explanation. There's simply nothing proven scientifically and/or Godly that leads to being gay as bad. You're just making guesses now to try and defend something you don't even know as to be true and every time, there's an explanation that questions what you're saying completely.

   -----transcend. In this world, for one purpose, this is the test, and not only why I was created, just to die, and you say that you prefer hell. Why do you give a little happiness if you can get eternal happiness?
  ","
  I say I prefer hell if that if God is bigoted and sets some people up for failure while others are just naturally born with ""better"" fortune.
  
  I will be happy in hell knowing I lived life as my true self and not someone someone else wanted me to be after creating me a certain way in the first place, or in other words, just trying to make my life harder on me for no reason.
  
  I can't be happy in some place where only people like me who can't live geniunely go. That's an after life dystopia.
  
  So then I will be living in eternal happiness in hell where I can be myself and be able to be proud of who I am. And the people I love will be there with me.

   If you had a crazy person in the streets of America kill people, would you call him and say that he is a fool who does not have the choice in what he does? In fact, you have the ability to control your desire, and I have the ability to obey God. Otherwise, I would not give you the test if you ----
  ","
  Again, killing people is not an emotion or feeling, that is an action. You are confusing actions with feelings right now and you will be confused until you learn the difference. Try a dictionary. We can't control what we desire, but we can control our actions. Obeying, killing, walking, running, shouting....those are ACTIONS. I said that already. Instead of just talking, maybe go back and start actually reading what I'm saying.

   In fact, two-thirds of the sexually transmitted diseases are transmitted through homosexual sex, and also are a change to the nature of the human being created by God, and God knows best for us

947424,"
   God does not prefer a person to the second We prefer ourselves to obey God's orders and not everything we believe is true as I said earlier but if you want to know the right way all you have to do to pray to God, free your heart from everything and say to him on the right path
  ","
  How will that tell me the right way? What's to say I don't already pray to God? And I'm still gay so.....
  
  If God doesn't prefer one person over another, then why would some people go to a good place and others a bad after death then?
  "
947425,"
   The child who died as a young person is not a person who did not attend the test but succeeded as an example if he said to the teacher that you will not prepare the test but you will succeed in what will be your reaction certainly happy not this child maybe if he grew up made a lot of mistakes -----
  ","
  That makes no sense and sounds more like you're making things up as you go along.
  
  That still unfairly limits the child for getting as much reward as someone else who just happens to be more luckier and not have cancer.
  
  What makes the child not have the option to try ""the test"" but other's do? If God can see the future and they know who will be good and bad already, why not just kill off all the good people right away and send them to a happy place right away? Why not send all the gay people and whoever else is or becomes ""bad"" to the bad place right away?
  "
947426,"
   -----and he will hold them accountable for their actions. I said that we are in a test where we must succeed
  ","
  I’m really not worried about afterlife because I don’t believe in it. I believe that when we die, we die and are nothing. Our bodies decompose and we cease to exist. But if there is an afterlife, I would rather go to hell or “the bad place” and know that I lived my life advocating for my rights and loving whoever I was truly and deeply in love with instead of faking everything just to please some selfish being who wants to punish people for truly being and embracing themselves. If God is gonna punish people for being gay, then that means God set every gay person up to fail in afterlife before they were even born which would make God a bigoted a**hole more than anything else.
  
  Again, if God created everyone, then gay people would not exist if God had not created them. Being gay is about loving someone the same sex as you. Love is a feeling and feelings, as we already went over, are not a choice. They aren’t controlled by us. So, to punish people for being gay is punishing them for being something God themselves created them to be. Something the individual cannot help, control or change about themselves. So that’s just messed up.

  So young a five-year-old who gets cancer and dies but is completely innocent has to die and get less rewards then others who are more fortunate? That just seems purely unjust. The five-year-old may not be able to overcome cancer, but that’s only because either they are young and aren’t very physically strong yet or the cancer is just really bad. It is not the fault of the child in any way. So, it sounds like you’re saying now that God sets some people up to get rewarded in the end more than others just because.

  Stealing is not an emotion, it's an action. We can control our actions.

  ","
  -We can’t control our feelings. Our feelings/emotions are involuntary. They are just part of us. It’s a mix of our intuition and logic that leads us through life.
  
  -If good people die because they deserve a “better place”, then why do some good people die really young and others die when they are old? Why do some people deserve a “better life” sooner than others when they haven’t done any more good in life? And why do many people who have consistently done “bad” things live very long lives?
  
  -No one who is gay wants or needs your help and telling someone being gay is gross is not helping in anyway. You’re not showing anyone the right path; you’re just showing people what YOU think is the right path. You are trying to enforce your beliefs and your religion on other people who simply don’t care because they have their own. No one here know what’s happens afterlife. Everything you think is just a theory from your religion or your community. You can never really know because you haven’t experienced being dead. The best way to help people is to accept and love them for who they are instead of demanding that if people don’t live their lives based on how some being who (supposedly) wrote an outdated book thousands of years ago says, they will forever be doomed when there is no evidence to prove that, in fact, more evidence on the contrary.
  
  -I know I am lesbian because I am and have always been only romantically attracted to women.
  
  -We have more neurons in specific places in our brains that allow us to be smarter than dolphins in the ways that we are. So, this distinguishes us from animals (aside from humans) which proves wrong what you said about being gay makes us no different than being animals. Clearly, there is a lot more that makes us different from animals than just loving whoever we were made to love and being proud of it.

  Well, morning gets you up and ready for the day and you just slept so you're all ready to be active, so a lot of people like to workout in the mornings. The exact time would depend on your availability.

  Well, It’s never just about one thing. Last time I cried was….well sort of today, bc I almost cried and my eyes watered and once I get back to my dorm I’ll let it all out, but Friday was the last time tears were pouring. The main reason was bc I didn’t get the classes and time schedule I wanted and it’s frustrating that my major is so competitive and I’m not the smartest person, so I already have very little chance of getting in even without only 30% of people getting in and I never took any running start, which I’m mad at myself about and added that to the list of mistakes I’ve made concerning my future, so therefore I’m a freshman by credits (one of the few freshman by credits at my school, cause like everyone else did running start) so my class selection time is gonna be last pick all year, which means the classes I need to be in to fill my prerequisites will either be full or fill up super fast by my selection time, so I won’t be able to apply for my major in time (but I guess that shouldn’t matter, cause I’m not gonna get in it anyway). And then today, I didn’t get a score I was aiming for on my Calc test, even though I felt like I didn’t do that bad and my first test also wasn’t a score I was aiming for and I hardly have the time to put more energy into that class than I’m already doing so, so I’m not gonna get a very high grade in that class which will look bad when I’m trying to apply for my very competitive major, so basically my future is f*cked. And then I also cried because I hate myself and I hate being me and I wish I were dead.

  ","
  Okay, well here's some ideas to think about:
  
  For a speech, I would first think about what is something specific you're passionate about? It could be a big issue or topic that's widespread in present time like for example, you're opinion on the discrimination against trans people, or something smaller like perhaps which OS System or phone you think is best.
  
  Then I would think about the goal for the speech. Is it to inform, persuade, educate, to share an opinion...and then think of how something you're passionate about that can work with the goal. And I guess if there isn't any required goal, then think, what aim would you like to have? Or maybe just what seems easiest? Haha.
  
  Then think about the time slot you have and what could fit it best. If it's only 1-2 mins, something smaller/less serious might be the best option. If it's like 5min+, a bigger topic that you could talk more about might be better. Or just something you feel more passionate about over other things.
  
  There's just some ways to brainstorm ideas, if you want more specific suggestions, I can help you with that too and list some, but idk what you're interests are so idk how much it will help haha. Let me know!

If a girl is fast or strong, men will say ""You're fast, FOR A GIRL"" or ""You're strong, for a girl.""
  
  A program I went to a few years ago was about empowering young computer science pursuing girls because woman are so underrepresented in that field. {Several of the woman who worked there -- at Adobe (which was not many), talked to us about the small bits of sexism they have encountered while working there.}
  
  But the program with my name was specifically for African American girls actually. In terms of opportunities and salary they are near the bottom the of hierarchy in my society.

  Well.....my parents are married, but I was adopted by them. I have never met my birthfather and I don't even know if he knows I exist. I rarely get to see my birthmom or her kids (my siblings).

  I don't think so.

I think if you really love each other you can still be in a relationship, just wait on the marriage for a bit. If it's meant to be, it shouldn't be a problem to wait

I'm a technology person and used to be a phone nerd lol and most people you meet like that will say Android and there are many reasons for that, but I would say it really depends on what a person wants with their phone. Apple is generally more for (for lack of better words) simple and basic use, but Android is for more tech savvy people who like more options with their phone

  Well, only if the boyfriend is okay with it I guess. If the guy is good friends with the boyfriend then that would help, but if that's not the case, I could see the boyfriend possibly getting suspicious of the friendship and then acting upon that. He could call off the relationship, which the girl might not want to happen, but if the girl considers the friendship more important, then perhaps she wouldnt want to lose it. Ultimately, it would depend on the couple

   Why do I want to be popular so bad?
I see people getting 100+ likes on social media or getting very nice comments and it really make me feel left out or not special because I don't even get more than 10 likes on my posts
It just bothers me
How am I supposed to become known or popular?
  ","
  I made an Instagram when I was 13. I introduced it to my bff at the time who made one about 2 wks after me. We followed lots of the same people, but then I noticed people we both knew seemed to only friend request her. Her account started gaining a lot more followers, so I felt left out. I deleted my account later bc it felt embarrassing.
  
  I think what it comes down to is that we need to stop letting social media define us. We feel if we're not getting as many likes on our posts that we're not good enough and it just ends up depressing us, when really we should all love and be proud of ourselves bc we are all just as worthy individuals. Idk how or why some people just receive more love on sm like that, but I try not to worry about it.
  
  I know this wasn't much help, but idk how to get oneself popular. I just know that we shouldn't look down on ourselves bc of some likes on an app. We are special, even when some people fail to acknowledge it online

  ","
  This is not even that serious of an event, but one time when I was younger there was this middle schooler who asked me to give up my seat at the bus stop for them. This dude who was sitting on the bench right next to me refused to give up his seat to the middle schooler, so when she I asked me, I refused too and she picked my backpack off the ground and put it in the middle of the street. The dude kindly said to me ""save my seat"" and then went and got my backpack for me. I tried to save it, but the girl dove for it and I was literally wrestling with a stranger, so I shortly just gave up. I regret not giving up the seat to make things simpler, and if not, I should have at least got up once she took the dudes seat because after that, I just felt like a jerk to him. Idk why I just sat there after he so nicely retrieved my backpack for me. This was soo long ago though lol, but weirdly, I still think about it

   are girls more dramatic than guys?
  ","
  It really depends on the people.
  
  Also, for certain topics or situations, a larger quantity of one gender may be generally more dramatic, and the other gender generally for other topics or situations. There's not just one overall answer

   You're too pure.

  If you don't take money from other people's suitcases, then you're too pure.
  
  No matter what.
  
  Nobody likes people who are very pure/don't take others money.
  
  That's just it.
  "
949354,"
   Because you don't take the money from the suitcase...
  ","
  I know, people only find others who take money from stranger's suitcases attractive. Otherwise you got no chance at all

949355,"
   That's why you are single :'>

  Because I don't watch old movies??

  ","
  Possible reasons:
  
  1. It's in a language I don't understand
  
  2. It's specifically directed to the other gender
  
  3. It's not something I want to talk about
  
  4. I just don't know the answer at the time, so I wait and answer it when I actually have an answer. I typically don't like to reply with just ""Idk""

   Is it okay to ask a friend that you sit at lunch with to goto the movies with you?I'm new to a school and this girl has been friends with me for a month, I wanted to ask if she wanted to goto a movie with me and her group of friends. I didn't get a chance to ask at school and I want to ask by snap.
  ","
  The short answer would be ""yes,"" but I would consider your intentions before asking this girl. Is the reason you're asking her because you like her? Because if she considers you attracted to girls, that's probably how she will take it unless you clarify it's just as friends

  Last night I had a dream that this tall guy with long black hair and white robes with some black lines on it was trying to kill me. I was in fear everywhere I went, and then I was at my friend's house and a car slowed down in front of the house and I saw the guy. He shot a bullet right through the house window, but it missed me. I was freaked out when I woke up, and it was like 4:30am and I didn't want to go back to sleep. I really have no idea why this dream happened 😕
