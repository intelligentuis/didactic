Why they feel like they don't deserve me (and love in general or if it's just WITH me). If there's someone else perhaps that is deserving of them. I'd want to know what they doubt about me. I feel like the future part is pretty self explanatory but at the same time would be interested to know what they picture their future person with so I can see if that is relatable to me or not.

Clearly they aren't trying to be that person for the relationship and themselves. If they really cared they wouldn't d!ck around like that. Just end it if that's what they want instead of going on and on like a riddle. Just scared it seems like to me and putting it on the other person instead. Just seems like a line instead of what they might actually be feeling? It's one thing to be unsure of how you feel but another to be all dramatic about it like that. Mixed signals can be annoying.
