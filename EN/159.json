My sister does- if she can spin something to be a positive thing, or convince herself that there's a sunny side, she'll do it, and she seems mostly happy except in spurts when it builds up too much so it must work for her. For me personally it's always been easier to just be open. It might scare some people away or make some people uncomfortable but at the same time it clears out those without empathy or kindness in them quickly so the people I DO end up spending time with are generally good, understanding people who aren't going to get grossed out when I'm ugly crying because something triggered me on a bad day.\n  ","170681":"\n  Thank you for asking, Lydia, because this is certainly one of the many mental health disorders that people like to make light of and I hope it's just ignorance and not purposeful ableism.\n  \n  The main thing I wish more people understood is that there are many many different possible types of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. There are 4 type names that try to act as an umbrella over all of the possible manifestations of OCD, but they don't catch all of them. Those 4 types are:  Checking, Hoarding, Ruminating, and Contamination.\n  \n  Most people are somewhat familiar with Hoarding type OCD because of tv or whatever.\n  \n  Contamination type is another OCD type that most people have at least a vague understanding of. This type covers OCD behaviors like hand-washing, organization, extreme fears of germs, fear of public toliets, refusal to participate in hand-shaking, fear of touching door knobs with bare hands, etc. Something most people are not aware of is that this can also mean Mental Contamination, where the person with OCD feels contaminated for less obvious reasons. This could be because of abuse or molestation, breaking rules of strict religious beliefs, etc. where the person feels defective or unclean and continuously tries to find ways to physically clean off the emotional contamination.\n  \n  Checking OCD covers things like compulsively checking locks, knobs, alarms, stove tops, lights, safety checks etc. but it can also mean checking relationship statuses compulsively (are you mad at me? Do you still love me? etc) checking on the safety of loved ones, checking information you've read over and over because of fear that you won't remember, checking and double checking memories or past stories to make sure they are \"real\", and infinite other possibilities involving doubting your ability to do something correctly whether it's keeping your home protected or being a good spouse or whatever else.\n  \n  Rumination OCD is also sometimes called \"Intrusive Thought\" OCD. Rumination OCD leaves a person obsessing over a specific train of thought. That thought could be literally anything- bad things happening to the people you love- specific times in history- theological questions- superstitious beliefs- etc. Some examples would be: being afraid to interact with children because you're afraid you'll accidentally injure them, Constantly tallying your sins and worrying that you'll never be good enough in God's eyes, Believing that stepping on cracks in a sidewalk will literally hurt your mother and worrying over any you accidentally step on for long periods of time, Being absolutely convinced that your partner is cheating on you with no proof and letting it run your life.\n  \n  Most people with OCD suffer from several different manifestations, and that can change over time. Some people with OCD can remain symptom-free for long periods of time, and have them triggered again by depression or anxiety or for no reason at all. I'm running out of characters so that'll have to do :)\n  ","170682":"\n  My opinion is that people should do wtf they want to with their own bodies, though I do think it's considerate to stay clean and hygienic if you're going to be intimate with someone.  I have nothing against body hair on another person. I remember feeling shamed when a partner suggested I shave everything \"down there\" a million years ago. I find I disagree with most any of society's expectations if they have to do with a person's individual choice on a private and petty matter like how to groom body hair. I personally shave pits, legs, and genitals, pluck my eyebrows and a couple of chin hairs, and use a depilatory cream on my upper lip but it's less for appearance and more because I have OCD and that often (for me) manifests in compulsive skin picking and it's way worse if I feel certain textures of hair along skin areas I expect to be smooth.\n  ","170683":"\n  I thought they already decided it would be Harriet Tubman?\n  ","170684":"\n  Basically everything I do is uncool.\n  ","170685":"\n  The version of me everyone expected me to be.\n  ","170686":"\n  I rarely look at youtube, but here's a .gif of an owl playing peekaboo\n  ","170687":"\n  Often. Drugs. Prescription drugs. It takes a very delicate balance to keep me from the darker sides of my depression. I take a SNRI, thyroid hormones, prescription-level folic acid (if I were to buy drugstore folic acid as a replacement, I'd be going through about a bottle of pills a day), and I smoke marijuana daily. I'm in regular contact with my team of doctors. Right now, this is what it takes to fight off the depression enough that I can rationalize through my issues and survive it. I'm working on finding the right balance for the anxiety now.\n  \n  Here's the thing though. I've tried half a dozen-ish times. To end it. Twice, I came really fucking close. I remember those times. There wasn't a peaceful feeling and my loved ones in the light. There was the soul-crushing feeling that everything was wrong and I had to get back. There was emotional pain that I can't even describe. It felt like I was ripping my spiritual body apart trying to cling to the physical because on every level of existence, I had made a mistake. Maybe that's just my own brain's chemical reaction to death. But I've talked to a few people who've experienced the same.

I don't see any of them regularly now because I've moved across the country from where I grew up and lived most of my life, but when I was back East it wasn't unusual for my husband and I to have dinner with one of my exes and their date here and there as friends.\n  \n  I would prefer all of my relationships have worked out this way (minus one person) but sometimes things just aren't salvageable. I have a lot of faith in the concept of \"soul groups\" and reincarnation, to a degree, though it's not something I like to talk about here.

It's SUCH an intense process but the result is really amazing weed with government approval, so \/shrug.\n  ","170720":"\n  The art history classes I had through the years focused pretty heavily on the Renaissance and then again on the years between the two World Wars, so I guess those two periods.

I think- and I'm not in any way connected to or a part of the tattoo\/body mod community or anything, so I am just talking from my perceptions here- that there's been a pretty steady change since the early aughts away from impulse tattoos in any old shop on the \"bad side of town\" while drinking with your buddies to a more refined experience overall. Potential clients are more likely to research not only the shop but the artist they'll be working with, and build a relationship with them over each piece. I mean, I'm sure there are still regrettable tattoos being had at sketchy places, but overall it seems like it's become definitely more of a creative and well-planned process.\n  ","170728":"\n  My second job ever was working in a piercing studio\/jewelry store.

I get to mess around on the internet while I wake up and take my pills\/drink my coffee, then I try to get as many chores done as I'm able and shower. From there I relax a bit with whatever, sometimes that's a nap, sometimes that's reading twitter, sometimes that's sitting on my sofa watching the birds at my feeders. When Jon (and our car) get home, I need to be ready to go for any errands that need to be run, and then it's dinner. The rest of my night is generally mostly goofing off with some creative work mixed in.\n  \n  It works for me. If I spend too much time unable to get some work\/chores done, I feel awful about it.

I'd like to make soap to sell at farmers markets and to use. I'd like to keep 2 bee hives.\n  \n  I'd like to make games with my friend.

I almost never use a console, though, except for my Nintendo 2DS. I'm pretty strictly a computer gamer, preferring to get my games from places like steam or itch.io or whatever. I LOVE small indie games that are presented in an artsy way, and I also love big immersive AAAs (just haven't invested much time in any lately, but that's going to change soon cause I have Fallout 3 ready to go) Lately I've been playing H1Z1 which is a zombie shooter survival game but I'm going to spend an evening on Dear Esther here soon before moving into Fallout 3. My favorite games of my childhood were the Atari games Yars Revenge and Carnival, and Shadowgate and Mario bros. on NES. I didn't play many games between NES and later consoles but my roommates in college had a SNES and my neighbors had a gamecube and a dreamcast so I did play things here and there.  My adult favorte game is harder to choose because I really just love so many games. My favorites I've played in the past year or so have been Kentucky Route Zero, Nuclear Throne, Binding of Isaac, Minecraft, any of the Elder Scrolls except ESO, Alice: Madness Returns,  The Wolf Among Us, and GOTY 420 Blaze It.\n  ","170759":"\n  Frau Eva from Demian by Hermann Hesse.

The constants are: I'm smart, anxious, depressed. I'm a big fan of art, music, games, food, design, and a bushel of other dumb shit. I had a bad childhood and strings of terrible luck in both health and relationships throughout my younger years. My health continues to suck. I wanted to be an artist when I grew up. I didn't think I'd ever actually grow up. Adulthood has been a series of long stretches of pretending I've known what I was doing speckled with  times where mental illness held me down in one way or another. Everything else seems to change, at least has changed, or is changing? I don't know. Today is hard.\n  \n  I'm a person who has made many significant connections with people in my life but who has to medicate in order to spend any time with them in real life. I like to think I've helped a lot of people and made a difference but I still feel very lonely often. I believe in nonsense and pray to a vague non-formed idea. Loud noises trigger panic attacks. I used to sleepwalk into the ocean. I spent 35 years suppressing bisexual thoughts because of what my mother might say. I have crushes on women now and it's bizarre and wonderful.\n  \n  I'm a lot to deal with and I have more emotional baggage than water has wet. I have a neutral American accent that can switch to Appalachian or New England for certain words or phrases. I pick at my skin. I like to be quiet for long periods of time and require alone\/down time.\n  \n  Um\n  \n  I'm an INFJ. and a Capricorn. I guess.

Those with enough privilege to afford these trends get to feel superior to those of us who are not because they can fend off those thoughts of mortality a little bit easier.\n  ","170771":"\n  This is like a tenth of the owls in my apartment.

So we HAVE worked together, and it was alright.\n  ","170774":"\n  Well, I don't get out to like, parks or forests as much as I'd like to, but I do try to enjoy the natural world around me.

After two years of monitoring, it was recently classed down to a category 2 BI-RAD grade, which is \"benign finding\". At Category 3, I requested an MRI, just to have an additional image to refer to. This was back in September, I think. The MRI showed three previously unnoticed tumors, the largest having an undefined edge, and residing in my LEFT breast which we hadn't even been monitoring for a year. I had a biopsy in early Nov. and it was declared they were benign fibroademas. I went in for an ultrasound 2 weeks ago, and two of the three are smaller now! So it's not really as much of a threat now, but it was a hard 2 years.\n  \n  There wasn't a day between the initial mammogram and my recent 6-month follow up that I wasn't thinking in the back of my mind \"I'm probably going to die of cancer before I'm 40.\" or something similar. By the time I got to the MRI results, I had a full on mental break that I\"m still recovering from.\n  \n  I still think about death a lot. Probably as much as anyone else.

White Shoulders reminds me of getting baths at my other grandmother's house and using her white shoulders body powder afterwards because that's what ladies do.

She says now that I had plenty of notice that this was happening but as I remember it, it was literally an \"I came home from work and everything was in boxes, first I'm hearing of it\" situation.  I already have severe abandonment issues from I'm not honestly sure what and that tripled them.

I've been in a monogamous relationship for 12 years, and I'm being completely honest when I say that I wish my husband flirted with other people or maybe even more. I think his self esteem would benefit and I think he'd be happier because there are just some things that, after 12 years together, don't click like they once did and I respect and love him enough to still want what's best.  I think, at my core, I'm polyamorous, and also, I often feel like \"cheating\" is sort of a patriarchal thing that just doesn't hold a lot of weight in my heart anymore? Like, I am married, but I don't belong to anyone but myself? I dunno. We talk about these things. If he were okay with it, I would probably date other people.

I hope whenever my nephew sees an owl figurine he has warm fuzzy memories about his Aiya. I hope my sister remembers me as the big sister who would get stung in the swimming pool by scooping up and protecting her from floating wasps. I hope my husband misses me laying in bed in the morning telling him about my weird-ass dreams.\n  \n  I'll probably just be remembered as that one crazy fighting drunk who kept getting kicked out of bars in her early 20s though, or the unbalanced college kid who painted brilliant things but kept sleepwalking into dangerous places at 3am from stress  :(\n  ","170828":"\n  I mean, if it's a one time thing, sure, but I'd rather see all colleges have free daycare available for students outside of the classroom.

There are days I get no questions, and  a few days I get a ton (of course, those rare days are generally malicious, from what I assume are a couple of gators who know me through other people and have fixated on me as an easy \"target\" -so their questions are either not answered or answered and then reported). Most days, I get 2, which if I averaged out the questions I ask other people is probably about 2\/day as well so that works.\n  ","170842":"\n  the internet\n  ","170843":"\n  People who insist that medication for mental illnesses are unnecessary or dangerous are at the top of my list for \"most unhelpful\/ignorant about health\" award.  I need my medications to stay chemically balanced. Without them, I am suicidal and unable to take care of myself or others, I obsess over things to a point of being unable to get past them to live my daily life, and my anxiety reaches levels that cause major physical health concerns.\n  \n  Second on that list are people who insist that I'm too young to have the medical conditions I do. Yeah, most women don't have to have mammograms until they are 40, but I have had 6 and I'm 35. My age doesn't matter to the three tumors, category 2 mass, and countless cysts making their home in my breasts that need monitoring. Telling me I'm too young doesn't make the problems go away. Yes, most women don't need to worry about brittle bones until after menopause, but osteomalacia affects many younger adults. Telling me I'm not old enough just serves to make me feel even more broken and fragile. The only major health concern of mine currently that I never get told I'm too young for is having Sacro-Iliac Joint Dysfunction, because I guess anyone of any age can mess up their back.\n  \n  What is helpful is not making a big deal out of things. I look \"normal\". I do \"normal\" things. I have \"normal\" emotions and reactions. Not feeling like some bizarro monster because of my medical shortcomings is pretty important to my overall health. If we are close, letting me know that I have support or that nothing changes between us even on bad days is also welcome.\n  ","170844":"\n  It depends on a lot of things and were I am in my life emotionally. I am not currently afraid of the dark, unless that dark is in a place I'm unfamiliar with, but I guess that's really more of a fear of the unknown than of the dark.\n  ","170845":"\n  My most liked photo on IG is this one of three cosplayers.

I'm actually a little disappointed that selfies and cosplayers are my most popular pics, I have been to so many beautiful places in the past few years and a lot of those photos didn't get the love they deserved lol.\n  ","170846":"\n  I was a shitty garbage punk rock teen in the mid-late 90s so green jelly, obviously.\n  ","170847":"\n  I feel frustrated pretty often, actually. I have a lot of medical limitations that keep me from being able to do everything I feel I should be able to do, as well as a lot of mental baggage that makes me think there are walls standing in my way when there might not be. I deal with it through medication and taking breaks, which is to say my method of dealing with frustration is pretty hit or miss.\n  ","170848":"\n  My freshman year of college roommate and I found a set of old golf clubs and a bag of kinda gross apples while on a walk in the middle of the winter in Massachusetts. The only place cleared close by to have ANY fun was our own parking lot, so we were golfing apples into a snow drift but a few (most) smashed open somewhere in-between and a few bounced on ice and hit things so we got yelled at but it was probably the only fun I ever had outdoors in a Mass. Winter.\n  ","170849":"\n  It's an owl's head on the front of a locket. I bought it on etsy ages ago from this seller (\n  \n   https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/birdzNbeez\n  \n  ) but it doesn't look like she has anything similar in stock currently.\n  ","170850":"\n  basically truth.\n  ","170851":"\n  Yes! So amazing. I saw one today that was a dollhouse covered in comb.\n  ","170852":"\n  I don't think there's anything I'm interested in that at least one or two people in the inner circle don't know about, I'm pretty open. I guess there are a few things that maybe not everyone I'm close to knows as far as what I'm interested in, even if a couple do. Those things would be: beekeeping and one day being a beekeeper, learning how to make essential oils from home grown flowers\/herbs, rollerskating, wanting to learn coding, women, smoking cannabis....I can't think of anything else. At my age, nothing is that shocking to anyone I don't think, or I expect it won't be so I don't bother bringing things up unless it comes up.\n  ","170853":"\n  A picture someone on tumblr took from the air of a dick-shaped crop circle. I'm not proud at how much I laughed, but in my defense I'm pretty high.\n  ","170854":"\n  I feel like this is a good question in a string of good questions that for whatever reason I'm completely unprepared to answer and don't have really knowledge on the subject whatsoever but rather than let it rot in my unanswered questions bin I'll just say, \"Hrm, good question, I'm not really sure. Looks like some other people I follow received your question too and had very thoughtful answers, though.\"\n  ","170855":"\n  A guy from a little over 2 thousand years ago who had some good advice about treating each other better and was punished for it.\n  ","170856":"\n  I just hope things get better than they've been.\n  ","170857":"\n  I'm not currently employed.\n  ","170858":"\n  Firstly, I'm not sure what her age is, but if she's a minor then talk to your guardian. That's the number one thing you need to do so that they can take action to help protect her. If she's an adult, and especially if she lives with the boyfriend and is being abused, then it's a bit tougher. Try not to get frustrated with her unwillingness to talk or her insistence that she doesn't need any help, it's possible that she is afraid that it's her fault, that she deserves the abuse, that she'll be killed or hurt worse if anyone finds out, or any number of other fear and trauma-induced reasoning that might not seem logical to YOU but it's how she's surviving. What you CAN do is let her know that you want to help her in ANY way you can, and that she is important and loved and has other options. If you have a family and friends that are close who also have concerns or have voiced the opinion that they fear that she is being abused, then maybe some sort of intervention focusing on how she has a support net to catch her no matter what could be a good idea? But really, I don't know what to tell you. I've been in her situation but I had no help or support so I know how important that can be. Start keeping notes on what you notice as far as bruises, strange behavior, illegal activity on his part, etc. Anything that could be helpful in a case against him if it comes to that. Sadly and disgustingly, the police won't do shit for just bruises. They'll want extremely clear and incriminating proof of abuse...hospitalization, video of him hurting her, eye-witnesses, etc. Good luck, sorry I'm not the best help in the world, I'm certainly no expert on this or anyone who can do much for you :(\n  ","170859":"\n  I guess I'd go into survival mode and figure something out, or at least I like to think I would. Maybe I'd accidentally get eaten by a bear or something. Maybe I'd give up out of loneliness. I like to think I wouldn't try to take my own life because I've been there before and it's always ended up with my last conscious thoughts before being revived being ones of sheer regret and panic because I'd changed my mind.\n  ","170860":"\n  Hmmm.  Maybe? I don't like small spaces though so I'd be a terrible assistant since the only illusion I can think of right now that isn't essentially a lady in a box is the bullet catch.\n  ","170861":"\n  Brilliant but troubled.\n  ","170862":"\n  Everything reminds you of the person you're in love with, and every reminder of that person makes you feel warm and happy and like you have a place in the world.\n  ","170863":"\n  I've touched on it before, but my childhood was not that great. I was the oldest child of a narcissistic mother, who was the product of an abusive childhood as the oldest child of a narcissistic father. I served the role of \"Golden (grand)Child\" to my grandfather, while being the hated \"scapegoat\" to my mother. I learned to read at age 3 and was really advanced as a kid, even as far as being part of some weird top secret IQ study in 1st and 2nd grade and then going to a specialized academically gifted school from 2nd to 4th grade (I switched to an art school in 4th grade). BUT- while technically I'm a super genius or whatever, it's in areas that people don't normally score as high during testing? Like, I'm super smart in things like spatial reasoning but will fail horribly if you put an advanced math equation in front of me. So I've always felt kind of \"dumb\" because while I was still smart by most standards, I wasn't what my mother and grandfather expected me to be. From him, I felt like I constantly let him down. When he was let down, I received extra abuse from my mother, who was always ready to cut me down as much as possible anyway because I look like my dad and not her. This taught me to never be proud of my accomplishments UNLESS I had my grandfather's approval and therefore, my mother's acceptance. It's honestly taken years and years of my adult life trying to reverse that. I try to let myself feel proud of small things, even- cooking a decent meal, getting my chores done before the afternoon is finished, etc- just to try to make up for all of the times I put my all into something as a kid and it wasn't enough.\n  ","170864":"\n  I really hope so but I don't know. I teeter on the edge of hopeful and having no faith in humanity.\n  ","170865":"\n  Since it says \"any\" I'll assume that this means past or present...I wanna be on the Muppet Show. I don't care what role or in what capacity.\n  ","170866":"\n  haha probably not anymore, I have a messed up back.\n  ","170867":"\n  I'm not a big fan of sports. Like, I enjoy playing them sometimes, I was in the tennis club in middle school and I used to play pick-up softball, volleyball, disc golf,soccer, and capture the flag games in college when I could and the weather was nice, but I haaaaaaate watching other people play sports and I have this kind of dread associated with sports because of elementary school bullies who always picked me last for being a nerd even though I wasn't even that bad at whatever we were playing, so I just sort of became apathetic to trying or caring anymore. That was sort of an unnecessarily long and rambling answer, sorry lol.\n  ","170868":"\n  By gathering at balls and parties where they could focus on the social niceties and pretend that women and minorities weren't being treated as sub-human. Also, card games\/parlor games were pretty big I think.\n  ","170869":"\n  Surprisingly not really.  I'll burn, don't get me wrong, but I also tan very easily and quickly (I just choose not to because I've had a malignant mole removed before and cancer is scary)\n  ","170870":"\n  Nah, love is simple. What we do with it, how we react to it, the lies we tell ourselves about it, and the restrictions we believe in or set up for ourselves because of it are what's complicated.\n  ","170871":"\n  Nah- The two oldest turned 10 in April though and 10 felt like a good milestone to be really silly about it. Packed little tissue-paper gift with catnip and treats and toys and everything. They were pretty bothered about the whole ordeal until they realized treats were involved.\n  ","170872":"\n  HI\n  ","170873":"\n  I made hats for my cats' 10th birthday last month and they were adorable.\n  ","170874":"\n  There have been many times I've had emotional reactions to art. I've cried, laughed, felt repulsed. I threw up in a trashcan at the Dali museum in Florida!  When I saw my favorite Kokoschka painting in Boston, I literally fell to my knees. I've always had a strong love of fine arts, having attended various art schools from 4th through 12th grade and then an art college.\n  ","170875":"\n  The moment they create something with artistic intent, I guess.\n  ","170876":"\n  Questions like these make me feel like I'm going to aggravate both the very religious and the very anti-religion. I am never very forward with my religious thoughts usually because it just isn't very important to me to debate or talk my thoughts out on the subject, it's a personal thing and I loathe being judged for that. But, I'm interested in this question tonight so I'll answer. God is who we make of Them. If you believe God is dead, then They are dead. If I believe God is a vague collection of strange energies that may or may not influence us in any way then God is a vague collection of strange energies that may or may not influence us in any way.  I believe in God in that I believe that many of us need rituals and codes and a feeling of connection. That God is never going to be the same for you as it is for me, or for that guy over there, or whatever. I guess basically I'm saying sure, God is Dead. But God is Alive too. God is whatever and nothing.\n  ","170877":"\n  I feel like I used to have more opinions about this, but honestly I have no idea what's happening with education nowadays as I do not have children and cannot have children.\n  ","170878":"\n  Good to meet you, but in all honesty you're probably my least favorite packaged cookie. Unless you're crumbled up in some ice cream.  Sorry.\n  ","170879":"\n  I will check it out. I haven't read a ton lately but I keep writing down books I want to read for when I feel like reading again. Thanks :)\n  ","170880":"\n  I have not, is it good?\n  ","170881":"\n  Busch Gardens Williamsburg used to have a suspended roller coaster called the Big Bad Wolf that I loved but it's long gone, I haven't been there in probably 15 years, and my back's too bad for roller coasters now.\n  ","170882":"\n  Yes I'm your angel\n  \n  I'll give you anything\n  \n  in my\n  \n  magic powers\n  \n  so make a wish\n  \n  and I'll let it come\n  \n  true for you\n  \n  tra la la la la\n  \n  (man it's been a long time since I've had to reach into the brain vault and pull out some Yoko lyrics)\n  ","170883":"\n  According to my great aunt's research\/extensive family trees, I'm directly descended from the Plantagenets so let's go with royalty.\n  ","170884":"\n  Thanks :)  the cat eye frame is coming back in a big way, I've noticed.\n  ","170885":"\n  It's alright\n  ","170886":"\n  Bob's Burgers probably. I'm still catching up on Parks and Rec and I love that, but I guess it's not current since it ended recently. I'm really looking forward to season 3 of Orange is the New Black. I don't watch a ton of tv. A few shows here and there, preferably 30 min for me because my crappy sofa hurts my dysfunctional SI joints and I'm too broke to replace it.\n  ","170887":"\n  I'm a romantic in that I'm usually hopeful, I try to see good in people, and I enjoy sentiment and intimacy, but I think it's rarely as pure or concentrated as it once was. Lately I feel doubt and cynicism about people and issues and relationships more frequently than I did when I was younger.\n  ","170888":"\n  lol nah. It's an innie, I'm really pale, and I'm about 50 lbs overweight so you can use your imagination.\n  ","170889":"\n  Same as here but I won't add people I don't at least kind of know irl.\n  ","170890":"\n  We can be art with out movements, our gestures, our words- we can cause art, we can inspire art, we can adorn ourselves with art or even be the canvas for it- but the human form itself? Nah. We are the art creators and curators, not the art itself.\n  ","170891":"\n  I would like to visit Cristo Redentor on Corcovado in Rio. I would like to stand there overlooking the city that a group of family members on my mom's side speak of with vitriol or regret, try to see what they blame for everything. Try to understand what it was that triggered all of them to become who they are. Or maybe just so that I can prove to myself that it's just another big city and my family is just prone to a large variety of mental illnesses.\n  ","170892":"\n  I do not\n  ","170893":"\n  Oh hell yeah I'd use a self driving car. Eff driving.\n  ","170894":"\n  You model for a sock company ONE TIME and this is what happens, ya'll.\n  ","170895":"\n  Not that I can recall. Physical punishment growing up was infrequent and generally involved being slapped across the face or grabbed by the arm and pushed into things. My mother abused us with words more than her hand.\n  ","170896":"\n  hahahaha thankfully I have nice full lips naturally and haven't paid any attention to this foolishness.\n  ","170897":"\n  I'm a big fan of the frankincense and myrrh combo. The perfumes I wear are generally very woodsy, spicy, or have a jasmine layer in them. My current favorite oil blend to stick in the diffuser to scent my home with lately is a combination of orange, ginger, frankincense, clove, and peppermint.\n  ","170898":"\n  By car, as a passenger, with a driver that is totally okay with me demanding stops frequently for picture taking, exploration, pee breaks, and other time wasting.\n  ","170899":"\n  I am regularly blown away by how beautiful everything in the Pacific NW is. WA, OR, and Northern CA are astonishingly gorgeous. The wild cold Pacific, the deserts, the forests and rain forests, the snow-capped volcanoes, the ferns and moss and wildlife- this is really the prettiest place I've ever lived. Here's a photo I took in Wenatchee National Forest, WA. The creek is called Devil's Creek. I pulled over to the side of a road to take this like two years ago.\n  ","170900":"\n  An empty early morning ocean beach or deep in the woods.  When I lived in Virginia Beach I would wake up at 5am a few times a week during the Summer and drive down to Sandbridge beach before the parking attendant got there (free parking yay) and watch the sunrise. I'd sort of snooze for an hour and then take a swim and then go home. It was peaceful. I was usually the only person around other than morning joggers.  I don't live close enough to the ocean for that sort of thing anymore, and the Pacific is much colder than the jet-streamed Atlantic. Now, I enjoy being in the woods, just walking and being quiet.\n  ","170901":"\n  I wasn't engaged before we got married, so all we wear are plain silver bands. So there's that, and I have 4 piercings in each ear- the bottom lobe holes I change out to go with outfits but the remaining three in each ear hold a tiny assortment of silver owls, stars, and hoops. I generally wear a silver and labradorite cabochon ring unless I'm dressing up for a particular reason and it doesn't fit in. I have a few other rings I switch in and out occasionally but not lately. I used to always wear a little silver necklace with an abstract owl charm on it but lately my skin has felt to sensitive to deal with it.\n  ","170902":"\n  Observing how different their personalities are. Rin is our dominant girl who likes to demand special treatment and talk back. Kyo is Daddy's boy and is afraid of everything. Mimi is the bumbling brave kitty who wants to be in the middle of everything. Sometimes they get along, sometimes they don't. Kyo and Mimi often challenge Rin for the head cat position and fail. Rin likes rodents\/squirrels but HATES birds. Kyo guards the hall bathroom from strangers because for some reason he's determined that that belongs to my husband only. Mimi begs for table scraps like a puppy. They're all ridiculous.\n  ","170903":"\n  I do not watch\/have not read this series. I do not plan to.\n  ","170904":"\n  Ma Fratelli from the Goonies, but only because I had a series of nightmares about her as a small child.\n  ","170905":"\n  Oh I get a choice? Is someone going to just like, give me my dream job? Does it pay my dream salary, too? In that case, I'll take one \"President of Doing Nothing While at Home in Pajamas\" for $200k\/year.\n  ","170906":"\n  35\n  ","170907":"\n  Sex education is extremely important, and the right age is, I dunno, like 2 years before puberty even thinks about beginning? Kids need to know what's going on with their bodies. Early sex ed should probably focus on anatomy and what changes to expect. I feel like by the time they're late- pre-teens, like 12, they should have a clear understanding of what STDs are and how serious some can be, should already understand how and why their bodies work, how a baby is made, and what contraceptives are available.\n  ","170908":"\n  I'd feel safer with guns in the hands of the average citizen more than I do with guns in the hands of our police force. I am undecided on the gun control issue. I enjoy target shooting. I have hunters in my family. Everyone I grew up with's families had guns, and we all are just fine. However, gun violence is pretty serious. I don't really know what the solution or the happy medium is.\n  ","170909":"\n  Yes, I absolutely think that animal testing is justified in major medical research situations. For cosmetics and skin care? Not so much.\n  ","170910":"\n  No, I'm not a supporter of the death penalty. I say that knowing full well that there are people out there who are evil to their very core. People who in all honesty probably should be sentenced in such a way. People who have done unthinkable things.They're still people, though and it's still murder.\n  ","170911":"\n  It's strange, because I was raised in a predominantly atheist household with a bit of woo-woo astrology weirdness thrown in, so the concept of heaven and hell and that sort of afterlife belief was really foreign to me. My family did not believe in any sort of afterlife at all, and that always gave me some degree of anxiety so I avoided really thinking about it for a good portion of my life. I guess, if I have to pinpoint what I believe, it's probably more along the lines of reincarnation, except without the Nirvana\/Heaven-like end goal. Just maybe information and energy passed on somehow. I identify as \"agnostic\" mainly because I really don't have any clear answers about what I really believe, I just feel sort of gut-feeling-led on these things whether that's for my own comfort or whether that's my personal truth or what.\n  ","170912":"\n  Like I kind of don't even want to say this because I feel like it'll just bring on abuse I don't have time or need for, but I'll answer anyway. I found the Matrix to be boring and predictable. Strictly as a movie showcasing action and effects, it could have been okay, but the movie took itself soooo seriously with this pseudo-intellectual crap and *blech*.\n  ","170913":"\n  The first time I had Indian food. I don't remember the name of the restaurant but I was 18 I believe and my friend Justin and I were in Richmond VA and stopped to eat. We had vegetable pakota, saag gosht, and mango lassis. It might not have even been amazing food, but the flavors and spices and everything about it was so good to me. Still one of my favorite cuisines for sure.\n  ","170914":"\n  I only saw the first Saw and part of the second one and that was approx. a million years ago. I may be totally wrong, but didn't the victims all have some sort of crime they got away with and were paying for from this vigilante psychopath with a puppet? I guess I would try to play judge myself. Find out what the man did as his unforgivable crime. Weigh it against my own. If he was like, a child abuser or a rapist or something, hell yeah his dick is coming off. If he did something really really awful against another person, probably he gets cut. Otherwise, then he's no worse than me so I guess goodbye foot.\n  ","170915":"\n  Honestly, I don't know if I do or not! I haven't been since I was a kid. I have OCD and while it stays treated when my meds are balanced out sometimes I do have issues with feeling or seeing things on my skin that I perceive as dirty so that might be an issue. My husband definitely wants to save up for camping gear since we live in such a great place for it, so I hope we'll get to try it out sometime in the not so distant future. (deleted and re-answered because I'm half asleep and made an annoying typo)\n  ","170916":"\n  Other than going to Pax Prime we haven't really planned anything for this year to look forward too, and I sort of look forward to that but at the same time....ehhh. Social anxiety and gators. So I don't look forward to that MOST. I guess what I look forward to MOST is hopefully feeling better at some point? Or having a healthy and enjoyable Summer? Maybe someone will come visit me. I dunno. I'm bad at answering things today.\n  ","170917":"\n  I wonder how many people are going to answer this with the Rebecca Black video (and I dunno, I don't work so everyday is about the same)\n  ","170918":"\n\n   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UHawd3Dlpyo\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","170919":"\n  Gallery attendant at my friend's dad's art gallery.\n  ","170920":"\n  Sleep, weed, or video games...or if I'm well, hiking.\n  ","170921":"\n  Eh, I'll play just about anything, generally what grabs me isn't the type of game something is but how it's designed or the story or something else like that. The games I've played most recently are Neverending Nightmares, Sentris, Nuclear Throne, Off-Peak, Skyrim, Pokemon Shuffle. I'm watching a friend stream H1Z1 right now but I don't think I'd necessarily enjoy that one. The next game I want to play is Fallout 3. I skipped a lot of the consoles most gamers grew up with because of a busy high school and college life, but I grew up with Atari (favorite game Yars Revenge) and NES (Shadowgate was my favorite NES, and of course Mario) After college I messed around with some console games but really it's been mostly PC games since then.  So basically, the short answer is: All of 'em, potentially, unless it's console only.\n  ","170922":"\n  It won't be Saturday for me for another 6.5 hours, but I assume tomorrow I'll be doing about what I do every Saturday- cleaning the apartment, cooking dinner, and playing video games.\n  ","170923":"\n  key lime pie or carrot cake or chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream\n  ","170924":"\n  Because he is the caretaker of Loglad, a miniature Lodlady-approved Moonkin companion with a heart of gold and wings of fury.\n  ","170925":"\n  I feel like I consider both about equally.  Probably those close to me would disagree, they like to assume I fly by the seat of my pants into things, but I really do carefully consider both feelings and reason.\n  ","170926":"\n  Cars that drive themselves, I really really really hate driving.\n  ","170927":"\n  When I am able to be fit (or at least fitter than I am now) I enjoy yoga, dancing, walking, hiking. The past year has been a nightmare of medication switches, withdrawal, back pain, and crippling depression though so I'm more un-fit than I've ever been before. Hopefully soon I'll be back on the right path.\n  ","170928":"\n  I prefer to donate to organizations that offer service to or do research for mental illness or women's health.   I don't have a specific favorite.\n  ","170929":"\n  The whims and whys of the Easter Bunny are not for mere mortals to know.\n  ","170930":"\n  I was going to say black jellybean since they're my favorite, but my mother likes them so that won't work :P  I guess my answer instead is any type of ginger candy, because I eat it a lot. Switching meds so frequently for the past year+ has caused a lot of random nausea and stomach probs so it's good to have around. I like the taste, too...spicy, but comforting and classic at the same time.\n  ","170931":"\n  I can't narrow it down to one favorite artist. I love basically the entire German Expressionism movement the best. I CAN tell you my favorite painting, though, and that is \"Two Nudes (Lovers)\" by Oskar Kokoschka. I don't consider Kokoschka my favorite artist, though. I like him just as well as Schiele, Grosz, Kollwitz, Felixmuller, Kandinsky, and on and on.\n  ","170932":"\n  I really like both, which is why I love where I live currently- I can drive to the ocean in a couple of hours, and be enveloped in the Cascade range in less time than that.\n  ","170933":"\n  When I was 17 or so I convinced some kid that the paint splatter on the ceiling in an art building at ODU was the result of anti-gravity, because once every 100 years polarities shift and gravity doesn't work for a second (and it had JUST HAPPENED like, a week ago, didn't he feel it?). Less of a prank and more a testament to my persuasiveness. I'm not really much for pranks- especially mean spirited ones and loud ones- but I'm also old and grumpy.\n  ","170934":"\n  I'm aware of trends as much as any one else is without trying too hard- when suddenly everyone I see is wearing something that they weren't wearing last week, then it's probably the new style. I don't consider myself extremely fashionable, but I do try to put together outfits that I enjoy wearing and that I think look attractive on me when I go out.\n  ","170935":"\n  smooth, because I'm not a monster\n  ","170936":"\n  I've never really paid much attention to them. Don't know very much about them at all.\n  ","170937":"\n  I read Sabriel by Garth Nix not tooo long ago (and the other two books in the series as well, Clariel and Abhorsen) and if you like fantasy type fiction they were very good.

Since Rin and Kyo have Japanese names, we've sort of been naming all cats since them with Japanese names as well to continue the pattern (Hachi had cancer and passed, Mimi is with us now- Mimi being short of Mikan). We had a hamster named Kostya, so to be fair to the cats I should probably name any other rodents with Russian names as well. We've not had a dog yet, but will probably adopt an adult dog when we're able so they generally have names already.\n  ","170942":"\n  I know it sounds like a cop-out answer but I really can't decide. I know so many people who are good or do good. Everyone has their own personal demons, of course, but I think I have done a good job of choosing mostly good people to connect with in my life in whatever capacity (with definite, evil, terrible-people exceptions here and there, of course, but a small percentage).\n  ","170943":"\n  I don't know....do YOU believe you're ghosts?\n  ","170944":"\n  I decide quickly and obsess over my decision a long time.\n  ","170945":"\n  It's possible because I'm a terrible driver and a worse navigator.\n  ","170946":"\n  Not very much, actually, it's one of the few problems I DON'T have. Yet.\n  ","170947":"\n  I do not know how to whistle :(\n  ","170948":"\n  Exploit it for fame and money and then hide my shame and loneliness by retracting inward to cry.\n  ","170949":"\n  don't have a preference about what another individual chooses to do with their hair. It's always bugged me when people have said \"oh, I liked you hair when it was short\" or \"I think you should grow your hair longer\" without having been asked specifically because I'll tell you 99% of the people making a judgement on my hair have been men, and it feels controlling as fuck. (The other 1% is my grandma so we'll excuse that)\n  ","170950":"\n  3% of all adult humans are sleeper agents for the robot revolution.\n  ","170951":"\n  This is tough. Cookies are my not-so-secret weakness. I basically love everything that isn't chocolate-cookie based. I like sugar cookies, peanut butter cookies, oatmeal raisin, cranberry and macademia nut, gingerbread, shortbread, etc etc etc. As far as store bought, I really like pecan sandies, but I'll enjoy basically anything that isn't, once again, chocolate cookie based. So no Oreos, but basically everything else is good.\n  ","170952":"\n  Yes, and I don't know. Ice age? Is that the main theory?\n  ","170953":"\n  I use an app called Zedge, it's def on android don't know about ios. It's a collection of wallpapers, live wallpapers, ring tones, notification tones, and games, but I only ever use it for regular wallpapers and notification tones (neat feature!: it lets you pick a bunch of wallpapers at a time and then randomly changes your phone background to one of them every hour or 3 hours or whatever you set it up to do, so I actually use about 12 backgrounds- mostly owls- that change once an hour)\n  \n  I've been using the app for three separate phones now, and the only time I've ever run into an issue with it was when I tried to use a live wallpaper, so I don't know about that mess.\n  ","170954":"\n  I was lucky enough to have two mentors, one in high school and one in college. Both were male. Both were MUCH older. Both were artists. Both were good enough to keep the relationship between us as mentor\/student until I left the schools they were associated with. Both then took a bizarre turn. The first sent me love letters with gifts and jewelry beginning several years after I graduated, but since he sent them to my mother's address and not my college address she of course read and kept them, and freaked the fuck out (I probably would have to to be honest, but I still hate that she read my shit). The second was less creepy and more of just a straight-forward explanation that he divorced his wife (who was one of many wives) because she wasn't cool with his sex addiction, and now that we were peers I should come by and visit. I declined and we just never really talked anymore.\n  \n  On a positive note, both gave me several years of learning that I was lucky to have. Both gave me confidence and strength and made me feel supported in my endeavors, which is something my mother never did.\n  \n  Point of my rambling is- mentors can disappoint the fuck out of you, no matter how much you look up to someone that someone is still a human being with flaws.\n  ","170955":"\n  I worked in a piercing studio from 1996 to 1998. In a military town. There are so many piercings I used to want but in just that short amount of time in the studio I cleaned up vomit from nervous Navy guys for just about every piercing out there- that kinda killed them all for me. I like them on other people sometimes, but for now at least I'm content with 4 earrings per ear.\n  ","170956":"\n  I'll narrow it down to top 3, in order, but it's very close. Jeff Buckley's cover of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\", The Black Key's cover of The Beatle's \"She Said, She Said\", and Devo's cover of The Rolling Stone's \"I Can't Get No (Satisfaction)\".\n  ","170957":"\n  Depends on what meds I'm on, what I'm smoking, and how many things I have to obsessively break down and re-think before I can sleep.\n  ","170958":"\n  I just ate a bowl of beef and vegetable soup so that. In general, those mustard and onion pretzel bit things are so good.\n  ","170959":"\n  I think most people are mostly good! (oh snap look at me dodging that political question like a pro!)\n  ","170960":"\n  They are real pigs, but fake soccer balls.\n  ","170961":"\n  It depends on if I have a craving for anything in particular, or if someone recommended something specific that made me want to try the restaurant in the first place... but if I'm going in completely blind I'll generally consider things like price (I don't like to order the most expensive thing, or the cheapest thing), ingredients (if it's slathered in jalapenos I'm probably gonna say no thanks), whether I've tried it before (I like to try new things when I can), or what I've eaten recently. I just made this sound so complicated.\n  ","170962":"\n  \"OMG enough with the baby voice, I'm not a cutie wootie little fluffy butt, I'm a grown ass animal\"\n  ","170963":"\n  Not regularly, but I have in the past and probably will again one day.\n  \n  The games I have on my iPad currently are: MTG 2014, Draw Something, French Girls, Blendoku, Alpaca Evolution, and Crossy Road. I finished Alpaca Evolution at 100%. I haven't started Crossy Road but it's by the same dev who made GOTY 420 Blaze It so I'm sure it's a win. Blendoku is a great game but you really need to have perfect or close to perfect color acuity. I want to start playing French Girls more, because I need to practice drawing more.\n  \n  The Android games I have on my phone currently are: Flappy Doge and Wold of Goo. I have not started World of Goo, and I Dl'd Flappy Doge because it was really funny to me at the time.\n  ","170964":"\n  No one, at least, I don't think I do. I got mad at Vine for some reason when it first came out and although I can't even remember why, I uninstalled it and haven't thought about it much since because instagram ended up coming out with a similar feature anyway.\n  ","170965":"\n  There are plenty of things I really hate paying for, but still do so begrudgingly- Things I WISH I could refuse to pay for and still have access to:  education. water. medicine...  Stupid things I wish I didn't have to need buy I definitely do need and it makes me mad that I have to spend money on them: ugly support bras for my tumor sacks, toilet paper, pads\/tampons, basic hygiene items. I pay for it all though, and just grumble.\n  ","170966":"\n  I'm not sure who my favorite actor is. I don't watch a ton of movies lately and no one really springs to mind...oh wait, except for Kyle MacLachlan. So there. Agent Cooper is my favorite actor. Musician....the opposite problem is happening here, I can think of a trillion but I have no idea who to narrow it down to. Generally I'll answer \"best band of all time?\" with The Pixies, so I guess maybe Frank Black\/Black Francis is in the running for favorite musician? Along with Joni Mitchell, Jeff Buckley, Mark Mothersbraugh, Lady Gaga....I dunno. That's more or less my answer I guess.\n  ","170967":"\n  Probably. I feel like that's where we're heading, right? We've begun privatizing space travel, seems like trying to get to and either occupy or mine other planets and asteroids and such is the next step. I lean towards believing that there are humanoids on other planets somewhere already if that counts.\n  ","170968":"\n  no!\n  ","170969":"\n  I dunno, I guess honey mustard or something vingar-y\n  ","170970":"\n  one at a time- barely.\n  ","170971":"\n  sometime between 10pm and 2am\n  ","170972":"\n  I try my best not to appropriate too much from other cultures, and that includes this cutesy hipster pc nightmare. I saw a woman I respect very much, Ijeoma Oluo (@IjeomaOluo on twitter) deflect this question once by replacing the problematic \"spirit animal\" with a nerdier but infinitely more acceptable \"patronus\", so we'll do that.\n  \n  My patronus would be a great horned owl (Bubo Virginianus) Here's one that's had it with people stealing \"spirit animal\" from the cultures where it actually means something sacred.\n  ","170973":"\n  The not peanut butter way.\n  ","170974":"\n  Keep trying to learn, I guess. I feel like there's much I don't know lately.\n  ","170975":"\n  One, and I've not bothered to learn which remote even turns it on. I only really watch shows via netflix or amazon and I only do that really with my husband when we eat dinner at home which is probably a bad habit but that's what we've done for years.\n  ","170976":"\n  I'm not sure I really have friends.\n  ","170977":"\n  I don't think I'm especially selective, but then again I guess most of the books I've read have been recommended in one way or another either by someone I know saying \"hey you should read this\" or someone I respect listing their favorites or something else. So maybe that is the case. But then again, someone recommended Catch 22 to me, so.... shrug.\n  ","170978":"\n  If it's non-fiction, I don't feel bad about only reading parts, but as far as fiction goes I will almost always finish the book. The ONE exception to this- out of the hundreds of books I've read- was Catch 22 by Joseph Heller. I know several people who say this is their all-time favorite book and I cannot understand how. I found it soooooo boring and hard to lose myself in because of the way it's narrated. Don't think I even made it halfway.\n  ","170979":"\n  Brave.\n  ","170980":"\n  Anglerfish because the females of the species are bad ass sharp-toothed monsters with bio-luminescent lures and the males of the species are tiny little parasites that have to cling to the females to survive.\n  ","170981":"\n  \"Enough is enough\" translates roughly to \"Rawwwr grrr grawl Rawwwr\" in Brownbear. Be very careful of your pronunciation, though, because it is very easy to accidentally say \"Fight me Motherfucker\"\n  ","170982":"\n  other people.  and spiders.\n  ","170983":"\n  Bees. One of my serious goals in life is to buy an acre or two and keep bees.\n  ","170984":"\n  I really try to be polite and kind as much as possible, but I also have some social anxiety so occasionally it comes across weird or my timing is stupid....but as far as a specific example, I took public transit into Portland yesterday with my husband, and on one of the trains a young homeless couple got on and sat across from us carrying all of their clothes and everything in their arms. I didn't have any cash or food or anything but I remembered I did have one of those nylon bags from Ikea that fold up and expand out to a large shopper bag in my purse so I tried to give it to the girl to carry some of the clothes in but she seemed really embarrassed and turned it down then I was embarrassed but nah, it was intended to be kind gesture and it was her right to do whatever so it's all good.\n  ","170985":"\n  So much that my biology lab partner spread a rumor that I was a vampire because I was pale, had goth friends, and slept during the day. Through all of high school, though, I was also attending a second high school that was focused on fine arts, so I'd have to go to regular hs in the mornings, rush to catch a bus downtown, take college art courses until like 5pm, and then bus home. That meant two schools worth of homework, and I was also working 30 hours a week once I turned 16, so I NEEDED those school naps.\n  ","170986":"\n  I am trying to draw all of the backyard feeder birds for my region- I think there's like, 28 or so. I have 12 finished. I have no real reason for doing this other than I felt like it one day and now I'm just trying to see it through lol.\n  ","170987":"\n  I think some social scientist someone or other said last year or the year before that the number is around 150, but I tend to have smaller groups of friends so I dunno.\n  ","170988":"\n  I had skin cancer on my butt and it left a tiny scar on my otherwise perfect butt so fuck the sun. I need bigger guns.\n  ","170989":"\n  Everyone I know is cute as hell\n  ","170990":"\n  If my feet are cold, sure. I like those half-toe toe socks that have the grippy things on the bottom, for yoga or whatever, because sleeping in them keeps your feet warm but your toe nailbeds dry.\n  ","170991":"\n  One of my three cats, Kyo, even though he didn't deserve it because he was on the kitchen counter.\n  ","170992":"\n  I'm in the middle of re-reading Demian by Hermann Hesse. The last book I completed was....um... Either a user's manual for Procreate or Holly Green's video game cookbook which can be purchased here:\n  \n   https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/book\/fry-scores\/id954313135?mt=11\n  \n","170993":"\n  I don't know!

My mom dated the bassist of some shitty one hit wonder band from the 80s called Head East briefly when I was a kid. Headbutted Wesley Willis in 1999. Have met tons of musicians and artists and writers briefly via this or that. But I'm not \"close\" to anyone famous.\n  ","170997":"\n  If you mean like, do I have that disorder that makes me crave and eat weird things, then the answer is \"no\". If you mean like, accidentally ingesting a little piece of wrapper or whatever, then the answer is probably \"yes\". If you mean something else, then probably not? I'm old and un-hip so if that's a drug reference I didn't get it.\n  ","170998":"\n  A very distressed street woman stopped me and a friend once in the mid-90s to beg for our help stopping Them from eating the children for breakfast. I don't know who \"They\" are. Or why they couldn't eat cheerios like everyone else. At any rate I was like, 15, so I didn't really know what to do and just hustled away after muttering some sympathetic sounding things.\n  ","170999":"\n  ...and I wish I felt well enough to focus on games more. But whatevs- it's honestly strange to me that my twitter persona is expected to be like, all games all the time by most of you. I started to make games with a friend, but several really terrible things happened and kinda fucked us both over and that's not happening now. I play games, I grew up with games, and I love games- and I have literally been doing so since most of my followers were even born. So- yeah, I will post about games sometimes, and I follow a lot of game makers or other people in the industry- but I also follow a lot of local government tweeters and pro-cannabis tweeters and people I know irl, and just random other shit, and none of those other facets of my twitter life ever reach out and say \"I wish you would tweet about smoking pot more\" or whatever, you know? But if I don't tweet about games, I hemorrhage followers. It's strange. I'll try, just because I DO care about gaming but I mean, give me a break. I just started thyroid meds and my world is kind of shaky and sweaty and nauseous and I'm not really feeling most things right now.\n  ","171000":"\n  Pulp Fiction Soundtrack was one of the last things I bought on cassette before CDs took over, and I played it so many times it broke.\n  ","171001":"\n  I really just like all cheeses. I am a fan of cheese. I've been to the Tillamook cheese factory like, 6 times since I've moved to the Portland area. It's sad probably how much I like cheese.\n  ","171002":"\n  no\n  ","171003":"\n  Less than I would like. Growing up I read constantly, now I'm lucky if I read 3 or 4 books a year.\n  ","171004":"\n  Whether or not \"irregardless\" is EVER correct (omg everyone stop saying that shit, and also stop with the \"I seen it\" shit while you're at it)\n  ","171005":"\n  chex mix or anything similar, popcorn, cookies, anything cheesy and crunchy\n  ","171006":"\n  Not very long. 20 seconds, tops.\n  ","171007":"\n  Strangely enough, I'm old enough to have actually been to a psychologist who was still using something as weird and out-dated as scream therapy when I was a young adult. That guy was straight out of a cartoon. He also specialized in dream interpretation and hypnotherapy but for some bizarre reason he was one of very few therapists in my area at the time who was accepted by my insurance.\n  \n  ANYWAY. Long story short. Some weird little throwback from the 70's shrink used to make me primal yell for an hour.\n  ","171008":"\n  someone who used to be very close to me advised me during a difficult time and told me in different words that it was okay to remove my mother from my life if she was hurting me, that it's okay to stand up for yourself to your abuser even if it's your own mother. I overcame the guilt, and I did it. It's been a few years, and things get through here and there of course but it's opened up the space in my life for healing and I am very thankful for that advice and push.\n  ","171009":"\n  Imagine Wario with a grey mustache and a Hawaiian shirt except for instead of hatred for Mario, he's filled with goofy jokes, Jimmy Buffet trivia, and cocktails.\n  ","171010":"\n  I would detest being famous I think. Rich, however, I could certainly live with. I don't even know what happiness really is, but I sure as hell know what it is to be poor so no thanks on that one again if I can help it.\n  ","171011":"\n  I did, and then I called him and we talked for like an hour and I guess I'll finally submit an answer now. My dad and stepmom are pretty good dad and stepmoms to have.\n  ","171012":"\n  shot down by our Reptile overlords\n  ","171013":"\n  I don't really read any regularly. I had a Portland Monthly subscription until this past month, and I flip through those a bit but I don't know that I've really cared about a print magazine since like, 2002.\n  ","171014":"\n  With that sort of scale, I'm not sure :P I try to have faith that people can be good and do good things. I realize that there are plenty who will never live up to their potential as decent human beings, but I don't think that's necessarily an American society thing. I like America. It's all I know. I have high hopes that we as a whole can improve our society through good deeds and acceptance of each other.\n  ","171015":"\n  Word.\n  ","171016":"\n  As a woman who has spent time on the internet, getting an anonymous question about sandwiches makes  the hair on the back of my neck stand. My answer previously was like, 70% mock outrage at a seemingly innocent question, and 30% legitimately wondering \"so when does the get in the kitchen and make a sandwich joke come in\" so basically, nah, I'm not talking about sandwiches with an anon past this.

Not that I ever really care to. So, in short, \"No.\"\n  ","171024":"\n  I bought my much younger brother and his girlfriend a cute little onesie set for the baby girl they're expecting this Summer. My brother and I don't talk. He's basically a sociopath and tbh, I've been afraid of him for years. I saw this thing, though, and I really wanted their baby to have it, so I bought it, and I wasted 4 cards trying to find the right, non-dramatic or weird things to say, and I wrapped it in cute paper, and packaged it up and mailed it to my sister (I don't have his address, so she was going to give it to him for me)...and now it's lost in the mail somewhere or else still in transit after nearly two weeks because of the snow, so who knows if it'll even get to him after all.  My husband threw away the tracking number accidentally. Hooray Gifts : \/\n  ","171025":"\n  I don't work, so no alarm.\n  ","171026":"\n  I was bullied terribly through Elementary and Middle Schools. Among generic insults about my clothes or my mom or being poor, I often got \"Horse Face\" (I have large teeth and an angled jaw and these are things kids don't really grow into until they are older :P ) and \"Bedwetter\" because my last name at the time was Ledbetter and kids LOVE those rhyming insults. So those are probably the ones I hated most.\n  ","171027":"\n  The easier question is \"what junk food could you easily give up\" because I'm kind of terrible about junk food. The answers to MY question are: pork rinds. potato chips. cherry pie. sugar cereal. that about covers it, everything else is awesome.\n  ","171028":"\n  Deborah, cause come on. Prophet, Judge, and Warrior? Eff yeah. Also I like the story of Ezekiel but that's just because I'm blasphemous and am convinced it's ancient alien activity going on.\n  ","171029":"\n  Surprisingly, I do not have a bedtime ritual. I don't really display any ritual behavior right now at all, probably because my brain is still reeling from a recent med switch. I just do things when I am ready to do things.\n  \n  Unless like- brushing my teeth and peeing count as a ritual now.\n  ","171030":"\n  Well... Okay. My husband became a premium member of Mysterious Universe JUST so he could get me the back catalog to listen to, because I didn't want to start listening in the middle. This was several years ago. I think I'm on Season 7? I forget about it most evenings, or am in a music mood, so it's taking me forever. IF I ever get caught up, I would like to listen to my friend Jamie Richter's podcast On Topic, and Kreayshawn and Chippy Nonstop's Lost in Thot, and I think a few supernatural-type podcasts follow me on twitter or whatever, but I have some obsessive\/compulsive issues that prevent me from just picking up in the middle.\n  ","171031":"\n  I know it's supposed to be a really popular name, and I've met plenty of people who know other people named Allison, but honestly, I went to school with 3 other Allisons years ago, and I have two friends who named their daughters Allison, but I don't really know any others.\n  ","171032":"\n  My brain keeps breaking, but as far as things I like, dropped or whatever, I chipped a bong downstem last week.\n  ","171033":"\n  Cheez-it's party mix. I'd pretend it wasn't exciting, but \"party\" is right there in the name.\n  ","171034":"\n  So stylish. The most stylish. Ugh, saying that word more than once grosses me out for some reason. Stylish. What a weird sounding word. Also, for real, not exactly. Probably. Some days I think I am but most days I'm in yoga pants and a sweatshirt not giving a fuck.\n  ","171035":"\n  When my great grandmother was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's, she would often hide the fact that she didn't know what was going on by making a spectacle so that people would laugh and wouldn't remember that she called them the wrong name or got confused about where she was. I remember being a little girl and going to a FANCY restaurant with her and other family members for someone's birthday, and she took bread from the bowl on the table, flattened it out, poked eye holes and a mouth hole in it, and made faces at my sister and I through the bread. I think about that every time I'm somewhere with cloth napkins now :P\n  ","171036":"\n  I grew up with dogs, but I'm probably more of a \"cat person\". I do want to have a pet dog again one day, but not until I'm out of this tiny apartment. A dog and a couple of birds maybe.\n  ","171037":"\n  I felt pained, like most mornings lately. Sacro-Illiac joints are dysfunctional and with withdrawal from Abilify going on and new meds being introduced recently, ALL of my joints hurt but especially those. Makes it hard to get comfortable.\n  ","171038":"\n  I feel like this was more of a statement than a question :P\n  ","171039":"\n  I reckon it's my husband, though we don't celebrate.

Thanks for following, and for thinking I'm potentially interesting :)  TBH you're in for a lot of cat posts.\n  ","171041":"\n  It's always depended on the person. Some relationships are more relaxed or secure, and those sorts of things cause me to feel less jealous, like a 1-2. Some relationships are passionate and a little unstable and those usually cause HUGE amounts of jealousy for me. I'm a bit weird with relationships though, especially bad periods of depression can start leading to relationship OCD for me so that's a factor too I guess.\n  ","171042":"\n  Apparently creating and maintaining meaningful relationships.\n  ","171043":"\n  Growing up in the South, \"putting on your face\" before going out was important to most of the women I knew. As an adult well past that sort of influence, I still do like makeup but I don't feel like it's completely necessary at all times like I used to. It's good to feel like you look your best, and it's fun to try new things, but some days I'd rather just swipe on some mascara and call it good.\n  ","171044":"\n  Hermann Hesse.
