. what i do and what i wear on a day to day basis . who i hang out and who i have grown up around and how . my whole life growing up i played football with the guys on their team . was pretty much the only girl playing . and if there was another girl she would usually quit or only play for one day because she didn t want to keep playing because they would either be too rough or it would be too muddy or she wanted to hang out with the girls . used to tackle and get covered in mud and everything . loved this . i still do this . i fish . i hunt . love working on vehicles . i love to build things and go bike riding and wheeler riding . and at times i do love chilling and being a girl because i m a girl . at the end of the day . yeah i look cute and pretty and girly in some of my pics because i like that too because i am a girl . but being a tomboy does not mean you have to always look like one and always have to act like one . it s how you been raised and what you were raised around . i was raised out on the countryside and out on the bayou . my whole life growing up i was raised around boys and guy friends . girls and other tomboys . we used to wrestle and fight and teach each other how to defend ourselves . jump on trampolines . play street ball and build our own fields and club houses out of things out of trash . sometimes still do this when i have the time . get outside and sometimes just dig a hole just to get dirty . just now i chased my dogs all the way across the yard and got covered in mud . i have to come inside and clean up and now i m laying down because i m cold from the water . but i had a blast . tomboy from the heart . always will be . it s in my roots .","36084":"nope . i have hundreds of girl and guy friends . and we are just friends .

!","36091":"pie can be crunchy . crunch bars . chips . lettuce and carrots and celery ?","36092":"? hey","36093":"you re welcome . but i wouldn t do too many of the gargling stuff . just pick one that you want to do per day . the one that i mostly recommend would have to be the hydrogen peroxide one . you could probably add a little bit more water to it just make sure that the water is warm . super super hot . it will soothe your throat and what i said but just don t add more than cup of water maybe . but you can do the ricola cough drops the one with the medicine that numbs your throat in them . i would take those as your throat hurts . and then spray the chloraseptic continuously get a flavor that you like . i think they have cherry and spearmint and mint and bubblegum in your throat as the day goes so it numbs your throat . suck on cough drops to numb and and mints . then when you come home i would so the step with the honey and tea and bourbon . and then right before you go to sleep i would do the little gargling and stuff but make with the hydrogen peroxide again sure you don t eat or drink and lay down immediately after . the remaining hydrogen peroxide that touched your throat will soothe your throat and make it better . i would try this combination throughout your day of things . it will keep your throat painless and it will help speed up the process of getting better . this is what i do when i have a sore throat and it usually helps . you re more than welcome . i don t like sore throats either so that s why i try to help others when they are sick . i got these remedies from other people by the way they re not just one that i made up .","36094":"? ?","36095":"your words are amazing ! thank you kindly ! you have an amazing dang ! and same back to you also !","36096":"? a house .","36097":"get plenty of rest drink fluids try comforting foods and beverages number one thing to gargle is hydrogen peroxide add just tablespoons , warm water tablespoons mint mouthwash the type of mouthwash that doesn t have alcohol in it tablespoon and a little bit of salt the mix together and gargle x times make sure all of this is warm gargle that and then do not drink or eat for minutes , usually lay down for an hour , maybe take a nap after . this helps to attack the acids that are hurting your throat . will speed uo the sore part process . do not swallow this . usually take this at the beginning of the sore throat and do about three times of day . do not do too much or it may irritate it too much . then you can . . . . gargle with salt water humidify the air where you were at consider lozenges or hard candy helps numb pain get chloraseptic spray helps numb pain take some medications too like benadryl or tylenol warm tea mixed with honey and sometimes people add a little bit of bourbon to it to help numb and soothe throat . any types of salt water . usually warm water with it chamomile tea peppermint baking soda gargle chamomile tea fenugreek marshmallow root licorice root and waaaay waaaaaay more .","36098":"your profile picture is beautiful by the way ! i love your hair . ?","36099":"thanks so much ! i followed you back

they re safe but we all need to work together to make the world a better place so we can live in it . . that s really important . because if the water that were drinking out of the faucet isn t clean then how are we supposed to stay hydrated . besides just going to the store and getting bottled water , what happens if this runs out ? this opportunity ? what happens if a lot of meat starts going bad and then we have to go to the store to buy some but they don t have any ? it s important to hunt and to remember this skill . because sometimes you got to do it to survive . what happens if a small apocalypse does breakout ? we need to go to protect ourselves and help one another . what happens if all the bodies of water become contaminated and we can t go swimming in it at all . then we just can t go swimming anymore . it s important if we make sure that our environment is clean and we take care of it .","36107":"yeah , sometimes i do this . i m in the middle of shopping at the store

love to get alfredo from the pizza places around where i live at . i like to order extra alfredo sauce too ! ? ? ? ?","36121":"ehhhh depends on what level of unsociable you mean . if you don t talk to anyone , that is not healthy . it is good for everyone to be a little social in their life . it helps stretch your communication skills . it helps with your comprehension and handling certain situations also . you do not want to be completely unsocial . cuz i promise you . . . it s not healthy . . . . but if you don t really favor having conversations with people on a daily basis there s nothing wrong with that . you just don t prefer that . and you don t have to do it everyday all day . even calling someone on the phone for minutes is healthy and good for you . but some people are more shy than others . some people just don t like people . but if you are the second one i would honestly try to stretch your social skills when you get the chance . stretching your social skills can do a lot of good for you and your life . it can open good opportunities and certain successes that aren t open to other people that are not as sociable . .","36122":"i love both . i love a warm veggie

okay at least but i know some youtubers that don t even go on their jet skis out there anymore because they barely touch the water and got sick . it can attack your skin and if it gets in your

see any problem in that ? if it s possible then why not let them do it as long as it s not hurting them or anyone else . at the end of the day i think people just need to mind their own business and let people do them . though i don t appreciate people that like to push their views on people that don t like their views . i think everyone s entitled to believe whatever they want . at the end of

straight up being like rude and just say things that are just ugly when you they could just keep it to yourself themselves , that s different there s no need to be that way . unless of course , you see that person about to embarrass themselves then you pull them to the side and talk to them one on one better than embarrassing them in public and going ahead and just doing the complete opposite of what should be done . but you don t need to judge people like as in just because you see someone dressing scary you automatically assume that they might be dangerous or a bad person . that s not always the case because i used to be like that and i was nice i wasn t mean . when people got to know me they saw a different side of what they thought . don t be so quick to judge because judging a book by it s cover one and you go to read it it s a completely different thing . or a name of a song . then you go to listen to it and you actually loving it and it becomes your favorite song . or

outside of you would be cold and you feel that you are cold because it is your skin , the surface of your body that is cold . you do not want to bundle up and you can put a towel on your head but . . . it doesn t really mean it s going to reduce your fever but if you more or less try to drink cold fluids that is getting the inside of your body temperature to go down some . yes i guess sweating out the temperature could be better but honestly sometimes people temperature just keeps getting higher . medications and tylenol and fever reducers or what you should turn to . try to figure out what your body is lacking such as vitamin c . stay hydrated . take showers . but under any circumstances don t bundle up because then you re just making the surface temperature of your skin hot too and that is honestly just making things worse . even though you feel cold does it mean that you are really cold . ex have you ever went into a pool and swim for a good while and it was cold in the pool but your body or your skin adapted to the temperature in the pool with the new you want to the restroom it felt like when you pee it was hot because the inside of you is actually hotter than the surface of your skin . this is a good example of how my statement becomes true and what i said about you feeling like you re cold but you re not really . either your body is the regular temperature or can be hotter . it just all depends . at the end of the day you should do a lot of research if you are sick and you re trying to figure out how to get better or really just visit your doctor and they can help you . and you don t have to do the research or take risks and doing the wrong research and waiting longer to get better .","36392":"? ?","36393":"when they are around , not around . whenever

should have the opportunity to be friends with whoever they want . it just depends on how far they take the friendship with that other person . there are boundaries . you want to make it known that you were in a relationship and that you were not interested in them whatsoever and that all you have to offer is friendship . especially if you were already friends with that person before you met the relationship person , usually there s nothing you have to worry about . but if you see signs of strange activity then something is going on in between them and i would not get involved until you know for sure that they are completely done with any type of relationship type stuff with each other . you re not want to share your man or woman with another human being . no person should be like that unless you agree to it . to try to tell them not to hang out with anyone that is the opposite sex is controlling . . telling them they can t at all . you want . . . your better half to socialize with anyone and everyone and to be friendly to the opposite sex . to respect them . showing that they respect another person like you shows that they will respect you . that s how i feel about it . ex when i see my husband trying to protect a random woman that is being abused i find that a kind act . . and inwhich this has happened before . . . i would want him to keep them safe . i wouldn t want him to ignore the situation . same with me i wouldn t want to ignore the situation but at the same time . . . i must keep myself safe and try to think before i jump it to a certain situations . for ex since seeing a woman getn slapped by somebody regardless of what s going on with the situation i have seen people jump into the situations and stick up for the women . no one should put their hands on another human being unless defense ! we have the ability to talk things out . it never needs to get physical . no need to embarrass one another in public neither . talk . my view on it .","36638":"anything negative usually","36639":"everything and anything that happens in my life i feel turned me into a better person each day . everything happens for a reason","36640":"it s just the amount of people and activities that you do on a daily or weekly basis . i guess it s like it becomes less and less and less it makes you feel more alone . i know someone that literally doesn t have almost no family and only has a few friends but they live far away so they try their very best to talk to her as much as i can and to visit . and at that . for some people it s really hard to get out and do things just by themselves . nowadays you have to be really careful with who you make friends with fran the morning . have a nice people we ll take everything you at home . if you be driving around naked trying to kill you and just try to take your car . rob you for just twenty bucks . it s a crazy world we live in nowadays . as i said you have to be careful","36641":"the amount of

dark brown originally . it is dark brown with highlights . the highlights that i have in my hair are gold light brown and burgundy colors . i like for them to resemble fall colors and indian colors . i just really like those colors they re really pretty and they shine well in the sun . i keep up with my hair very much . i like to straighten it every now and then . i do not blow dry my hair or

pets , but i was never around to raise either of them because when i first met my husband one of them was already a full grown dog and the other one we got while we were together but we were in a long distance relationship and the dog was with him so i was not able to be there because of how far i lived from him but once the dog was about a year old i finally got to move in and live there . ever since then i have been around him and have been raising him . same as the other dog have been raising and taking care of both of them . they re both pitbulls , dogs . ones named dixie and the other one s name is g fred . my husband wants to get one more pitbull and a little dog for me and maybe a cat . we even talked about maybe owning some birds . but we have a roommate , but we aren t going to

something for those kinds of people . i make them feel like completing the other sh when they do that too and they don t do it anymore . i m not a very competitional type person . i just like to try my best and participate . i feel like participating it better than anything . socializing and exercising and trying new things is always a good thing and a part of life","36698":"we really like something different . not the everyday red roses but those are pretty . me for my wedding i had dark pink light pink white and red roses with baby white flowers and a lot of green leaves . i personally really liked that , it was really pretty . i absolutely love tulips . the smell of them is amazing . hadrian s are really nice . baby roses are really nice . i absolutely love magnolias ! magnolia state and living in a magnolia state obviously i would like that . what s the magnolia leaves are so pretty and so are the green leaves that come with them . they re such a strong flour and smell great ! wild flowers are gorgeous . honestly the sweetest flowers for me to get from my husband would be just random wildflowers that he found because i feel like he took the time to think of that idea pullover go and find them cut them and then put them together himself and give them to me . i think that that is so sweet . other girls are probably say different but i m a country cajun gal and again to see my husband go out of his way and do something like that is absolutely adorable , romantic and sweet . chrysanthemum flowers are really pretty . these are usually put in a bouquet to add character . but they still are really pretty by themselves . especially the random color ones . but they can be very expensive . that s why they re usually only added to bouquet because they re expensive . usually only one two or three are added to a bouquet . daisies smell absolutely amazing . carnation . beautiful . orchids dahlia there are so many flowers that you can give a woman . some women don t even like flowers . another flower that s awesome is eternity roses . they lasted very long time but are expensive and people that don t like flowers may actually like these . cuz usually because i don t like flowers is because they die so quickly . this is a good recommendation for people like this . make sure your woman is not allergic to them either ! that might be one reason why they don t like them !","36699":"hello . i m doing good . thanks for asking . i hope everything is going all right for you ?","36700":"just try to work together . be known when you re doing something . say for instance . . . when you re washing the dishes , be like , hey hun , i m going to go and wash the dishes , or when you re done come in the other room and be like , okay ! ? dishes are washed ! i gotchu ! don t say it in an ash way . . . or like an attitudinal way . . . just say that you did it and then move on . if they she wants to be attitudinal about it just be like . . . oh well ! ? at least i did it without being asked . and you can even say that . and keep being like that and they will surely catch on . if not that s a shame . . . they should appreciate that . even if you haven t done it in a while or don t do it a lot . both halfs have parts they have to play in the household . even the kids . kids should have chores . and they don t exactly have to do ones they don t like but they should at least do one that they don t like . try something new . when i was growing up we had to do certain things in the household and i didn t mind because i was helping my mom and stepdad out . say for instance my sister didn t really like vacuuming , so i would vacuum for her . but i didn t really mind vacuuming . and i didn t really like cleaning the bathroom , so my sister would clean the bathroom . and since the vacuuming is not really that big of a job i would also do the clothes . i would pick them up or fold them and she would have fold them or pick them up . if we made dishes we had to clean our own . if we were the last one to drink the tea then we have to make the tea or at least help make it together no . . the woman don t always clean and cook . . the guys want to do that too sometimes . guys like to cook ! and the guys don t always do the carpentry and outside work . sometimes girls like to do this . mix it up . work together more . both do the dishes together sometime or maybe both go outside a new yard work together . or both build something together maybe . or do laundry together you wash and dry them and she told them or the opposite .","36701":"i m doing one right now i m walking on my treadmill . my new year s resolution was to work out more and try to eat a little bit healthier . and to also try to stop biting my nails

between . and . and i own vehicles but i don t really do a lot of the driving . my husband really does . i am not a fan of driving at all . and i would say we probably fill our vehicle out maybe once a week ? maybe twice maybe every two weeks ? it just depends on what we re doing . we do a lot of traveling . we go to louisiana about four or five or six times a year . that s where my mama lives so we go and visit her and my family and friends .","36706":"it s been windy lately and a little bit cold like in the s . no rain no fog no snow . it s been sunny","36707":"do random act of kindness for

school but one class was really hard for me and it was physical science . i don t know if it was just the teacher or what but she would teach and it would be very basic and not very explaining and helpful . especially the people that didn t understand on the first try . honestly i was in freshman here and honestly i feel like she was teaching it at a senior if not college level . i ve literally handed her the test with not a single thing written on it but my name because i didn t understand a single thing on there . and i would pay attention in class and everything . at some point i would just write random letters and numbers because i did not understand anything . i think honestly she thought everyone in the class learned quickly and was fast paced and that was not the case and i think that she should have maybe did more one on one or maybe slow down with the teaching i would have gotten it . the thing about it is when i went home and actually studied it and tried my best and did my research i would complete projects at . but in class she would hurry up through the lesson and i would not understand anything . and when i went to ask her to help me she would make it seem like i was stupid and dumb for not understanding it so i would just stop asking for help because i mean . . . why make someone feel that way ? and makes them not want to ask for help and want to learn . no motivation . at least this is what i remember . i m not fully remembering of the whole thing but i do remember that it was very hard to learn lessons that she taught . but when i would go home and take my time i would make good grades . i think at the end of the year she started to understand how i learned and took her time and helped me and then i ended up passing . i had bad grades all the way through the year until the last semester . then i aced everything .","36714":"no .","36715":"try to look up recipes that have already dairy free items . you would be surprised to how many awesome recipes that are online that don t have any dairy products in them at all . that s what i do . substitutes a good idea is to find vegan type stuff . considering vegans do not eat meat or dairy . following a vegan diet is a very good recommendation . though be careful . an example to this is like instead of regular butter you can find vegan butter . like try to find dairy free alternatives at your local grocery store or even at a whole foods or a place that sells vegan type things another idea for a substitution is unflavored unsweetened non dairy milk for regular milk bake this is a baker s hotline . you can ask questions and they can help you out . i would make sure nothing cost money when you first call . i would definitely not be afraid to call them if you have a question on something .","36716":"yep that s where i got the name from . her name is beautiful and so is she and she has wonderful music .","36717":"that s awesome . i have always loved the twilight saga . me and my friends around me grew up through that","36718":"that is not always the case . also that is your opinion . shoot , nowadays apartments and rental places are a fortune . nobody can pay what they want . they want for rent and more . that s not counting utilities and water and wi fi . then you have to put food on the table and you have your own personal needs as well . plus medical and so on . i honestly appreciate the fact that they have those places available but nobody can pay those prices . but that s just me . and honestly they re probably just trying to keep up the places . so tired of seeing all of these ratings of such horrible places but yet they want to charge so much but they don t want to fix the places up . but the places i am talking about they want they are nice places . they use money to better the places up and to update them .","36719":"i like the name that they gave me .","36720":"very rare creating anything st and being the st because honestly the guessing combination in the world is very high of that thing . but yes it s very possible to create something and you be the first person to ever try it . will we ever know that for sure ? no .","36721":"yes , but in moderation because my stomach doesn t really like it that much . plus i love to bake and milk is a very important ingredient in a lot of the things that i make . a lot of the times i like to drink almond milk . i also really like coconut milk .","36722":"my plans for tomorrow is to just chill out and rest from working .","36723":"jason and my pups did .","36724":"thank you so much ! ? ?

do all the carpentry and plumbing and you have to hire people to fix things and correctly . roofing . . . drywall . . . and so much more . there is a lot of work that comes into managing . that s what that job is . . . is managing . not trying to stick up for your property owner . . . it s just when someone owns a property that s what they are is a manager . i would know this because , i know
