I was headed more towards the Army. But also was looking at the Navy. I have a high respect for the military. I have hundreds of friends that are in the military. Also tons of family. Sometimes I feel bad for the military because of course they have to do what they are told. A lot of them being terrified at some moments. Being away from their family and friends for a long periods of time. Making sacrifices. Risking their lives for us, to keep us safe and I have a huge respect for people that do that. Just recently we had a lot of Army and firefighters go out to Australia and help with the bushfires. We're also trying to help other people. There are many different branches in the military. Many different things that they all do. But the reason why I did not join because I met Jason right around this time when I was going to go in. At the time I wasn't with someone or I think I was with someone but I was not happy... they were not treating me right.. so I felt like something was missing from my life. I wanted something more so I turned to the military. But right before I joined that's when I met Jason all that changed. It made me look at life differently. I wanted a family and to be a mama instead. I chose not to go in and instead be with him. I feel like I chose the right thing. \u2764\n  \n  Are used to write people in the military and everything.

It just depends on how far they take the friendship with that other person. There are boundaries. You want to make it known that you were in a relationship and that you were not interested in them whatsoever and that all you have to offer is friendship. Especially if you were already friends with that person before you met the relationship person, usually there's nothing you have to worry about. But if you see signs of strange activity then something is going on in between them and I would not get involved until you know for sure that they are completely done with any type of relationship type stuff with each other. You're not want to share your man or woman with another human being. No person should be like that unless you agree to it. To try to tell them not to hang out with anyone that is the opposite-sex is controlling.. TELLING THEM THEY CAN'T AT ALL. You want... your better half to socialize with anyone and everyone and to be friendly to the opposite sex. To respect them. Showing that they respect another person like you shows that they will respect you. That's how I feel about it. Ex: When I see my husband trying to protect a random woman that is being abused I find that a kind act.. And inwhich this has happened before... I would want him to keep them safe. I wouldn't want him to ignore the situation.\n  \n  Same with me I wouldn't want to ignore the situation but at the same time... I must keep myself safe and try to think before I jump it to a certain situations. For ex: since seeing a woman getn slapped by somebody regardless of what's going on with the situation I have seen people jump into the situations and stick up for the women.

Ever since then I have been around him and have been raising him. Same as the other dog have been raising and taking care of both of them. They're both pitbulls, dogs. Ones named Dixie and the other one's name is G-Fred.\n  \n  My husband wants to get one more pitbull and a little dog for me and maybe a cat. We even talked about maybe owning some birds.

Socializing and exercising and trying new things is always a good thing and a part of life\n  ","41995":"\n  We really like something different. Not the everyday red roses but those are pretty. Me for my wedding I had dark pink light pink white and red roses with baby white flowers and a lot of green leaves. I personally really liked that, it was really pretty. I absolutely love tulips. The smell of them is amazing. Hadrian's are really nice. Baby roses are really nice. I absolutely love Magnolias! Magnolia State and living in a magnolia state  obviously I would like that. What's the Magnolia leaves are so pretty and so are the green leaves that come with them. They're such a strong flour and smell great! Wild flowers are gorgeous. Honestly the sweetest flowers for me to get from my husband would be just random wildflowers that he found because I feel like he took the time to think of that idea pullover go and find them cut them and then put them together himself and give them to me. I think that that is so sweet. Other girls are probably say different but I'm a country cajun gal and again to see my husband go out of his way and do something like that is absolutely adorable, romantic and sweet.\n  \n  Chrysanthemum flowers are really pretty. These are usually put in a bouquet to add character. But they still are really pretty by themselves. Especially the random color ones. But they can be very expensive. That's why they're usually only added to bouquet because they're expensive. Usually only one two or three are added to a bouquet.\n  \n  Daisies smell absolutely amazing.\n  \n  Carnation. Beautiful.\n  \n  Orchids\n  \n  Dahlia\n  \n  There are so many flowers that you can give a woman. Some women don't even like flowers. Another flower that's awesome is eternity roses. They lasted very long time but are expensive and people that don't like flowers may actually like these. Cuz usually because I don't like flowers is because they die so quickly. This is a good recommendation for people like this. Make sure your woman is not allergic to them either! That might be one reason why they don't like them!\n  ","41996":"\n  Hello. I'm doing good. Thanks for asking. I hope everything is going all right for you?\n  ","41997":"\n  Just try to work together. Be known when you're doing something. Say for instance... When you're washing the dishes, be like, \"Hey hun, I'm going to go and wash the dishes,\" or when you're done come in the other room and be like, \"Okay! ? Dishes are washed! I gotchu!\" Don't say it in an ash way... or like an attitudinal way... Just say that you did it and then move on. If they(she) wants to be attitudinal about it just be like ... Oh well! ? At least I did it without being asked. And you can even say that. And keep being like that and they will surely catch on. If not that's a shame... They should appreciate that. Even if you haven't done it in a while or don't do it a lot. Both halfs have parts they have to play in the household. Even the kids. Kids should have chores. And they don't exactly have to do ones they don't like but they should at least do one that they don't like. Try something new. When I was growing up we had to do certain things in the household and I didn't mind because I was helping my mom and stepdad out. Say for instance my sister didn't really like vacuuming, so I would vacuum for her. But I didn't really mind vacuuming. And I didn't really like cleaning the bathroom, so my sister would clean the bathroom. And since the vacuuming is not really that big of a job I would also do the clothes. I would pick them up or fold them and she would have fold them or pick them up. If we made dishes we had to clean our own. If we were the last one to drink the tea then we have to make the tea or at least help make it together & no.. the woman don't always clean and cook.. The guys want to do that too sometimes. Guys like to cook! And the guys don't always do the carpentry and outside work. Sometimes girls like to do this. Mix it up. Work together more. Both do the dishes together sometime or maybe both go outside a new yard work together. Or both build something together maybe.

I don't know if it was just the teacher or what but she would teach and it would be very basic and not very explaining and helpful. Especially the people that didn't understand on the first try. Honestly I was in freshman here and honestly I feel like she was teaching it at a senior if not college level. I've literally handed her the test with not a single thing written on it but my name because I didn't understand a single thing on there. And I would pay attention in class and everything. At some point I would just write random letters and numbers because I did not understand anything. I think honestly she thought everyone in the class learned quickly and was fast-paced and that was not the case and I think that she should have maybe did more one-on-one or maybe slow down with the teaching I would have gotten it. The thing about it is when I went home and actually studied it and tried my best and did my research I would complete projects at 100%. But in class she would hurry up through the lesson and I would not understand anything. And when I went to ask her to help me she would make it seem like I was stupid and dumb for not understanding it so I would just stop asking for help because I mean... Why make someone feel that way? And makes them not want to ask for help and want to learn. No motivation. At least this is what I remember. I'm not fully remembering of the whole thing but I do remember that it was very hard to learn lessons that she taught. But when I would go home and take my time I would make good grades. I think at the end of the year she started to understand how I learned and took her time and helped me and then I ended up passing.

My most favorite gift was being able to go to South Louisiana and spend time with family and friends. I even fed my dogs good on Christmas Eve and Christmas. They got treats! Me and my husband popped fireworks on New Year's and had a blast. Thanksgiving dinner was really good and so was Christmas. My mom cooked gumbo when I was in Louisiana and some potato salad.

Though it would not be right if they treated everyone awful but me. A good example is some boyfriends or girlfriends are mean to everyone and anyone around them but the person that they are with. This is wrong. They should be friendly to the friends and family and that are around both of them. Another example is just a girl that doesn't like other girls and only want her girlfriend to be friends with her and no one else.l. This is not right. You shouldn't be so controlling of someone. Not make it seem like you're trying to choose their friends or the amount of people that they should hang out with.\n  \n  I think this is the right answer to your question.

I definitely I think you should look up at least 10 or songs and listen to them. I think that you would probably like a few. If you would like to know if you songs that are really good by then let me know and I will list them.\n  \n  PVRIS is really good. Their old music is very very good. Their new music is a little dark but is good. I do not recommend for really young people. Paranormal like music.\n  \n  Evanescence is really good. I'm sure you've heard their music.\n  \n  Flyleaf is good. If you would like me to lose some songs out let me know.\n  \n  While growing up Avril Lavigne was my idol. My most favorite singer of all time. My favorite music by her is her old albums under my skin and let go. Every single one of those songs on those albums are amazing. For over two decades I have loved her. I recommend her to you. And her old music.\n  \n  Paramore. I'm sure you have heard of them. Their first two albums are amazing as their albums have gotten newer their music has changed but it's still good.\n  \n  Against the current. A good YouTube group that makes really nice covers. They also have their own band now and are doing very well. They sound good.\n  \n  Seether\n  \n  Breaking Benjamin\n  \n  Linkin Park\n  \n  Creed, if you would like me to tell you a few songs by them let me know. But they are very good.\n  \n  Avenged Sevenfold\n  \n  Papa Roach\n  \n  9 Finger Death Punch\n  \n  Jumpsuit Apparatus\n  \n  This is a little swerving off of the music topic but I really like Becky G she has really good Latina music and English music. I like Ariana Grande. Zara Larsson. Ryan Upchurch and Katie Noel. Front of church is country rap and so is Katie Noel. Zara Larsson makes really good music. I think you would like it. Sassy and sweet music. Obviously you've heard of Ariana Grande. A lot of people don't like her music and there's a lot of people that do. I like it for its sassiness.\n  \n  I love country music so anyting country I like. Country rock. R&B. Metal and gospel metal. Rock. Pop. And more\n  ","42910":"\n  I love the 13th here.
