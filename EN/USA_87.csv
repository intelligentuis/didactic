   Do you think the UK Government has gone to far this time by making it ILLEGAL people to have se× with anybody they don't live with? 😮 With current rules stating that people can only meet others from outside their own household in outdoor spaces, surely such laws are just going to be ridiculed? 🙈

  I think all lives matter. Even people going there are risking their lives for the cause. Having the movement just shows segregation even more. I've even had people say that white lives dont matter. We all do! I get how the focus is on the crimes committed but in the end we all do matter. Everyone is standing together. Not all cops are bad, not all *insert race* are bad either.

  My happiness wouldn't depend on you though. I wish guys would stop saying crap like this. Like that last guy who got mad since he didn't get my IG so I was destined to be forever alone 🤣🤣🤣

  You wouldn't even make the list of possible candidates especially with how you've acted towards me. I keep saying no and then you basically threaten me that you'd come to the us for a good time with me... just no
  "

   i m asking about sharesome

  Easily lol
  
  The fragile masculinity is showing.

  Really now???
  "
466832,"
   but why did u call me a weak guy 🙄🙄🙄 i am upset☹
  ","
  Saying you'd lick me slowly is creepy especially when not going to ever happen. Vanilla even
  
  I'd rather have a dom or switch.
  "
466833,"
   what is sharesome?
  ","
  It's kind of like onlyfans but you don't exactly need to pay people? There's coins and other stuff though.
  "
466834,"
   come on naah, if u r single then whats problem?
  ","
  You are the problem.
  
  Not every girl needs to entertain you when you have the itch to be dirty.
  "
466835,"
   did u ejaculated today due to this conversation?

  No because of sharesome and turned on.
  
  This weak guy doesn't do it for me lol

   ok i will leave u alone, but prior to leave i want to know little more about ur boyfriend maxwell 😉

  He's flesh toned and likes going places. Likes baths too. I don't need to feed him. He doesn't talk back or lie to me. Decent sized. Amazon handled him with care. I think the birthday is coming up. Suction cup.
  "
466838,"
   😍😍😍 omg u know my name..❤

  Because you are annoying and keep sending me messages to talk with your name attached and also anonymously.

  What
  "
466841,"
   so Maxwell is ur hubby name?
  ","
  Has anyone ever married their d!ldo?
  
  I'm single.
  "
466842,"
   Seriously?? That's so unhealthy! It annoys me so much! Why people think they have a right to even have an opinion on anyone else's body is beyond me, let alone to tell people to go to such an unhealthy and unrealistic weight.
  ","
  They probably thought I weighed more but yes. Fucked up regardless. Agreed 👏👏
  "
466843,"
   I really don't get what it is with some of the anons on this site who feel the need to just be assholes!
  ","
  Neither do I. Someone earlier literally told me to lose 100 more pounds which would make me 80 pounds of nothingness in the end 🙃 I'd then be ""good looking"" to them. Like they had a shot to begin with...If someone can't really see it now then they don't deserve me at goal weight either. That would definitely not be 80 pounds either! 118-125 like a normal human, thanks. Maybe even 130 depending how that looks. They act like it happens overnight. Even people who go the surgery route don't have killer bodies straight away. So sick of people lol

  No. Only did one. Might do more ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  Just me and Maxwell 👍
  "
466848,"
   Do you think you are good looking?
  ","
  5-7 at best
  
  Just because you don't think I am doesn't mean you need to send me mean crap about it. Weight doesn't come off instantly. It's more medical for me too and y'all are still asses regardless. Says more about you than it does me.
  "
466849,"
   please answer me
  ","
  I was a little busy 😈
  "
466850,"
   How often do you cry?

   I do not think you have experience with real relationship.  The way you speak about these things show this.
  ","
  They were still relationships regardless of what you think lol
  
  Why should I sugar coat relationships that weren't right for me? Especially with the 2nd one mentioned.
  
  I dont see you sharing anything about your own relationships. You wont even say how.. just keep going around in circles and mouthing off. You weren't there to know what any of them were like.
  
  Yes, that one was young but still counts.
  
  You dont know what I've learned from them or anything either.

   at age of 7 this is not relationship this is just playmate. maybe you are saying like joke way. maybe for you relationship is just like friend and you consider boyfriend.
  ","
  Uh no. That's dumb. I dont mistake friends for boyfriends regardless if they were a BOY lol that would be like saying that I'm dating all the guys on here when I'm indeed very single lol
  
  If he was just a friend then why did we ask eachother out? Have a title even at a young age? Friends dont exactly do that. He was my first real crush and we dated. Why so mad over this?
  
  Are you saying that the person I spent 2 years with was also just a friend? Rofl. You are dumb. Or that the guy who left me for his ex was also just a friend? They've all had titles, pal.
  
  What is a relationship to you? S*x? People can be single and still have s*x too. Doesn't mean it's a legit relationship.

  My brother asking for money to my dad because his WIFE racked up her credit card. Rofl like no. Dont be a pos. He knows how much money my dad has atm, knows why he needs the money and still asks.. like dude.. dad isn't responsible for your wives credit card or yours. Meanwhile they keep going to the country club and stuff like that. Maybe stop spending money on unnecessary things? Cut back.  Not use the card. He asked for a large amount of money too...
  
  He always does this crap when he knows people have money too. Done it to dad countless of times, to my sister. Even me before. Atleast the other reasons were legit.. this is just stupidity at its finest.

What is the pettiest thing to take after a breakup? The microwave? All the remotes? All the shoes? The cat? All the chairs? All the forks and spoons? What's your choice for laughs?
  ","
  I guess microwave as ours is still broken. Shoes seems the oddest out of those.. like why would I keep theirs?? O.o the only benefit of that would be if I was into girls and we had the same size feet 🤣 even then I'd probably be too nice and not hoard their shoes..
  
  I never lived with someone I've dated. I can't imagine wanting to keep anything like those. It would depend on whose house it was or blended.. maybe the bed if it was a good one but I'd prob feel awkward about that too. Idk man lol I also wouldn't take stuff for ""laughs"". I'd be mature about the situation. Wouldn't need to do things out of spite. If they wanted out then let them? Obviously If it was a marriage, that would hit harder. Still don't think I'd do b!itchy things tho

  I liked my hair stylist Becky from Massachusetts. She always did my hair good. Nice to talk with. Didn't push you with talking either. Just made you feel comfortable. A few years older. Tattoos. Her hair was always different when I'd see her XD
  
  Shopper can be a bit different. I like Alexa Chung, Rihanna, Samantha Maria from YouTube, thrifters anonymous from YouTube. More into street style looks.

I think he read off the wrong street name? Idk wasn't paying much attention after that. Like clearly not the right people. Even if they rented the place, pretty sure the names of the tenants would be discussed instead of just those people he was asking about. Wasn't about to let some 40-50 year old guy in either even if had the right names. They would have mentioned something if was expecting someone to come here.

  I think it would be better. Know more of their quirks, how they'd be to live with. No surprises before marriage. It's just more things you learn about the person.

I had one I knew I wanted but as I was sitting there typing it in I had the idea that we'd always be friends and ended up writing a stupid quote about that instead of what I originally planned -_- I feel stupid when I think of that 🤣
  
  I haven't talked to two of them since after we graduated. And the other one I'm still in contact with but it's been a tad rocky as she kind of cut me off randomly. We talked a few days ago. I was actually surprised that she wrote back. Other times she would just ignore the messages if I did try reaching out.

  1. Kind of. Always seems happy to see me. We never dated but played house with and married so kind of 50/50 on
  
  2. Nah. I think he's married? Idk has a kid. Haven't seen in years
  
  3. I'll pass. Wasted enough on him lol wasn't really my type. Wanted to feel special, be with someone. Wrong person for the job!
  
  4. He's dead so I don't see that happening. We also barely began. He went back to his ex. Not sure if they stayed together. Been dead for a few years now. Not quite the type I usually liked either.
  
  5. Among new ones

  I think I read about that before o.o not sure if 100% true. I'm sure not everyone would be the same? Just like all period symptoms could be different. Hormones can effect a lot of things.

  They were renting out my sister's other house, those people just moved out.  He's painting the kitchen cabinets white. My mom repainted all the doors upstairs and downstairs. She was supposed to do the cabinets but purposely messed up and my sister ""fired"" her from that. She was very happy haha
  
  It had tiles before but my sister had the idea to do a cement type look with a finish over it. They are putting in some laminate wood flooring.

   Do you think 60% of people can find the right partner that both sides are satisfied with? You are so optimistic. Why are you so optimistic?
  ","
  Just wondering what happened to them :p
  
  I don't think love should be a percentage or a stupid statistic. People are real, not a number. Things happen, good or bad. Math isn't always involved in partnerships. It's those two people, not others. I see the big picture, not a number. A number doesn't guarantee happiness with the person. Not every relationship will be the right one for you. Trial and error can occur too. All a learning experience. Some might even feel like they found the right person but too predisposed and scared of that knowledge. Who knows. For shits and giggles..  maybe 45-50% find the ""right"" person. Nobody really knows until they give it a try.

   yes you have to be able to divorce your emotion from the situation. become mechanical like a machine for the good of the ""patient"" i learned this when i took care of my dad. he ceased to be my father in a way. something flipped. responsibility beckoned and i can never refuse to answer when it does.

   to do this you have to be a killer. that does not mean a bad thing but you have to have that trait in you to take a life. its not easy on so many levels and its even hard to imagine without it actually happening. when you are in the midst of this its something just awful.

  ","
  Eh. Nothing has happened 🤣 literally talked in the room. The gyno lady didn't want to be responsible for giving me the metformin for my pcos anymore so shipped me off to him lol
  
  The first time; He basically went over what pcos was. My numbers. About certain things that could help. Talked to him about doing keto which he brings up as well
  
  Had to do bloodwork sometime and my stress level was high and think estrogen was low? So had to do the pee test. We went over that information which was then normal ranges..  my numbers went down. He wanted me to do an MRI incase there was a reason for not getting my periods. Luckily, I already had one on file so he could look at that instead of redoing it. Talked about the gyno and bc which I just mentioned how I didn't really see the point afterwards. They've been regular since getting them. Well technically my last one was 10 days late and this one was a week early but it is better instead of working while on my period.

  Idk. My next endo appointment is in June but that should be interesting because I haven't done what was asked of me 🤣

  She's switched to lowcarb more. Added potatoes, bananas, mangoes and some other things in. She's had days where they've gone to like 5 different fast food places to get her favorites 🤣
  
  Ended up failing the 1 hour glucose test and retested at the 3 hour limit. Gestational diabetes which she wasn't happy about. Kind of makes sense since has pcos as well but the opposite symptoms of mine. Hormones in overdrive.
  
  She's definitely still been wanting to eat healthy the whole time. Sometimes forgets to eat. Nesting like 99% of the time she's been pregnant. Making our mom and her husband crazy 🤣
  
  She's kind of keto again but a few cheats like the mango and  other stuff at times. Atleast she knows what to do and not just learning to eat that way. Would be a nightmare lol

  The summer can be hot af. Already had some triple digits then cooled off to 90s.

  If I had to pick a climate like this.. think I'd rather have California somewhere. Miss the ocean. There's lakes here atleast.

  I'm not the one acting all defensive since someone doesn't want to talk elsewhere. It's always the same memo with guys on here. You don't get what you want so have to call someone names. It's like the guy who called me a duff because I told him I wasn't interested. Now I'm apparently crazy since I don't want to put up with guy's shit. We haven't even talked here.. so what makes you entitled to know other personal social media? What cant you say here  that you cant say there?
  
  Now you will A. Apologize and be all I'm not like that. Who hurt you bullshit. While still trying to get a username. Making me feel like the bad person for not talking with you.
  
  If this makes me crazy, then good! Atleast I trust my gut. If a guy gets mad at you for simple things then that's NOT the kind of friendship I need in my life.

  "
469527,"
   how would you feel if your date rolled up to your place in a limo, treats you to a rooftop dinner accompanied by a harpist playing music, surprises you with a personal firework show and then a helicopter ride around the city?
  ","
  That would be cool.
  
  However, they don't need to go through all that trouble. It would feel like a dream instead of an actual person. I'd feel like I wouldn't get the chance to know them with all the distractions in the way. Being flashy over money isn't really a turn on either. Even if the dude was rich, I'd rather him act normal instead of spending money at whim just because he can. Cool date.. but who is he as a person? What brings him joy? Why is he trying to impress me so bad? Does he do the exact same date with everyone? Why a harp? It's just all overkill to me.

   Hi, was just wondering have you ever gone through a period in your life where you significantly increased your tolerance to alcohol  through sheer over indulgence in it? 😳 If so, can you you tell me if stopping/cutting back for a bit is enough to decrease the tolerance to pre heavy drinking times??
  ","
  Nah, i don't drink much to begin with. Very rarely drink. Anywhere from 1-3 drinks when I do. I don't drink to get drunk.
  
  I've only had one drink during quarantine. A margarita. Hot day and was hanging out by the pool.. sounded good lol
  
  You can definitely train yourself to cut back, switch to different drinks etc

  No. That's awful. People shouldn't cheat if the relationship isn't going well. It shouldn't be a part of a relationship. Making it normalized is a shitty attitude towards relationships. That shouldn't be the end goal or something to aspire to in a relationship.

   Has 2020 been a good year for people who make memes in your opinion?

  Kind of sick of those accounts that are all get me to 4 million memes without ads... most are just freaking repeats over and over again and aren't original. But yes, it seems to be very good for those people, especially if making money off it. They don't really have no excuse to not post right now? Also hate the comments that are all ""you stole this from me"" and then they say it wont happen again including some type of diss.

  Putting yourself out there.. making things happen, creating happy moments that aren't in the cards? Not everything is fate or a coincidence? Reactions to certain things. Just because someone is happy doesn't mean its because of fate. There's usually effort involved.  Not everything is handed to you or fated.

  Depends more on the context. It should be split 50/50 in my opinion. If it was just about one person then I don't think that's real love, could be damaging. I don't want a robot. Why can't the person do things for themselves at times? Seems like the effort on making the relationship work is only on one person ie making him happy and you miserable depending on what the ""everything"" is.

  The last time I seen her was 5th grade and I didn't even know she went to the same school since didn't have any classes together. We both happened to need to go the bathroom that day. I was washing my hands and she ended up mentioning all that 🤣 then the bell rang and never saw her again.

  Well there was Austin which I've known since a baby and his cousins but I didn't have to do any of the work. He played with my barbies and stuff ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I've helped babysat them but without the real responsibility.
  
  I've only held one of my nephews when he was a baby. Wasn't in AZ at the time with the other nephew.
  
  Probably the screaming.. cant forget that :p
  
  Jack should be exciting! Atleast I have more practice than my sister does. I even had to do CPR in school with dummies including the baby ones. She even tried picking this up with one hand instead of two... fake doll to help with the dogs to get used to it and whatnot :p

  My coach has been a little annoying lately. First off, she only shoutouts her friends and new people that she finds. Not anyone else who does the work. Made it seem like only people who eat too many calories can be fat.. didn't take into account people with actual medical conditions. Today there was something about keto when all ""diets"" can be messed up. Just because she did low carb and missed carbs doesn't mean it's a fact that it's bad. No diet is the ""end all"". There's lots that can be bad for people. I don't think it's fair just going after one diet.. why not all? Just because it works for some doesn't mean you should crap on it. I accept everyone's diets and wouldn't go after anyone because of it. Just seems rude lately. All about getting money instead of helping people too.

  How? I said I'm a calm person in a general way. You mentioned crying randomly. I wasn't crying. Never cried for no reason or when calm. When I do cry its because I'm upset/sad over something. I haven't taken drugs when upset to calm down when feeling things. I listen to music, breathe, write, cry or whatever else for comfort in those times.

  No. I haven't. I wouldn't do that to someone. I  would have the balls to cancel on them before it got to standing someone up.
  
  The last person had about three or more days to find someone else. Kind of a blessing that I listened to myself since they got mad. Pretty sure they blocked me too. It was just a really shady feeling inside and listened to it. I was also sharing more whereas they just kept mentioning a date over and over again until I agreed.

  I don't like the ""get him"" message. He's a person, not a prize to be won or in an ownership way. Plus, cheating or breaking up in general can be a hard thing to process. Shouldn't really wish that on people. I've known him way longer but I don't feel any entitlement due to that. It's just it is what it is type of deal.. wanting him happy even if not with me. I've always believed in that. Even when I found out other things, I was still happy for him.
