   Is our life already destined? Can we escape fate?
  ","
  A human lies in the consequences of their actions and decisions. indirectly controls a destiny by actions and decisions. One action or decision has a consequence that leads to another action or decision. fate is basically opportunities place right in front of us. Decision Making! we can control it. you can either let fate lead you through life or you can shape your own destiny.

  Everything is nothing means that actually nothing is really important in life. We are the ones giving something or someone importance. you are the decision maker, you decide what your priorities are going to be.
  
  Then, nothing is everything, it means, for me, that as I said, you are the decision maker, so you are the one choosing your priorities and your priorities is actually showing who you are and what matters for you it actually shows everything.
  
  So long story short, you are the one who will choose what is important for you and what not and by making this choice, you become the creator of your life.

  ","
  Good Things: Its a very secure job. if you get tired of one nursing job, you can transfer to the other easily. you learn a lot about people. However difficult a shift might be, you certainly don‚Äôt go home feeling that you didn‚Äôt achieve anything worthwhile. Once you get some experience as a nurse, you‚Äôre likely to be in demand wherever you go.
  
  Worse things would be: Working Weekends, Exposure to ever germ, virus, body fluids in existence. Being used as a punching bag by angry patients and families. following proper nursing procedure and providing customer satisfaction, so much balancing between the two. professional development and lack of control over workload.

  This is a very tricky question. yes and no. fate is co existent with free will but it depends on the person and how they look at the two. if people think fate is basically everything that is pre-determined then it cannot coexist with free will. free will is basically action, which is where ""control your narrative"" comes into play. the freedom to act, the freedom to speak, the freedom to think. every action and all of its consequences can be individually determined and that the results of those actions is entirely dependent upon the choice that is made. then it cannot coexist with Fate. one can believe that an end is fated to be, while at the same time believing that we are free to choose a path that is chosen by free will.

  Well it is very sad and unfortunate that older consoles ps4/xbox one is having that issue. they should have tested more on those. pc however is doing great. they are providing the updates in a timely manner and taking responsibility for their mistakes. the witcher 3 was a mess but it got fully polished in a matter of a few months which are the same devs who came up with cyberpunk. some people is not patient about it, but some devs waits years until something gets fixed so. I have high hopes that it will loose the hate just like the witcher.

  ","
  I was all for it until he made a comparison of ""AC Valhalla"" which is a different genre.
  
  The game came out almost two weeks ago and has already gotten 4 updates for pc and console to fix bugs. not including the additional ones coming out this week, next month and in February.
  
  Honestly these are just self entitled people that want things right this moment in life and it simply can't happen like that.
  
  Here are some examples: DayZ, No Mans Sky, The Dreaded ""fallout 76"" Fiasco. Final Fantasy XIV online has been out for years now and still to this day didn't fix all of the issues of what is wrong with the games. but people wants to moan and complain about an issue they are having for not even 2 weeks? lol
  
  Compare those to a game that has been out almost 2 weeks ago in which updates has been provided in a quick manner compare to most games of today. people just needs to chill and get some fresh air. all these threats of ""lawsuit"" or threats towards ""bodily harm"" is childish in my opinion.

   Why in most cases, does when a man cheat on a woman, the woman blames the other female? ü§î
  ","
  The Feminine Burden. its been happening since ""adam and eve"" days. finger-pointing is baked into our history and culture. every time the woman is made to be responsible, it also implies that the guys are merely helpless pawns in the situation with no culpability for their actions. but everyone has a brain, sure the other woman may or may not know about the guy's ""current relationship"" but the guy should put 1 and 1 together being that other ""1"" his g/f or wife and be honest and true with her. if the guy wants to cheat then he shouldn't be in a relationship. if the woman tries to do something knowing that the person is married then she is no better since it would be considered ""homewrecker"" male or female isn't the winner in this, either way why be in a relationship to begin with if you gonna cheat.

  love is when you care about a person so much that they hold the special place in your heart. Sexual desire is not love, it's lust, it's wanting to procreate for the sake of procreating. Passion is any powerful or compelling emotion or feeling, as love or hate. strong amorous feeling or desire; love; ardor. strong sexual desire; lust. so in short terms love is completely different from sexual desires, but passion actually works in both.

   How can you judge someone you don‚Äôt know personally?
  ","
  Depends on what exactly that you are ‚Äòjudging‚Äô.
  
  If you see a person living at the homeless shelter I won't be judging that because I have no idea why they are homeless to begin with because it could be for any reason.
  
  If someone says something that I don‚Äôt understand, and I don‚Äôt know why they said it. I‚Äôm not going to judge the motive because I have no idea what their motive is. maybe they don't know what they said was wrong.
  
  But a persons actions I will judge upon when it comes to insults or trying to bring people down because its wrong.

  No. let me tell you the reasons why. #1. it made gold on PC meaning that it is fully polished and ready to go. #2 they should be already done by the time next week comes up after testing on the new gen consoles. #3 CDPR went all in with the advertisements and WWE already had a sponsorship by cyberpunk on their Survivor Series ppv. #4 they are past the point of no return. when you factor in The marketing, the distribution and the holiday timetable. plus CDPR does not want to miss the entire Christmas season from a sales perspective. the holiday timetable alone all points to December 10th being the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù date of release.

   what is the best savings rate you can get right now?
  ","
  Depends on the bank. My bank for example has a 1.75% annual percentage yield. So every $6,000 a person has saved up in the account, would be $100 each per year because it builds up interest. There are some annual percentage that are higher than that but that's at like the top tier Banks.

   thats impressive. what ultimately made you decide to focus on that specialty? and the people you treat, what are the most common reasons they seek out a nutrition specialist such as yourself?
  ","
  Let's just say I had a couple of close calls in regards to health. The people were so nice that treated me. So one day I wanted to help out others the same way they helped out me. The most common reasons is due to not getting enough nutrients in their system or certain vitamins. Diets, eating healthier and ect. But lately I've just been dealing with covid patients since I'm cross trained as a critical care nurse.

866451,"
   oh cool. what made you leave when you did and what prompted the comeback? also when you came back was anyone you knew still around?
  ","
  Well pretty much the pandemic made me came back lol. Besides video games, during my free time I wanted to do something else to pass the time, so I figure asking and answering questions would be one way in coping my sanity. unless my friends are under different accounts, which I get the feeling some are, then I have no clue who anybody is at this point. But you know what they say ""small world"" so I'm sure I'll run into somebody I know.

  Absolutely. Money doesn't buy happiness.
  "
866459,"
   How do you know you‚Äôre not crazy and just hallucinating your whole life?
  ","
  oh that's pretty simple. If you are hallucinating then you're doing it out of confidence. Other people may view you being hallucinated out of this reality yet you're engaged in a new reality which they cannot understand except you and chose to accept this new reality. It's that inner experience, within a world, a society how Insanity was created in them. Fear is an illusion, and that is what causes hallucinations. But beyond that fear somewhere down the road is the truth. Being crazy has its emotions, actions, feelings. People who does unthinkable hatred, crimes and mischief. Which leads to a next question, what is a choice from there? Living in fear and staying crazy? Or accepting those fears to find the truth and finding the wisdom in the heart? For any experience to occur in life there must be a choice first understand it or not, even if you find a reason for why things happen the way they happen. It will not change anything in reality because things are the way they are, what matters is your choice.

   If one were to experience how it'd be to live a typical day in your life, what would they most likely be thinking once that day was over? Do you think they'd be able to take something valuable from it? üõåü•™üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüöòüììüõÄüèã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíª
  ","
  I think most people these days just lives their life one day at a time and don't worry about the future. I'm sort of in limbo when it comes to that. a day is just a day, but I want to make that day as great as possible looking forward ahead to the other days and hoping the same results.

  It depends.
  
  If talking about a happy ending for ""happily ever after for everyone"" it's pretty much impossible in real life because no one will be forever happy for their entire life, add ""everyone"" to that- even more unlikely to occur.
  
  But if a ""happy ending"" like ""the ending was happy"" then absolutely. For instance when a wedding happens and they drive off feeling happy, the event (wedding) ends with them happy, therefore ""happy ending"" or in a movie the heroes win, it's usually considered a ""happy ending""

  Friendship is something that should bring one another up.
  
  I don't have many friends right now (was isolated via manipulation) but I'm slowly opening up to new people for friends.
  
  Reason I would stop being friends with someone now is if they're toxic, make me super uncomfortable, and/ or I spot a few red flags.

  For entertainment-based social media (ex. YouTube, Wattpad, TikTok, etc.) YouTube and Wattpad are definitely up top on the list in a tie. Wattpad because I write a whole bunch of stuff for my own entertainment and it helps me pass the time and YouTube because I love the animation work by other artists in subbed to ^^

  Written Works:
  
  For the upcoming revamp of my Truth of the Beast's Heart trilogy:
  
  I would have to say Sapphire, actually. I rarely ever seem to have any main characters as my favorite, whether I'm enjoying content of others or with my own. I mean Kayla used to be my favorie with the original and the first plot revamp.. but after the last revamps and the current one, Sapphire has taken up that spot. She has to fight to believe in herself and in her own abilities despite everything that she was told about herself being ""lesser than"" by her father. I can't say more, again, for spoiler purposes but she's truly a gem.

  You probably expected things like museums/nature sights, etc., but for me it was a childhood friend's grave. I've never been the same since they died, nor the same after visiting their grave.
  
  It's a hard subject to get into, but simply put at their death I was filled with loss, anger, frustration, guilt, and just overall sadness. I was 11. People your age at that point don't just drop from the world, you know?
  
  But I visited their grave for the first time a few years ago. It gave me a bit of peace. The grave was covered with nicely-rooted grass, the gravestone was weathered ever so slightly, the plastic flower vase was no longer shiny and new. It had been some time, the world continued onward and it was time for me to join with it, no longer be trapped, laying in the past wishing things to have been different.

  Yes. Absolutely.

   Why is it so hard for ppl to apologize?
  ","
  There's a lot of reasons why, many people have different reasons. Some were raised never to show weakness and view apologizing as one. Some feel they need to prove themselves and if they apologize it means admitting they were wrong at some point, and in their mind that takes some ""points""(for a lack of a better word) away from them. Sometimes apologizing means submission (forced to apologize to a classmate type thing) and that's not fun for anyone.
  
  Some are embarrassed when they're wrong, some just really believe they were in the right- even if they actually aren't.
  
  Everyone has trouble apologizing at least in one point in their life, all for many different reasons. Everyone's different and dealing with their own set of walls preventing them forward.

  Mixed. I have relatives that hunt but they only take down one buck a season, so they aren't greedy. But then their are the people that will hunt as many as possible and kill the natural predators that depend on them (like wolves) so they can have more for themselves.

  1-2 ""Common rooms,"" (Ex. living room, den, etc.) I could go with one for a main living room, but a second one for entertainment like games wouldn't be bad.

   Do you have any advice for people starting out on youtube?
  ","
  1: Prevent burning out! find a schedule that works for you and if it turns out not reasonable- remember the earlier you change it the better! Don't wait until you have 100 subs then decide to tone back on video rate. (But if something happens later on the effects the ability to keep up- the earlier the better still stands!)
  
  2: When you get the mean comments, just delete them! If they
  
  keep appearing from the same person don't be afraid to BLOCK THEM! There's nothing wrong in
  
  protecting yourself! Also there's been an increase in s*x channel bots in small channels. Just report & delete.
  
  3: Figure out what you want to do for the channel or if you know, just go! First few videos you may feel a bit awkward or scared. But the awesome thing of starting from scratch is you get practice time before you get traction- you'll be a lot more comfortable by then!
  
  4. A mistake (imo) that I see when a channel changes to something else (say going from reactor to gamer) is announcing it. Slowly merge- don't announce! Subs won't hop off and you'll have an easier time with the YT algorithm with gaining subs interested in the new content as the previous ones leave. The higher the sub amount the quicker the rate of new subs get. Once you hit 100 you're usually set! Just be sure to do your best to keep up the same schedule you've been using.
  
  5: ALLOW yourself mental breaks as needed!! One thing I recommend is to make an extra video every now and then (not all at once to prevent burnout by that sh*t is real) and if you're gone for awhile you can just post those during your break. You can set a video to be published at a certain date even years ahead without a premiere. You can change it if you get back from break earlier than the date the videos release date to hold it for when/if you need it in the future!
  
  If you have anymore questions just send a message directly to me via any of the social medias connected with my carrd link on my profile here.

  I would think yes. If you're notorious for being rude, always negative and ungrateful you won't be invited for things and you'd have a sh*t ton of trouble finding friends (even online) that would be interested in dealing with your attitude, thus creating a snowball effect of negativity causing more issues, those issues causing more negativity, that negativity causing more issues and so on.
  
  If you have a reputation of being polite, friendly, and grateful, you'll be invited to things, have a wonderful life, get to meet many people, find new interests, and more. This kind of life can really only get better. Pulling each other up in a positive relationship instead of bringing people (and thus yourself) down yields amazing results.
  
  Build a good reputation by politeness, friendliness, and positiveness, you're bound for a happy life that'll yield better results for you.

   What is the appropriate age for marriage?
  ","
  Depends on the each individual, the couple itself, future plans, money, and a lot more.
  
  Factors as:
  
  Each individual: personalities, maturity levels, and if they really feel they should.
  
  Have either if them had any previous relationships that would signal a future issue? (I.e. stealing money to buy something, little or no ability to stay with someone for longer than a small amount of time, etc.)
  
  Couple: how long have they been dating? What's their ability to understand each other and resolve issues maturely?
  
  Future plans: the more similar, the better the chance for a marriage that will actually stay strong and last. And yes, while some future plans can be compromised, others should NOT be wavered. (For instance, one might want to have biological kids, but the other doesn't due to health issues and things that run in the family that can and may present itself in the child)
  
  Money/Career: At least wait until graduating college with a degree of some sort with the guarantee for a job that pays high enough- OR after getting a stable job that gives enough money to survive on your own* (or at least almost enough, depends on the income of the other individual!)
  
  *Remember it isn't just rent, food, water, and transportation they'd be paying for. Health insurance, car insurance, emergency funds for sudden injury or illness, or car accident (almost all insurances won't give you enough to get another car if yours was totaled, even if it wasn't your fault!)
  
  TL,DR: While once you're 18 you can ny legal standards, that shouldn't be the ONLY deciding factor. Look into ALL factors before deciding to get married!

  If it's a hug of greeting, hug of celebration, hugging for support (whether for them or the other person), or something along those lines, yes.,This goes for any hug with one or both in a relationship. Hugs are not always romantic or sexual attraction. They can be- and are frequently- a purely platonic action. If they're doing it multiple times and you ask them to not hug someone too much and they either don't stop or just stay the same but instead continuing to do it behind your back, then you've got a problem.

  Next x-ray showed it was shrinking, thank whatever being exists! It's still still there (though shrinking) over a decade later it's still there and they estimate it'll take at least 4 more years to dissapear just from the massive size of it.

  I think the context for ""nice"" in the question is generous(?) So I will say fair.

  Fair: $20 dollars- $18 of which is given to a starving family on the street; keeping $2 for a run to a gas station for a $1-1.75 candy bar.
  
  Equal: $20 split into halves- one half is given to a starving family on the street; the other half is kept for a candy bar at a gas station.
  
  Generous: $20 dollars- $18 given to a friend for a random purchase, leaving you with $2 even though you may have needed the money.

  'Being Smart' in learning how to speak through voice with full length sentences, do mathematical equations, and building engines are smart in human terms.
  
  In cat terms, 'being smart' may be using their paws to feel for vibrations, know where home is with ease, and know how to climb trees and escape from predators.
  
  In dog terms, 'being smart' could mean learning tricks or commands from their owner, becoming a service dog (from being a seeing-eye dog for the blind, a medical alert dog, search and rescue dog, police k9, even be a water-search dog to search for human scent on the top of a body of water, etc.)And military working dogs, trained to scent just for a certain drug, or bombs.
  

  It's all relative, but the main thing I see is that there's confusion between independence and intelligence, they aren't equal or the same thing.

   Background information- My boyfriend of 3 months has 2 girl best friends. We are seniors in high school. We have a pretty great relationship. 
They trash on my name & our relationship to him. They are always touching him, playing w/ his hair & even sittin on him. Also they hangout A LOT! Thoughts?
  ","
  I had a boyfriend like that from the end of my freshmen year (2014) until this year. We had some rough goes, and it was a mutual thing when it ended, but every relationship is different.
  
  What his friends say about you isn't necessarily what he says/believes.
  
  Allowing another girl to sit in his lap should not happen though. Might be a ""making her jealous"" thing, maybe not; but it isn't right.
  
  Talk to him face to face about it, it'll be the best way to get more from him, and you'll see any hesitation vs ""not seeing"" the message while thinking of an answer. What he answers with, though, will show a lot.
  
  Something like:
  
  ""they're just friends.""  May mean that he doesn't see anything wrong; tell him it hurts you, and if he's ""waving away"" your emotions and acting as if you shouldn't think/feel that way, but continues letting them sit on his lap- be wary-- sounds like the start of a toxic relationship.

   What do you like in life?
  ","
  Just Life.. being alive, being able to love and breathe and the ability to care for the people you care about.
  
  I been through things in life where I only was getting up to go to bed, feeling only the numbness I carried daily, not having a reason to breathe, or to do anything other than lay down and hide from the world.
  
  I've felt pure terror at the thought of leaving my house, to get in a car where life could be snapped from me in a single beat, or to even lay down and sleep myself to get another nightmare that plagued my life and the feeling of any security I had left.
  
  I've had these reasons to mourn, lay down and stay in bed every day wishing I was somewhere not on earth, to fear just being alive, just wanting to leave, to end it..
  
  But I just couldn't. I had to get that strength that had been ripped from me back, and I opened up to a friend of mine that helped me through so much. She helped me see the silver lining around the hurricane of clouds I had swirling throughout my head. I felt some of my strength and courage come back
  
  She had been the one we needed, not just me, but my even family. But we got the news one night early 2016 that she had died, so unexpectedly from undiagnosed Diabeties. I didn't even know that was a possible way to die, at the time. and I felt that hurricane rising back up, swirling yet again, wishing I had done something, anything, to have been able to know she was sick. How could she have been dying without even knowing? Without a single thought she was even feeling sick? Smiling happily, just like every day I had known until that day she had just left, gone, never going to return, from something I never knew could happen. If I had known that you could die from it, could I have noticed the signs? Save her life like she saved mine?
  
  But I remembered so many of the things she'd done for us. I had to remember that, preserve that peace she gave us when she was here..
  
  So now I'm living her out dream: Make a difference.

  Just the usual early morning random thoughts:
  
  Why do we have that line for ""counting sheep""? And how does that help you sleep? Every time I ever tried it, it became something completely off and random, like if farmers made machinery to sheer sheep from their wool by just leaping over a small gate or walking through one..
  
  And what about ""catch a few Z's""? Where did that come from? Snoring doesn't sound like the letter Z, it sounds like a mutated zipper with a deep sound, and the high pitch sounds are gone.
  
  And the way dogs snore too, whether it be a dog with his or her head over the edge of a sofa, or the smaller breeds with smushed in muzzles snoring because their palette and throat isn't allowing them breathe right...
  
  Wait, do cats snore? I don't think I've ever heard a car snore? Wait!! What if ""purring"" is actually snoring? They just use it differently???

   Do you have any advice for people starting out on youtube?
  ","
  I don't have much, But I'll try to! I have 2 channels: ""Raindrop"", and ""Warriors"" about a series.
  
  The 1st video that boomed on subs and viewers was ""Confessions"" on the Warrior series. It Includes what I found strange or disagree with in Warriors, Those videos are commonly searched and since ""confessions"" sounds like a bit of drama will show, people click it more. This is good, but is also bad: More views, but More likely to cause fire in the comments.
  
  To prevent arguments or thrown insults, I put the confessions logically and calmly, making sure no anger will show in the video. Any comments that would cause arguments, i.e., ""You are stupid to think that-"" esp. If cursing is present, I delete then. I've had 2 or 3 of these, all deleted as they appeared.
  
  1 person in the comments said they didn't agree on 1 and why. Those I will interact with, polite debates are more likely, which makes it look better.
  
  People enjoy the invite to tell about something they are proud of, so I like giving them a chance to by questions about them shown in the video and interact with them.
  
  I try to keep consistent with videos, even if it's rare. I don't want to add 5/week, then drop to 1/month.
  
  Of course, all channels are different. My Warriors one has 30 subscribers currently, prob. low due to uploads spread so far, but I feel it's a good trade-off; I have subs that I enjoy interacting with, opposed to having 100s of subs that aren't easy to interact with.
  
  Vlogs and fursuit-kinds of videos I can't help with, though. I'm sorry about that! I never have time to do vlogs, and for fursuit videos my only good camera is my phone, and I'm still waiting on getting a stand or even a selfie stick that I would record them easier.
  
  For frequency, I'd say to start at a slow pace, maybe once per 1-2 weeks(?), then add them more frequently until you get a feel for what's right for you.
  
  I hope this helped you! If you find something that helps you, please send them over in another question! ‚ù§

   Can I get married at fifty with little?
  ","
  From a previous answer of mine:
  
  ""Depends on the each individual, the couple itself, future plans, money, and a lot more.
  
  Factors as:
  
  Each individual: personalities, maturity levels, and if they really feel they should. Any previous relationships that would signal a future issue? (I.e. stealing money to buy something or little or no ability to stay with someone for longer than a small amount of time)
  
  Couple: how long have they been dating, and their ability to understand each other and resolve issues.
  
  Future plans: the more similar, the better the chance for a marriage that will actually stay strong and last. Some future plans can be compromised, but others shouldn't be wavered. (For instance, one might want to have biological kids, but the other doesn't due to health issues and things that run in the family that can and may present itself in the child)
  
  Money: at least wait until graduating college with a degree of some sort with the guarantee for a job that pays high enough OR after getting a stable job that gives enough money to survive on your own (or at least almost enough, depends on the income of the other individual!) Remember it isn't just rent, food, water, and transportation they'd be paying for. Health insurance, car insurance, emergency funds for sudden injury or illness, or car accident (almost all insurances won't give you enough to get another car if yours was totaled, even if it wasn't your fault!)
  
  About Age: it really doesn't matter once 18+ AND have the above factors figured out and can do fine.
  
  Ps.. I didnt mean to make an essay, sorry about that lol""
  
  But, at 50 and little money, if you both truly love each other and both want to get married, you should go for it. By 50 years old, you've had experience in making major, life-changing decisions. If it feels right, go for it.

  Even though you can use the head rest by pulling it out of its place and using the metal bars on it to break the window glass to escape a burning/flooding vehicle, I get worried someone else will have been trapped and the can't get it off the chair for whatever reason.
  
  Also!! If this ever happens, go for the car windows, not the windshield! The windshield is designed not to break or crack, the window will be easier to break.

   Does what they say about your zodiacal sign generally match your personality?
  ","
  Yes. Pisces
  
  They are veryin touch with their emotions, and if you know someone that‚Äôs a Pisces, you know that they both express and internalize a multitude of feelings.
  
  Whether you‚Äôre a friend or more than a friend to a Pisces, you‚Äôve likely seen how caring,empatheticand sensitive they can be. They really allow themselves to feel exactly what you‚Äôre feeling. So, if you need someone to crywithyou rather than a shoulder to cry on, turn to a Pisces.
  
  Because Pisces are such caring people who are extremely in tune with their emotions as well as the emotions of others, they tend to go into fields that allow them to help people. According toAstrology Zodiac Signs, they are likely veterinarians, social workers, attorneys and the like.
  
  With a wealth of emotion and plenty of imagination, Pisces are quite creative and typically make excellent artists because it‚Äôs a great way for them to express themselves.

  I hate how people are not taking the virus seriously. Like even if you aren't that susceptible to the virus you should still be careful. You're ruining it for the rest of us by doing that. I probably won't get to graduate if the vaccine doesn't work and I've already heard people saying ""I'm not going to get the vaccine"" why not? It is to help with the virus. I'd rather have it then deal with you getting me sick.

  Well they have to do whatever it takes to protect us. If the virus becomes too widespread and rises again the vaccine will be ineffective and more people will die. A virus mutates over time so if we don't attempt to stop it then it will just get worse. Like the flu is different every year which it is a form of coronavirus, same goes for regular colds. So when it mutates it becomes the Covid like we see now.

  ","
  Okay here's the deal:
  
  For years people who aren't straight have been silenced. Me, myself was bullied up until I graduated high school. I was not allowed to be myself as we were pressed into a dress code of collared shirt, khaki pants, belt, close toed shoes, no weird hair, no shorts, dresses had to be collared, skirts went past knees, ect. So yeah when I realized I was pans I was immediately treated like shit by teachers and students alike. So now I can finally be myself and I am proud of my identity.
  
  So yes I did get upset when you literally disrespected my identity. That's like going up to a trans person and saying ""why are you so passionate about being trans? I'm straight and I am not that passionate for ffs"" that is literally disregarding someones IDENTITY. What you did was not right.

  You literally undermined an identity with no idea why they have a reason to be passionate about. Not everyone is straight and not everyone had the same events and such as you. So you do need to grow up and you are an idiot by not acknowledging the differences. You shouldn't assume and all you're doing is making yourself seem like a bigger asshole.
