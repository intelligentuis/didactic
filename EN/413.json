Talking about when there's mutual romantic interest\/feelings and you are seeing them. I think if I took things slow, I would fall in love at a more average rate. Then again, I don't know what the average rate is.\n  ","443250":"\n  A journey.\n  ","443251":"\n  I don't think I had a hero or idolized anyone in my childhood. Same for today. There are people I admire, several that I do and don't know. Maybe that's why I don't have a lot of direction in life, I don't have someone or one person that I want to be like and follow in the steps of.

Maybe it doesn't feel that way from he inside though.\n  ","443252":"\n  The furthest I've gone is about 750 miles (geographic distance), in terms of actions, I can go pretty far, but if I can't sense that it is mutual then I'll shut down.

I'm not sure how I feel about the concept of love though, I'm almost a different person when I'm in love. by that I don't mean my personality , just certain things change in terms of what I want and I take a lot more risks. I guess depending on whether you look at it in a good or bad light you could say passionate or unreasonable. It's probably the same for everyone, I'm just not sure how I feel about it. It feels good, but on the other hand there are certain things in my mind that change that when I'm not in love I see differently and feel is the right way to see it.\n  ","443253":"\n  A festival centered around the holiday of Halloween I guess?

I've been loving Billie Eilish stuff like \"lonely\" and \"bad guy\". Guilty pleasure or one of them being Ava Max, \"So am I\" and \"Salt\" as examples. I love her hair too.\n  ","443256":"\n  No, I wish. I'm trying to get to such a place.\n  ","443257":"\n  In terms of it being on purpose and not assumed I would say it is because they felt they were not in the wrong, because they disagree that it was wrong, or they just don't want to admit they were in the wrong as it would hurt their pride or make them feel less significant (shorter). There's also a chance they think it is just assumed depending on the circumstances. I'll sometimes not say it, but also say it indirectly and express it. There's also times I just forget or don't think to say it.\n  ","443258":"\n  I don't know, at least 400% more assuming I make it to an elderly age.\n  ","443259":"\n  That's a tough one, the pros and cons are about even. I'll say Doritos, but cheese puffs I would say has both of them beat.\n  ","443260":"\n  I don't know, I don't have places I go to in order to meet friends. If I did do such things, it would probably be places like Games & Enchantments or conventions where the subject is an interest I have. I do go to such places, just not for that reason.\n  ","443261":"\n  Happiness isn't a goal, happiness is a treat on the journey. You can't predict it and the more you expect it, the less you get of it. I would be happy in life not stressing about where I should be when, and not thinking I want\/need stuff that I want just because I don't have it. how would I be happy? The most reliable answer is by putting my all in and seeking to make others happy.\n  ","443262":"\n  My computer, my phone, my bed, my fridge, and my car. In terms of possessions, I can do the most with those. I don't have a lifetime supply of good food in my possession or anything of that sort. I also assumed the setting would be modern day and nothing else has changed as well as my placement geographically. Access to the internet, phone service, electricity, gas, and so on are not possessions, so I couldn't list them anyway.\n  ","443263":"\n  Maybe sight, because I love aesthetics, colors, patterns, and to create such things. Also because my hearing isn't what it used to be, I would rate hearing as my number two, especially with music and other pleasant or enjoyable sounds, taste is somewhere after and smell might be in last place (it is also my worst sense as far as I know.\n  \n  I'm not sure where I would put touch, I know it increases the release of oxytocin and prolongs life as well as functioning life. Well, when between humans anyway, or other similar beings. Then there's also that I would rate touch as my number one love language or at least at the top. However, it doesn't do anything for me artistically or creatively. It could inspire creativity, but it's not as much an expression of creativity I mean (not that it isn't or can't be, just not to as high an extent for me). I know it would be above smell for sure, i'd say above taste as well. When it comes to auditory and visual stimulus nothing can top the visual part. I might tie it with the sense of hearing or put it a bit above it. Yes, I can still imagine sounds and sights after losing those senses, but imagining isn't the same because you will never hear or see anything new and you'll forget details of things you have seen and heard as time goes by at least for most things. Plus for sight it would mean I couldn't really draw or design visuals and create digital art anymore, not in the way I enjoy doing such things anyway. It would also make a lot of things impossible that I enjoy doing as well, not just robbing my of aesthetics and things I would enjoy seeing alone.\n  \n  I'd say the sense of touch provides the realest experience to me, I don't know how to express why that is the case at least not yet, I've never thought about it. Part of it is that I don't really experience touch in dreams, not like I do with the other senses.\n  ","443264":"\n  Sleeping\/relaxing in my own bed, using things that I didn't bring with me, loved ones, and that's about it.\n  ","443265":"\n  Taz. I say things for my own amusement.\n  ","443266":"\n  I appreciate the positive feelings, I don't really have any specific thoughts on groups of people that I don't know though. I mean, In not great at reading when someone has a crush, partly because I reallt don't like to assume I imagine. Reason why I don't like to assume is because I imagine it from the other side if it was a bad assumption. Someone thinks you like them or want to talk to them for such reasons, things of that nature. This is why I rarely approach women, because heterosexual attraction is the norm and it is often seen as interest or flirting when someone of the opposite sex initiatiates interaction, especially if they seem interested in talking. This doesn't mean I never initiate conversation or interaction with the opposite sex, but only when it's automatic or seems a natural occurrence or follow-up to something that happened. Also of course if it is someone I am already acquainted with.\n  ","443267":"\n  I don't believe in such a thing as a \"real man\" just as I don't for the term a \"real woman\". People crying in general tends to make me uncomfortable because I feel bad for them and more so if I don't know how to effort them or am not close enough to possibly know. That doesn't mean I think anyone should hold it back. I resent that I don't know how not to hold it back because it's become an ingrained habit I guess. Can't remember how to let go (I'm sure I did when I was a baby and up to kindergarten possibly). Happy crying doesn't make me uncomfortable of course.\n  ","443268":"\n  To jump off a skyscraper (yes I technically could do this, but I don't want the end result, just the experience), to live as long as I want without aging, to be able to easily switch between bodies of each binary sex, to be able to both spend almost all of my time by myself and also spend almost all of my time with loved ones, friends, and love interests. The list goes on...\n  ","443269":"\n  I can follow directions and I can cook well what I have cooked at least a few times.\n  ","443270":"\n  Make someone's day better.\n  \n  It might sound like a simple answer, but it makes sense if you think about  it. Ideally it would in turn also make you feel better and it would likely lead to both of you doing more good things after feeling better in a sense.\n  ","443271":"\n  To immerse yourself in it, go where they speak and write it if possible. Otherwise try to communicate with others that know it. Of course in addition to some traditional learning to help you along, like memorizing terms and learning grammar. Learning patterns in things really helps You remember things too.\n  ","443272":"\n  Visited my brothers in Cali, Steam Summer Sale, and coming up is a convention.\n  ","443273":"\n  Either thinking up creations or direction for creations, things I need to do, or thinking things through (what would lead to what, what would be a good idea or bad idea).\n  ","443274":"\n  I haven`t spent any money today, should probably buy gas soon.

Am I an angel or a demon or which do I prefer in some sense? I`m probably closer to the former by most people`s opinion , but my preference is demon creatively\/artistically. Why can`t I choose snowy? Sunny and cloudy are about even in my mind with pros , cons, and aesthetic.

The hype\/hard songs because they can make me feel pumped and like I can do most anything. Hopsin is an example of rap in that category, he's probably still my favorite rap artist along Tupac Shakur.\n  \n  I also find some songs like a decent portion of love songs sad, like A Thousand Years for instance. I guess because the associated memories with the subject.\n  \n  Billie Eilish, Ava Max, Lana Del Rey, Marina & the Diamonds, and DubstepGutter are some of my more recent favorite artists.

I don't know why these events are so significant that I remember them along with the feeling back so far when nothing even really happens in the memories.\n  \n  Basically, a feeling of being out of place, it's not so much an emotional thing, more physical and a feeling (not talking about after making big changes\/decisions or after changing scenery\/moving house).

High on the list for when it is very noticeable anyway. Contrast, deep\/saturated colors.\n  \n  3) Faces: expression\/structure.\n  \n  4) Height and Figure.\n  \n  5) Butts (would be higher if butts were on the front). Don't worry though, I don't get aroused when I look at your butt (99%+ of the time if you are a stranger, much less so if we have a sexual\/romantic connection). It's more of a fascination and I will get an image in my head when I don't even look at it and it comes up in my peripheral. When I do get aroused its sometimes just that I happened to get a random erection at a fitting time or I haven't done anything in weeks.\n  \n  Boobs don't make the list. (probably belongs higher on the list, I just don't typically care about them. Sometimes I'll be accidentally staring at them while daydreaming or spacing out (thinking or too tired to think)). Don't get me wrong, boobs can be fun, but they are not really an object of sex in my mind. They can compliment a figure well though.\n  \n  When talking (even more guessing):\n  \n  1) Voice.\n  \n  2) Whether a Shy or Outgoing personality.\n  \n  3) Sense of humor.\n  \n  4) Mood.\n  \n  5) Connection.\n  ","443382":"\n  Closest I can think of is to create and I do pretty often.\n  ","443383":"\n  If I had one wish I would wish to stop the aging process.

I also don't have a person I hold at the top or anyone coming to mind right now.\n  ","443398":"\n  Are my needs assumed to be taken care of in this question? If not: food, sleep, and a shelter. If so: worldbuilding (writing, drawing), leisure (D&D, anime, gaming), and exercise.\n  ","443399":"\n  When I ate a Carolina Reaper, not audible cries, tears streaming down my face and lots of nose blowing. Happens when I eat spicy food. I thought the Carolina Reaper would be spicier though, didn't even feel any need to drink milk.

I mean, I don't necassarily want to leave, or for them to leave, but my mind is more occupied nowadays of course and I'm more used to it as well as knowing I'll almost certainly see them again.\n  \n  In the case of saying goodbye forever because of death or another reason, I find that harder of course.\n  ","443404":"\n  Writing, worldbuilding, playing video games, watching anime, and drawing. I'd like to learn to play piano.\n  ","443405":"\n  Eh, okay. Only because it wasn't anything personal or private.\n  ","443406":"\n  Usually procrastination or taking small steps, just starting, when it stresses me out and I have a large course load. The former method is a biological response while the latter is a logical and informed method to reduce the stress via getting rid of the stressor ratger than ignoring it.\n  ","443407":"\n  I would say my favorite memories are tied to who they are with rather than where they take place. Not sure that I have a favorite memory, well, maybe, but it's a bit personal.\n  ","443408":"\n  Further than I probably should as long as I can deduce that it is mutual. I feel as if the me in love and the me not in love are two very different people and they can both observe themselves and the other self. It's strange. A lot of my views, ideas, and desires change. In terms of ideas\/views I try to be more consistent, also, how they change hasn't changed based on who the target is either. So I'm not saying I adopt the targets views.\n  \n  I would also say the me in love is more bold or passionate in terms of expression through art for the most part. Sort of like having a muse.\n  \n  Maybe you could argue that the me in love is just more honest\/emotional and less pragmatic\/logical. Some of it is also just biological. Like how I will change my mind on kids for instance. Where when I'm not in love I think about it logically, but also less passionately. I think about how I wouldn't want kids until I'm in an optimal place financially and once I learn a lot about raising children, child psychology, and have a good mindset going into it so that it is my best effort. There have also been times where I've thought getting a vasectomy to prevent the in love me from doing anything stupid in the future. I also feel that having kids shouldn't be as easy as it is biologically when it is a huge responsibility and that the process of adoption is closer to how it should be. I know there isn't exactly equal treatment with the adoption process in the US, but it's much closer to an ideal system than sex which is pleasurable and easy (between heterosexual or bisexual individuals of of the opposite sex).\n  ","443409":"\n  I recognize Muslims as a people and Islam as a religion. I've had a relationship with someone that practiced Islam, but I don't assume everyone that practices it practices it in the same way. I generally don't assume things about individuals based on a group they belong to or other individuals in that group. There's a very wide range with every nationality, religion, and more for what people believe, how they express that belief or just how they live and the decisions they make. I don't believe it's right to tell anyone how they ought to live or dress as long as it doesn't harm anyone (for those that do choose to veil in western countries).\n  ","443410":"\n  With a little what? I can't answer unfinished questions. xD\n  \n  Unless you mean a little as in DDLG or something, in that case, I don't see why not...\n  ","443411":"\n  I don't know, it's not one or the other for every case.  Maybe I open up first less, I don't think about it a lot or keep track. That's probably partly because I ask a lot of questions.\n  ","443412":"\n  Huh? Does this question assume I feel most people don't like me? Maybe when I'm in certain moods. I mean... it certainly is possible. It would be rude if they made it obvious.\n  \n  There's two ways I'm seeing that I could read this: \"Why do you feel like so many people don't like you?\" and \"What to do when you feel like so many people don't like you?\"\n  \n  You could also mean not liking someone as being neutral towards thrm rather than disliking them or not caring for them.\n  ","443413":"\n  Depends on the act, circumstances, and the context overall.\n  \n  In general I believe in at least second chances.\n  ","443414":"\n  No. They could be. They could also be a cool cat. I wouldn't necessarily say they are over-confudent either. Maybe they are, confident, friendly, and a jokester. Thinking of a certain person I know. I am not close to them, but I don't think they are shallow. I don't think they are superficial or incapable of deep thought.\n  \n  Being friendly and forthright with msny doesn't mean you can't be or don't wish to be close with a few and share deep connections.\n  ","443415":"\n  I worked and did some stuff Saturday before work, I think.\n  ","443416":"\n  Don't school, vape, stay in kids.\n  \n  t.l. note: Don't do drugs, kids, and stay in school.\n  ","443417":"\n  A letter as in writing a letter, pen on paper and mailing it? I don't know how many years ago (outside of handmade holiday cards and such). I don't really have any pen pals.\n  ","443418":"\n  Which one? Regardless of whether you mean the dreams you have when you are asleep or awake. I have more than one. I'm also pretty happy with the way things are going in my life.

Black or purple\/pink if you mean favorite color(s).\n  ","443420":"\n  Never thought about it. Don't have the greatest sense of smell. I like spring and winter based smells in terms of seasons. Fruity and sweet smells are nice too.\n  ","443421":"\n  Saying that I don't like sweets, soda, and\/or junk food (fake it 'til you make it).\n  ","443422":"\n  Fear of agency, probably.\n  ","443423":"\n  April 24th of 2013.\n  ","443424":"\n  Whatsapp.\n  ","443425":"\n  Like most week days, enjoyed the tail end of a party though.\n  ","443426":"\n  Usually the individual's face and hair if they are facing me.\n  ","443427":"\n  Try to think of it from their perspective I guess.\n  ","443428":"\n  Visiting California.\n  ","443429":"\n  Water.\n  ","443430":"\n  Intelligence is a form of beauty.\n  ","443431":"\n  Probably not one specific person I greatly admire and no others.

Maybe for neither.\n  ","443441":"\n  Is attitude personality? If so, that is at the top. Money over good looks probably. I'm pretty demisexual so looks aren't too important besides to show off, but that isn't a priority.\n  ","443442":"\n  Discrimination.\n  ","443443":"\n  Well, I would hope I wouldn't remember for my own sake. Awkward is a very specific and conditional emotion if you ask me. In order for sometjing that happened to be deemed awkward, both parties must see it as such, or at least the party that did the thing. I don't have the best memory and usually think about things before I say\/text it, so that it won't be something I'll regret. I've definitely said awkward things to all of those that were special to me I'm sure. Off the top of my head I can't think of anything though.\n  ","443444":"\n  I don't know what SN is. Is it a physical place, a place on the internet, or what? Social Networks? I don't really have any close friends on social networking places that I don't talk to in real life face to face. I have some distant friends or past close friends that I haven't talked to in s long time. Not that anything happened other than life.\n  ","443445":"\n  In terms of practicality probably a portable phone charger, power bank. I can't find my old one, it's probably still here I just don't know where (been a couple months) and don't feel like wasting money on another when I might find it.\n  \n  I know for a fact my air mattress is still here somewhere and I can't find it, that also makes me more confident that my power bsnk is still here and I just am unable to find it. I'm 99% sure I didn't have my power bank in a position to be lost at Ohayocon at any time. Only had it out when it was charging my phone or in my pocket after fully charging it rhen back in my backpack.\n  \n  Oh my god! I just found it in my backpack after searching for half a dozen seconds. I remember fully emptying all my bags multiple times to look for it. What the hell.\n  \n  So, one of the things at the top of my wishlist is probably Naokai Urasawa's Monster, the DVD set. It's not on any streaming service or anle to be purchased digitally to watch on any device either. Only streaming services you can find it on are ones like kissanime. I watched it on one of those websites because I didn't feel like dumping tons of money on a show just to watch it for the first time. Dubbed would be preferred because part of the reason I want it is to get friends to watch it and some might be turned off by having to read subtitles while they watch. I've seen both already anyway (zubbed and dubbed).\n  ","443446":"\n  No, I don't suffer.\n  ","443447":"\n  If the pause button is unlimited in how msny times I get to pause and for how long and the rewind button is unlimited in how many times I can use it I would choose the rewind button. I'll assume there is no consequence to either and that I retain my prior memories when rewinding (not perfectly like all memory) because otherwise it's useless.\n  \n  I could go mad either way. If I wanted time to think, either would work (could keep going back to think). If I wanted to prolong living or live forever, either would work. If I wanted to live forever in ongoing time, one would work, if I wanted to undo\/redo only one would work.\n  \n  Rewind is easily superior.

You first have to understand what manipulation looks like which is: Someone who is emotionally manipulating you may do so in subtle ways, like judging and criticizing your actions. They might make a mean comment about your choice of friends, for example. Another sign of emotional manipulation is trying to create feelings of embarrassment or guilt. There's Psychological manipulation too that you can look up.\n  \n  Here are some ways: You feel fear, obligation and guilt. You\u2019re questioning yourself (aka they're gaslighting you). There are strings attached (If you don\u2019t meet the manipulator\u2019s expectation, you will be made out to be ungrateful). You notice the \u2018foot-in-the-door\u2019 and \u2018door-in-the-face\u2019 techniques. Plain Old Bullying. They pull the \"If You Really Loved Me...\" Emotional Blackmail. Playing The Victim (THIS IS A HUGE ONE). Gaslighting (ANOTHER BIG ONE). Convenient Neediness, they're always \"joking\".\n  \n  What to do if you think you\u2019re being manipulated? Talk to a therapist or call the National Domestic Violence Hotline as they know what to do. Try not to let the manipulators behavior affect you personally. I know that's easier said then done but it's really important to not let them get to you.\n  \n  Some more: Stubborn Headedness, Knowing Your Weaknesses, Creating Confusion, & Being Passive-Aggressive. Most of the manipulators are pathological liars. Psychological manipulators are often what they call emotional vampires or parasites. That means that they will make you feel bad whenever they feel bad, or make you feel guilty because they feel bad. They pressure you. Manipulators will often yell or put you in an uncomfortable situation because of their behavior. (Stone cold\/letting you take the initiative) Manipulators will let you speak first because this allows them to get to know your opinions, emotions or even weak spots.\n  ","443550":"\n  hehe \ud83d\ude07\ud83e\udd70\n  ","443551":"\n  Here are some strange reasons.\n  \n  1.

Get out of the house when you're feeling depressed; it's ok if when you're out and about that you still don't feel the greatest. It's not always about feeling good while doing things, allowing yourself to be surround by positive does better your feelings over time. Challenge your negative thoughts.
