I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was in shock and thought it was fake. I was sleeping and then I woke up with a notification saying he committed suicide and I just froze and said no this isn\u2019t real and literally started panicking. My childhood, my hero, my inspiration, my smile, my everything has ended he\u2019s life I couldn\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s like he has impacted me so much during my life and I grew up listening to Linkin Park so you can only imagine how much it killed me when I heard that it was real. A piece of me died along with him. That piece of me will never be the same ever again. My hero and my childhood is gone and I wasn\u2019t able to save him and that completely breaks my heart in half. I mean listening to his music and his lyrics carefully you can tell he was in so much pain but yet no one offered to help him and that just shatters me \ud83d\udc94 I will always continue to wonder why no one helped him and that we could\u2019ve saved him and he would still be here with us that will always haunt me for the rest of my life. It\u2019s  been one year and it\u2019s been been heartbreaking and devastating knowing that it\u2019s been one year since he\u2019s been gone. I don\u2019t even know how I made it knowing he\u2019s not here with us anymore but deep down I have this feeling he is here with us all the time in spirit so I guess that\u2019s how I made it this far without him. I just never knew how hard it was gonna be losing someone who meant the world to you and who made you strong and so happy and has helped you through life and continues to do so. I just never knew how hard that was until we lost Chester. Then I realized wow it is super hard losing someone you love like that. Breaks my heart. And that piece of me that died is with him now in heaven. Wow this is incredibly long guys I\u2019m sorry I just felt I had to. My childhood will never be the same \ud83d\udc94 and knowing that we will never hear new music by him honestly is the most devastating, heart shattering thing ever. Like I lived for his music and all their albums and knowing their won\u2019t be new ones just breaks me even more. No more hearing Chester in new songs god that is saddening. but I know that he\u2019s up in heaven now with all the angels as he is an angel himself watching over all of us and making sure we stay strong for him and keep his legacy alive forever which we will\ud83d\udc95 it\u2019s just harder now listening to his music every time I do a tear runs down my face because I just miss him so much and yes I know he will always be here with us but it\u2019s still very hard.
