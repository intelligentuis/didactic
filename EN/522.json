time or with certain scores idk . i feel like the tasks should be for those who aren t that active on here and have a hard time getting enough activity , not for the people who already have so much going on when they come on . like why are they congratulating us by giving us more work ? thats like there whole thing right ? they say like the more active you are , you can be vip thats how they suck you in , then once they got you they make you do a whole bunch more than you probably already do . . because ive been just not doing any tasks omg its so much better . i stopped caring about the

would have ever gotten to this mental state . because of covid i was able to take a step back and look at my life and go , wow all my priorities are flawed i wasn t doing anything i wanted to do . i was so miserable . unhappy . so , my parents were the ones that pushed me to see its an opportunity to change my life around , start over . well , actually my mom was more like , we have money . dont risk working . just take a break and do art or something . at first , it was so hard but then i slowly started to seep back into my old self but a smarter version and now i think it was the best decision i have ever made . so is bad for majority of society , but for me it kinda literally saved my life . my heath was declining so bad , i mean i actually ended up with a super deadly infection

hilarious . idk how you approach someone in the gym without looking creep asf .","483122":"in my opinion , hunting is more humane compared to just having a bunch of slaughterhouses and lining up animals just to be murdered . some people are meant to eat meat . check out the blood type diet . type a blood type is the only one that has to be really mindful of meat consumption but im blood type o so im supposed to have a very high protein diet because i produce so much stomach acid i can handle digesting a lot of meat . also , they were using all of the animal . the fur , making leather , teeth , bones , and meat . nothing went to waste and hunting helps keep the population down which is why during certain times of the year you re allowed to hunt certain animals . its kinda the circle of life . i know we try really hard to say we arent animals but like we are , just like how theres animals that only eat meat , only eat greens , or a little of both why should we be any different ?","483123":"i blame my genetics","483124":"someone told me about this and i didnt know if it was really true but i always lay on my left side when my stomach is killing me or even to fall asleep . i

then i look behind me in the reflection because i expected the little demon to pop up so i look away and run to find her . i needed her help getting to the witches in the forest cause there was a secret portal then i end up in the middle of the forest with three witches behind me explaining that every person is connected to a certain species of plant and we need whatever plant that might be to be healthy . and i ended up rubbing soil on to someone and they started to grow with the plant . so i start making potions out of plants .","483438":"both ?","483439":"i love you so much . ? truly
