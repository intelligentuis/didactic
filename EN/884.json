This dude who was sitting on the bench right next to me refused to give up his seat to the middle schooler, so when she I asked me, I refused too and she picked my backpack off the ground and put it in the middle of the street. The dude kindly said to me \"save my seat\" and then went and got my backpack for me. I tried to save it, but the girl dove for it and I was literally wrestling with a stranger, so I shortly just gave up. I regret not giving up the seat to make things simpler, and if not, I should have at least got up once she took the dudes seat because after that, I just felt like a jerk to him.
