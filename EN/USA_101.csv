  Like I'm pretty picky. I wouldn't want to settle for something that I hate with a passion just to have my own place. I'd want a good fit. Somewhere that isn't that much crime rate. To know what's in the area before buying/renting. It wouldn't be something i do lightly. Also adding your own furniture on top of everything else as well.
  
  I've been through a lot of home renovations so excuse me for not wanting to jump at the first opportunity at something that I don't think would be an ideal home for me lol
  "

   Are you saying you can't really even afford an apartment right now?
  ","
  I'm not really looking at apartments. The ones I just noticed looked pretty ghetto and were going for $700-1000+ range. Looked pretty small and odd layouts. Also haven't found something that I absolutely love yet either.
  
  The town we are in right now doesn't have apartments but that should be changing, I believe.

  It would say 31 but since I was born in December I'm not 31 yet. I turned 30.

   When I go camping I always want to be prepared.  In this case, bringing a condom would have prevented an unwanted pregnancy resulting from being in the same sleeping bag as a beautiful young woman suffering from hypothermia.   p.s. the CPR was simply an excuse to get a free kiss.   lol

   So she arrives at the camp site and prepares for bed.  During the night a bear attacks her and as she runs she falls down an embankment into frigid waters and screams for help.  A young man hearing her cries rushes to help. He provides CPR & then climbs into a sleeping bag to warm her.  Condom?

   You will never change yourself
  ","
  In what way? Who says I need to change anyway?
  
  I love my personality.
  
  Just because I don't always mention the gym, swimming or going for walks doesn't mean I don't do them. I literally went to the gym Saturday. I did a lot of walking on Sunday and that was even on vertical uphill land. Like it was basically a cliff with lots of stairs, side streets and everything else. I eat healthy. I drink lots of water. I've lost weight. I don't get why you are being a dick for no reason. I also just went swimming and took a shower.
  
  When I go to the gym it's an hour and a half to 2 hours tops. Walking 5 miles is usually an hour and some minutes. I'm not on here 24/7
  
  I bet you won't even answer what you think i should change.

Walked aimlessly down the street. My sister has a thing where she wants ice cream after eating dinner o.o She ended up spying an ice cream shop and we got some. Also got my mom some fudge for mother's day. My sister and brother were trying to be the favorite sibling lol Like they both told her at the ghost town thing to pick something that she likes. They had jewelry and other stuff there. Sister also then claimed buying her meal type thing when she didn't get anything there. In the end my brother didn't get her anything lol. He was also more focused on the Celtics. Like he was walking around with his earphones in listening to the game.

   How was your Mother's Day?
  ","
  Part1
  
  Very long. On the road around 8am. Went to breakfast with everyone. I ended up getting pancakes. They were huge! I remembered that they did them big but one was more than enough. I had a small bite of the 2nd one. Thankfully, I went with 2 instead of the 3 it said on the menu. They are also known for their pies so my mom and I split an apple crumb pie with vanilla ice cream on top. We then traveled some more til we got to Jerome, Arizona.
  
  Went to the Ghost Town. It wasn't really what I expected lol. It was more like a giftshop and a junkyard 😂 Lots of rusty old cars and other things. I'll post my favorite out of the cars. I loved the rust colors on it! My nephew's uncle had a ghost app going when we were looking in the small shed like storage areas. I don't know if that was real but it was creepy. He had some FM radio thing that the ghost could use to use their voice with? It would answer a few things. One of the voices said ""inside"" and we actually went into one of the buildings and my sister-in-law's brother hit a rock or something onto the metal thing we were in and she basically screamed and ran out 😂 It was really creepy but I felt like it was kind of going to happen anyways lol
  
  Went to The Grand Hotel afterwards. I guess its $20 per person and if you do a tour, they give you a bunch of ghost hunting gear to use. Already spent a lot at the other place. But we basically sneaked in XD We were going to go up the old elevators but noticed that you needed a key to actually use it :( Then there was more stairs nearby that led upstairs but that needed a guest hotel key to open the doors. So that was annoying. We didn't really feel any energies when we were in there but I feel like we weren't on the right floors for that either or its just a scam lol
  
  then went out to eat. My mom and I weren't that hungry so we just ended up splitting chicken wings and French fries.

He just had that demeanor that made you want to be bitchy towards him 😂 My sister told him to have a nice day and he was all ""not anymore"" kind of thing. Like that was your 2nd job and you weren't even doing it so what makes you so entitled? He's still getting paid for previous things he did though. He's supposed to go to meetings to learn more about the program but refused as well. Even another person in HR was talking shit about him before my sister fired him.

  I was in Maine up until April 3rd. We have a house up there, lake front. I'm in AZ right now basically visiting now... My sister and her husband went to Ireland in April so mom and I came out to take care of the dogs.

  I didn't even get the fat shaming questions nor do I know what Cadie and that other person wrote. Did they even directly call someone out?
  
  How would insulting even make you edgy?
  
  It's a fact that obese people can get a lot of different health problems - asthma, diabetes, and countless of other things. It's not opinions, it's factual.
  
  You can be overweight and have no problems as well but that still doesn't really make you 100% healthy either. You are still big. The bmi can still be in large ranges. You might still have a hard time with certain things but your #s are good ratios.
  
  There can be medical problems (pcos, insulin resistance etc) that make people gain fat as well. Just fuck the haters. They don't know anything about your health, life or anything besides what you put out there. It's their problem, not yours. As long as you take steps on being the best you then who cares? Do you eat healthy? Good. Do you work out? Good. Exercise of any kind isn't just for skinny or muscular people. Everyone starts somewhere. If the person is really big and eating fast food all day, every day, not doing shit for their body then I'd have a problem with that. Do they deserve insults? No! They know that they are fat. They don't need reminders. Fat shaming isn't going to help them either. Encouragement, support and respect would be more beneficial.
  
  Idk this shit is such a double standard as well.

   Best way to increase stamina ?
  ","
  Keep at it? Try going for longer times. Maybe use lube or products that can help increase the pleasure. Edging. Find the best position. Breathing techniques probably help. Maybe find a song with a good beat... or do in time with a video. Be in the right mood and mindset.  Don't overthink things while doing it since that could be messing it up.
  
  Or just look up stamina or something on Google and see what others recommend.

   Why are Protestant countries more richer and civilised than Catholic countries? For example, UK, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Iceland, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and so forth are Protestant but Nigeria, Mexico, Poland, Slovakia, Columbia and Ghana are Catholic.

   Is it normal that if a woman tries to speak to me in real life (unless she’s family or someone I know) I completely ignore her and pretend she isn’t there? For example when I was 15 at a Deicide concert this woman tried asking me something and I just completely ignored her.
  ","
  That's pretty rude.
  
  I think the concert is ok to do that. It's loud. Rather enjoy the music instead of trying to have a conversation. I guess it depends what she said too.
  
  At the outlet mall there was some guy selling skincare products that get rid of dead skin. I kept walking and acted like i didn't see/hear him but my mom got sucked in. I was like noo lol. He ended up putting the product on her wrist and she was complaining how it felt gross after we walked away lol didn't help anything.

  I guess that's one way of looking at it. Mom and I only came out here to babysit the dogs when they went to Ireland. We were supposed to head back April 25th. We would have hated the 13 hour flight (3 layovers) and my dad was even telling us to stay since the weather was still horrible in Maine and didn't feel like dealing with everything lol Also we have our dog Lulu with us so that would have been chaotic too. Luckily, we ended up getting the money back at cancelation.
  
  It's also good we stayed since on Sunday, my uncle and his wife came out here. I haven't seen him in a couple years so it was good to see. They mainly came to visit her daughter. It's funny how that stuff works out. It was nice seeing Rachel too. She moved out here recently and her mom is trying to convince my uncle to move out here. He was looking at North Carolina but AZ might be a contender. He seemed to like it but also hot for him too. Doesn't help that he came out when the weather is more hot as well. They went to the Grand Canyon today or that was their plan lol

   You complained it is sad that the way I ended up. I think you complained about being degraded by me. I didn't mean to degrade you.You are a very fine girl.You are fit and beautiful. It is just that there are better girls than you in the world just like there are better men than me in the world.
  ","
  ""I didn't mean to degrade you"" but yet the 2nd message, you are basically saying how I'm a piece of shit personality wise. Like my personality is the best part of who I am. I don't need to be better than others. I'm not egotistical like you are. I'D RATHER BE BETTER THAN MY PREVIOUS SELF and no, I'm not talking about my personality here.
  
  Plus, it's rude to say all that about my personality when it was obvious that is what ""attracted"" you in the first place. Logic. You haven't seen me.
  
  I don't like how you compare girls either. You really should stop with the double standards.
  
  You won't make me depressed. Your words in the long run don't matter. You literally know nothing about me. Nothing you even say is relatable.

  I have had to resort to EBT a few times though. It ran out over the summer and just never enrolled again. I would get around $195-200 range just for myself.

I'm a pretty calm person to begin with so it would have to be something big like doing a speech, walking alone and feeling like a person/car is following me (happened before at night but nothing came of it.. like I kept seeing the same car at multiple different times when walking and there was no real reason for that) or other potential life threatening things. Or maybe nervous butterflies but I keep that in check lol

  It's fine but they look stupid. Especially if they go back to them or when everything is back to normal with them. I understand being upset and in the moment but people should really think before publishing relationship issues. Also it kind of screams how they want attention too in most cases.

  Kind of in the middle about it. It's good if they learn something about it but not everything should be focused on beauty at a young age. Most likely the mothers go overboard with it, living through the child. Trying to get that former glory back...
  
  If I had a daughter and if she really wanted to do it then I'd be fine with it. I don't think that I'd want to be her coach... I'd rather support her. Step away from her moment. I wouldn't want to force a kid into that. Should be their idea. Not to please me.

  Last time it was because the person was toxic. They didn't really care about our friendship and they'd bring up stuff that they helped me with in a blackmail kind of way. Like out of nowhere they'd say something. ..like where did that come from? Honestly, the guy had it coming. And he kind of just made it a reality. He was also younger and pretty immature for his age. Woe is me type of guy. I always had to play therapist with him and his many relationships he was in. He'd only really come back to me if he got dumped by each of the boyfriends he had in the end.

  Most of my questions are sent to all. I've also done questions to specific people when I see that they want questions. Or if I want to know something then I'd ask.
  
  I usually do like posts from others.
  
  I did end up following someone today. I haven't asked questions to yet but they seemed really chill and nice. I don't remember if I liked anything though lol

  I'd say that there's probably a few guys on here that I follow but never really talked much with. Sometimes I'm just more focused on answering my own questions or liking posts from others. Conversation is nice but ultimately it's a Q&A site.

We ended up going to the ocean one day and looked for shells and other marine life. It was also raining so it felt cool being there. Had a dance. Painted. Hiked. Did a bunch of different activities.

  Public for all of them. Vocational Technical high school that was still public and then Community College.
  
  I had no real problems.
  
  Votech was the right choice for me. It got me out of a bad town/schooling. A lot of people were from different areas. The teachers were pretty amazing. Not only did I get a high school graduation but I also received a degree in graphic communications.
  
  Community College was in a different bad neighborhood. It was 5 minutes away from home. I didn't do the whole real college dorm stuff. I would gain friends but then each new semester, I'd never see those people again. There was only one girl that was pretty consistent or I'd see every other semester and we'd just click all over again. She was also the first friend that I met on the first day! She reminds me so much of my best friend's sister, like pretty identical and even the same name. We'd sit and talk about a lot of stuff outside when we would be waiting for a class or whatever. We didn't end up hanging out outside of school though. Nor do I have her on fb or anything. She was pretty cool tho. Not sure if I remember her last name.

  It's not that hard 😂 Literally right next to Massachusetts (where I was born, lived etc)
  
  We'd just always go up to the same spot in the summer. Family friend ended up renting a cabin up there that was right in the area. They ended up buying it when it was sold since they kept renting it a lot. It's now one of the biggest houses there. lol They also plan to add more to it.
  
  There was a house that was in the neighborhood and parents ended up buying it a few years ago. Summer house and most likely rent income when everything is done. It still has a lot of work to be done. The year they brought it, there was a huge snowstorm and the roof caved in. So had to rebuild quickly. It's a deeded lot. The place was basically falling apart already. Got for a decent price. Since it was deeded a lawyer had to track down like 20 relatives of the seller so that took a while lol
  "
543752,"
   That makes a lot of sense. I think it's more of a comfort food thing. It's almost 930 here and I could go for Chinese food. lol. I'm not getting it because it's so late. I'm eating snacks though. I'm having Doritos.

  I can get seasonal depression a bit. It's not too bad though. Mostly just in the winter. I crave the sun. We kept getting bombarded with snow. Grey cloudy days. Another reason why I was so happy about AZ. I kind of mentioned it a lot during the winter on here.
  
  I don't think I'm that anxious. Maybe if huge crowds and I don't know anyone or i have to give a speech? I feel like those are pretty normal examples though. Like I never had a panic attack or anything that can go with anxiety.
  
  I was really depressed in 2010. Um, time helped with that. It's so weird looking back at that time lol. I really was withdrawn. I didn't want to share with friends. I just felt like a burden. I wasn't taking care of myself at all. My college paperwork got messed up and i had the semester off.. so that sure as hell didn't help. I would only eat one meal, dinner. My sleeping schedule was f*cked. My sister kind of shined the light on how bad I was. Her words truly helped me begin to live again... little steps like getting up early, taking more care for myself, getting out, eating again. Finding myself again. I lost my humor and stuff...

   I don't know. I think sometimes when you are craving bad food, you just got to eat the really bad kind and not the ""healthy"" bad food.

  Maybe. I'm not in the mood for pizza.

My body does amazing things for me.
  
  I guess I can't talk about healthy things on here because it just brings out the hate in accounts that I never even heard of out. I eat healthy. I go to the gym. I swim.

   Why/How does working out give you confidence?  I see other people working out and it ends up have the opposite effect for me.
  ","
  Knowing that I'm working on my body. Attention I might get later on. Confident that I know what works for me (cardio + weights)
  
  Confidence that I know how to work the machines. I know how to adjust them to my height level or the right weight # that I need.
  
  Confidence in my strength improving
  
  It kind of gives you that after high too. Like b! Tch, you just did that!? 💪
  
  I people watch sometimes but I'm still in my own head. Not caring what they are doing or thinking. I don't really feel judged at that gym. I'm there to better myself, like everyone else there. Think its got to be the right mindset when going in. Like I listened to music that makes me want to workout. I also took my preworkout that helps me feel stronger and last longer in the gym. Confidence in knowing what to do helps.

  Death? Obviously, that wouldn't be fun. I'd probably be a mess.
  
  One of my ex's did die a few years ago (we weren't together then) That was more like a damn type thing. We didn't really love each other like we should have so it didn't really matter much? If it was truelove then hell ya that shit would hurt. For one thing, I think the guy would have probably cheated on me. His ex was coming back into the picture. I didn't really want to get into all that. I was like buhbye. I clearly didn't matter to you then. I'm not going to fight for him if I know I'm not even #1 to him...

  Since I'm currently in AZ - The warmth. Especially coming from cold temps, snow and all that. The pool. There's a new Goodwill in town. Also Ross but I'm not sure when it opens.  Walking around is fun to look at houses, cactus, flowers.. The gym i go to is great since its a recreational one so there's ton to do there if the gym part isn't your thing. Classes, a bunch of different courts etc
  
  East coast shenanigans-  the lake in Maine, my fam/friends who are still in Massachusetts.

I enjoyed making fashion sets there. It kept me in the loop of what was trending too. Now I feel all ""What is fashion?"" 😯😕

  I don't like bras with wires. Just not comfortable to me. Always dug into me and left marks for a bit. Was so happy taking off lol Thankfully, they make some good supportive ones without the wires these days.

  Kohls, Target, VS, Walmart, Ross
  
  42D or XL depending on the sizes/style.
  
  I did end up getting 44D on my adoreme order since when i got my bridesmaid dress measured last year, she said 46. They didn't have that size though. I figured a little more room would be good.

  It went better than I thought it would! It's been a while. But I managed to be around the same weight numbers on the machines. More reps... probably some PRs there. I don't keep strict knowledge of them but do remember some vaguely.
  
  They added some new machines and also moved the stationary bike area so it overlooks the pool now. Idk it felt very isolated. I didn't care for that change lol Only did 2 miles on that. The majority was on other machines.
  
  The hip abductor is still creepy 😂😂😂 Some guy was on the machine next to me and grunting. Still doing the 100+ weights on it. I was surprised since its been forever. Expected to be on the 30 range lol
  
  I think this guy told me good job or something like that when I passed him. I wasn't sure since I think he was with someone and could have been talking to her? Idk I usually don't talk to anyone lol ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  My sister has a couple different Alexa's and they been freaking out. Not sure if my sister and her husband were listening to music on the plane but the music would go on here too. Like we didn't ask for ____ to play and it would. And if we did ask for something, the other ones would play something else.
  
  My sister does the whole ""turn the tv on"" and when we tried it would say ""ok"" but not do it. Or it would do the beeping noise and not go on.
  
  I heard my mom's phone ring and told her. She answered and it was my sister asking why SHE called her. We weren't near the phone so that was strange. Earlier, Alexa wanted to call people from my sister's contacts. We didn't mention calling her either.

  They have different clothing you can do. They actually just added some new clothing looks you can pick from.
  
  If you click on the shirt on the top right you can pick different clothing. They also give some bitmojis that have different clothes already done too.

   if you're 28-35 to be fair, sex is obviously completely legal so why tf not? but having a relationship on the other hand would be weird to me just bc you have nothing in common with an 18 year old kid at that age. kinda lame.
  ","
  I wouldn't want to have sex with someone that age. Legal or not. I'm not into 12 year age gaps. I don't think 18 yr olds have anything to offer me. We aren't on the same page. I can't relate. I rarely drink but I would want to have someone who could instead of relying on a fake ID. I don't want to be a cougar to them or his parents. Also the guy would probably be more into mind games and I don't need that. It would be really weird to show up to family parties with someone that age. Most guys aren't mature at that age.

  The age range. You are 28-35 but want 18 year olds as well? Also some guy had it from 20-60... wtf. EW.
  
  Cockiness. How is that working for you? He wasn't even that good looking. A computer nerd. You really want to start off by saying how good looking you are and no wonder why I looked at your page. There's literally nothing to say back to him lol He was probably a solid 6 and not really my type of guy
  
  I accidentally swiped right on a guy and he ended up asking what I liked about him 😂
  
  They only have 1 picture
  
  They didn't write anything on their page. They wrote too much. They have horrible spelling, slang for everything or don't use punctuation at all.
  
  They have a lot of pictures but it's unclear who it is or they overshare? Like cool.. you have a sister that got married. Enjoy lol
  
  This guy (I feel like I seen him before) had a picture of him with this kid. His page said he doesn't have kids. In the caption it says ""nephew""... who does that? It literally had the quotations.
  
  They ONLY write hi/hey/hello.
  
  I think it's very annoying when they spell my first name wrong. No effort. I didn't reply back to that guy. Was like nope.
  
  I think that's it for now.

  When we sold the house, there was a car that would kind of look like it was stalking our house. I went walking and passed it and then it randomly started and drove off. It would be there every day around the same time. Never noticed anyone get out of it. You'd see the headlights and then it would go dark. Idk was creepy lol

  I ended up adding a bit more megawatt than I took yesterday.
  
  Then I ended up having my normal shake to help repair muscle after swimming and then I had the great idea to add protein powder on top of that since I haven't had that much protein today. I think I added too much of that as well.
  
  I felt fine until my sister and her husband mentioned going out to eat. Then it went downhill after that. I think it was mostly the megawatt and the level1 that killed me.
  
  I hate puking. My throat feels awful. Just trying to relax now and hope i don't puke anymore

   The outside kitty showed up again. I felt so sad and went outside with food and treats. It run under the bushes and peeped at me with a small meow. I put the food down and it are lots. Then I gave it even more and it left some behind and drank lots of water and then I went in.

  Drinking some megawatt before hitting the pool. Strawberry kiwi flavor 😍
  
  It doesn't make you tingle but it does work very well!  I hope it works better at the gym than in the pool. I didn't bring my other preworkout flavors from a different company so hoping it's way better than those ones when I'm being more physically active.

   What did you do today?
  ","
  Woke up a little before I wanted to. I set Pandora album up and was up before that time.
  
  Had breakfast. Plain greek yogurt, stevia drops, strawberries and a Hershey kiss
  
  Went online. Got even more pissed about my favorite app being sold to a different company. They didn't warn anyone about it so everyone is going crazy. Signed a change.org petition to get it back. They literally wiped away everyone's hard work. It's also a platform that I use to do affiliate marketing with so I'm even more like what now???? I've been using polyvore for 9 years and they treat everyone like that?
  
  Took a shower
  
  Went to the gym to get the paperwork.
  
  Went to the new Goodwill. I ended up getting a pair of capri length workout leggings and on one side of the leg it says ""Game on"" in pink letters. They also have a new Ross (not open yet) and a Planet Fitness (not the gym I'll be going to but it is closer to me)
  
  Went to Frys to pick up a couple things. Fell in love with some dresses there. Pretty expensive though -_- cute bikinis but their other swimwear was pretty shitty besides this one red one-piece with criss cross near the boobs..
  
  Came back to the house. Had some brown rice with 6 chicken nuggets. I'd rather have strips or breasts but it's what my sister had.. so ya. Was hungry. Also had some hummus, wheat thins, black grapes and a few walnuts.
  
  I just changed into my bathing suit. Gonna hit the pool soon. Need to take some megawatt from 1stphorm.

  And it was hell. Portland airport to Baltimore DC and then to AZ. Had bad turbulence and different routes. Think we arrived an hour late than the normal time. Saw some lighting but luckily it wasn't that close to us either.
  
  There wasn't a gate opened so we were just on the track forever. Like are we ever going to get off this plane? I didn't feel like paying $8 to get wifi or $5 to watch a movie on my own device. They didn't really serve real food.. just nuts and other small things. lucky that we ended up buying sandwiches to eat on the plane before going to the airport. I kept checking the info on how much more time and felt like it barely changed.
  
  Got in around 9/10pm. Was very tired since was still on the east coast time.
  
  I did wake up early today, surprisingly. Was up at 8am. Ate yogurt and just hanging out. Then went swimming, layed out then took a shower. Finally asked for the wifi password lol

  Sugar is in a lot of things. I try to have it at 50+ goal and also rather get from fruits than processed junk. I'm not too strict with sugar. I rather watch the main macros (protein, carbs, fat) and also sodium content.
  
  It will be nice to have a gym routine again. Maybe a rest day thrown in. Walking and swimming are also my go to exercise if not doing the gym.
  
  In the end it will be. Rather enjoy my adult life than looking the same as when younger etc

They were more yes or no... or even shared their experience with past relationships when they shared a lot of the relationship with every single person.

  Still don't care. Also have no information about the incident. Nor do I want them.
  
  I'd rather get questions about myself or things that are relevant/relatable to my life.
  
  I don't go to clubs and I wouldn't use technology devices as a weapon. I'm sure a phone wouldn't do that much damage either. Just because one WOMAN does something doesn't mean all women will,

  ","
  Well fuck you then.
  
  Just because I don't take pictures doesn't mean that I'm not out there bettering myself. When I go to the gym I'm there for an hour and a half or two hours max. I don't bring anything with me besides a waterbottle. I don't want my phone to lug around from station to station. It would probably make me look at it more than doing what I came to do. I don't need added distractions. I don't really have any bottoms that have pockets when I workout. I like being in the moment. Taking a break from whatever devices. I don't need to have a bunch of crap photos of me at the gym to prove a point to people. I don't need to always talk about how much weight i lost either.
  
  Also I own 6 different 1stphorm products so it's kind of lame to own all that and NOT WORKOUT. Just because you don't see me doesn't mean shit.
  
  I don't ALWAYS need to tell people on here when I'm going to workout or I just did a workout. That shit can get annoying. I'm not always on here every hour on the hour. There can be huge gaps in the hours when I'm not on here. In April, I won't be on much at all.
  
  Foodwise i have been pretty good besides the odd Chinese food now and again. You don't always know what I eat unless I get asked about food or something on here. I'm not on a strict diet or anything. Diets don't work for me. Lifestyle change and moderation works for me. Having more protein than other macros helps. Using my 1stphorm products helps. Taking vitamins and shit helps.
  
  Do I know what you do 24/7? No. So i don't get why you *have* to be rude about me doing or not doing x,y, and z. I have admitted that this winter has been shit but that still doesn't change the fact that I'm still bettering myself in other ways. I have still lost a bit of weight.. just not where I want to  be / should be. I don't need anyone's negativity.

  It's whatever. Sometimes it can be fun to share how much of an ass someone is being when they do DNP? Or they stop writing dp and I forget to not answer it then. Like sometimes you need the space to write something back, ya know? It's just easier in most cases. Chances are most DPs are things that don't even need to be private in the first place so it can be comical in that way.
  
  But ya.. anyone can do dnp or just go on anon and I'll give more of a longer response... going back and forth on here can be a bit boring if I'm not in the mood or don't care for the topic. I'm here more for the Q&A but conversation can be nice as well.

  Then someone else who read that tagged me in a post talking about how i support Selena 😂 And to basically pass on hate to me. How our opinions don't matter. How black people are the best race out of every race. How black people aren't racist.
  
  Meanwhile they are giving hate to Selena and everyone who has an opinion different from them.

   oh i get it now.    Sagittarius is difficult to seduce, and rarely a seducer, but still often regarded as attractive – because of it. Sex might be quick, as if meaning nothing, but sometimes, at the spur of the moment, intense as a forest fire.
  ","
  I agree with the first part. You need to really impress me and then I'll be seductive right back. I don't feel comfortable with just anyone? Especially not anons when they want to be all sexual. Like I know nothing about you so I'm just going to come off more lame than actually being sexy right back lol Plus, I basically don't care for sexting that much these days. I basically grew up with aim, msn and creepy men wanting to talk with me when younger. It was ""cool"" but I'm more selective these days because of it??
  
  I don't agree with the second part at all. Sex means something to me. I'd also rather be doing it longer. The only part i agree about regarding sex is the intense part ;)
  
  Not every Sagittarius feels the same way.

  Maybe 10 plus? I don't think a kid really needs that stuff in their systems. It can also be bad for teeth. Most have enough energy without adding in soda to it.

   I think it's terrible that people would call you names based on your weight. That's so absurd & shows such a lack of intellect. I was fat as a kid, then lost a lot of weight through puberty, but never got to a place I felt good about. I never get criticized for my weight, but I'm not happy with it
  ","
  True. It's so dumb. I get a lot of ""are you fat, plus size"" and so many other things from time to time. It's like cool? Feeling bad about yourself or bored and want to project that to someone else. No thanks. They don't really know me, what i look like, my story.. ya know? They literally don't matter lol
  
  I've had a few people say things in person but it wasn't that horrible either? Rarely happened. Again, those people don't know you 100%.
  
  I have even had this young kid at the GYM say something before. Like what??? Literally working my butt off and they felt the need to say something rude. There's an indoor track that overlooks the basketball court. He should have been paying attention to his game and not me walking the track when taking a break from the actual gym area that's beside the track. It was also annoying since I lost a lot of weight before that. Like ok? Had the empathy that they don't know sh!t about me haha :)
  "
545592,"
   Sorry that came off as creepy. I know first hand what a sensitive topic this can be. I hadn't read everything on your page, so I missed some things. I'm always wondering how other people's weight issues evolve, as compared to my own. Thanks for answering :)
  ","
  Not really creepy but it makes me think it's more trolling or trying to get a rise out of me somehow lol Has happened quite a few times. I get curious ones and then people who are just trying to be d!cks about it. Along with name calling even though they haven't seen me XD
  
  I don't really see it as sensitive anymore. It's just whatever. It doesn't define me as a person. I have a voice like everyone else. It really shouldn't matter how much I weighed or what I weigh now. I don't care about taking pictures even though I look better than I used to. Still not where I want to be. I'm not photographic at all. My fashion is pretty casual so I feel like taking pictures in blah clothing wont make me feel better about the picture/myself either 😂
  
  As far as evolving, it's only been better with being more active + the gym. I've also done zumba in college. Eating more healthy. I still have junk sometimes. It had to be a lifestyle change for me. Diets don't work for me. I'd just yoyo. Eating in moderation and all that. I have also cut out soda and changed to just drinking tea and water. I have always loved swimming.

   Were you always overweight, even as a kid, is it something that happened as you got older?
  ","
  These questions are creepy to get out of the blue. I can understand if I was openly talking about my weight, fitness and all that. If this is trolling then it's pretty dumb. I've talked about it countless of times on here.
  
  Ended up gaining weight when I had a bad reaction to mosquito bites and had to get a steroid shot to make them go away. Main reason, before that I was skinny. I also shared a childhood picture a few days ago. Clearly skinny in it :P It's creepy seeing pictures from the first and 2nd grade since I was skinny and then the next year I'm not 😐 There was a school note asking about it and I apparently put on 50 lbs back then.
  
  Also bad eating habits here and there. I have also been pretty good at maintaining the same weight.
  
  If anything I'm at the smallest adult weight even though still in the overweight crap. It had nothing to do with puberty if that's what you mean. lol. I think I might have pcos so that could explain a lot of it as well, especially when older. My sister has always been skinny and just got treated with it. It can run in families.

  Vent with trusted friends about what's going on. The app Vent is also good since it's more anonymous.
  
  Personally, I'd analyze why I'm feeling that way. Take little steps to help.
  
  Drugs, alcohol... Not really the best way to cope ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Can make it worse

  None? Just the ones in gym class.
  
  I tried out for basketball once against my better judgment. Got hit in the head. Didn't end up going again lol I never liked basketball but mom basically made me. So I didn't really want to be there to begin with and then that happened, no thanks. Done lol
  
  Ones I wouldn't have minded doing;
  
  Track - I'm not a great runner so figured it would have been pointless. Also I don't think they had any girl teams???
  
  Volleyball - I didn't like the people on the team nor did I care for the skimpy looking outfits 😂
  
  Dodgeball - I don't think they had a team? I was always good at it though in gym
  
  Does zumba count as a sport to you? Did it in college.

  Had a normal dream and then the next part my mom was yelling that Lulu just died. Apparently she let Lulu go outside on her own and wasn't out there when she checked on her? That was scary. Felt real. My mom had a dream a few weeks ago where ""Lulu got hit by a truck and was flat as a pancake"" Poor Lulu. Hard being a small dog lol XD
  
  That sucked since it was 4am and was hard to get back to sleep.
  
  I basically woke up an hour ago. Not much has happened. Gave Lulu kisses and belly rubs since I felt bad 😂 Had a hot chocolate since I don't have any tea currently, my normal go to in the morning. Haven't made breakfast/lunch yet.

  ","
  Keep organized. Maybe set a limit.. ""I'll go to the gym X amount of times this week"" and follow through. I'd aim for a lower # if the motivation wasn't really there. Maybe keep active in a different way besides the gym? Dressing in workout gear tends to help. If you take preworkout and stuff then maybe have them readily available. Have a calendar or write post it notes that motivate you. Do one thing every day that you love.
  
  Just go and you'll feel so much better and productive!
  
  Find someone to go to the gym with?
  
  Maybe keep the eating on point.

I was in some weird house and there was a closet that had some jackets on the rack. There was this blue silky bomber jacket and I ended up putting it on. In the next room there was a lot of different mirrors all over the room. There was a huge full mirror and I tried taking a selfie. But it just wouldn't work like it would just come back filmy and blured. Also kept turning lights on and it still wouldn't let me take a picture o.o

545859,"
   If you've ever moved, how long did it take for the new place to feel like home?  Is there anything that happened or anything you had that helped make the transition easier?
  ","
  I've moved 7 times. Luckily most were in the same town or surrounding town so it wasn't a huge change besides a different house. Pretty much the same school districts. I feel like it was good since i still had the same friends and all that.
  
  I think going out to Arizona was a bit different. Parents sold the house. We ended up getting rid of a lot of things we didn't really need. Downsizing and all that. It makes you see the clutter in a different way. Especially since parents are getting older type thing. My dad is such a hoarder so it was chaotic getting rid of things. My sister and brother came to help with the mess as well. I ended up flying out to AZ with my sister when the house sold. So I didn't really have all my belongings with me. It showed me that I can be pretty minimalistic. Ended up living there for three years and then going back and forth to get out of the winter then coming back to the east coast in the summer.
  
  I'm not really sure what makes it easier. I feel like you learn more about the best way to pack. You have a blank slate to decorate with if you wanted new decor. Some areas can be better than others.

  School to me can be kindergarten all the way up to high school. I usually think hs aged when school comes to mind.
  
  College and university/uni are basically the same to me. It's what comes after graduating from high school. It's a higher level. You can get a degree based on what major/minor you do. To study = college. You get to pick what classes you can do. You don't really have a choice what you get taught in ""school"".

  My sister's wedding. I think it was more drained from dancing, running around all day  (bridesmaid) and stuff like that more than from drinking. I only had two glasses of wine and a apple martini when we went to the bar afterwards. We were also there til closing time. Like I basically slept all day when we drove back to the house the next day.
  
  If that doesn't count... then I'll go with that new years where I was sick and drinking southern comfort. Room spinning at the end of the night and ended up puking. I was a bit groggy the next day but it wasn't that horrible either.

  Whenever you and the partner have a healthy relationship. Enough money for a wedding or get hitched to safe for a honeymoon. Stable relationship. Real love. When both of you want the same thing out of life.

  I feel like I can buy my own food and say what I want as well. My dad is a sh!t shopper though. He buys things that only he likes. He's also someone who buys stuff for the sake of a deal. Like you rarely have ____ but buy X amount of it because of a deal? No thanks. Why waste the money on something you don't frequently make???
  
  As for clothing. Eh.. I was brought up to say ""thanks, i love it"" and all of those manners if it was a Christmas gift or whatever. I feel like it's probably best to include a gift receipt incase the size was wrong, person didn't really like and all that. I don't think that I'd say outright that I didn't like it.

  Woke up around 9am. Ended up just chilling on my bed and answering some of those questions from the Q&A book

  got me for Christmas. Filled in some of the ones that I knew wouldn't change by the time I got to *insert months here* I did end up falling asleep again and finally got up at 11am.
  
  Woke up to my package being here. So that was great. It was also wrapped in a plastic bag which was nice since all the snow we've got.
  
  Ate breakfast - overnight oats.
  
  Fed Lulu since my mom didn't feed her yet. She was begging at my mom's cereal lol so I was just like c'mon Lulu and made her the dog food
  
  Took a shower
  
  Opened the box and took pictures of the products. 1stphorm is hosting a giveaway contest where you can win a day or whatever it is working out with everyone, new supplements and clothing etc They have different things you need to do. One is basically giving a review of the products so I ended up just writing about the ones I got today. Would be cool to win but I don't really see myself as ""athlete material"" yet...
  
  Checked email + other sites/apps

  Little steps
  
  Tell yourself something you love about yourself. Big or small things.
  
  Take risks. Wear that. Do that. Whatever makes you happy or confident in the moment.
  
  There are a lot of ""self-help books"" out there. Most are pretty common sense. I enjoyed, You are a Badass. I think you get more confidence by actually being out there and living than actually just reading something.
  
  The whole fake it til you make it mantra.
  
  Believing in yourself. Again, can be big or small things.
  
  Mine fluctuates a lot. I'm not the greatest at taking pictures but I'm more confident in other areas. Know your worth. Try being the best possible you, in whichever way that means to you.

  I blame one of my dreams last night 😂😂😂
  
  I was sitting in one of those classroom desks. There was some kind of debate going on. Then this girl got called on and she did this whole rant about herself, her family and other shit that related to the debate. Next thing I know she's in front of me with a gun basically pointing it at me. Probably about an inch away from my face and taunting me about the debate, thinking i found it funny o.o I could feel being scared but I knew that I had to make eye contact with her and let her rant. I don't remember if I said anything to her but I was obviously watching and hoping that she wouldn't do anything rash.
  
  I don't think she shot me though. Usually when I have gun dreams, I end up getting hurt but I wake up before knowing if I die.
  
  I think it's probably a past life? It's always different ways and areas..

  IG - If we're mutual here then I'm ok with giving it if they wanted me there. I have a few people on there. It is annoying getting anons asking for it or people that I never even talked with. Not cool. I don't need fake followers like that. I'd rather gain them because they like me or the content. I need to delete some. I follow way more people than people who follow me. I agree with what Liam said about this as well. I don't need every single person. Someone tried hacking into my account before so I'm more wary of who I follow as well. I have also ended up getting one of those unfollower apps and delete the ones who have unfollowed with a few exceptions. I hate private accounts as well. I want to see what I'm getting into?? Also if we're mutuals then DMs are fine if they didn't want to talk in the open.
  
  SC - I don't use it much but so far it's only been guys following lol -_- It's whatever to me. I feel a bit weird giving it out because of the sexual name lol
  
  Kik - I have a few on there from here. I hate when anons ask for it again. I like keeping it more private and selective.

  It depends more on how much time I put into it and also commission if someone buys something. There's no real set amount. I did make  $1,000+ before. I ended up getting  $500+ from them and then got the  $1000 about a month later. I wasn't expecting any $$$ at the time since the site didn't really track my earnings. I was also a few months into working with that site so it was cool knowing that it was actually a legit site.

  Bored. I ended up starting a book but it sucks so bad! Guy kills himself when finding out his wife was pregnant + he got fired from his job and probably other reasons.
  
  Flipped a good amount into the book to find out that the wife finally had a daughter.
  
  Flipped again and the nun died. There was a nun at the beginning that noticed something was wrong about the day the guy died.
  
  Flipped to the end and it's basically talking about finding out secrets.
  
  The nun ended up lying that it was suicide so that the husband could get buried in the cemetery plot they already had waiting... so I'm guessing that the daughter  (she was pregnant with a girl) never found out that her father actually killed himself instead of just falling asleep while the building caught on fire because of what he tried doing...

At the time i thought I did but nope XD He was Jewish and never gave me presents.. birthday, Christmas or anything else. It was just one of those relationships were it went on too long. Wasn't how real love should be. He was younger by a few years. Only time I dated younger as well.

  Why would I pay for a shower when it's literally inside the house? What would I be giving back?

  What are you talking about?
  "
546625,"
   What do you think of people who try to push their views on people and they think they're always right. Example my friend is vegan and he says you should never eat any food produced by animals as it hurts them even things like cheese and milk.
  ","
  It is good to educate people but they should also shut up and let people decide what they like.
  
  I love animals, plants and all that but I still eat meat. Mostly chicken. I prefer almond milk to normal milk. I have a tiny bit of lactose intolerance so the almond milk helps with that. It's also less calories than normal milk.
  
  If the cows or other animals have a good upbringing then I don't see how milking them is wrong or taking the eggs. It's kind of why they came into the world? Obviously killing them is bad. I admit that. I wouldn't personally want to kill any animal for personal gain. I'm not into hunting. I'd probably be vegan if it wasn't for chicken. Lots of alternatives these days so it's not too bad.
  
  It's kind of like religion, it shouldn't be thrown into people's faces. There's talking about it and then there's debating and trying to make people convert. It's not going to happen overnight. I actually had a vegan account on IG unfollow me because I posted a meal that had chicken in it lol

  In Bitter Chill by Sarah Ward.
  
  ""In 1978, a small town in Derbyshire, England is traumatised by the kidnapping of two young schoolgirls. One girl, Rachel, is later found unharmed but unable to remember anything except that her abductor was a woman.
  
  Over thirty years later the mother of the still missing Sophie commits suicide. Superintendent Llewellyn, who was a young constable on the 1978 case, asks DI Francis Sadler and DC Connie Childs to look again at the kidnapping to see if modern police methods can discover something that the original team missed. However, Sadler is convinced that a more recent event triggered Yvonne Jenkins’s suicide.
  
  Rachel, with the help of her formidable mother and grandmother, recovered from the kidnapping and has become a family genealogist. She remembers nothing of the abduction and is concerned that, after Yvonne Jenkins’s suicide, the national media will be pursuing her for a story once more. Days later, the discovery of one of her former teachers’ strangled body suggested a chain of events is being unleashed.
  
  Rachel and the police must unpick the clues to discover what really happened all those years ago. But in doing so, they discover that the darkest secrets can be the ones closest to you.""

  It's not that confusing. The company basically has everything you need to use. I like keeping it more fashion based but theres lots of different things you could basically promote. I would be the affiliate and the actual companies are called merchants.
  
  Most banners/advertisements will open to a website if you click them. That is one part of it. The link would have your code to show that people viewed it. If someone ends up buying the product or other products from that site then you basically get commission from that, along with more views on the site.
  
  There's link urls that also could bring the person to whatever company page that they could check out.
  
  You might see a lot of people being all ""____ has a sale"" and then they might link the page with their embedded code in it.

Going to the gym, I still have a 1 month gift certificate membership from when I was last out there. It's a recreational one so there's lots to do.. pool, gym, indoor and outdoor track, skate park, tennis court, basketball, fishing and plenty of other things. The town also has some new shops going up so it will be cool to see the progress. I will be seeing my sister's dogs again, so cute. Along with their new cat for the first time. Hopefully it doesn't get out and run away. Their other cat ended up running away when they went on their honeymoon 😿

  ","
  Drinking more water helps. Helps with skin, getting rid of toxins and everything else.
  
  Supportive or like minded people also helps! It's not going to happen overnight. Try not to get discouraged. Love yourself while working on yourself.
  
  Those are all good starts. Meal prepping is great to do. You will eat the meals instead of going for just anything in the moment. It doesn't take that long to do either, depending on what you make. I don't really feel like saying what foods to eat since everyone likes different things. Maybe seek a dietitian? Be honest and real with them.
  
  What i do might not work for you etc We are all different. Like you, I like a mix of cardio and weights. I go back and forth between them when I go to the gym.
  
  Listen to your body!!!!
  
  I love myfitnesspal. It's great to track what you are eating. Seeing the macros (fat, protein, carbs) along with all the calories. Obviously it can be bad to do that as well. People might get really strict with counting and only focusing on numbers.
  
  Have you tried walking a little further each day? Or upping the weights a little more?
  
  I think taking measurements or pictures at the start and end of the month can be good! If the scale isn't going down but clothes fitting way better then it can be fun to see the differences.
  
  I know
  
   @breakfreefromlife
  
  has been doing dietbets. It could be a good way to go and could win money. I guess there's a 4% in a month and another that is 10% for 6 months? I think it's typically $30-35 to join. A lot of people will do free giveaways on IG for them.
  
  I love the 1stphorm fitness brand company. They have a lot of different products. I do use their vitamins. I have used their fish oil as well but that one is pretty pricy so I've just been using the drugstore Spring Valley one. Those two have helped a lot. I also take a preworkout from them before I go to the gym. I also have a postworkout one that helps repair the muscles. I have a meal replacement one as well. I know that powders might not be for everyone or for people just starting out but they have really helped me.

  I don't think so. The only loss I've dealt with has been my grandparents dying  (one still living), a friend dying. Past relationships or friendships stopping.
  
  None of them really affected me in attaining  something I have wanted? I would think any of the above would want me to seek those goals and be happy and whatever else I wanted even if they *weren't* there to witness it?

  Clothes, somewhat! Obviously was bigger growing up so I wasn't always as fashionable as I would have liked. But I don't really cringe much about the clothes...
  
  Writing. Yes. I'm more descriptive now. I don't really use run on sentences as much either. In school, I'd always make A and B's on essays.
  
  My style hasn't really changed all that much. I had the whole long braided hair. I had bangs a few different times. I have only got highlights so my hair has had various shades of blonde highlights in it through the years. I have mostly kept it shoulder length, collarbone length or a little past my boobs. There hasn't really been huge changes.. besides with weightloss. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  ""My name is Chloe Saunders and my life will never be the same again.
  
  All I wanted was to make friends, meet boys, and keep on being ordinary. I don't even know what that means anymore. It all started on the day that I saw my first ghost - and the ghost saw me.
  
  Now there are ghosts everywhere and they won't leave me alone. To top it all off, I somehow got myself locked up in Lyle House, a ""special home"" for troubled teens. Yet the home isn't what it seems. Don't tell anyone, but I think there might be more to my housemates than meets the eye. The question is, whose side are they on? It's up to me to figure out the dangerous secrets behind Lyle House... before its skeletons come back to haunt me.""

  Alcoholic
  
  Can be mentally abusive at times
  
  He has cheated in the past
  
  He actually used my msn messenger one time and was talking to someone. I don't know if they actually met up or just sexted but I didn't need her message about how she had a great time and mentioning him by name 😂 I think I replied saying how i was his daughter lol XD ya kind of gross and goes with the cheating theme
  
  Domestic violence towards my mom before. Hence not having respect for him anymore. Also kind of putting me in the middle of it / witness before.
  
  I know he's pretty ocd but I feel like he might have something else going on with him. He's pretty annoying, overthinks a ton, doesn't really ask normal questions if someone is talking about stuff. In his own world kind of thing. He'll even say things that might not have been said to get a rise out of you at times. Idk.. just weird lol

  Funny how your opinion doesn't matter. It's not your life. Why bother asking if you already know I do still?
  
  Being 30 is sad to you. Not being married is sad to you. Not being in a relationship is sad to you. Living with parents is sad to you.
  
  Sorry that no guy likes me right now or if they do they haven't admitted to liking me in that way. I'm not someone who always needs a bf in my life. I'd rather not be a serial dater. Some independence is nice. I don't need to be in a relationship because an anonymous user tells me that my situation is sad to them. Perhaps, you should worry about yourself. I'm not going to have a relationship just to say that I'm in one. I don't fall in love fast. I don't need to be with someone 24/7. I don't need to think about getting married when I don't currently have anyone.
  
  I don't have enough money right now to have my own place. I'm saving up. The streets vs living with my parents still. Such a hard decision :P Most of my friends are married or pregnant right now. I wouldn't feel right living with them as roommates. Like wtf. It would be stupid to rent something with another person.. like I might not always have the rent money. Paying rent, utilities, furniture and everything else isn't in the cards right now. You saying something is sad isn't going to make me change my mind overnight.
  
  I already know that it isn't the norm.
  
  I feel like I know who this is and it's quite sad that you feel the need to share ""your honesty"" like this. It's not needed. I know all this shit without you weighing in. Nothing you said is new to me. You probably have your own securities and projecting them to me. You aren't really being honest either. Just being rude and a jerk for no real reason. I'm surprised you haven't called me names this time.

   How much/often do u workout?
  ","
  About an hour or two when I go to the gym. I can pretty much go every day when I'm in the zone. Maybe 1-2 rest days.
  
  I've been slacking because of the winter. Another reason why I'm looking forward to April! I love the gym i go to in Arizona and I'll be more active in general. My sister has a pool so I'll be in it a lot too. The sun really helps me. I'm so sick of winter, snow and barely any sun :(

   so u eat a lot?
  ","
  I don't think it is that much. Afterall most things have the whole ""2000 calorie diet"" on them and I eat less than that.
  
  I was more hungry so had snacks instead of proper meals.
  
  Eating 1200 doesn't help me. Eat whatever amount works for you.

   do u like wearing skimpy clothes on a regular basis?
  ","
  Reanswering because I'm curious...
  
  What would skimpy clothing be to you? I did add a dress that might have been the reason for asking on my amazon wishlist earlier  (criss-cross one) but I don't think anything else there would be considered skimpy? Unless the bathingsuit cover up counts as well?
  
  Anyways, no. I usually wear leggings and a top or actual jeans and a top. I'm pretty casual.
  
  If you have me on IG.. you might have seen that stripey number which could probably be a little skimpy on the right body. Sadly, the shorts don't fit right now. The top looked tiny so didn't bother with trying it on. Besides that, I don't really think i have anything that is really skimpy lol
  
  One of my resolutions this year is to experiment with fashion  (hence the striped co-ed) but ya.. that didn't end up working.
  
  I'd rather be comfortable on the daily. Obviously if I had a date or something then I'd like to dress up a little more than normal but I wouldn't really want to come off as skimpy either. I'd rather feel sexy and sophisticated lol

  Well, I ended up writing this earlier to a question lol....
  
  I'm getting sick of this reputation that I'm just here to help people get off or them helping me. Wow.. three people shared d!ck pictures. Who cares? Get over it. It doesn't mean that I literally need to be harassed now for ""dirty time"". I'm not always horny or need much help from pervs here. You guys are making me feel like a horrible person. I'm not a wh*re or anything and it seems that I'm coming off that way since I put up with a lot of sexual questions / people. You can go help yourself. Not here to do that for everyone. I don't need these type of questions. ✌

   NOW THIS IS DEEP!

We all perceive things we see differently. 

We all comprehend and interpret what is laid before us independently.

However, if this is true, are our perceptions real? When the person stood next to us experiences physiological realities contrary to what we believe to be the same?
  ","
  We all have different reality. All have different views. We see things differently. All have our own side of the story.
