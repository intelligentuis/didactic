life , and honestly all ive done is that since we have been together . . . . and i know that hurts his mom a little bit . . all those years she thought she was the one that was going to save him and it ended up being me in less than a year . i just understand him better than she does . if they reject me they are going to lose their son . and i think they are finally realizing that because they stopped trying to say that he and i should take a break . .","497818":"heres a really good example so my bf has ocd and he has had ocd his entire life . his mom said that she thought he had slight ocd when he was younger but it wasn t fully developed so she just thought that it never was going to develop . so my bf ended up starting to do drugs because his ocd has gotten so bad and it helped . well his mom doesn t put the two and two together when he first started doing drugs before it was too late she blamed the drugs but didn t realize that the drugs were his way of solving his ocd . . . and it took a few more years for her and doctors to really figure that out and i figured it out less than an hour of just talking to him . when he told me about his history with drugs i asked why did you do them ? and he said it was because he liked them and it made him feel normal . so i asked is your ocd worse without drugs . and he was so caught off guard that i noticed he had ocd . its very small things he does but my sister has ocd so i know what it all looks like . so i notice things like that and other things as well .","497819":"apparently working two jobs so that im completely full time isn t enough . they want me work out everyday . not sleep in on my days off . clean every time i come home . basically just never be home . . and i should probably find the cure for cancer since

believe that my bfs parents did not realize that they were going to have to let go and mentally prepare themselves that their son will need to have a life without them and so since thats happening now they don t know how to react or live . sorry i just went on a rant but their relationship is sickening .","497820":"its am so im thinking about bed","497821":"i would have loved to be born in the late
