untucking it","752905":"i m learning to stop looking for happiness . people love to sell you this idea that once you achieve this , once you get that , once this happens , you will be happy and the reason you re not happy right now is because you don t have these things that you re chasing . but there is no pinnacle of life that you reach and then suddenly you re immune to being sad and bad things don t happen to you anymore . life is hard . life is sad . the world is deeply imperfect and unfair . and that is not going to change . instead of looking for this before and after life where once you reach the after , you re happy , i m learning that fulfillment and a real sense of joy is found in the everyday and it is found in love . not just the finding your soulmate type of love , but sacrificial love . the type of love you don t just feel , but you practice . when you live your life for something greater than yourself . when your actions are all centered around bringing love to those around you . when loving yourself isn t the end goal , but a necessary means for you to be able to love others more fully . when the goal of your life is to be happy , you will constantly be disappointed because happiness is a feeling that comes and goes . when the goal of your life is to love , you can attain that goal everyday regardless of what people do to you , how hard things are , or even if everything is falling apart , because the times it is hardest to love are the times when your love means the most . we as human beings were simply designed to give and receive love and when we are doing that is when we truly feel fulfilled , grounded , and alive","752906":"announcement we will be doing a livestream in honor to celebrate our golden ticket week ! ! check our instagram
