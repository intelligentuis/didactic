Lead the choir.\n  \n  I have researched the paranormal for many years. 13 or more years. I just find it a  challenging, interesting and curious subject to research. I find it something that not a lot of people research.  I do not do it in an evil or satanic way.. I am not like this... This is not my work... No. I am very respectful about the afterlife. The spirit life. I respect people that don't believe in it. I respect Skeptics. I just don't respect people that make fun of me, because of it. Because I have have other people that have seen what I have seen at the same time. Heard what I have heard.. I researched many different levels of the Paranormal. I go on Urban Explorations.

And then they charge it when actually you're supposed to wait until it completely dies. Give the battery a break.\n  \n  They say that you need to charge your phone to 100%, then use it all the way down to when it dies, let the phone die for a little while and then recharge it and turn it back on. Continuing to recharge your phone over and over is not good for the battery. Let the whole battery be in use, then charge it up.\n  \n  I have killed a few batteries not doing this. If your phone is showing that it is dying faster than what it was when you first got it, that is a sign of killing the battery. It will result in you having to buy a whole new battery for the phone.\n  \n  If your percentages are just jumping around and it dies at like 17% randomly? I find this another sign that your phone battery is going bad... this is just based off of my experiences.\n  ","55203":"\n  Make them beer battered and the onion rings is what I choose.\n  \n  Ever had a corn nugget?
