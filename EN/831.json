People love to sell you this idea that once you achieve this, once you get that, once this happens, you will be \u2728 happy \u2728and the reason you\u2019re not happy right now is because you don\u2019t have these things that you\u2019re chasing. But there is no pinnacle of life that you reach and then suddenly you\u2019re immune to being sad and bad things don\u2019t happen to you anymore. Life is hard. Life is sad. The world is deeply imperfect and unfair. And that is not going to change. Instead of looking for this before and after life where once you reach the after, you\u2019re \u201chappy\u201d, I\u2019m learning that fulfillment and a real sense of joy is found in the everyday and it is found in love. Not just the finding your soulmate type of love, but sacrificial love. The type of love you don\u2019t just feel, but you practice. When you live your life for something greater than yourself. When your actions are all centered around bringing love to those around you. When loving yourself isn\u2019t the end goal, but a necessary means for you to be able to love others more fully. When the goal of your life is to be happy, you will constantly be disappointed because happiness is a feeling that comes and goes. When the goal of your life is to love, you can attain that goal everyday regardless of what people do to you, how hard things are, or even if everything is falling apart, because the times it is hardest to love are the times when your love means the most. We as human beings were simply designed to give and receive love and when we are doing that is when we truly feel fulfilled, grounded, and alive \u2764\ufe0f\n  ","892186":"\n  Announcement: we will be doing a livestream in honor to celebrate our golden ticket week!!
