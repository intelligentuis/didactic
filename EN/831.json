were infected and transferred it onto humans and they didnt know about it till this outbreak occured ? another thing i heard was someone from china got it from eating bat soup and traveled over here and spread it . but deep down i just feel this is all like a government scam to cause people to panic and it s all made up besides we dont actually know if people are dying just from having corona

know who you truly are and what you do","769352":"it s kinda a two way side . because while the real father may not be involved the step dad or someone else could have adopted the child as his which means he has certain rights so it would be his responsibility to pay for all the children even if they re not biologically his . however if the real father is involved then it s his responsibility to make sure his child gets what is needed and make sure the mother is actually spending the money he gives on only his child . but maybe the real father isn t involved and someone stepped up to the plate to take care of all three of the kids and he gives money for the two that may not be his so they don t feel left out bc only his child is receiving money . lol","769353":"oof hope it s nothing
