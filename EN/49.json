But then again it depends on what type of relationships and how many a person is deciding to go in and out of because some people don't even take relationships seriously. They just want to be with someone, because they just don't want to be alone and it doesn't even matter who it is. People are losing self respect for themselves. People are not taking marriage seriously anymore, because people are not trying anymore with relationships. People aren't even sure if they're ready to get married. Some of them just get married? If you get married... you know for sure if you want to get married to that person. At least in my opinion.\n  \n  If you are unsure then you are clearly not ready for marriage and with that person at the moment... You have your whole life ahead of you, take your time, and if that person is being impatient and is hurrying you?... than they obviously don't care enough to give you time to think.... If they loved you.. They would be patient and wait! No matter how long. Honestly I feel like that's the best way to find out  if you need to be with them or not . If someone doesn't have patience?... that's a big problem in a relationship.\n  \n  Sometimes they want to say.. \"oh you don't love me,\" \"you're not serious about me.\" It's not that... you have to give a human time to get to know you fully.. 100 and thousand percent! They have to live with you! You have to make all decisions together... Constant communication! Loyalty! Trust! You've gotta be for sure.\n  \n  Idk.

Just a few.\n  ","53592":"\n  There are so many. That's So Raven, Life With Derek. That's just two. There are more.\n  ","53593":"\n  Thanks.\n  \n  This is the list from most favorite to still favorite and still have played before.\n  \n  #1 and favorite, Volleyball\n  \n  Played for 7 to 8 years and was team captain for a a few years before graduation. Almost went professional before my leg injury that left me no choice but to really sit out. Plus! I needed to focus on my school work!\n  \n  #2. Soccer. Played when I was real young growing up. Absolutely loved playing this sport! Definitely my 2nd favorite. Played for about 3 or 4 years. More or less. Enjoyed alot. Was sweeper and goalie best at.\n  \n  #3 baseball\/softball\n  \n  Played for about 3 to 4 years.. Maybe more? Can't remember much. My mom was the coach for a few years. I played right fielder, then catcher for a few years and then gave pitching a try my last year and then quit. I enjoyed playing but was not something I wanted to continue. Still enjoy teaching and playing with side teams!\n  \n  #4 Basketball. Was decently good at. Really enjoyed playing! Good at shooting 2 pointers and played good block under the goal. I could steal a ball easy. I'd push on people and steal. But this sport is sadly the one tjat messed me up. Hurt my leg very bad and was rushed to the ER. Hurt it after too much because of this other accident and they said if I kept her in my life I would have to get a very expensive surgery that would put me out for year so.. And then expensive after physical therapy. Thousands and thousands and I mean alot of money was on the line or I could just stop. I chose to stop. Didn't want to further ruin my leg. Till today, I still struggle with my hurt leg. May need the surgery anyway sadly....\n  \n  Lastly. This wasn't a sport that I fully went into, but was begged to join and that is the weightlifting team. He wanted me because he saw potential. And yes I could lift a lot and I still can. I enjoyed lifting because I felt like it was a challenge & it also is healthy for you. It also gave me a chance to work with my hurt leg. Try to make it stronger.\n  \n  Think that's it. Ha\n  ","53594":"\n  I love swans and dolphins.\n  ","53595":"\n  Cajun food.\n  \n  Spicy.\n  ","53596":"\n  Yeah.. I heard about it. It's terrible. Sad. People just are getting insane. Acting like they have no control? We are people. We have it. Just gotta find it in us. No excuses.\n  \n  It's sad. Very.\n  ","53597":"\n  Yeah, I believe in destiny anything's possible.\n  \n  I feel like my destiny is to start a family, a family business and get a house.\n  ","53598":"\n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/Qzw6A2WC5Qo\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","53599":"\n  My bad.\n  \n  Typo.\n  \n  Fixed\n  ","53600":"\n  Unsuccessful people you can tell don't really have sh-t and things aren't as easy going for them.\n  \n  But at the same time I mean anything is possible I've seen people come out of high school sophomore year not graduating and have became successful.\n  \n  So I mean success can be really small to someone but yet so big as someone else.\n  ","53601":"\n  Well I have my regular stuff I look up all the time.\n  \n  My main is different levels behind the paranormal. Sometimes I even go on expirations. Wish ya could come! They aren't always scary and serious sometimes they are funny and fun. Quite spontaneous, adventures.\n  \n  Geography and culture is another I favor.\n  \n  Looking up different\/secluded places. Places that are thousands of years old that people don't visit and learn the history and the culture of it. I like to research different biomes. Rocks. But I also like to research the food and how they prepared in different countries just different types of things that are done all over the world that's why I like this app so much. Because I can talk to people and they tell me all kinds of stuff about their country. It is so interesting and I kind of find it slightly respectful because I enjoy listening and it interest me so much. I show so much love when them telling me because they don't have to tell me? But I really love it and appreciate it alot. ??\n  \n  Then Meteorology.\n  \n  When was going college, this was my chose major and then my secondary was going to be geography that's why I like researching these two so much. I love learning about natural disasters, the process that you have to do to get in and out of them the science behind it all..\n  \n  All good.\n  \n  Other things I like too.\n  \n  But these are y favorite.\n  ","53602":"\n  To see that we are all humans. All one thing in common. We are human. No matter who you are, where we're from, the color of our skin, our views, how old we are, man or woman, we are all human.

Well ya can't be that judgemental, cause ya wanna know something? ya a little like them, HUMAN. FACE IT. Embrace it.

Creoles, like Cajuns, have contributed so much to New Orleans art, music and social life; without them, New Orleans wouldn't be the unique city it is today.\n  ","53614":"\n  Yes.\n  \n  Cajun but more or less Creole in my family.. I have a French background though. My folks and surrounding folks are from the Bayous and New Orleans and I do have folks in France and I have background of French.\n  \n  But yes.. Information bellow on it...\n  \n  Cajuns are the French colonists who settled the Canadian maritime provinces (Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) in the 1600s. The settlers named their region \"Acadia,\" and were known as Acadians. In 1713, the British took over Canada and expected all settlers, including the Acadians, to defend the kingdom. The British demanded that the Acadians adopt the king's Protestant religion.\n  \n  Over the next forty years, the Acadians' refusal to abdicate became a political and religious threat. The British government seized farms, burned villages, and expelled Acadian families. Families were separated as British soldiers loaded them onto ships with different destinations. Family members were shipped all over from New York to the West Indies. Some were sent down south to the Louisiana territories. Many Acadians found some acceptance in Louisiana, with its strong French background and Catholic heritage. Many family members were reunited there as they sought to locate one another.\n  \n  It is here the Acadians eventually became known as \"Cajuns.\" Cajuns developed their own distinct lifestyle in the swamps and surrounding areas of South Louisiana. Cajun contributions to New Orleans and Louisiana are immense, and have improved the quality of life we now enjoy.\n  \n  Many people think we have a Brooklyn accent when we speak. It is my opinion that the Acadians who settled along the U.S. eastern seaboard are responsible for that \"New York\/Brooklyn\" speech!\n  ","53615":"\n  Idk? None? Lol.\n  \n  Probably caue with Facebook there is usually more information with where people are located and some people don't feel comfortable with adding and talking with people on there.\n  \n  But the other apps.
