   Where did you say kasey being a big girl was wrong? 
All you said was that her boyfriend doesn't like big girls and she's a big girl , so it most likely won't last?

  "
751330,"
   Guaranteed it's some insecure dark skin girl who is the anon, I'm sorry but as a mixed girl that's all I've heard say stuff like that. They can't stand when you acknowledge you're different which there's nothing wrong with , they assume you think you're better than them which is sad.
  ","
  Which is so sad.
  
  Nobody should think they’re better than anyone.

751331,"
   If your son has a kid with a black girl, would you consider the kid mixed or black? Since the great grandma would be white in that case but the % would be low, something like 15.

  I’m no where near dark lmao.
  
  Especially if you see me in person

751339,"
   Yeah but your son is 75% black and as he gets older he'll get darker, and your daughter is still an infant so it's hard to tell

  My son is 5 1/2 I doubt it .
  
  My nephew is 6 and is dark like his mother and she’s Guyanese and my brother is my skin tone lol. And my niece is my brothers color and she’s almost 2.
  "
751340,"
   Your son could pass for Dominican tbh and you don't really look black it's weird cuz you'd expect your kids to be dark skinned cuz of the dad but I guess your genes are strong

  My son I believe will stay my color . Only in the summer her gets dark. Our daughter I think will get like his skin tone as she gets older .

  I don’t think it’s necessary in elementary school. I believe it’s for the parents to teach if they like.
