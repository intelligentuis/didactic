My nephew's uncle had a ghost app going when we were looking in the small shed like storage areas. I don't know if that was real but it was creepy.

I guess its $20 per person and if you do a tour, they give you a bunch of ghost hunting gear to use. Already spent a lot at the other place. But we basically sneaked in XD We were going to go up the old elevators but noticed that you needed a key to actually use it :( Then there was more stairs nearby that led upstairs but that needed a guest hotel key to open the doors. So that was annoying. We didn't really feel any energies when we were in there but I feel like we weren't on the right floors for that either or its just a scam lol\n  \n  then went out to eat.
