  ","
  It could just be that you hit legs a lot more at the gym then you do with upper body. Like for example I probably hit legs once or twice every other week so when I hit legs my legs are always sore. However when I hit any upper body it’s not really sore. Maybe try doing different leg exercises that your body isn’t use too.
  "
719017,"

  "
719022,"
   Hey Michael! I had a question. Should I go no days off or a break day at gym?
  ","
  Ok so everyone asks this question a lot. Rest days are important to allow your body to recover especially if you don’t meal prep and intake the daily nutrients you need to build mor muscle. I normally take 1-3 rest days and maybe more depending how hard I push myself. This week I went to the gym 6 times and am doing 1 rest day. Next week I’m probably going 5 times and taking 2 rest days. You never want your body on a set schedule in the gym. You want to trick your body to experience muscle shock to build muscle. Hopefully this helps 😊 stay grinding

   Fitness question, why did my arms and upper body get sore but my legs and lower body didn’t? I was forced to work on my legs and lower body again as my upper body hadn’t recovered yet, any advice?
  ","
  It can take up to 24-48 hours for a body part to get sore. For example I didn’t hit legs till Tuesday and starting today when I woke up my legs were sore. It’s been at least 30+ hours. Also it could be that you’re just not doing enough repetitions. Remember key to building muscle is pushing it past it’s breaking point to where you need to push for each rep

Everyone has a secret talent that no one else has. The people that rely on judgement to take away your freeness of love and happiness are those that don’t know what that’s like... maybe it’s cause those people don’t know what it’s like to be happy.

  I’m 21 now. I’ve been drinking since I was a sophomore in high school so probably about 16 at the time. However it was only on occasions like parties and New Years if I was home and wasn’t going out that night. Honestly it’s all about being responsible with alcohol. I have parties every Friday at my apartment and I make sure no one leaves if they get to messed up because I always make sure there’s someone sober there for safety and responsibility of us. Now for drugs I would recommend staying away from them completely. They have no benefits what so ever. If anything they just make you depressed and ruin your life. So many of my friends are in dark places now because of it and they’re stuck there. Hopefully this helps. :)

And it allows you to change there life and give them the life they wish to live

  Love is a feeling, expression, emotion all mixed into one. Only yourself can personally feel and interpret because love is different for everyone.

  Hate to break it to you, but everyone in life has a job. Being a student is a job, being a parent is a job, being successful is a job. Nothing comes handed to you unless you work for it. All I’m trying to say is if you rather travel because you can’t sit behind a desk or run an office as a CEO or a position like that maybe you should look at becoming a traveling agent or work for a cruise ship or airplane airline that way you can travel for pretty cheap while getting paid for it. But that’s just my suggestion based on your work ethic and the way you’re making it seem.

  It depends what model IS are we talking about.? If we’re talking about the IS F and then I’ll have to choose the IS F because it’s a luxury sports race car basically. But if you’re comparing a IS 250 or IS 350 to a G37/Q40 you can’t really choose because each have there pros and cons based on them being two different types of cars. You’re basically comparing more of a speed demon car compared to a more laid back chill ride for traveling.

   I’m an early grad, what’s something I can do while out of school ( I can’t get a job)
  ","
  How old are you? I had a job since I was 8 years old. I worked for my own mowing company of course with the help of my parents getting me the things I needed. Then at 14 I applied and got hired at publix and currently am still there as of 7 years. Right now I’m in college working towards my degree and looking for internships. So you saying you can’t get a job as an early grad doesn’t make any sense. So either your background history (things you’ve done in the past like records and stuff) is terrible and that’s why no place wants to hire you or you’re just not putting in the work for a job and showing them that you standout compared to everyone else.

  Feelings are something that are earned. Feelings work differently among everyone. Some people may get feelings from nice things people do, from looks, from the way they interact with one another. Feelings come mainly from one on one interactions. This may be correct or incorrect but like I said feelings work differently for everyone. But to be able to have feelings you have to have emotion otherwise it doesn’t work. They go hand in hand with one another.

  From this question I’m guessing you mean what I dislike the most. There’s quite a few I can list. Top 3:

  2. Disrespectful people (this includes those that make fun of people with disabilities or judge other people based on what they like to do)
  
  3. People who pretend to be someone who they’re not.

  The reason she missed my party was because she was with her new boyfriend Cody literally a week or two after we broke up.
  "
719841,"
   Emma said that because your mom always got in the way of stuff. You guys had the whole summer planned and she spent it all by her self. even when you guys could hangout  you always had to bring your friends with you. Never any alone time.  As I recalled you also missed her birthday. So maybe.
  ","
  For the record. I know who you are. I’m not a dumbass. I’m not going to call you out though cause that’s rude. But I focused on passing school and spending time with my family and friends cause I have people in my life that mean something to me. And for the record I didn’t miss her birthday. I was in school so I didn’t have a choice. But I did celebrate her birthday the week after by cooking her a home cooked meal and it was just the two of us so she can’t say shit.

  Love is defined as a word that you’re willing to do anything. Love is an action, it’s not just a word that you can use daily just to make people feel good. Like if I’m going to tell someone I love them I’m going to do so in such a way that shows I would go way out of my way for them and do whatever it takes to make that someone happy. That’s what love is.

She really liked you and she was really hurt when you broke up with her. I just want her to be happy.

I also know that she really misses you Mike. You should talk to her.

  No it really shouldn’t. She’s with Cody. That’s wrong. She doesn’t know it but Cody her current boyfriend actually got dismissed from the navy cause he got injured during training but still no date on when he’ll be back home.

  I would try to reach out to that person and find out why they wouldn’t let me talk to my best friend. Like people shouldn’t be able to control who you can or can’t talk too. It’s all about your own life and you make your own decisions. Don’t let other people control your life. I’ve been in that situation and I learned my lesson because I lost so many friends and family because of it but luckily I was able to gain them all back after I realized my mistake.

   Science involves experimenting to figure out how things work; how they operate. Why is evolution, a theory about history, taught as if it is the same as this operational science? You cannot do experiments, or even observe what happened, in the past?
  ","
  I’m sorry but I disagree with your statement. Look at our society today. Did we improve from society back in the 1800s 1900s? Yes. Are people still racist even though we overcame separation? Yes. Evolution is more of a proof science through history than an actual experiment you observe. And this is why you see history repeat itself. It’s an infinite loop of evolution that keeps repeating if we aren’t educated on the events that happened before our time to keep those events from happening again.

   What do they mean when they say a cell phone is ""unlocked""? What ia the difference? I know its been previsly owned, but is that really a bad thing or no? Thanks.
  ","
  If it’s unlocked that means everything is completely erased from it. No phone service or contract with a certain company. If a phone is locked that means you have to physically take it to a phone company for them to unlock it and I believe there’s a fee for unlocking it as well. That’s why you see many people buy unlocked phones instead of locked phones. Or at least this is my take on it. Not sure if my information is correct but that would explain why unlocked phones cost more than locked ones.

  It honestly all depends. If they want out on a relationship you should respect their decision and give them the space and then be friends for the time being.

If you really care about them and they don’t see you’re doing everything for them show them and maybe they’ll decide to stay. If not then you just have to move on but it’s always better to move on as friends that way if things go bad for the other person in the future you could always be a rebound and she/he can see how much you really cared about them

  That is a fact but let a guy receive compliments for once from other people. You know you females get compliments from every damn guy in this fucking world whether you have a boyfriend or not.

  She knows I wouldn’t cheat. And it’s a free world if a girl thinks I’m cute she thinks I’m cute end of story.

   I think you should fight for her no matter what. She’s doing a lot more for this relationship then you are. She truly cares about you. So do something before an other guy comes along does something that wows her. On my opinion
  ","
  No shit. (Don’t take that so hard)  but I’m trying too and yea I have a lot of shit in my life right now that’s going on. And if you honestly think I’m a give up my future of studying in school for a relationship then you need to figure out your priorities. No one should be more important than you. You is what matters. Make yourself happy and make others happy in between when you can but the main priority is your future.

  Don’t be judgmental and respect everyone. You don’t know what they’ve been through or what they went through or currently facing right now.

   I’m 21, and well my life is just starting, as they all say. I’ve been doing bad in college and I’m not willing to admit it but I’m quite depressed. I’m not to worried about my future cuz quite frankly I hope I’m dead before I turn 25. I’ve never told anyone this. Dose any one feel the same way?
  ","
  I can relate. I’m turning 21 soon and honestly life is just hard. College is hard. I’m studying engineering so if you think you got it hard try remember how to code and create your own formulas. One of the most difficult things to do. As far as life goes you have to think of it as a game. Think as college being the level and life the obstacles or the objectives you have to overcome. You can do whatever you want in life and it’s only up to you to make that decision. There were many times I said to myself I was just going to drop out but I pushed myself to keep going even though I had to give up a lot to pass my class such as hanging with friends, going to parties, going out, etc. anything and everything is possible and for those that say it isn’t are those that want you to fail. You should embrace your failure and learn from it to be successful. That’s what makes you unstoppable. Hopefully this helps and remember just try to focus on what makes you happy no matter how hard life tries to hit.

You may need to lean into it at first so he knows that it’s ok for him to do so

  I would agree that he probably does like you in this case. I mean does he offer to go out or do you offer him to come out with you? If he offers then respectively he could just be nice paying for you because he gave you the invite. However if you invite him out and he still insists he pays for you then 80% he most likely is into you.

   How can you tell a person is in to you *
  ","
  It depends. If you’re a guy and want to know if a girl is into you then look at body language. Most likely the girl will be smiling a lot, laughing at the things you say even though they may not be that humorous, they twirl their hair when talking to you, blushes when she talks to you.
  
  For a girl who is trying to find a guy that’s interested in her then look at the guy body language. Is he open armed or closed arm, is he smiling at you whenever you’re talking, keeping great eye contact, shaking a little because of nervousness.
  
  These are some signs that I noticed from my experience.

  Ok so I’ve been in somewhat of a similar situation with one of my exes. If he’s accusing you and playing mind games with you he is most likely cheating and is making the relationship toxic to you and him and the best thing to do is drop all contact with me.

Each have there pros and cons but everyone’s opinion would differ.

   What would be harder for you, to tell someone you love them or that you donot love them back? ?

  Those are both really hard things. I’ve been through both of them. It honestly depends on the person and knowing how they’ll react. It’s hard telling someone you love them because you don’t know how they’ll react when you say or if they don’t have similar feelings and vise versa when you tell someone that you don’t love them back it’ll be like the same thing.
