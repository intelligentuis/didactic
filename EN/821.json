they fail to realize that they are perfect the way they are already . you don t need to try to change in order to be accepted or fit in . because someone out there appreciates and loves everything about you and you just need to find them . we all have our strengths and weaknesses as well and together that s what makes the dream team . work together and stop comparing . and learn to love yourself and your flaws","759712":"that s nice","759713":"hey ! ! sorry i m behind on answering questions but my week has been pretty great . just been keeping myself busy as much as i can and
