   Why do married men want affairs with much younger girls?
  ","
  The desire to test the waters. Women do it too perhaps we don't have to try as hard to test it. But ""taken"" people who become lackadaisical or have a partner who is sometimes need validation. Eek.

  Morality is relative to the person just like religion is. And I would argue the partner in crime & time & place is important too. Folks can get into good mischief or be haphazard.

  Sometimes when emotions aren't valued or seen as weakness in a household its hard to easily express them. Its not always physical abuse althk it can be. Neglect of a safe space for emotions is huge! We all have them & we should all be given the freedom to express their range...not just anger and happiness. We're so much more as humans. Be patient with yourself & those you care about.

Let's not forget Thor: Ragnorak dark & powerful!

  That's tricky. Ex-lovers tend to be cordial or enemies, but in terms of friends that's different. Hidden or repressed feelings on one person's part can ruin it. Make sure its strictly on the friend tip & do it if the friendship is that beneficial. Recognize the signs if someone is trying to rekindle something you're not interested in. But if u live within 30 mins or have the same friends you'll be around ex-lovers often anyway. Be smart.

  I watched the 1st season of Unorthodoxed today on Netflix. It was painful to watch Etsy, the main character be stifled & held down at every turn.

  ","
  I don't have a partner. But a long time ago in a galaxy far far away I did. 3 points. 1. People make time for what they want. How much are you both investing in the relationship? Is it equal? Perhaps he gives in other ways 2. Support a man's ambition. Recognize when he makes a sacrifice to prioritize you. 3. Bonus: If he's earnestly working towards goals...this may not be the time for him to date. BONUS: Don't take it personal. Evaluate what he's giving vs what you truly need.

   What are your thoughts on feminism? What about their slogans?
  ","
  I can honestly say I do not follow the feminist movement. I don't know its leaders or slogans. There has always been a disconnect with the race and the feminist movement. Black women have the issue of intersectionality that isn't covered solely by either side. Very frustrating, yet a common reality. There are countless examples. Our experience is highly nuanced or complex due to historical constructs that aren't reflected in the feminist movement.

  My workout routine is pretty abysmal. I run a trail of varying elevation a few time a week. I should do my planks and burpees...I procrastinate becoz I hate them. Circuit training works best for me, but its not as easy to accomplish in my current household. I never thought I'd miss the gym. And I hate working out with friends in a park atmosphere. Anyway I need to work on strength & balance. So there's that.

  If you are interested in someone or newly dating, I'm not sure that this matters any more than asking how many relationships the woman has been in. But I do know women ask men this question. So to be fair...you have the right to ask. It can be a touchy 1st date subject. At least let it happen organically.

  I think anger is a byproduct of other feelings. Root out the cause. Deal with it. We can allow anger to control us or deal with the feelings. Being angry isn't weak, but allowing it to grow causes us to make poor decisions and do not so smart stuff. Channeling anger into determination or creativity or even love breaks the seal towards mastering our bodies.

  Yes, the person must be of legal age. And be able to relate to some of the things that I did growing up. There's an easier flow with people of the same experiences of timeframe. At least be knowledgeable of my era.
  "
337895,"
   When is the last time you went to the library?
  ","
  I love libraries!!! Its been quite some time. And I'm a bit leary now as my state rolls out new regulations due to covid-19. North Jersey or NY Metro area  was hit hard.
  "
337896,"
   If you learn something that you never get to use (a language, for example) is that a waste? Why?
  ","
  Hmmm...sometimes the act it self of learning is the lesson. The journey to the other side. And all the stick-to-it-tive-ness required. A true microcosm.
  "
337897,"
   Have you received a celebrity's signature before?
  ","
  Yes as a teen. I live in an area where we see quite a few, so I don't ask for sigs. Most of the time I will act like I don't see them, so they have a normal day with family, at least while around. Or a simple head nod of acknowledgement.
  "
337898,"

  "
337904,"
   Do you think you can choose who to love? Or are we carried away by our feelings?

  "
337905,"
   What‚Äôs the one book you think everyone should read?
  ","
  The Alchemist by Paulo Coehlo

337906,"
   If you have a gf or bf, would you care if they liked the same shows you do? Would you try to get them to like the same stuff you do? Or is it not really a big deal? (Cuz many ppl who like anime/certain shows on dating apps got annoyed when I say I don't like it & try to get me to like it. üôÑ)
  ","
  When in a relationship its good to experience some of the things your partner likes, out of courtesy and care. Perhaps watching a show, attending and event that he/she likes, but you don't have to be ""into it"" or do said activity regularly. It's good to see what he/she is passionate about. However, don't go haywire trying to be something you're not. And continue to like what u like!

   What happens when two lonely people get together?
  ","
  Hopefully, they are alone but not lonely. If they are just alone, they can compliment each other. If two lonely people get together, they might make the mistake of filling holes in themselves with each other. When they break up...still broken and attached.

   Why do people tend to answer questions from people who are trending on ask.fm or with more number of likes or blue tick than users doing okayish or trying to grow?
  ","
  I don't have very many followers on askfm. Nor do I like the practice of deciding who is important enough to respond to or send questions.
