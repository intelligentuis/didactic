Isn\u2019t that what eHarmony started, then MySpace, followed by Facebook\/Instagram, then Match.com, and now every form of social media from Tinder to Tumblr.\n  \n  Just because you met someone online doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t expand it further than just that.\n  \n  For instance the obvious; meeting that someone in person.\n  \n  After that, meeting up with them another time; then another, then another. You may not know it at the time, or had any sort of intention besides just being friends.\n  \n  After some time of getting to know said person, you start to become closer and what from that emerges, could be\/is love.\n  \n  I think it when it comes to falling in love, even with someone online; it all matters on how much time and effort your willing to put in to push it further than that to.\n  \n  I say it like that because of course you can say, \u201coh I love them!\u201d\n  \n  (referring to the person you met online) and that could be based solely off of looks; but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s love.\n  \n  Love is a lot deeper than that.\n  \n  Which is why I believe it is possible to fall in love with someone you just met. People believe in love at first time sight, I do too. But like I said, it all depends on what you\u2019re willing to put in to push it further than that to make it more than just seeing them through a computer\/phone screen or just seeing them from afar. And from doing that, introducing yourself to them and talking to them more, to hanging out with them, and then getting to know someone on a deeper level from all that combined, you can and will find love. Now whether or not that feeling is reciprocative is a whole other story.
