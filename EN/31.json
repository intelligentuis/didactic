She then walked up to the person on the video game and the person felt threatened so they almost tried to kill her. But instead something told them not to and she got in their car and the dude got in their car and just drove her around for a while. The two people finally got to wave Xbox Live party where they could actually hear each other and talk and started to exchange friendly words and greetings. The two immediately hit it off and became friends. Ever since that day they were good friends. Maybe about a week later she started to notice some sort of feelings for that person. But she ignored it and kept being friends with the person. She most definitely could tell that he liked her. They kept exchanging words back and forth and talking as friends and after a couple of weeks they actually told each other they really liked each other.

Say for instance I'm making a spaghetti right okay... But I will chop up tomatoes or get me a can of tomatoes and a can of tomato paste and will create my sauce. Out it together. (Or you can just simply get you a can of already ready tomato sauce from your local grocery. They have that too and that can save you time if you don't want to make home made. Ragu. The traditional one or the meat added one.) But I will just get some tomatoes and smash them down and even make my own. You just have to adjust it with salt, garlic, Italian seasonings, maybe even some of the minced garlic more or less. Onions different spices and other sauces.\n  \n  Just things like that to make and shape your own homemade spaghetti sauce. I think honestly making your own homemade is the best because you can make it taste the way you want. You can make the sauce more Tangy or maybe more sweet or maybe strong-tasting or spicy. When you're making your own homemade, you need to slowly make it and try the food as you go. Taste the sauce. If it does not taste good, then add different seasonings to your taste buds to the sauce to make it taste the way that you want. Sometimes you have to add more water to make it more liquidy and sometimes you have to add more tomatoes and thick tomato pulp to thicken the sauce more. Adding even a slight bit of different types of BBQ sauce and sugars can help also make the sauce taste better. But honestly that's just what I do. I like my spaghetti sauce to taste really really good and not be so harsh on your stomach when going down.

We have to put it in multiple bags and be very clean about it. Which I'm fine with. I have always been that way.\n  \n  But we have these giant garbage bins that we put our garbages in. Usually when we take the garbage out we gather all of the bags together and put them into another bag and then close that back.

I mean... You can't do it in a weak, stupid way. But beat them with the facts. With kindness and stand up to them. Don't give them any information about yourself. They don't know you and don't need to know you. Don't feed into their hate. They want you to give them attention. They are bored. That is why they are bothering you. You are giving them something what they want. You are putting a show on for them. Your entertaining them. Something. Just tell them to screw off once and be serious. Then move on. Don't look at them. Nothing. Ignore. Get away from them. If they touch you. You turn at them and look at them as serious as possible and tell them to not touch you and then if they keep touching you or hurting you. You teach them back how it feels to not want to be touched and defend yourself. And if they I want to start tattle telling and asking questions to why you touch them back... well then you tell them... well how do you like being touched when you don't want to be? That's what you kept doing to me? so I did it back. Leave me alone. As I said before. And do not touch me.\n  \n  And if they do it again. Stand up for yourself fully. And you know what I mean. They keep touching you. Physically defend yourself.\n  \n  I don't really recommend tattle tailing but I would definitely show signs of you not wanting them to touch you and you. Warnings. but at the same time you just want to walk away move on and ignore them. When you do that that's you showing that you're not feeding into them and you don't care but if they really start to touch you and stuff that is crossing the line. People should keep their hands to yourselves. There is absolutely no reason for them to have to put their hands on you.\n  \n  They touch 1st. Say no. And keep.

Lavender is a good source to help you sleep.\n  \n  I have a bottle of lavender essential oil and sometimes I put a little down on my neck and a little bit out of my nose then I get a washcloth and rub it in a little bit to not make it so strong with the smell.\n  \n  Before you do this taking your really warm shower for about 10 to 15 minutes is really good to help me go to sleep.\n  \n  Make yourself extremely comfortable. Make sure that your sheets are clean and that the room is adjusted at the temperature that you want. Make sure you're not too cold or too hot but perfectly comfortable.\n  \n  Honestly reading makes me really tired. Visualizing things in a book is almost like a TV show to me and makes me go to sleep really fast. So after you take a shower and apply the essential oils and get comfortable and adjusted temperature in your room may be read a book for a little.

We also leave the light on above the stove. (That's it I think.) Keep the outside light on only at night.\n  \n  But the reason why we leave those few on is cause have dimness issues with my eyes so we always have to leave one or two small lights on throughout the house so I don't fall at night. But we honestly try to preserve light. Plus, to have a cheaper light bill. Also, I always grew (was raised) up to just have natural lighting going (always taught to save) on into the house and have no lights on. I also went to a school where we did that. We just decided to open the windows and use just projectors instead of putting multiple lights on. Plus when it was really hot in the summer that helps cool it down..\n  \n  But it's always good to keep one or two lights on in your house when you leave sometimes.
