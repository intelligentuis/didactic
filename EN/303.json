urban environments , especially busy areas like new york city . i d much rather live somewhere rural .","280351":"depends on which bagel store deli you order it from .","280352":"i ve never tried onion bread before ! ! although i have had onion bagels , which are delicious with cream cheese .","280353":"mental health advocacy .","280354":"garlic bread , of course .","280355":"hello i m feeling pretty well today , and i m just working at the moment . the windows are open and there s a nice breeze coming in , which is super refreshing .","280356":"i don t have any thoughts , i don t know very much about him .","280357":"that s absolutely horrifying . i thankfully haven t seen that , but i can t believe that there are people out there who believe that is okay .","280358":"i try to arrive to places early i absolutely hate being late to appointments or meetings or parties , etc etc . i m usually minutes early , and even when i used to commute to work , i d get there about minutes early so i didn t feel rushed .","280359":"i d say anywhere from and up . that s my personal opinion , anyway .","280360":"something hearty that s more filling than having a bowl of cereal or oatmeal , lol . i made myself an egg sandwich .","280361":"thank you yes , i m staying safe . i ve been working from home since mid march and we don t have an established date to return to the office .","280362":"i m doing well i made another good breakfast this morning , and i m currently working . i feel pretty good today .","280363":"there s quite a few of us on here ! ! you re not old at all though , then again most of the people i associate with irl are between years old , haha .","280364":"sure , i m curious about what people look like , but i also respect their decision to keep themselves private .","280365":"there are a few people i m curious about , yeah ! ! but it s ultimately up to them whether or not they re comfortable revealing their voice online it isn t for everyone .","280366":"honestly , i was incredibly bored and thought it would be a nice change of pace for my page . it s nice to actually see hear the person behind the account instead of reading their words on a screen .","280367":"i m pretty young , but i m also one of the older people who use askfm . so for a lot of people on here , they consider me to be old , lol .","280368":"my last selfie was taken in my bedroom .","280369":"hello do you have a question ?","280370":"aw , thank you ! ! i m slowly learning to like my voice .","280371":"yeah , my voice probably makes me sound a lot younger than i actually am , lol .","280372":"thunderstorm .","280373":"? ? ?","280374":"lol , you re welcome ! !","280375":"a molecule of serotonin .","280376":"new york .","280377":"usually the middle , but it depends on if the theater is crowded or not . i try to sit far away from other people .","280378":"no , i ve never played lotto and probably never will . i just think buying lotto tickets is a waste of money .","280379":"yes , really . this isn t up for debate .","280380":"erasing stigma associated with more complex disorders , such as personality disorders , trauma disorders , dissociative disorders , psychotic disorders , etc etc . i do talk about depression anxiety as well , but those are talked about most often and there isn t as much of an emphasis on other disorders that are comorbid with depression anxiety .","280381":"because you can love animals while still including meat into your diet .","280382":"i don t usually give out my other social media , unless it s someone whom i ve spoken to extensively who isn t anon . i have quite a few askfm friends added on other social media accounts .","280383":"lol , no but i admire anyone who has the courage to shave their head . that s why i settled for shaving half of my head , because i want my hair to be shaved but i also like having long hair . however , they pull it off extremely well ! ! i m so envious of people who can confidently do that .","280384":"november th .","280385":"i love animals more than i like people .","280386":"no , i screw it up by burning it , ahah .","280387":"honestly , that s the only thing that works well enough for me . if i just put the timer in and count between pops , i end up burning it completely . lmaoo .","280388":"burning popcorn .","280389":"lmao , probably not . i ve cursed out a few coworkers far too many times in my head .","280390":"my cup of coffee , lmaoo . i m fine with splitting a pot of coffee with my roommate or something , but no one but me is drinking out of that mug .","280391":"idk , i don t know when i first realized i was in love with my ex but i do recall just feeling a sense of uplifting energy whenever i was around him , i missed him and his scent and his aura whenever we weren t together , our conversations brightened my day and always made me feel incredibly happy regardless of what i was feeling , and i felt like i could take on the world with him by my side .","280392":"i believe it s important to live with someone prior to getting married , because like you stated , you don t truly know your partner until you live with them get to know their daily habits and how they live . you won t see a person s true character until you re around them routinely on a daily basis .","280393":"i value others more than i value myself .","280394":"placing all of the bibles in the fictional section ? lmaoo .","280395":"the experience of love is different for everyone . what one person feels in love , another person might feel differently . it s a totally subjective experience .","280396":"be mindful of the present moment take each day as it comes .","280397":"that s very true , and it makes me so incredibly nervous . even the peaceful protestors have been met with unneeded force , such as being maced while they re simply sitting down with their hands up . it s ridiculous . trump has basically already called for an act of war against the protests , whether or not he said it directly . it s clear what his intentions are .","280398":"? ? ?","280399":"all lives can t matter until black lives also matter .","280400":"yeah , i totally agree with you . i m just concerned that the military is going to act the same as the police , i . e . ab sing their power to exert unnecessary control over the protests and hurting people .","280401":"i think involving the army national guard is a bit extreme , especially considering trump has considered the protestors as terrorists which they aren t .","280402":"no , it means it s a mail in ballot as opposed to physically going to a voting location . due to the coronavirus situation in new york , the board of elections is apparently allowing people to mail in their ballots instead of voting in a polling place .","280403":"i can t even fathom myself being a parent , so i really have no clue .","280404":"i have a high physical pain tolerance , so i can handle that better personally . i ve gotten tattoos on painful spots of my body and they bothered me , but it wasn t enough for me to completely stop the session . i ve actually never broken a bone before , haha .","280405":"black lives matter . abortion should be legalized everywhere and treated as a health care issue instead of a political issue . donald trump is a dictator and a fascist thus making america a joke to other countries . video games are not just for children , and it s normal acceptable for adults to play video games . you can t compare emotional ab se and physical ab se or say one is better worse than the other , because they re equally as terrible .","280406":"haha , i honestly don t know . probably because of my political viewpoints .","280407":"basically any sexual question or questions pertaining to where i live specifically , where i went to school or work , details about my family , etc etc . i delete any of those questions .","280408":"to make people feel less alone in their thoughts and move them emotionally through my writing . a lot of my writing deals with mental health , so i think it s important to raise attention to those issues and how i experience them on a personal basis to make them relatable to others .","280409":"hello do you have a question ?","280410":"sitting in a cozy bed with tons of blankets , looking out through a giant glass window of rain falling down upon the forests outside of the house during the mid afternoon . the windows are cracked open , and you can hear the rainfall splatter against the windows and on the roof .","280411":"no , definitely not . there are some women who are simply heterosexual .","280412":"i don t think i have any guilty pleasures that i wouldn t necessarily talk about , lol . i mean i listen to pop music sometimes , but there s nothing wrong with that .","280413":"before makeup after makeup , i guess","280414":"i love this photo that i took down in the bahamas .","280415":"good night , also good morning ! ! i just made breakfast and i m waiting until am so i can log into work for the day .","280416":"both are pretty gross , not gonna lie . lmaoo . i m going to say mcdonalds , though , because at least their coffee is good .","280417":"i m not the biggest fan of chocolate in general , but i do prefer dark over milk .","280418":"no , there s nothing coming up that i m excited about , lol . new york is still under lockdown so places are still closed .","280419":"i m constantly posting links and resources on social media to various awareness campaigns and bail funds across the nation . i ve been very vocal about my thoughts on what s going on rn , as have nearly all of my friends .","280420":"new york state is voting for the democratic primaries on june rd . i ll be voting via absentee ballot .","280421":"i don t drink soda , surprisingly . i know the majority of my weight comes from alcohol consumption , so i really have to cut back from that .","280422":"i take multivitamins every day , and i love green tea ! ! i definitely need to get into the habit of drinking it more often , lol .","280423":"i wouldn t have started self h rming at such a young age , well i wouldn t have started at all . it plagued me for years of my life and i still deal with frequent urges .","280424":"i m not really sure how it works , lmao . i m not looking to get gains or anything , i just want to lose stomach weight and weight in my thighs .","280425":"when i used to go to the gym , i did half cardio and half arm and or leg exercises . so i d likely be doing them in the same session .","280426":"yes , thank you ! ! i ve been eating relatively healthy to begin with , i ve just been very inactive , haha .","280427":"i am a smol bean . really , i m only five feet tall lol . i m overweight but i m still considered petite i suppose .","280428":"health insurance ? haha .","280429":"this cutie .","280430":"montauk , new york .","280431":"this isn t a viral video , but this song is super important rn https youtu . be ujubrbwi","280432":"twisted by missio . someone you loved by lewis capaldi . by grandson .","280433":"nutella ? idk , i think the majority of people i know love it . and chocolate in general . techno edm music . fps games , most of them at least like call of duty . mayonnaise . socks . lmao .","280434":"idk if i love anything that the majority of people hate , haha .","280435":"fruits veggies .","280436":"honestly , it would annoy the crap out of me to where i d get out of bed turn on the lights just to catch it .","280437":"i m doing fine honestly , i ve just been sleeping a lot because i ve been so mentally physically exhausted lately . i ended up taking a nap yesterday after work for two hours , stayed awake for another two hours , and then went back to bed around pm . i slept through the entire night until am this morning . i feel a bit better today , so after work i might do some laundry to keep myself busy .","280438":"no , i ve never visited a mansion before .","280439":"i ve been trying , and learning how , to take each present moment and use it to my advantage . and teaching myself how to be mindful of the present instead of worrying about the future or dwelling on the past .","280440":"i already answered a similar question earlier today , but my friend showed me a video last night of two black men discussing the blm movement and their experiences , and it was really moving . it moved me to tears .","280441":"the beach there are loads of beaches around me , but they re always crowded with people which deters me from going , even just to walk on the boardwalk or something . i can t handle crowds of people .","280442":"foreign films should be given more credit by american audiences . napoleon dynamite is the worst . movie ever made , point blank . silly chick flicks can be good movies , especially as comfort films for people . a lot of movie adaptations of books are actually pretty good . the more gore , the better .","280443":"the power to transport myself with a snap of my fingers from place to place without worrying about driving , planes , trains , etc etc .","280444":"i ve only tried edibles once , and it was such a trip , lol . this is going back , like . . . years ago , though . i haven t tried edibles since , but i d be willing again given i m in the right mindset .","280445":"abandonment by my loved ones .","280446":"honesty , loyalty , open mindedness , and a sense of humor .","280447":"both simultaneously .","280448":"i don t anymore , but i used to have a fish tank with a few fish when i lived at my parents house . i had two betta fish not in the same tank as well as a corycat .","280449":"i like being outside during the summer , whether it s walking through parks or on the beach , or being in the backyard with friends while we grill food and have a campfire .","280450":"i don t have air conditioning in my house yet .","280451":"here s a selfie from a few weeks ago","280452":"well , first i got into a relationship so i didn t necessarily feel the need to use it anymore . then later on , i learned about how horrible the industry is and decided not to support it anymore .","280453":"this sounds like a fetish , hm . . .","280454":"i don t support the p rn industry for myriad reasons , although i do admit i used to watch p rn when i was younger before i knew how harmful the industry is .","280455":"lmao , no . like i said , everybody farts . it s a normal bodily function .","280456":"yeah ? everybody farts .","280457":"yeah , i think it s very common ! ! i often have to look up definitions of words just to ensure it s right , even though i know what the word means but my paranoia takes over , and i have to double check and make sure before i finalize a draft .","280458":"idk , probably when i was a child . my mother has told me stories of when i was a child and wanted to be a boy and didn t want to do things girls typically were expected to do . that carried on into my teenage years , and eventually when i came out to my best friend years ago , she told me you re only figuring this out now ? i ve known since we were kids . lol .","280459":"it s annoying , especially considering i write for a living and then i start to question myself if the word is real or if i m using it correctly . lmao .","280460":"? ? ? haha , they shut down years ago in the united states . apparently they re trying to make a comeback , though .","280461":"idk , every time i focus too much on any particular word for a length of time , i start to take it apart and the word itself just sounds weird to me .","280462":"i don t have a spirit animal because i m not native american .","280463":"i ve never been actual camping before ! ! i ve always wanted to because i think i d enjoy it .","280464":"general trollish questions , fetish questions , anything sexually based , etc etc . i just end up deleting them .","280465":"i m more right brained than anything else , but i also have a bit of left brained within me as well . depends on my mood that day , how i m feeling overall , etc etc .","280466":"sushi , probably . there are so many varieties .","280467":"i honestly have no idea , haha . i don t recall most of my childhood in that way , except for when i began reading the harry potter books .","280468":"i don t believe in past lives .","280469":"both , depending on how i feel and which habits i choose to indulge in on that day . lately , i ve been trying to cultivate good habits to counteract how i ve been feeling , i . e . eating healthier than usual , drinking more water , getting sunlight in , sleeping more , etc etc . on my bad days , my bad habits come out in full force , particularly in the form of drinking .","280470":"no , not really . i haven t had the attention span lately to commit to a book , but i ve most definitely been wanting to get into the habit of reading more often .","280471":"two nights ago , my friend showed me a video of a really inspirational discussion between two black people regarding the blm movement it brought me to tears .","280472":"made a healthy snack , mainly because i m not very hungry and didn t feel like making an actual meal .","280473":"the fact that trump is designating the protestors as terrorists is ridiculous , tbh . just like he declared that the antifa movement is a terrorist organization , which is also wrong . he s essentially fueling a war on his own people .","280474":"i don t watch the news on television , so i wouldn t know .","280475":"probably a huge fire as much as i love having campfires in the firepit in the backyard , fire also scares me a lot .","280476":"lmaoo . nice typo . no , i don t collect funko pops .","280477":"i ve explained this so many times already on askfm , lmaoo . it s become so redundant . the only thing that matters is that we re amicable with one another we re still friends .","280478":"i don t generally go to protests because they make my anxiety go haywire . i can t handle the people and yelling .","280479":"lol . no , they re just things from the move that i never got around to sorting through .","280480":"you re discussing the initial autopsy , not the one done most recently .","280481":"the autopsy actually said he was strangled and declared

not quite sure i understand the question .","280490":"clearly , my name is leigh .","280491":"no , i don t really care .","280492":"i don t believe that s ever happened to me before .","280493":"? ? ?","280494":"some of them can be cute creative .","280495":"my boss from upper management wanted me to call an irate , extremely angry client about mistakes made in his magazine article . usually stuff like this is referred to the customer service team . i was shocked and immediately had an anxiety attack . i can t handle when people are angry , i freeze up and cry and don t know what to do . luckily my immediate supervisor stepped in and gave an alternative solution so that i wouldn t have to do it , and upper management accepted . i m so relieved . i definitely would have started crying on the phone , i don t handle people yelling well at all in any circumstance .","280496":"unfortunately , i ve never been to a protest before . my social anxiety would skyrocket with that many people around .","280497":"a tree branch wedding band ring . something like this","280498":"green so i can still see the grass and tree leaves and forests for the most part . things like that bring me peace

reminder that the gay rights movement was started by a black trans woman during a riot at stonewall . just because it s pride month doesn t mean we should speak over the blm movement happening now .","280510":"happy june ! !","280511":"that s your opinion , lmaoo . i really don t care .","280512":"no one gets a medal for being a decent human being . it s common decency to protect black lives .","280513":"yet you re still throwing a slur around without acknowledging that you re using a slur , lol . no i don t have an intellectual disability . and even if i did , that wouldn t mean i m of less value as an individual than anyone else .","280514":"eh , to a certain degree , yes . i think it s important to acknowledge what s going on , of course , but if it s detrimental to your mental health then you have the right to remove yourself from social media and such so that you don t get worn down by everything .","280515":"so ask it .","280516":"? ? ?","280517":"yelling .","280518":"definitely not , lmaoo . the only way you re contacting me is through askfm . and if you don t have a real question , you can move along .","280519":"no , i don t give that out either

you re talking about .","280530":"honestly , i agree with you to an extent . this is even crossing into other countries too there are protests going on in europe and such . it s a global revolution at this point , like i said earlier . the only way to institute real change at this point is by making a scene and showing governments the wrongs they ve committed . everything that has been changed in history , like the fight for gay rights and women s rights , have been the result of protests and riots .","280531":"nutella is gross . pineapple on pizza is delicious . not everyone can be vegetarian and or vegan due to health related issues . the best food combo ever is french fries in vanilla ice cream . there are no such things as cheat foods . it s just food , and you shouldn t feel guilty for eating something that brings you pleasure .","280532":"green hazel .","280533":"if you had asked me this last year , i definitely would have said dogs . however , after living with cats for months , i can say i love both equally .","280534":"yeah , i m only five feet tall . lmao .","280535":"was that a different anon , then ? tag me in your explanation on your page . until then , this conversation is over since we re just talking in circles .","280536":"you literally said that you d add me on facebook to prove me wrong . prior to that , you said come to my page . i obviously can t visit your

.","280544":"i know , lmaoo . goes to show how clueless these people are .","280545":"it confuses me how you re certain my house was built by white people . nevertheless , i ve stated my points here and i have nothing left to say to you .","280546":"why aren t you focusing your attention on racism ?","280547":"there s a higher percentage of white men than black men in america . the reason why it seems there s more white men being m rdered is because there s more white men than black men in existence . however , when you look at the ratios , there are more black men being m rdered in comparison . the argument that white men are k lled more is moot and not factual . nevertheless , i did answer your question .","280548":"i can live with that . it doesn t matter what you think of my opinion , the ultimate goal is to raise awareness of racism , white privilege , and police brutality . thank you for having this discussion with me and providing me with the opportunity to do just that .","280549":"if he was a white man , he wouldn t have even gotten arrested in the first place . if he was a white man , he wouldn t have been declared as resisting arrest even though he didn t . if he was a white man , he would be treated like any other white person who has gotten arrested non violently . when white people get confronted by police , they fear for getting fined or getting a ticket . when black people get confronted , they fear for their lives .","280550":"you re ridiculous , lmaoo .","280551":"? ? ? my home was built in the s . either way , that s irrelevant to this conversation .","280552":"that has nothing to do with this conversation ? we re talking about racism and systemic oppression . my home isn t a corporation that benefits from those forces of oppression . you re focusing your attention on the wrong things . instead of complaining that people are protesting , perhaps think about why they re protesting in the first place . this is a revolution .","280553":"the protesters ? yes .","280554":"i wouldn t know , they re mostly anon and i delete those types of messages .","280555":"my friends and i did friendsgiving last november , which i think will be a nice tradition every year .","280556":"this question has been asked to me once before , and i ll summarize what i said below . insane aslyum is an archaic term that is not used anymore . it places stigma on those who are mentally ill and have sought help at hospitals . additionally , the mentally ill community doesn t agree with the term insane because that also places negative stigma on mental illnesses because it s been used to discriminate against the mentally ill for centuries .","280557":"being fair , because you can t be fair without an underlying motivation to be nice to others

overthink it believe someone is trying to distance from me when really they re just busy . i ve noticed i m always the person to text first in most of my friendships .","280691":"it all depends on the circumstances behind the breakup and how you both handled it before , during , and after . i think it s common for you to have this anger and these feelings since it appears that you never truly received closure .","280692":"people have the freedom to make their money however they desire assuming it s legal , and onlyfans is a resource that people use to accrue money in a legitimate manner . there s nothing wrong with offering adult services via subscription and making money as long as you pay your dues in taxes at the end of the year .","280693":"no , hate is a very strong word and i ve

online that resonate with you . nutella is disgusting , pineapple tastes good on pizza , chocolate covered potato chips are an abomination , and french fries belong in vanilla ice cream . obesity is a medical condition , and when you re obese , you re at greater risk of developing other serious illnesses such as diabetes , rheumatologic , and skeletal disorders . it s fine to be body positive , but obesity is a health concern and you can t ignore medical facts just to look for clout online .","280699":"last sunday afternoon .","280700":"it isn t rude , it s educational . people have the right to

although i wasn t unhappy but just in denial . we had tried putting effort into fixing the intimacy between us , but things felt more like friendship than anything else . he didn t feel as strongly

you .","280716":"it s easy to be biased when male privilege exists .","280717":"text message or visiting my home .","280718":"cont . . . one thing i m concerned about is i don t even trust myself to not get attached . even if he backs off and agrees nothing significant will ever come out of whatever we have , it s still natural for me to get overly attached and over think every moment . it makes me want to run i understand the feeling all too well , i often get attached to people and then i end up getting hurt because they either do something or say something that isn t meant to be harmful , but because i m so attached , it has so much more significance to me and my mind races with everything they say . perhaps through that distancing , your attachment won t happen . it s also good to be aware of when you are or aren t becoming attached , so the fact that you recognize that you re the type of person to attach themselves to someone is a good thing . it means you can prevent it when you see the signs happening .","280719":"you can t place blame on one specific person or thing because everyone is responsible to some degree , mainly in terms of government for not enforcing quarantine rules quickly enough .","280720":"at the moment , it s stupid by ashnikko https youtu . be vbqrhowkonk","280721":"that would be met with a lot of opposition , and it s easier for me to just suck it up

especially things like blood spatter analysis and ballistics . i took a course in high school on this subject and it was super interesting to me .","280724":"i think people like watching sad movies because it can be cathartic for them if they need to express emotion but don t know how , or they need to cry and can t bring themselves to cry , then sad movies provide that sort of release and comfort . scary movies are a bit similar , but i believe that s more to elicit an adrenaline rush and feeling of excitement more than anything else .","280725":"ah , thank you ! !","280726":"cont . . . instead of just cutting him off . today he brought up wanting to be with me again and i told him he needs to not be so quick to be ruled by emotion and just be realistic . i don t want him to get hurt . i also brought up talking every few days instead of everyday and he didn t want to hear it at all . he was literally cutting me off and going blah blah blah lol . i just don t want to keep talking frequently and letting his feelings grow then letting him down . i asked him what he would do if down the road i started dating someone , and he said the thought makes him sad and why would i date someone when i have him ? so now i m not sure what to do . i told him us being together isn t going to happen and he said even if i say no , he won t give up so easily . so yeah , i really don t want to cut him off i still enjoy talking to him but i m not sure what to do . oh man . . . the fact that he says he wouldn t give up easily is really red flag ish to me , honestly . he s not respecting your feelings , and it sounds like he genuinely believes he s going to win you over no matter what it takes which can be alarming . i would be cautious . even if he doesn t want to stop talking as frequently , you have the option to not reply as frequently . you ve already made yourself abundantly clear to him it seems , and he just won t accept no for an answer . if not replying as frequently doesn t work and he freaks out or threatens you in any way , that s when i d cut him off completely . right now , he seems harmless but he s showing signs that he could be dangerous if not given what he wants . like i said , he obviously isn t taking no for an answer . please stay safe , friend . this guy is really giving me bad vibes .","280727":"unfortunately , i m not sure who the artist is . but this is a gorgeous painting rendition of the halo franchise .","280728":"kudos to you i wish i could break contact completely , but that probably won t be able to happen until i move out of state . even though i m not close to my parents , i still see them every week or two in order to help around the house . my mother is disabled and my father is in his mid s , so they require some extra help every now and again .","280729":"my parents ab sed me for years , so i try to keep contact with them on a low , as needed basis . i feel no emotional connection to them whatsoever and i m doing much better without them in my life as much .","280730":"no , i m not close with my parents .","280731":"lmaooo . well that s certainly a different opinion . regardless , no that made no difference in our relationship .","280732":"i don t feel like explaining it again . i ve explained it so many times on askfm , lol . we re still friends , though , and there s no animosity between us . that s all that really matters .","280733":"yeah , we broke up last year . lol .","280734":"my bedroom is the most relaxing spot in the house for me , lol . i have everything i need here my television for movies and shows , my xbox for video games , books for reading , my laptop for working and writing , my bed for sleeping , and two windows to let in all the sunlight and cool breezes .","280735":"the cliffs of moher look beautiful .","280736":"good morning ! ! i m feeling fine today thus far . i woke up perhaps minutes ago and just finished eating breakfast , and i have to log into work in another half hour . i watched the movie parasite last night for the first time , and holy crap that movie was intense af .","280737":"depends on my mood in that moment . sometimes i d rather stay home , while other times i prefer to go out or order takeout .","280738":"i used to go to the caf with friends before quarantine started , and it was a lot of fun because the caf we would frequent also played live music at night , or poetry readings . obviously now that i ve been stuck at home and working from home , i ve been making my coffee at home . it s fine for me , but i do miss coffee shop coffee every now and again .","280739":"i m not the biggest fan of muffins , but banana nut muffins and blueberry muffins are pretty good .","280740":"i don t have a boyfriend .","280741":"lol . yeah , that does sound pretty contradictory when you compare those two answers , huh ?","280742":"it s spring where i live , haha . but it s been pleasant mild weather , but an unusual amount of gray days .","280743":"they feel entitled to other people s attention and or affection , and get angry when they re not given those things in the manner in which they think they deserve . they were raised in a society where male dominance is normalized , which tunes into their egos and makes them believe that they re obligated to be respected even if they haven t done anything respectable solely because they re a man .","280744":"if this doesn t exemplify quarantine life , idk what else would . ask me questions , friends","280745":"i only have a small circle of friends , but they do sometimes come to me if they need an opinion on something . i think i m appropriately mature for my age .","280746":"probably because they re unsure of how to approach a situation and they value my input , especially since i ve often been in the same positions as many of my anons who ask for advice .","280747":"here ya go to the anon from earlier asking for advice i ll get to it soon ! ! i want to answer it from my laptop because it s a long inquiry .","280748":"i wasn t dismissing it . i was offering a perspective from another approach that could challenge your notion and make you look at it in a different manner . i couldn t care less about what other people think about me on askfm , and if my friends on here have a different opinion or believe that my views are problematic , then they d confront me about them .","280749":"physically i m feeling relatively okay , although a bit tired and my lower back hurts . i m laying in bed for a bit just to relax and relieve some of that pain . mentally i m a bit anxious at the moment for some reason . i ve been feeling it all day i can t put my finger on why . i just took my medication , so i m hoping it kicks in soon .","280750":"depends on your definition of radical . half of my head is shaved well , not at the moment due to quarantine , and some have considered that a bold move .","280751":"i ve seen a few articles where that is up for debate , primarily due to sociological studies where women are seen as submissive due to a past history of ab sive relationships , and being submissive means less harm will be done to them . it s easier for the survivor to compartmentalize ab se by being submissive to it as opposed to trying to establish dominance , which will create violence .","280752":"it could be , sure . there s a difference between what a person thinks something is based on their own experience versus how something actually is based on objective reasoning .","280753":"eh , it can go either way . i d personally write give feedback .","280754":"i never said you were the same anon , lol . i didn t really think that either . you re basing your assumption off of . . . how well a series of erotic books were sold back in the day ? that isn t really a logical or factual source of information .","280755":"there s no reason why someone can t be both , haha . i don t exactly know what i m interested in besides how my ex was when we were together .","280756":"you can t really say most when you ve probably only dated a miniscule fraction of the population of women . it may be true in your own experience , but that doesn t necessarily mean it s true on a universal scale .","280757":"depends on the individual you can t really make a blanket statement and say all women want x or all men want y . everyone has their various preferences , and it all comes down to how well your chemistry is with another person .","280758":"i m tired , but overall fine . i just clocked out of work and i m relaxing in bed , lmaoo .","280759":"any sort of problems , whether big or small , should be discussed in relationships if you feel the need to ignore a problem to

and it was infj every time . i haven t taken it in a long time though .","280762":"i seldom buy new clothes unless i realize that i new some new shorts or tank tops or something for the change of seasons . i don t get embarrassed like that , and there s nothing wrong with recycling outfits , lol . i probably wore the same outfits every two weeks .","280763":"well if you re talking about users from years ago , then yeah they re not active anymore . i follow like other people though , lol .","280764":"? ? ? i simply answered a question , lmaoo . there are plenty of active users on askfm who post every day . like i said , it all depends on who you follow .","280765":"either cherry garcia or chocolate chip cookie dough .","280766":"no , they re a bit different from each other . there are some good examples on google regarding the differences between race and ethnicity .","280767":"not generally , no . there was so much drama back then , lol . and askfm is just as active now at least for me , it all depends on your following and who you follow .","280768":"that is indeed my personality type , yes .","280769":"uh , you realize islam is a religion , right ? it isn t a race or ethnicity .","280770":"yeah , my roommates and i rent a house .","280771":"i agree ! ! and perhaps , my roommates and i want to first invest some money into getting some outdoor patio furniture , a grill , and a firepit .","280772":"this is pretty typical of the area i live in . we could plant things if we wanted to , but this is what the yard looked looks like when we started renting the house .","280773":"i only speak english .","280774":"exactly and even though things are being documented now through video and photos , most of these law enforcement officers aren t being punished correctly . a lot of them are put on paid administrative leave . which is so sickening .","280775":"somewhat , yeah . i only really see the articles that come up on my feed on facebook and twitter . i don t regularly read the news , though .","280776":"in the majority of circumstances , absolutely not . look at all of the protestors who are white who have been rallying in groups against quarantine . nothing bad has happened to them at all , even though they re breaking rules and regulations and probably even laws by doing what they re doing .","280777":"i don t mind the quarantine , honestly . i ve been working from home for over two months , which has really been great for me . i m wondering if i can work from home permanently considering i don t necessarily need to be in the office and can do everything regularly from home . i d like for stores and restaurants and bars to open when it s safe to do so . i don t believe it s safe enough yet where i live .","280778":"i honestly don t know much , even though he s the governor of new york . i don t even watch the press conferences and i mainly just read the news articles afterwards of what s going to happen in new york .","280779":"there s video footage of what happened . it s the same story as what has been happening to people of color for years upon years when they re confronted by law enforcement . this is just another example of racial prejudice .","280780":"his name was george floyd . the entire situation is tragic , and it only proves that most law enforcement is wrongfully discriminatory against people of color . george floyd was m rdered , and the officers involved should be reprimanded for their gruesome actions .","280781":"i honestly have no clue . i have zero memory of it .","280782":"i think i was or years old .","280783":"i think they can be useful for some people , although i ve never read one myself .","280784":"sure , but depending on the question , i may or may not answer .","280785":"it s always been both .","280786":"graduating from high school and moving onto college , returning home after my first year of college , graduating from college and pursuing an entry level job , transitioning between jobs , breaking up with my ex , moving into a new home , etc etc .","280787":"? ? ? it s ridiculous when people think that there are separate feelings for when someone is bi or gay compared to those who are straight . it s the same feeling .","280788":"yes , this has happened to me on multiple occasions whenever life has transitioned for me .","280789":"i was attracted to men and women , lol . my first relationship was with a girl , and then i dated a boy a few years later and the feelings were the same .","280790":"i understand . i ve known i was bisexual since i was years old , but i wasn t out or anything until i was much older . i dated a girl when i was young , but we kept our relationship a secret from friends and family because we didn t know how they d react .","280791":"why do you think it s an issue ? there s nothing wrong with being bisexual , but if you re concerned about backlash from friends or family , perhaps you should remain quiet about it until you feel safe . your safety is what matters most .","280792":"nah , no one needs to see that .","280793":"honestly , i ve always just slipped it into casual conversation . lmaoo . however , i ve only ever come out to close friends irl , and i also talk about it on the internet from time to time on social media , but it was never a direct declaration or anything . other people obviously do it differently , but it should be something you re comfortable doing when the time is right , in whichever way you think is best .","280794":"change into pajamas , take my medication , and scroll through social media on my phone .","280795":"depends on what you need advice on , but i ll try my best .","280796":"well , i m definitely not old , lol .","280797":"i can t explain it . i m just unhappy with myself .","280798":"i just answered this .","280799":"because it s disgusting to me , lol . my only redeeming qualities are my hair and eyes . i hate my face and body .","280800":"nope , i absolutely hate my body .","280801":"i m constantly undecided on this because i see both sides of the argument i can understand those who say trans people don t need dysphoria , because feminine leaning and masculine leaning non binary or agender or genderfluid people exist , and they re content with their bodies . that doesn t invalidate their gender . at the same time , however , i believe a criteria in order for a trans person to be approved for top or bottom surgery is body dysphoria , although i m not sure what the criteria is for hrt . i ve never sought hrt or surgery , so i m pretty uneducated in those areas .","280802":"most of them are pretty much hidden by regular clothes , yeah . i have tattoos on my upper arm , my forearm , my ribs , my back , my upper thigh , my calf , and my ankle .","280803":"yes , i have seven tattoos .","280804":"i don t really blush , so i m not entirely sure .","280805":"is neither an option ? lmaoo . i don t remember my childhood , so who knows what happened back then . my teenage years were terrible . i m content with being an adult .","280806":"yeah , i m sure everyone would be annoyed by that . that s why i ve cut a few people out of my life in recent years they were simply unfair in that manner , and they wouldn t acknowledge that their behavior was hypocritical .","280807":"pumpkin pie and pumpkin bread will always be my favorites .","280808":"playing video games makes me lose track of time , haha . three hours could pass and i d have no idea .","280809":"it seems pretty fun , but i just got frustrated quickly because i couldn t line it up correctly .","280810":"it was real i was in upstate new york staying at a dude ranch and they offered archery .","280811":"doesn t much matter to me , i appreciate it either way .","280812":"nope , i ve only tried archery once and i was terrible at it .","280813":"yeah , i d say so . i usually like getting people sentimental and custom gifts off of etsy .","280814":"i don t believe i have , no . i ve been on regular like person boats with friends as well as a cruise ship .","280815":"there s nothing to argue about . my friends and i have all found common ground and confide in each other with our troubles , and there s never any conflict .","280816":"for the most part , yeah . however , i haven t had an argument with a friend in an extremely long time .","280817":"peppermint tea , blueberry white tea , earl grey tea , matcha tea , jasmine tea , and ginger peach tea .","280818":"depends on the day . when i m feeling unsafe , i ll confide in one of my close friends and they usually help me in feeling more secure .","280819":"i think everyone has a different definition of what love is , but i also do believe that people in relationships should have a common ground or understanding of what love means to them specifically in order for things to work .","280820":"taking the first step forward my treatment for mental illness and following through with finding a doctor and a therapist to help me .","280821":"yeah , there was a trigger to my episode . but i feel fine now , i m just listening to music to ease myself down and settle myself down so i can sleep soon .","280822":"less money i m making coffee and breakfast at home instead of buying it on the way to work , and i m spending less money on gas for my car every week since i ve been working from home .","280823":"hello my day was fine . i worked for . hours , then laid down with the cats and checked social media . i heated up a quick dinner , and now i ve been watching forensic files and having a few hard seltzers in the meantime . i had a mini mental breakdown that lasted like . . . minutes , and i was crying profusely , but now i feel fine , so .","280824":"i ve always been under the belief that we should trust our gut instincts . if you have a bad feeling about someone or something , then follow that feeling and take a different route . often times , ignoring that instinct will result in complicated or harmful situations .","280825":"self improvement will always be important , because you cannot grow as a human being if you don t continually try to improve yourself in some way .","280826":"open world rpgs mostly . i also like a few first person shooters , like destiny and halo .","280827":"not off of the same plate or anything , but yeah . if my roommate and i are cooking , obviously we make our own plates and whatnot . whatever is left over in the pot , we throw in the fridge for whoever wants to eat it next .","280828":"it s all about the angles","280829":"i d be living off the grid , away from of people with the exception of a few close friends , inside of a beautiful cabin with large windows and plush rugs and candles , either in northern new england or the pacific northwest .","280830":"white privilege is very much a real thing , and even though there are so many people trying to raise awareness of that the injustices people of color face , there are just as many if not more people who claim white privilege doesn t exist .","280831":"things like pads and tampons , they re ridiculously overpriced . but people have no choice but to buy them in most cases , and it leads a lot of others to be at risk of infection or ill health if they can t afford them .","280832":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","280833":"achievement hunter rage quit the impossible game https youtu . be aglvtnxlmma","280834":"my day has been pretty good . i finished up with work about minutes ago and i ve just been laying in bed with the cat , lmaoo . i m not sure if shops are ready to be opened yet where i live , but they are beginning phase one of opening certain places up and giving back other jobs starting tomorrow .","280835":"my bedroom windows ! ! they let so much light in , it s glorious .","280836":"obviously , yeah . i can only hope that they re donating some of the proceeds to organizations working to combat the coronavirus .","280837":"absolutely not . just because i m not friends with them anymore doesn t mean it s acceptable to reveal their secrets that they confided in me in confidence .","280838":"no , i seldom request people on facebook .","280839":"probably because it s loud and unexpected . i personally love thunder and lightning .","280840":"no , i couldn t care less about how people spell on the internet . i do too much of that for my job , i don t need to be correcting people s grammar outside of work too .","280841":"uh , i didn t even know that was a thing . lol . that s rather . . . odd . i m assuming they re in salute of essential workers or something ?","280842":"no , i m happy for my friends who are in great relationships .","280843":"i believe high functioning alcoholics are alcoholics who are perhaps in denial about their problem because they can still do their ordinary tasks without an issue . they don t see their alcohol intake as an issue and don t believe they require rehab or any sort of treatment for their addiction . this doesn t make their alcoholism any less severe or important , though . any sort of alcoholism is lethal and detrimental to not only the well being of the user , but also their friends and family .","280844":"how is that mean ? if i don t have a response to something someone has said , then i simply don t respond .","280845":"my phone , cash credit card , and my vape .","280846":"lately it s been this one","280847":"i don t believe that i m attractive , and it doesn t matter to me if other people think i am or not .","280848":"no , i m not interested in dating at the moment .","280849":"i don t look for anything , but i usually notice their hair and their smile first .","280850":"i did work a job like that for four years of my life , lol . it was horrid .","280851":"i don t remember , tbh . it doesn t happen to me very often .","280852":"i m fine . i just woke up not too long ago and i m just laying down before i have to make breakfast and coffee , and then work .","280853":"yeah , i m single .","280854":"yeah , i m bi .","280855":"chloe price from the video game life is strange .","280856":"yeah , music is a big motivator when it comes to getting household chores done and working and whatnot . when i m working , i listen to classical music or instrumental soundtracks from video games , shows , and movies because lyrics end up distracting me . however , when i m cleaning i like putting on whatever music i m currently interested in at that moment .","280857":"it doesn t bother me . i do it to people all the time both accidentally and on purpose .","280858":"i have no big summer plans , no . my roommates and i are planning on buying some outdoor patio furniture , a firepit , and a grill though . hopefully the coronavirus pandemic will ease up soon so we ll finally be able to have people over .","280859":"people interrupting me while i m speaking . people belittling me or thinking i m inferior to them during a conversation . people who are mean to animals .","280860":"i walked into the house to a conversation between my roommate and his girlfriend about period orgies , does that count ? lmaoo .","280861":"my day was fine , although esther unproductive . i called out of work this morning , and i spent most of the day sleeping and playing video games . i finally found the strength to shower , so i showered , put on lotion , and blew out my hair so it doesn t look like a complete wreck over the next few days . i m about to put some television on .","280862":"i think those people are literal scum are acting entirely selfish , disrespectful , and childish . retail workers are already disrespected on a regular basis by customers , and people are now acting even more ridiculous and nonsensical than ever before . i feel bad for the workers who have to deal with these people every day .","280863":"favorite foods sushi . halal lamb and rice platters . veggie burrito bowls . least favorite foods anything with mayonnaise in it .","280864":"yeah , drinking is bad for you if it isn t in moderation . vaping is probably also bad considering i m still using nicotine , but i haven t read up on any recent studies regarding whether or not vaping is better than smoking cigarettes .","280865":"thanks , i appreciate it","280866":"a few friends , depending on who s available .","280867":"they re not a problem , they re just habits . i drink occasionally and vape every day , lol .","280868":"do not give more of yourself to a person who isn t reciprocating the same efforts and energy . there will be people in your life who will end up taking advantage of the friendship , and it s unhealthy and toxic for you to continually put effort into maintaining the friendship when you re not receiving the same energy back . one sided friendships are unhealthy .","280869":"this may be a pessimistic outlook , but i don t believe humans will ever be able to live in harmony together . there will always be people who are controlled by hatred , ignorance , and greed , and they re the ones who make it difficult for everyone to live in harmony in the first place .","280870":"plenty of people disagree with me when i inform them that there are more than two genders , lol .","280871":"humanity s goal should be to protect the earth . we cannot live on this earth if there s no earth for us to live on in the first place . we re slowly destroying everything the earth has to offer us .","280872":"i would wish that my friends wouldn t struggle anymore and find happiness in their lives .","280873":"colorful patterned socks ! ! i think i only own like one or two pairs of plain white socks , lol .","280874":"drinking alcohol , smoking , and skin picking .","280875":"yeah , i heard that they were ending the series . i don t feel any particular way about it i haven t watched it in years .","280876":"i don t believe that food is the greatest thing in the world , lol . i believe the love you cultivate between friends , family , and partners is what is most important .","280877":"i don t hold strong opinions for or against it . i just have no interest in watching it .","280878":"no , i ve never been to six flags before .","280879":"i don t follow people upon request .","280880":"yellow roses .","280881":"yeah , i used to like the series a lot back in the day . i haven t watched it in years , though .","280882":"i use askfm to answer questions . i ll have conversations on occasion , but usually it s with my already existing friends and it lasts one statement or two . i m not going to have a conversation with a person who thinks i m pretty . i already know where that is headed .","280883":"this is askfm . you re supposed to ask questions . so if you don t have a question , i m going to delete your messages .","280884":"hello do you have a question ?","280885":"i don t like companions in either game because i m a stealth sort of person , and honestly the companions just blow my cover . lmaoo . i like working alone without partners .","280886":"it means that i m drinking alcohol and will be awake for a while , so ask me questions","280887":"taking a page out of shehitsback s book and deeming it shitfaced sunday ask me questions , friends","280888":"no , i m an atheist so i don t believe in god or any sort of higher power .","280889":"? ? ? that s most definitely not true , lol . men and women and people of any gender can be just friends , there doesn t have to be a sexual component to it . that s just invalidating to people who are gay too .","280890":"i think i d rather know how i died , because if i knew when then i would do nothing but think about that specific day develop anxiety over it .","280891":"maybe i picked it up from my ca friends then ? the internet has its own subculture and the linguistics behind it is hella interesting .","280892":"depends on the context of the relationship . ideally , your partner should trust you . also , just because you re out with a woman doesn t mean there s a romantic context behind it . men are allowed to have friends who are women .","280893":"that s internet lingo i ve picked up over the years , lmaoo . nah , irl i mostly say dude or bro .","280894":"lmaoo . no , that isn t the case for me . but that s a pretty accurate stereotype .","280895":"avocado , coffee , and cheddar cheese . obviously not all at the same time . . . lmao .","280896":"campfire , pine , and coffee .","280897":"how am i supposed to feed you if you won t get out of my lap ?","280898":"you re not the suspicious one at all , honestly . the number of photos someone sends another person shouldn t be an indication of how real they are or how interested they are . he should really be understanding of your insecurities , and like i said , if he has a problem with that then that s something he has to deal with himself .","280899":"i took some sleeping aid and ended up sleeping for hours last night , which is something i most definitely needed .","280900":"i don t have any enemies , lol .","280901":"i can t think of one day in particular , but pretty much any night that i ve spent with friends and we re all sitting around a campfire , drinking , eat delicious food , and swapping stories . there was one night in particular that i was at a friend s house , and there were maybe other people over . we all sat in a circle around the campfire , and it was someone s birthday so we passed around a tray of tequila shots with salt and lime slices in order to celebrate . it was a lot of fun .","280902":"yes when i was with my ex , he was friends with a few of his exes and i had no problem with that whatsoever . i was also friends with them too . if you have trust in your partner , then you would have nothing to worry about .","280903":"yes , this is exactly it people aren t discounting white people s hardships when it comes to other aspects of their lives , but their difficulties do not stem from their skin color by any means . people of color , on the other hand , are oppressed and discriminated against solely because of their race , and that s something multi generational and rooted in historical racism and even internalized racism . i m white so i ll never be able to understand the troubles people of color face , and i ve benefited from white privilege my entire life , but i often try to use my privilege as a platform to allow people of color to speak for themselves .","280904":"my anxiety manifests itself in headaches , heart palpitations , tightness in my chest , sweating , shakiness in my limbs , and indigestion .","280905":"uh . . . what ? lmaoo . i m diagnosed with an anxiety disorder , which often affects me in a physical manner .","280906":"my favorite fictional character is probably lestat from the vampire chronicles by anne rice . his psychology and actions have always been super interesting and appealing to me . my least favorite character is , obviously , dolores umbridge from the harry potter books by j . k . rowling . lmaoo .","280907":"because it was never done to me while growing up , i d like to be open with my future children if i ever have any , it s just a hypothetical about my feelings and accept their feelings in a gentle , but productive way . i was berated for showing my feelings when i was younger , and i was constantly criticized for the way i looked , behaved , thought , etc etc . i d like to provide a safe space for my children where they could come to me with their thoughts and worries without fear of judgment .","280908":"because of stupid , i really want to check out more of yung baby tate s music too . her verses were fire .","280909":"i m not really sure what s within your comfort zone , so it would be difficult for me to suggest things to do that are outside of your comfort zone . however , perhaps you can take up new hobbies that you ve always contemplated doing but never followed through with .","280910":"sorry , this question doesn t really make much sense to me . i don t believe in the concept of soul mates , and i think that people should date those with whom they feel comfortable and themselves around . if it works , it works if it doesn t , it doesn t . we won t know unless we do trial and error , and come to a determination of what we re genuinely looking for in relationships .","280911":"i ll check them out ! ! i believe i ve heard tantrum before , but not her first ep . i ve mainly been listening to songs like invitation , hi it s me , halloweenie , stupid , and no brainer .","280912":"a quick faq about leigh i m years old i m a scorpio . my profession is in the publishing field writing and editing . i have an undergraduate degree . i m non binary they them pronouns . i m diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses . i m left leaning , but i m not really much involved in politics anymore and i don t really label myself anymore . i have seven tattoos . i m extremely passionate about music , art , writing , and video games . my music taste ranges from classical to nu metal , alternative rock to indie pop , and hip hop . i quit smoking cigarettes after years of smoking a pack a day , and now i vape .","280913":"me tooooo . i think manicmartyrdom introduced me to her sorry dera if it wasn t you , my memory is sh t lol . but now i m obsessed .","280914":"punch nazis and k ll your local pedophile .","280915":"i don t post photos of my friends on askfm .","280916":"you re not wrong he should respect your decision , and it honestly sounds like he s trying to guilt you into sending him more photos , which is really suspicious to me . do what makes you comfortable , and if he has a problem with that , then he should deal with that himself . it has nothing to do with you and everything to do with him .","280917":"i m pretty content , but i wouldn t say that i m happy . i still have a lot of worries that i deal with on a daily basis .","280918":"no , i was pretty unknown and low key when i was in high school . the only eventful things that happened were the fights and b mb scares , lol .","280919":"i don t remember , but it was probably pasta or scrambled eggs .","280920":"ugh to the anon who asked about my loss of memory of my childhood , i think my initial answer got deleted by askfm . to sum it off , i basically said that it was concerning and terrifying that i can t remember most of my childhood . i do have memories of ab se from when i was a teenager , and i think the reason why i don t remember my childhood is because my brain was protecting me in some subconscious way . my old therapist once told me that some people experience a flooding of memories in adulthood that they previously blocked out , and that s something that scares me the most .","280921":"people probably don t expect me to be mentally ill , because there s this useless stigma that says that mentally ill people aren t good at expressing themselves , or something of that nature . it s mostly online , especially on askfm if someone is new to my page , and people don t seem to believe that i have multiple mental illnesses and semi severe symptoms associated with them . it doesn t come across in my answers at all , and when i am doing unwell , i avoid social media entirely .","280922":"i don t normally eat when i m high . when i smoke , i usually smoke indica strains , which is more of a body high than a head high . it helps me relax .","280923":"i totally agree with you i ve even seen comments so to far that indicate that white people are somehow oppressed for being white , lmaoo . white privilege is still very much alive and kicking , and white people especially do not realize that , probably because they live in their own personal bubble .","280924":"yes , i absolutely love thunder and lightning storms ! ! i find them to be incredibly relaxing .","280925":"my original answer prior to moving into my new house would have been dogs , because i was never really a fan of cats . however , after living with a bunch of cats for the past months , i d have to say that i love cats and dogs equally .","280926":"halloweenie by ashnikko , at the moment . https www . youtube . com watch ? v iqst zs znw","280927":"i m doing well . i ended up taking valerian root and xanax last night in order to fall asleep , and i ended up sleeping for a solid hours straight . it was something much needed , and i feel awake and refreshed now . i have a doctor s appointment in a little while over webcam , so i m just killing time before i have to sign in .","280928":"honestly , my job . it has given me grief sometimes because of a select few people i ve worked with , but the majority of my time is very valuable and pleasurable to me . i love my job and my coworkers and my supervisor , and i genuinely enjoy what i do .","280929":"have a drunken night with friends and my roommates , lmaoo .","280930":"when i was years old , my friends and i took a joyride to a place called sweet hollow road on long island , which has supposedly been haunted for ages . it s a long , winding road with no lights and people have said to have had a lot of weird experiences there . we were drinking and we were underage , and when we pulled off to the side for the boys to pee , we were approached by a cop car . my ex lied to them and said he was the only one drinking , even though everyone was drinking including the driver , and somehow my ex and the driver sweet talked their way out of us getting in trouble for underage drinking and urinating in public . at one point , they searched the trunk of the car and found some weird items , including a ghillie suit which my friend used when he worked at an amusement haunted park . as well as a pair of night vision goggles . one of the cops ended up having a conversation with my friend about call of duty , and they developed such a rapport with them that they only let us off with a trespassing summons .","280931":"i ve never paid much attention to trends , so i honestly have no idea . anyways it s pm and i just took five capsules of valarian root . let s see how long it takes for me to fall asleep .","280932":"depends on where i am and what i m drinking . when i m out somewhere , i usually drink with a straw for anything iced . but when i m home , the only thing i drink with a straw is iced coffee .","280933":"these days , sleeping .","280934":"my voice is average , i don t like it but i don t dislike it either .","280935":"i d work a part time job just to keep myself occupied , or go back to school . i can t see myself being without a career , or attending college if i don t have a job i wouldn t know what to do with all of that spare time , and i d probably fall into a depressive episode .","280936":"this remains unseen , considering i have no recollection of my childhood .","280937":"i don t usually buy dumb things , or things that i don t end up using at some point or another . i m pretty conscientious with my money .","280938":"certain musical artists and bands i love sharing music with friends .","280939":"depends on my mood , because sometimes i m willing to die for literally nothing at all , ahah .","280940":"in my parents house , we had air conditioners window units . there aren t any air conditioners in my current house , so we re going to see if we can make it through with the ceiling fans before we make the leap to buy new ac units .","280941":"abortion is a health care issue , not a government issue . it should be legalized everywhere and covered by insurance . the death penalty is inhumane and archaic . marijuana should be legalized everywhere and taxed , much like alcohol and cigarettes . racial profiling is still prevalent in law enforcement and the justice system , and people of color are scrutinized and harmed more than white people . gender exists on a spectrum and doesn t solely include men and women .","280942":"mayonnaise is the most disgusting , revolting condiment . adults who play video games are not immature . tik tok isn t as cringey as most people make it out to be . grammar spelling isn t important on social media . men s mental health should be discussed more frequently .","280943":"i have borderline personality disorder .","280944":"probably the simpsons , haha . i don t believe i m seen a single entire episode . i ve also never seen any of the star wars movies .","280945":"haha , i watch everything on my television . i mainly use my laptop for work .","280946":"i m doing all right tonight . i m watching a buzzfeed unsolved true crime marathon on youtube , which has been really interesting . my day was rather boring , haha . i got up around am and drank coffee , and eventually had breakfast a few hours later . i did three loads of laundry . i ve mainly just been watching television and scrolling through social media all day .","280947":"it doesn t really affect my dysphoria very much it s something that happens monthly , and i don t think much about it while it s happening . it doesn t change my mood or behavior , it s just a body reaction that i deal with whenever it occurs .","280948":"three one in each bedroom .","280949":"well , i read in terms of my job but i don t consider that the same thing because it isn t recreational , haha . i m reading to copyedit proofread and fix mistakes , not out of my own enjoyment of the craft .","280950":"yeah , i agree . it isn t a solve all obviously , but it does help until someone does reach a point where they can get professional treatment . having someone to talk to is better than keeping everything within you , where you feel utterly alone and lost in your thoughts .","280951":"i read that book when i was young , but i don t even remember much about it . i was an avid reader back in the day , but the past few years , i haven t had the interest like i did when i was in school .","280952":"i agree . whenever someone comes to me looking for mental health advice , my first suggestion is to perhaps confide in a close friend or trusted family member , co worker , partner , etc etc . i m aware that not everyone has access to doctors or therapists , so sometimes the best thing for people is for them to vent and be understood by their peers having a strong support system does wonders .","280953":"a lot of the books on my bookshelf have not been read , haha . i always tell myself that i ll read them eventually , but i honestly haven t even had the attention span lately to commit to reading .","280954":"i wouldn t consider it cruel to encourage people to seek professional help , as long as you re not being close minded towards it when they tell you afterwards that they don t have the means to do so . it s very much the same in the united states as well , a lot of psych doctors and therapists don t take typical insurance coverage or aren t covered under insurance , and there are also a lot of individuals who aren t in a socioeconomic position to obtain professional help .","280955":"yeah , i m up to my nose in student loan debt , lol .","280956":"i own it , but i ve never read it .","280957":"i don t wear perfume , lol . i have a black cherry vanilla body spray that

, no . get that sh t away from me .","280961":"you re making a big deal over apostrophes ? lmaoo . just because i ve explained what something means doesn t mean i agree with it . the anon asked what halal meant , and i provided the information .","280962":"i don t disagree . i m just explaining why it s called halal .","280963":"it s middle eastern food halal technically means lawful , noting that the animals were slaughtered in a humane way at least , that s my understanding of it . in new york at least , there are halal food restaurants that have platters and gyros . i like getting a

past grudges and living your own life regardless of others .","280967":"i don t believe i ve ever eaten any exotic food , tbh . i ve had food from other cultures but i wouldn t really consider them to be exotic .","280968":"eh , people in general are confusing and contradictory regardless of their sex or gender . a lot of people feel entitled to know other people s business , which is wrong .","280969":"i d create it into an animal sanctuary , particularly for wolves .","280970":"lmaoo , exactly . it made zero sense , like ? ? i find the human body in general to be beautiful and fascinating . that doesn t mean my gender isn t valid . there s legit no correlation .","280971":"nah , because knowing my luck , i would slip the truth without meaning to because i often talk without

about myself , lol .","280976":"? ? ? how does a sticker say i m cis ? lmaoo .","280977":"no , this is something he developed himself . he s been an artist from a young age and he started rapping years ago . we went to college together , but i honestly have no idea what he majored in lol . it wasn t art or music , though .","280978":"yeah , he s very talented . he s also a hip hop artist and occasionally my roommate and i will go to his shows to show our support .","280979":"haha , thank you my friend is an artist and sells prints and stickers , so i bought a few from him because his style is amazing . i have another variant of the same nature , just a different character , on the back of my laptop but obviously i can t access that rn . lmaoo .","280980":"thanks , i appreciate it ! ! on another unrelated note , this is my current situation . i am forever confined to this bed now .","280981":"i m not sure i understand the question . do you mean if i know anyone who had a scholarship to attend a university overseas ? if so , then no . i also don t remember because i graduated high school years ago .","280982":"i don t really think people should be worried about not offending others in general , because when you think too much into how people think of you , it can change your opinion of yourself . what you do and say , meaning the things that make you happy and want to fulfill your own life , is your decision . it s out of your control whether or not people get offended by your choices or actions , and that isn t necessarily your responsibility .","280983":"no , not necessarily . i believe that good things come to people who word hard and put effort into making those good thing happen for themselves . waiting around for something good to happen won t work most of the time , and you have to be proactive about your life in order for things to work .","280984":"omg , i caaaaaan t . this cat is too cute .","280985":"i probably wouldn t be interested in talking to a person who thinks they can impress me based on the clothing they wear .","280986":"i m not interested in other people talking to me to get to know me , regardless of whether or not they re attractive . i m content with the amount of friends i have already .","280987":"i m not entirely sure , tbh . i always present myself in an honest and open fashion on the internet as a whole , and i believe that most people have an accurate understanding of who i am .","280988":"i m extremely proud of my friends who have overcome terrifying and difficult obstacles in order to make a better life for themselves . i have a lot of friends who have endured ab sive situations , but managed to escape from them to pursue their own happiness , and i m so extremely proud of them for recognizing the signs and taking the necessary steps to remove themselves from those situations .","280989":"there s still a large stigma surrounding men who are interested in feminine things , and those men are stigmatized and classified as being gay or weak in light of those interests . it s completely wrong , and no one is weak for liking things that go against the societal norm of what a person should be interested in by societal standards . additionally , a person s interests in concepts or objects has no bearing on their sexual orientation . this stigma is something that has caused a lot of grief among men , and it leads to further mental distress and s icidal ideation . it s very toxic and harmful .","280990":"i don t really believe in the concept of evil people , and i believe that people have both good and bad traits within them . it s all a matter of morality , environmental conditions , how a person s brain is wired , social factors , etc etc . people are much more complex than all good or all bad .","280991":"death and life by gustav klimt .","280992":"no , i don t have an answer . i don t answer sexual questions on askfm because it goes against their terms guidelines , and also i don t feel the need to discuss my sex life with complete strangers .","280993":"oh jeez . you should know by now that i don t answer questions of a sexual nature . go find someone else to project your feelings onto .","280994":"cont . . . so basically , the guy told me that he loves me . but the feeling isn t really mutual , even though i do like him and have grown an attachment . in the past , i was in this cycle of forming relationships with men online , growing extremely unhealthily attached to the point of splitting on them constantly and just developing a very toxic relationship . this has happened so many times that i promised myself i would get professional help and get my life together before even thinking about love , and never do the long distance thing cuz it isn t for me . after several months of being successful , here i am again in this situation . i ve become attached to this guy but i don t quite love him , i m too conflicted on my feelings and here he is telling me he loves me . i was honest about how i feel and he said he wasn t going to push it . however , i just feel like someone will get hurt . he lives in a whole other country and like i said , i don t think this will ever progress into anything other than chatting online . still , i m super attached now and it d be hard to just cut him off . what would you do ? sorry for how long this is . thx that s a rough situation to be in , and i m sorry you re going through this especially since it seems to be rather confusing for both yourself and the other person . i don t know if i would cut him off entirely , but it might be beneficial for you to try to distance yourself from him . perhaps , instead of talking to him every day , you talk to him every few days . allow yourself the space to collect your thoughts and feelings , and also indicate to him again that you don t reciprocate those feelings of love . i understand the whole attachment thing , because i often feel the same way about people in my life . i get overly attached to certain people in rounds , almost , i . e . i ll become extremely attached to one person and then they do something wrong , and then i ll attach myself to someone else in the meantime . i ve had too many favorite people to keep track of at this point . however , i do recommend distancing if you re attached and you don t believe you can cut him off entirely , and i also don t think cutting him off entirely is something that s necessary anyway . just enough so that he understands you don t feel the same way towards him and perhaps allow yourself the chance to ease yourself out of that attachment stage .","280995":"i wrote a piece of non fiction an essay of sorts that received a lot of attention on the website medium

recall any specific incidents , but i suppose it would be things like tripping over objects in the house or walking into walls , haha .","280999":"honestly , i would probably try to live my life as normally as i could until something disastrous happens that affects me personally .","281000":"usually bad movies have awful soundtracks too , haha . however , i recently watched suckerpunch again , and i forgot how awesome that soundtrack was . it was also a pretty good movie .","281001":"i ve been on askfm since or so so roughly eight years . this account is fairly new , i d say perhaps years old , but i ve had plenty of previous accounts besides this one . i first became involved in askfm because formspring was on the decline , and a few of my friends started using askfm instead , so i joined them . my favorite parts of the site are answering questions about my opinions and my life , as well as educating others and being educated by the people i follow . i also like getting to know others on a deeper basis . the obvious downsides of askfm are the trolls , lol . they make this site unbearable at times because you simply cannot post one thing or opinion without being criticized for it , which is exhausting at the worst .","281002":"i believe the greatest aspects of life are the relationships you cultivate with other people whether they re coworkers , friends , family , partners , etc etc . your life is defined by not only your own goals and ambitions , but also the support system you have behind it all .","281003":"i ve been giving off the overall impression that i ve been doing well , but honestly , it s been difficult for me to hold things together during this time . i m not sure if it s the regular ups and downs of my mood that i experience normally , or if it s something influenced by the pandemic and having to remain quarantined until further notice or a combination of the two . i wrote something creative for the first time in a very long time , and that is usually an indication that i m not feeling the greatest because i only write when i m in pain . it was cathartic , at the very least , and i m hoping to engage in more writing in the upcoming days or weeks .","281004":"people who try to sugarcoat things or beat around the bush in trying to say or explain something . i have no patience for either of those things , and i d prefer if someone says something outright instead of trying to dance their way around how they feel .","281005":"red flags in a relationship lying , especially with no known cause . manipulative behavior , i . e . extorting you to do what they want to do in exchange for something from you . gaslighting , meaning questioning what you ve done or said and made you out to seem crazy , for lack of a better term . anything that causes you not to trust your partner . your partner not being supportive of your dreams and goals .","281006":"i don t believe a stranger has had any impact on my life , tbh . everyone

most recent ex . lmaoo . however , it has helped to focus on myself and my goals , my friendships , and just living in the moment and doing what s best for myself more than anything else . you can t force or rush the process of getting over an ex , it has to happen naturally .","281018":"my version of love for today was self care . i showered , cleaned my face with scrub and lotion , wiped down the bathroom to make myself feel productive , treated myself to my favorite meal , and watched a few episodes of one of my favorite television shows .","281019":"yeah , i particularly enjoy cheddar and sour cream chips .","281020":"they re showing you disrespect , and what they re telling you is not what bdsm should be about . if you feel uncomfortable , then you have to trust that instinct . nothing should be happening without your consent . your fear is correct in most cases , it does get worse . and even though you still love them , it s important to recognize that your partner s behavior and thought process are wrong . it s ultimately your decision as to where to go from here , but i m just advising you that what they did to you was utterly wrong and ab sive .","281021":"the quote if you re going through hell , keep going has always resonated with me .","281022":"i love sushi , and i actually had some tonight ! ! i ve never made it myself , though . it would probably turn

ve never heard of this before , but it sounds pretty unhealthy . you need more vitamins in your diet than what just meat can provide you .","281025":"my entire life has been composed of addictive behavior , lol . i don t feel like discussing what they are were , though it could be very triggering for some people .","281026":"woohoo , happy friday ! ! this week was grueling working from home doesn t make the work itself any easier , and i felt like my brain was overloaded every day this week . i m definitely less anxious than i was when i worked in the actual office , but the workload has actually been more than usual .","281027":"just because you re both into bdsm doesn t give your partner the right to hurt you without your consent . their behavior by hitting you is still wrong , and the fact that you re questioning it to begin with means that you know deep down that what they did to you was wrong .","281028":"it s basic psychology rhetoric , lol . a lot of people fall into unhealthy coping mechanisms when they ve been ab sed because they ve been conditioned to believe that they don t deserve anything better , and it s easier to escape rather than confront your feelings head on . also , addictive behaviors and mental illness go hand in hand , and they re often co morbid .","281029":"when i said diet , i meant the food i consume probably should have been more specific . i don t order takeout very often although lately my roommates and i have been slacking on cooking , and when i do order takeout , it isn t a ridiculously unhealthy meal . i drink regularly , and that s unfortunately one of my unhealthy coping mechanisms .","281030":"no , which is why i usually just copy paste the entire thread into one answer instead of doing it in separate parts . it doesn t take much for me to copy paste since i m normally on my laptop when i answer questions .","281031":"because i ve been conditioned to hate myself for the past years and i haven t broke myself of the unhealthy coping mechanisms i ve developed over the years in an effort to deal with what i ve endured .","281032":"thanks for reiterating exactly what i just said , lmaoo . my diet is healthy , but everything else about me is not healthy by any means . i m taking steps to improve , though .","281033":"i don t answer questions that are trolling or inappropriate , particularly any questions that

to be fat , per say , but they re on the bigger side . they re also both over feet tall , lol .","281037":"i guess ? i ve always been uncomfortable with calling myself a survivor of anything because a lot of people have had it a lot worse off than me .","281038":"the only household chores that are done daily are the dishes . on a weekly basis , we do an overall cleansing of the house dusting , vacuuming , mopping the kitchen and hallway , cleaning the bathroom , etc etc . i ve never hired a maid before . i don t mind cleaning at all .","281039":"well , the day is pretty much over

to reiterate i m not engaging in drama because it s silly and pointless . you re just asking my opinion on someone else s opinion solely to run back to them and tattle , and quite frankly , i m too old and tired for that nonsense .","281049":"i think this is a loaded question that will only stir up drama . i m not in the mood to engage in silly drama , so i won t be answering this question

gift . i love personalized sentimental things like that .","281055":"no , you re irresponsible .","281056":"aw , thank you . honestly , i don t really see it as strength as much as it s an attachment . we were friends prior to entering a relationship and i never wanted to end that friendship . when we agreed to break up , we both established that we would still remain in contact as friends because we both have contributed so much to each other s lives over the years and it would be a disservice to both of us if we stopped talking entirely .","281057":"initially , i wanted to use it as an unhealthy coping mechanism because i knew getting drunk would help me forget about my life temporarily . eventually , i experimented and grew a taste for a variety of beer , liquor , and wine . i

friendships that ended up hurting me because i cared too much and they cared too little .","281103":"don t put more effort into a relationship whether platonic or romantic than what it s worth especially if the other person isn t contributing to their half of the relationship as well . a lot of people hurt themselves because they invest so much time and energy into relationships that are

way to lose weight .","281118":"i rarely use emojis on askfm , and i don t play these games , so no .","281119":"doesn t it ? it s nice outside where i live , but definitely not warm enough out to sunbathe , haha . it s currently degrees fahrenheit , but it s super windy .","281120":"i don t remember what the last thing i said out loud was . i haven t spoken yet this morning , and i don t remember what i said last night before going to bed . lmaoo .","281121":"pajamas , lmaoo . that s the majority of what i ve been wearing these past two months .","281122":"i don t believe i have .","281123":"i love having bbqs during the summer ! ! my ex s family and i would have them every week or so , and his father would grill hot dogs and cheeseburgers and steaks . my roommates and i just hired a landscaper , so once everything gets cleaned up outside , we re going to buy a grill , a firepit , and some outdoor furniture .","281124":"even though there are beaches all around me , i seldom visit the beach because i don t really like all of the crowds of people there . it s relaxing to sit in the sun with a friend and talk , listen to music , and have some drinks while swimming in the ocean every now and again , but the amount of people who go to the beach also deters me .","281125":"sit outside and sunbathe with a good book and a glass of iced tea or coffee .","281126":"i ve never gardened before , so i m not entirely sure , haha . i m not sure i would be very good at it .","281127":"possibly . i ve always gotten the same result too . i don t put much faith in those types of tests overall , though .","281128":"no , i ve never had surgery before .","281129":"you should at least put a trigger warning before this question , or censor it in some way . there s active and passive s icidal ideation . passive ideation is when a person has thoughts of s icide but no intent on hurting themselves . active , on the other hand , is when a person does have the intent on hurting themselves and will often have a plan to do so .","281130":"selfie from the other day","281131":"of course it should most definitely be normalized .","281132":"i d call him and ask him what s going on .","281133":"it isn t accurate , no . a lot of people will often take the test at multiple times throughout the course of a few months or years and come up with different results . it s been proven to be inaccurate .","281134":"i hope you feel better i ve been doing okay having both good days and bad , but today has been fine overall . i m currently watching house and i m thinking about going to bed soon .","281135":"enlighten me . what is my ip address and where am i located ?","281136":"you can t trace which device someone is using on askfm . you d have to remote enter into the system with a provided ip address . you also didn t tell me which device i m even using , lmaoo . i m not clicking on your link , so if you want to leave this conversation with a little bit of dignity , you ll admit to your wrongdoings and stop sending these messages to people .","281137":"well , it looks like the time you originally gave me has run out remember , minutes ago you said i had minutes . guess my device will forcibly be corrupted . now it s up to you to figure out which device i m using .","281138":"lol . no , not yet at least . we ll see where this goes .","281139":"mister tom , please forgive my ignorance . of course i ll abide by your bullsh t scheme and fall directly into your plan of deception . i ll inform you of when the operation is complete .","281140":"this is like the fourth person honestly , it s probably all the same person to claim they re from like , microsoft or the government trying to scam askfm people into giving their account information , lmao . it s so amusing . like , yeah someone s security is compromised , therefore let s contact that person via ask f ckin fm , aka a dying website , to resolve the alleged issue .","281141":"ah , the renowned bullshitter has found his way onto my page . welcome .","281142":"i don t feel like figuring that out rn .","281143":"scorpio . infj . slytherin . i have no clue about the other two .","281144":"well , i completely paid off my car loan last weekend which is something i ve never done before , so i guess that would count .","281145":"interactions with my close friends , drinking coffee in the quiet morning , writing something that i m proud of , and playing with animals .","281146":"nah , i don t even know when the coronavirus pandemic is going to end so there s no point in making travel plans until i know a definitive answer .","281147":"margherita pizza is delicious .","281148":"yeah , he s gorgeous . and his meow is so high pitched cute ! !","281149":"i love all of them because they all have such distinct personalities , but i ve become attached to the mainecoon even though we re only looking after him for a little while . he s extremely sweet and loves cuddling .","281150":"a lot of people don t have school or work because of the coronavirus pandemic , or just a lot more free time in general .","281151":"i don t watch anime , so i don t have much of an opinion .","281152":"yeah , it s been more active from what i can tell based on the questions i get and how active my feed has been .","281153":"everyone should be against fascism .","281154":"thinking is overrated .","281155":"unfortunately , no . hahah . i can t wait until next year when we decorate the house for halloween .","281156":"everyone is entitled to their opinion but it doesn t necessarily mean that their opinion is correct or justifiable .","281157":"i believe the means meaning the journey one takes to get to an objective is much more important than the end result . end results can either be good or bad , but it s what we ve learned over that process that truly matters . it teaches us and helps us grow .","281158":"last summer , when i went to the bay with a friend and we listened to live music , drank tequila , and watched the sun set by the water .","281159":"probably sometime during the medieval times , just to see what it was actually like back then . i love watching period movies and shows about that era , but obviously it s much more glamorized than how it actually was back then .","281160":"this is subjective , so it varies from person to person . i personally don t believe that we can ever stop improving because there are infinite ways to improve ourselves and evolve as we grow older . some people accept themselves for who they are , but that also doesn t mean there isn t more room for improvement .","281161":"well . . . first of all , i am mentally ill , so if i was hospitalized , it would probably be for a very valid reason . tbh , i should have been hospitalized a long time ago . secondly it s incorrect to refer to psych hospitals as insane asylums these days , it places more of a negative stigma on those types of hospitals and towards the mentally ill population as a whole . hospitals these days are a place for rehab and recovery , it isn t a death sentence .","281162":"i enjoy going on walks , and i should really get out of the house and go on walks more often now that the weather is getting nicer .","281163":"i don t believe in karma , so no .","281164":"omg , that sounds literally amazing ! ! i ll be feasting with you in spirit . i had a leftover slice of pizza for dinner about an hour ago , lol . i didn t feel like making something new .","281165":"i think that s the reason why people are so fascinated with killers because their actions are vile , and because the psychology behind why someone becomes a killer is also interesting and can vary wildly .","281166":"no , i keep my door closed at night , lol . occasionally one of our cats will be sleeping on my bed already by the time i go to bed , but she usually leaves because i thrash around in my sleep .","281167":"did i tell y all that my household is looking after four cats now ? lmaoo .","281168":"it could be both , but it s ultimately decided based on the individual . some people are racist because of their upbringing while other people are racist because they developed into that while growing up not necessarily because of their family . either way , a racist person needs to acknowledge that their way of thinking is harmful and flawed , and it s their responsibility to take command of those thoughts and de condition themselves into not being racist anymore .","281169":"honestly , i d probably stop myself from c tting before it even started . it ended up controlling my life for eight years and was a big subject of ridicule and bullying when i was younger , which made me hate myself even more . i still get urges to c t even today , even though i ve been mostly clean since i was like years old .","281170":"it s never phased me . there are airports everywhere around here , and i always see planes flying overhead on a regular basis .","281171":"i m neither immature nor mature for my age . i m just as mature as i should be considering my age .","281172":"i don t even know enough about the zodiac to even fathom an answer to this question . i don t really believe you can judge an entire person based solely on their star sign either .","281173":"definitely not , lol . their reporting system is subpar , and those who deserve to be banned or reprimanded never do while people who don t do anything wrong get warnings .","281174":"he s an odd one , that boi .","281175":"no , i m not religious by any means .","281176":"some things are better left unsaid .","281177":"lmaoo . yeah , definitely not everyone s cup of tea . rofl .","281178":"i mean he doesn t do it regularly , but he once offered me slices of raw onion to eat while we were cooking , and i was like uh . . . no ? lmaoo . he told me he can eat an entire onion , and i was disgusted .","281179":"smart thoughts usually don t come to me at all , haha .","281180":"i dislike cleaning the bathroom , but obviously it s something i have to do , lol . cleaning the rest of the house is fine , but the bathroom hurts my back and knees because of all of the bending and kneeling .","281181":"i ve always used android phones .","281182":"yes , ramen is delicious .","281183":"i ve heard of the name before , but i m not really too sure who he is .","281184":"my roommate eats raw onions in one sitting , lmaoo . i don t remember if i ve ever had raw onions though , only cooked .","281185":"that s a random person s handle , lol . but yeah , celine deactivated it appears .","281186":"scrambled eggs this morning for breakfast .","281187":"i try to take one or two on the weekend when i have the spare time .","281188":"well yeah , that s funny and could be turned into an amusing stand up piece .","281189":"no , but it all depends on context . i won t listen to a comedian who s blatantly homophobic or sexist , etc etc .","281190":"depends on the context , tbh . like i said , if it s derogatory toward the lgbtq community then that s not really a joke at all .","281191":"i never said it was a personal attack , lol . some of my favorite comedians are probably pretty controversial , at any rate .","281192":"if a joke is derogatory towards groups of oppressed people , then that isn t a joke it s bigotry . people in the lgbtq community can certainly joke and make fun of themselves , but if it s coming from someone outside of that group , then that s ignorance .","281193":"i have a headache , but of course i just made more coffee so clearly i want to torment myself .","281194":"most jokes don t offend me .","281195":"if they seem racist when only they re angry , then they re overall racist when they re angry , they re showing their true colors , which is racism . the reason why they don t appear racist when they re calm is because they don t want people knowing that they re racist . so yeah , an angry racist person is still definitely racist all around .","281196":"i m a few towns away from my parents house . far enough to be comfortable but i also don t mind driving there to help out every now and again when they need my help .","281197":"most places have one of those scanners where you place the bill in , and a light shows where the appropriate markers should show up . there s also a pen you can use to put ink on the bill and it ll come up a certain color if the bill is fake . otherwise , it s all a matter of how to bill looks and feels . i haven t worked with money in like six years , so i don t remember the characteristics .","281198":"absolutely onions are great in food . especially with peppers .","281199":"yeah , lemon chicken is delicious ."}}
