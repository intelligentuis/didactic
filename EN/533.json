this little ball of white light just floating across the room . second , i was sitting on my bed and i was just on my phone and in the corner of my right eye i see movement a women as if shes sitting next to me talking with a lot of hand gestures . third , in the middle of the night around am i saw a shadow of a figure in the corner of my room . next morning bf at the time tells me he had the worst nightmare and the thing was standing in the corner just starring at him in his dream and i point at the corner i saw the figure and say it was standing right there . and he was so freaked out he
