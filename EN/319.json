said seriously .","295142":"the worst job interview i had was for a social media marketing company after i had just graduated from college . i sent them my resume after they expressed interest in me applying for the job , because they asked for my resume personally so they could have it on file . i figured i didn t need to bring it to the actual interview , so i didn t rookie mistake . when i walked into the office , the interviewer asked me for my resume and i told him that i emailed it to them , and he promptly ended the interview right there , after only speaking to him for maybe two minutes . i was absolutely devastated and i cried in my car the entire drive home . it was so embarrassing .","295143":"why would i be afraid of ben ? ? lmao . he s one of the most insignificant and pathetic askfm users . although i m thankful he isn t really around anymore , his spam was super annoying .","295144":"hello do you have a question ? ?","295145":"aw , it s okay ! ! yes , i have a friend who s a professional hair stylist so i always go to her salon to get my hair colored .","295146":"i don t like physical affection from the majority of people , but i also don t like hamburgers . i don t really prefer either .","295147":"i ve used the word adulting a few times , yeah .","295148":"my hair appointment on saturday . it was fairly expensive , but absolutely worth it because my hair was getting gross and the color was so faded i wanted something brand new .","295149":"i spent one summer playing volleyball for an adult league for fun , but that was all . i never played sports in high school or anything .","295150":"i drink coffee the most . i usually have at least two cups per day , but they re relatively big cups , lol .","295151":"no , i m not afraid of anyone in general .","295152":"right now , nothing . i ve been incredibly down on myself lately due to some life circumstances .","295153":"no , quite the opposite actually . i honestly hate myself and try to focus as little time as possible on myself , which often results in me not giving myself enough credit or allowing myself time to heal .","295154":"depends on my mood . i listen to alternative rock , metal , hip hop , pop , and instrumentals i . e . video game , movie , and television soundtracks .","295155":"yeah , i definitely have the capacity to be jealous and it hurts me sometimes . i m trying to get over my feelings of jealousy because it s a toxic emotion and doesn t serve me .","295156":"yeah , it s fun ! ! although a little frustrating , lol . i ve only played once in my life , though .","295157":"definitely false . sushi is one of my favorite foods .","295158":"i prefer coffee . it s my life fuel i have at least two cups every day , lol .","295159":"yeah , sometimes . there are certain occasions where i m filled with rage , but isn t always present .","295160":"never . i ve actually never been to the hospital for myself , it s always been for other people .","295161":"yeah , although i haven t played video games in a while . i really want to play layers of fear , though ! !","295162":"aw , thank you ! ! i feel a little better today . going out with my friend last night venting really helped .","295163":"thank you , dera . i really appreciate it .","295164":"i haven t yet , he s at work for another hour or so and i would feel terrible if i bothered him .","295165":"i hope so too . i just literally begged my friend to come pick me up so i wouldn t be alone . i don t know what else to do .","295166":"thank you so much .","295167":"i ll also put this in my list of things not to tell a person who is s icidal .","295168":"thanks friend .","295169":"it isn t something i m comfortable discussing online , and honestly it s a whole bunch of things happening at once , not just one incident . everything has been piling up and i m so burnt out and broken , and i just don t want to exist . the only reason why i m even posting these messages is because i need to get this sh t off my chest somehow , keeping it inside my head hurts too much .","295170":"i m extremely depressed , sobbing my eyes out , and passively s icidal . i m far from okay right now i have no idea what to do . i m a failure as a person and this life is utterly meaningless to me . i can t handle this anymore .","295171":"i love them both in different ways . platonic love you feel for a close friend is much different than romantic love .","295172":"i like sleeping as much as i want , which includes usually going to bed early , sleeping in , and taking naps in between . i also like going to a bar or restaurant and having a drink with whoever i m with .","295173":"i was explaining to my friend why i was in a bad mood . i texted her last night , but she was working and didn t get back to me until after i already fell asleep . so i responded after i woke up this morning .","295174":"uh , yeah ? ? lmao .","295175":"heartwarming , busy , unpredictable , dramatic , and creative .","295176":"it isn t something i feel like discussing online .","295177":"aw , not over the top at all ! ! i think that s super cute .","295178":"i don t really know , i ve only ever been in love with two people in my entire life .","295179":"i prefer earth tones , i . e . magenta , navy blue , forest green , brown , and black . i also like dark purple .","295180":"we had dinner dessert at the house .","295181":"the only hobbies that i ve carried over from childhood are reading and playing video games . i still enjoy escaping into a book , and i remember playing video games from a very young age .","295182":"browse social media , listen to music , read , see my boyfriend , and sometimes hang out with a friend .","295183":"everyone feels age differently , so i feel like my current age years old .","295184":"my sunday was fine . i had coffee breakfast in the morning , ran some errands , took a nap , and then had dinner with my family for father s day . afterwards , my mood took a turn for the worst and i ended up feeling extremely bitter , sad , and angry . i fell asleep around pm i think , because i just couldn t handle it anymore .","295185":"thank you , i appreciate it . i ve been in a bad mood all morning , so i m hoping that work distracts me at least .","295186":"they re co morbid , which means that often times people diagnosed with bpd are also diagnosed with depression as well . however , having depression isn t a diagnostic requirement for having bpd .","295187":"this is what summer feels like where i live .","295188":"aw , thank you .","295189":"no , i haven t yet . it s been a busy weekend with getting my hair done father s day and whatnot , but i ll try to check it out this week before i go on vacation .","295190":"no , but i want to eventually .","295191":"heathers ! !","295192":"unless the partner makes it completely obvious that they don t love their partner , i think it s difficult to determine if someone loves their partner more than the other . especially because love languages are complex and people express their love differently . however , in the case where one person definitely doesn t love their partner as much as their partner loves them , then yeah that can get really unhealthy . the same can be said for any sort of relationship , romantic or platonic . both people need to be putting in work to maintain that relationship , otherwise it s simply one sided and unfair .","295193":"you said most people , which is basically a nice way of saying no one . i already have my doubts about people in my life caring about me , so reassuring the fact that they genuinely don t care or at least most of them don t care isn t exactly the right thing to say . that insinuates that i definitely have friends who pretend to be friends with me , whether out of obligation or pity , and only furthest my assumption that they actually don t care about whether i m alive or de d .","295194":"i understand that . but to basically say you re right , no one cares about you is definitely not a healthy or right thing to say to a person who clearly struggles with s icidal thoughts . that was pretty insensitive .","295195":"thanks , that s definitely something that needed to be reassured to me .","295196":"i don t follow many people , but some of the more active people i follow are celinem littlesha shehitsback urlsareshittbh manicmartyrdom kittiemeowsie ninegdxfour jonesymo","295197":"considering i m s icidal sometimes , no . sometimes i believe i m a burden on everyone around me , that no one actually cares about me , and that i would personally be better off de d .","295198":"spending time with my boyfriend makes me happy . drinking alcohol with a close friend and laughing together also makes me happy . listening to music doesn t necessarily make me happy , but it does put me in a better frame of mind and calms me down .","295199":"i can be with certain things , yeah . like pieces of jewelry or paintings that have been commissioned or photographs , stuff like that .","295200":"my sadness usually goes hand in hand with my depression , and that s likely due to a chemical imbalance and my personality disorder . even though i m on medication , i still have bad days .","295201":"i m not a unique person by any means .","295202":"not at the moment . i m a bit melancholy , but it isn t something as down as sadness .","295203":"i m not an inherently happy person , so no . there are some instances that make me temporarily happy but it s pretty short lived . i m usually in just a neutral state .","295204":"i m five feet tall . i am a smol bean .","295205":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","295206":"yes , i have a boyfriend .","295207":"i don t think i would be able to stand myself if i tried being my own friend , simply because i think i m a greedy and selfish person and i feel a lot of jealousy in relationships . i don t have a clear cut personality because who i changes depending on who i m with , i could act one way around someone and a totally different way around someone else .","295208":"i m outgoing around very small groups of friends . however , if there s a large crowd then i m very introverted and anxious .","295209":"i don t really have a group of friends , because i only hang one on one with people most of the time . however , it ultimately depends on my mood that evening . i d say i m fairly unpredictable because i can swing from being the comedian to the listener to the loud , reckless one .","295210":"i suppose so , although i haven t developed an original plot in quite a long time . however , my way of describing things and telling a story in general , regardless of what that story is , is talented .","295211":"human beings in general are dramatic . it isn t something that can be based off of gender alone .","295212":"yeah , it happened every so often when i worked as a supervisor during my retail days . some decisions i had to make were unpopular among those who worked beneath me , but they were decisions which had to be made . and quite frankly , the reason why they were unpopular was because very few people actually wanted to work . smh .","295213":"depends on the person . i ve had some people totally disregard my ideas or feelings , while a select few people do take me seriously . although lately , it s been feeling like i genuinely have no one besides my boyfriend because no one else puts any effort into the friendship anymore .","295214":"hello do you have a question ? ?","295215":"coping with borderline rage be like","295216":"i like to plan things because i enjoy having something to look forward to , but honestly most of my plans are very spontaneous because i have zero patience . if i want to do something , it literally eats at me until i do it because i m normally very impulsive .","295217":"i honestly have zero clue . i haven t tried imitating an accent since i was in high school .","295218":"no , it s a feeling that was triggered over a year ago by a specific incident . i want to let go of it because holding onto toxic emotions is unhealthy .","295219":"no , it hasn t . even though i m quite open about my past and experiences , i only admit to particular things that i m comfortable talking about to virtually anyone . there are still a lot of things that i keep to myself to protect myself and those around me .","295220":"my day has been fine . i woke up early had coffee and breakfast , then i went out to run some errands for father s day . after i came home , i put all of the groceries away and then took a two hour long nap , lol . since then , i made some iced coffee and i ve been sitting outside before it starts to rain . we re having a family dinner tonight , and then i m basically planning on going to bed right afterwards .","295221":"no thoughts , no prayers can bring back what s no longer there . the silent are damned , the body count is on your hands . thoughts prayers , grandson","295222":"the s , haha . even though i was alive throughout the s , i wish i was a bit older so that i could actually be part of the culture and whatnot , especially the music scene . most of my favorite past bands are all s alternative rock grunge bands .","295223":"i d love to learn how to sing well .","295224":"yes , there s one thing i m still holding onto from over a year ago that i should have let go right after it happened .","295225":"the correct way is to say i m nice to him . meaning that you re purposely being nice to that other person .","295226":"i don t post photos of my boyfriend on askfm .","295227":"you re asking me this question as if i actually know who he is , lmao . i don t know anything about morgan s past relationship . cc littlesha","295228":"only if it s a trial by combat .","295229":"depends on the individual . i know some people who use sundays to do all of their errands and chores meanwhile , there are people like me who like doing everything on the other days of the week using sundays for relaxation , lol . although i did have to run errands this morning , bleh .","295230":"i have a mole on my cheek , yeah .","295231":"cont what a great father . but , per the stigma , if a woman let s say got a babysitter to go out with friends , she s a horrible mother for doing something for herself instead of being responsible at home . yes , that s what i was trying to convey . i assume my message wasn t clear , lol . i ve been a wreck all morning . thank you , though , that s exactly my point as well .","295232":". . . oh jeez . i can t even put into words how much i m shaking my head at this , lmao . i m not surprised he thinks this way , but i m also still shocked at how delusional he is .","295233":"i m average . i make enough money to live comfortably , but i can t go out and haphazardly spend my money or anything . which is why it s been so difficult for me to find an apartment because i don t make quite enough money to pay for rent by myself .","295234":"i agree with you . honestly , i didn t think my opinion was too farfetched at all , and perhaps i was just expressing it with less clarity than i originally thought .","295235":"being good is multifaceted and depends on a lot of factors . i believe if someone has a genuine , kind heart and goes out of their way to help someone else in need , then they re a good person . selflessly caring for others , owning up to their mistakes , and knowing how to be wrong and apologize are also important factors .","295236":"i posted a few pictures a couple answers down ! ! it s orange reddish rn , though . it looks a lot more orange in person .","295237":"who said anything about criticizing females ? society is what s under scrutiny here , the culture surrounding men and women .","295238":"it isn t outrageous to expect fathers to be a parent to their children , regardless of whether or not they have a job . mothers usually have full time jobs too , and they re percent expected to also care for the children outside of their careers .","295239":"i don t really know what you mean by mom movie , lol . i don t generally watch movies that revolve around families and whatnot . i also believe when it comes to child custody , the responsibility does often go to the mother as well , so i agree with you . however , that s usually in instances where the father is obviously unfit to be a father so it s in the child s best interest to remain with the mother . otherwise , there s shared custody .","295240":"i respectfully disagree . in my experience , fathers are generally treated with more respect than mothers because of the culture that exists around men and women in general . women are seen as childbearers and their role as a mother is expected , meanwhile when a lot of fathers do necessary things for their children , it s praised .","295241":"is it ? i really never took notice of that before , in my eyes both hallmark holidays are basically treated the same way . even if that was indeed true , that doesn t mean that mothers aren t treated unfairly every other day of the year . showing appreciation for mothers one day per year doesn t mean that the stigma and expectations around being a mother aren t there anymore .","295242":"i m a very emotional person , and i normally cry over really insignificant things , lol .","295243":"my best friend s father took me in as his own when i was growing up , and he was such a wonderful parent and overall human being to everyone who stepped into his life . i felt more at home around her parents than i did around my own parents .","295244":"i think it depends on where you re from , because i ve been seeing a lot of posts online today already about people appreciating their fathers . but in general , mothers are normally expected to take care of the children and are never praised or rewarded for being mothers . there s a culture around fatherhood , on the other hand , where a lot of fathers seem to get immense praise for doing things like watching the children or changing diapers , even though realistically that s part of their role as a father .","295245":"climate change will be at its all time peak , fossil fuels will be completely depleted , a lot of animal species will be extinct , and there will probably be a pandemic eradicating much of the human population .","295246":"sometimes , yeah . however , there s also a lot of praise for fathers for doing things that are necessary in their role as a father , that mothers aren t praised for doing because it s more expected of mothers than fathers to take care of children .","295247":"if they re a father , of course ! ! i wished a happy father s day to a few of my friends this morning .","295248":"i honestly can t remember . he rarely does things that anger or upset me , and he s a pretty responsible person , both in terms of his life and his emotions . the only thing that i get on his case about is cleaning up after himself , but he s gotten remarkably better at that over the past few months .","295249":"i don t believe i have any interests that most people aren t interested in , haha . most of my interests are fairly mainstream , i . e . true crime , music , video games , books , art , television shows , etc etc .","295250":"i can t answer questions about my childhood easily . i have memory loss and cannot remember anything really prior to the age of .","295251":"i don t really remember any of my childhood fears . however , if it was something i never told anymore , i sure as hell ain t posting it on askfm , lol .","295252":"aw , that sounds super cool . i love quirky celebrations like that .","295253":"i ve never heard of this before ! ! i just looked it up it sounds interesting . apparently there are a lot of celebrations in the united states as well , including in new york city .","295254":"no , we re not obligated to help others . although it sounds a bit selfish , we have to help ourselves first and foremost . otherwise we won t have the energy to help other people in our lives . no one is under any obligation to help someone else , especially if the act brings them harm or unhappiness .","295255":"some people still view video games as childish , so i would likely choose that . although i haven t played in a while , i still enjoy video games as a whole and i m usually always watching someone playing , whether it s on youtube or twitch .","295256":"no , i m not a nosy person . i m respectful of other people s boundaries and i don t ask questions unless they re expected or warranted . i was raised by very nosy people and it was a blight on my life growing up , and i would never want people to feel violated or annoyed with me like i felt with those individuals whenever they tried prying into my life .","295257":"i d like to believe that i do , but i m also a very anxious person who gets flighty when confronted with new objectives or experiences . i think too deeply into what could possibly go wrong and sometimes it prevents me from enjoying the adventure experience .","295258":"new official pics of my hairrrr","295259":"i don t really know what i want to do with my life , tbh . i know that i want to be a writer and live independently and be happy with myself , but those are fairly broad goals . however , i do know that i m steadily working towards those goals and it s only a matter of time before things start to fall into place .","295260":"overall , i d like to lose between pounds . i already lost pounds , so it s only a matter of time before i reach my goal .","295261":"this is going to be a boring answer , but i would pay off all of my debts . then i would invest money into a house .","295262":"yes , i have quite a few hobbies although i don t really get to enjoy them very often . i like reading , writing , painting , playing video games , listening to music , sleeping , and hanging out with my friends .","295263":"thundercats ! ! i used to love that show .","295264":"that s never happened to me before . i don t have that feature turned on either .","295265":"? ? ? are you blind , lmao .","295266":"thank you ! ! it s actually more orange .","295267":"lol . damn it isole , you caught me .","295268":"i guess that i m trying to copy everyone because literally the only hair color i haven t tried is green . lmao .","295269":"i can barely remember my own hair colors , let alone someone else s . lmao . cadence is a friend of mine , though .","295270":"i don t discuss my sex life on the internet .","295271":"no . i m not interested in making new friends . if you want to learn more about me , however , you re free to ask me questions here .","295272":"poetalunam my account is private though . i only accept requests from people i know .","295273":"hello do you have a question ? ?","295274":"oh , yeah i recognize the profile picture . she used to ask me questions . i don t know how she found me tbh , she just started asking me questions randomly one day , lol .","295275":"no , i don t know who that is .","295276":"uh , what ? i have no idea who you re talking about , lmao . i don t converse with people that young .","295277":"our relationships with our family , friends , significant others , etc etc . jobs will come and go and money can always be re made , but our interpersonal relationships are what give life ultimately its meaning and substance .","295278":"? ? ? cadence doesn t even have orange hair , lmao . regardless , even if she did have orange hair then it obviously doesn t mean i want to be her . people are allowed to express themselves .","295279":"nope . i m absolutely useless when it comes to most car things .","295280":"my boyfriend and my best friend do , yes .","295281":"aw , thank you ! ! my stylist took better photos at the salon , so i ll post them when she sends them to me . they show the true color of the hair , haha .","295282":"new hairrrr it s more ginger orange in person , tho .","295283":"like . . . people are spending real money on coins . . . when we don t even know what the coins are used for yet ? oh jeez . i know how you feel , things were much simpler a few years ago . although there was a hell of a lot more drama , lol .","295284":"haha , i appreciate the sentiment . i don t care about coins , though . the ranking doesn t mean anything to me .","295285":"oh , hell no . i can barely speed walk two miles on the treadmill . i still do it times per week , but it absolutely kills my legs .","295286":"not anymore . now apparently i m , haha .","295287":"i don t think liking the smell of sunscreen is unusual , haha . they always have a really pleasant smell to them . i love the smell of gasoline .","295288":"yes , i m talented when it comes to writing . i have a knack for the written word and can normally describe things with ease .","295289":"i believe some people have the capacity to change , yes . we have the ability to unlearn behavioral patterns or thought patterns and adopt new styles of thinking .","295290":"honestly , i normally call them out on it and ask them why they re blatantly lying to me . i don t tolerate lying in any form of relationships , platonic or romantic . i won t trust you if you lie to me .","295291":"sushi ! ! especially spicy tuna rolls . i also tried pad thai for the first time the other day fell in love .","295292":"i hate anything that has mayonnaise in it . it literally sickens me .","295293":"no , i ve never seen any of the star wars movies .","295294":"anywhere between and hours .","295295":"no , i usually just type haha or lol to lighten the mood if i think an answer is too serious

bullied for my appearance . it wasn t much different from real life , haha .","295299":"my boyfriend and i switch on and off between big spoon and little spoon , lol . however , we don t usually stay in those positions for very long . after like minutes , we usually get hot and retreat to our respective sides of the bed .","295300":"i honestly can t remember the last time i went to the library , yikes . probably sometime when i was in college , i always went to the library on campus to study and do homework .","295301":"i usually just work during the summer , haha . however , i ve been doing that since i was years old . i ve never had any extraordinary summer plans or anything .","295302":"i ve never given anyone a massage before , so i have no idea . haha .","295303":"yes , i was my best friend s maid of honor at her wedding .","295304":"i avoid and or ignore them .","295305":"singing , lol .","295306":"you essentially feel like you re dying .","295307":"no , sometimes it triggers a panic attack .","295308":"i don t need to try to cry , it just happens automatically . lmao .","295309":"no , i just have a small group of friends and we rarely get to see each other .","295310":"i don t personally know . you can easily google this question .","295311":"addiction is a mental illness , so yes . it s listed in the dsm v and can relate to any sort of substance addiction , i . e . nicotine , caffeine , drugs , alcohol , etc etc .","295312":"there s smog in new york city , but it doesn t reach where i live .","295313":"no , there s too much light pollution .","295314":". . . wut . cigarettes are percent terrible for you , lol . it also has nothing to do with revenge , toxic behavior , or mental health .","295315":"it has nothing to do with karma . investing your energy into something toxic is unhealthy for your mental health .","295316":"i don t even know what this means .","295317":"it could be , but only a doctor can make that determination . regardless of whether or not you re mentally ill , if you re having s icidal thoughts then you should seek professional help . there s always help available .","295318":"montauk , new york . montauk has always been my happy place because it s such a quaint little town , and the beach scenery is absolutely beautiful .","295319":"i was cyberbullied when i was younger as a teenager using the internet , and i don t really remember how i reacted . it obviously didn t dissuade me from using the internet , so i assume it didn t bother me very much . these days , i receive hate messages every so often , but i simply delete them . it isn t worth the energy to give them attention .","295320":"there s a part of me that says yes , because i m a vengeful person at times and i only wish that those who hurt me would receive some sort of punishment . however , there s also a part of me that says no , because it s useless to invest your energy into something so negative that will only end up hurting you in the long run .","295321":"offer to listen if someone is struggling with something in their life . listening to a person s problems goes a long way , it feels nice to be heard and understood .","295322":"my happy place","295323":"no , i don t believe in love at first sight . you cannot be in love with someone you just met , you don t know their personality or anything about them . what people experience in those instances is lust .","295324":"i highly doubt it . i feel like we re on the verge of a major pandemic or extinction within the next years , haha .","295325":"i sorta mashed together the latin words for poetry and moon to resemble a meaning of poetry of the moon , haha .","295326":"no , i don t believe i ve ever been in that situation . besides people who have been passed out from being drunk , lol .","295327":"i m from the united states . i ve never visited any other countries .","295328":"at first , i m normally down on myself because i have a difficult time accepting personal failures . i have high expectations for myself all the time . however , talking the situation out with my boyfriend or a close friend usually helps motivate me to do better . they can rationalize the situation and validate my feelings , which inspires me to move on and try again .","295329":"people are usually racist because they grew up in an environment that was racist , generally in a racist household . it becomes ingrained in them from when they re young . they never unlearned their thought process , and sometimes it gets to the point where they ve become so intolerant that they re incapable of changing .","295330":"uh , i accidentally told my coworker the size of my boyfriend s p nis , lol . we were talking about past history and i thought she told me how big her husband was , so i told her how big my boyfriend was . then she looked at me confused and was like , uh , i wasn t talking about size . . . lmao .","295331":"the thing about boxes is that you can open them up . even though they re completely boring on the outside , there might be something interesting inside . so while you re saying all of these stupid , boring things i m imagining what it would be like to cut you open and see what you ve got in there . i am not a serial killer","295332":"i would choose the power of teleportation . it would be nice to magically teleport to where i need to go instead of commuting everywhere , lol . it would take away a lot of anxiety .","295333":"i don t feel comfortable explaining the circumstances , sorry .","295334":"yeah , there s one person in my life who i hate .","295335":"yeah , that sounds pretty unhealthy to me . someone else s happiness shouldn t affect your happiness , and also just because someone gives off the impression that they re happy or fulfilled doesn t mean they actually are . people only talk or post about the good things in their life , never their struggles .","295336":"when someone has a first world problem , it s generally referring to a problem that s pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things that would only happen to a person who is privileged to be living in a first world country . like , say someone complains that their favorite brand of bottled water is out of stock at the store . people might say that s a first world problem because there are countries that don t even have clean water .","295337":"i think it depends on how long you ve been seeing them and how you go about asking the question . there s nothing wrong with being educated about different medication , and if you think a certain medication may help you , then it s a good idea to ask about it . as long as you re not literally demanding for the medication , i see nothing wrong .","295338":"i won t lie , having a significant amount of money would solve a lot of my current problems .","295339":"no , i don t believe in karma . life is simply unfair people who do bad things seldom receive consequence for what they ve done , and good people are rarely rewarded or recognized for their good deeds .","295340":"i can appreciate both forms of literature , so i don t really have a preference . i like reading the classics because it s interesting to me to see where contemporary works originated from and how the classics set the stage for other forms of writing . there s also something uniquely different and mystical about classic novels , i can t quite put my finger on it . however , i also like modern literature too because there s simply so much creative freedom out there now .","295341":"yes , i have a bad habit of never finishing any of my creative projects , whether they re paintings or pieces of prose . i also have a lot of video games that i never finished playing , haha .","295342":"relationships whether platonic or romantic shouldn t be one sided . don t put effort into a relationship if the other person does not reciprocate that same level of effort . people often get taken advantage of in relationships because they re either too nice or too shy and are too forgiving when it comes to the levels of dedication on each side . don t settle for anything less than you deserve . if you re being shorted in a relationship , either try to fix it with the other person through open communication or end the relationship . do what serves you first and foremost , there s nothing wrong with putting yourself first at times .","295343":"i usually choose a nord or bosmer for race . as for guilds , i always loved the storylines of the thieves guild and the dark brotherhood .","295344":"yes , you re correct . when the word late is used before an individual s name or something similar , it means that they re no longer living .","295345":"i honestly have no clue . i ve never left the united states before . i would assume outlet adapters would be hella important , though .","295346":"oh gosh , i m so sorry i m only getting to this now . i m sorry you and your best friend are going through this , i can t imagine the kind of pain you re in right now . to be honest . . . i wouldn t know what to do in that situation either . i cannot fathom my best friend or my boyfriend passing away , i would absolutely lose it . can you confide in another friend or family member ? perhaps even a therapist ? again , i m so sorry . i m here for you if you need to talk . stay strong , friend .","295347":"lol , wut . i ve never come across that before .","295348":"i most value honesty and a sense of humor in my friends . i don t think i can be friends with someone who doesn t have a good sense of humor or who can t make me laugh , and i definitely cannot be friends with someone whom i cannot trust .","295349":"i don t really see being rich as a financial thing , because you can be wealthy and still be deeply unhappy with your life . a person is rich when they re happy or content with their life , they surround themselves with positivity and loved ones , they immerse themselves in hobbies and events that make them happy , and they contribute to others .","295350":"seeing my boyfriend laugh or smile , listening to music that moves me , getting positive feedback and reinforcement regarding my personal life or work , having campfires in the backyard with friends , and immersing myself in nature .","295351":"i would rather have , that s clean and guilt free . at least i won t have to worry about the money being traced back to a nefarious origin and getting in trouble .","295352":"i would rather lose my money and valuables . you can always make more money as time goes on and acquire new valuables , and generally speaking i don t own many things that are sentimental to me like that . however , i do value photographs a lot . i have a really bad memory , and photos are one of the few ways i m reminded of all of the good moments of my life . i have a dozen photo albums of various trips i went on with my boyfriend and i m constantly taking photos whenever i go out with friends , whether it s pictures of us or of the food and drinks or scenery .","295353":"i m the shortest person in my entire family , lol . i m only five feet tall .","295354":"i ve re discovered my love and passion for music within the past few months , so i basically listen to music non stop throughout the day . it ranges from alternative rock to contemporary pop to heavy metal to video game television instrumentals to lo fi hip hop .","295355":"no , that s my natural hair . my hair is past my shoulders .","295356":"i generally don t shop at walmart because the closest one to me is like minutes away , and it s easier to go to the supermarket or target or the drug store .","295357":"i decided upon the strawberry blonde with light blonde streaks . my stylist says she might be able to do it depending on how much of the blue she can take out , but i trust in her abilities .","295358":"that isn t reality , though . accept me for who i am or don t bother posting this nonsense . it s unbecoming , a bit creepy , and very unhealthy .","295359":"say goodbye to the blue hair ! !","295360":"i don t care about looking hot . i have no one that i wish to impress , and what you just described does not sound appealing to me at all . i m growing my hair out , i rarely wear makeup , i don t have my ears pierced , and i don t wear tight clothing . having an unrealistic vision of another person is really unhealthy . you need to look at the reality of who i am instead of basing your opinion of me off of a fantasy .","295361":"story of my life , lol . nah , but yeah sometimes i do cry for absolutely no reason , or if there is a reason then it overall makes zero sense and i m overreacting .","295362":"i understand how you feel your emotions are completely justified . death is difficult to process and overcome , especially in the context of a loved one or significant other . however , just because he passed away doesn t mean you cannot date other people . you may find that you ll be ready in due time . he probably wouldn t want you to dwell on the past or prevent yourself from being happy . if anything , he would likely want you to be the happiest version of yourself you can be and find someone who brings that out in you . you deserve to be happy and loved .","295363":"no , i already think i m too much to handle as it is . everything about me is exaggerated or grandiose , ranging from my behavior to my emotions and everything in between . if anything , i would like to be less .","295364":"i don t care about clothing style . i wear what s comfortable .","295365":"no , i have no interest in local politics .","295366":"i don t generally eat bananas unless i put them in cereal or yogurt .","295367":"i think bunnies are absolutely adorable . there are a few bunnies in my neighborhood who roam freely and they love nibbling on the grass in my backyard .","295368":"i love smoothies . there s actually a smoothie shop on my home from work and i ve always meant to stop there after work , but i haven t gotten around to it yet .","295369":"contemporary top pop music , lmao . i love ariana grande especially , as well as billie eilish . i also have a horrible obsession with old town road .","295370":"leigh is a unisex name that means delicate or meadow .","295371":"i try really hard not to be a jealous person , but sometimes it comes out of me without me realizing it . it s something i m continuously trying to work on . jealousy is a toxic emotion , and it hurts you first and foremost .","295372":"no , i don t dress punk and i never dressed punk in the past . when i was a teenager , i went from being goth to being scene emo , haha .","295373":"thank you , i appreciate it .","295374":"he cheated on me once earlier in our relationship , but that was it . he s never betrayed me other than that and he doesn t continuously make mistakes .","295375":"i would wish for it to be saturday tomorrow ! so that i can get my hair done .","295376":"i prefer solitude . i m not a people person by any means and i m fairly introspected by nature .","295377":"not very many , i got rid of a lot of shoes because i simply didn t wear them . these days , i only wear maybe the same three pairs of boots sandals , haha .","295378":"i am worried about something , but it s too personal to talk about on askfm . i honestly hope it blows over , though , i really don t know what to do in this situation so i m at such a loss .","295379":"no , i ve never been in that situation before .","295380":"lavender , patchouli , gasoline , fresh rainfall , campfire , roses , and dragon s blood incense .","295381":"lol , i guess i did accidentally set it up that way , whoops . thank you , though","295382":"if i have to make a difficult decision , i normally talk it through with my boyfriend so that i can get a different perspective on the situation before diving in and making a decision right away . he s always been good at presenting different points of view and getting me to see things from different angles .","295383":"i m honestly not sure . i ve always been self motivated because i felt as if i had no other option but to succeed . i m terrified of failing at aspects of my life , so that in itself has been my motivation to step up and move forward .","295384":"no , i honestly haven t paid attention to what new movies are coming out in over a year or so .","295385":"here , have my profile pic","295386":"out of those options , i prefer to travel by train . it s something i ve done since i was a child , so i m very used to traveling via train and it s actually relaxing to me .","295387":"uh , probably gas station wine . i didn t realize it wasn t actually wine until after i returned home and inspected the bottle more thoroughly . it s actually advertised as a wine product , which is deeply concerning and disgusting . it also tasted horrible .","295388":"not generally , no . the only opinions that are worthwhile to me are those of my boyfriend and close friends .","295389":"i would have lunch with chester bennington . he was a resounding influence on my life when i was a teenager , and i ve always wanted to thank him for inspiring me , for motivating me , and for allowing me an outlet when i was going through really dark , difficult times . i ll forever be in his debt .","295390":"i always shower before i go to bed at night . i value my time sleeping it s difficult for me to wake up in the morning as it is . i can t fathom waking up any earlier than absolutely necessary , lol .","295391":"it makes me uncomfortable when i m in a situation where i m alone with someone and have no idea how to pass the time without making things awkward between us . i m absolutely terrible at small talk , and i generally don t enjoy talking to new people to begin with , so when i m in a position where i m alone with my friend s friend as an example , it makes me hella uncomfortable .","295392":"to entertain myself , i usually listen to music , watch youtube videos , scroll through social media , read , write , play video games , or see if a friend is available to hang out .","295393":"you asked me this hours ago , which would have made it pm . at that point , my day was going fine . i was on my lunch break at work at that point . the rest of my day since that point went well , too . i feel fairly accomplished and i m just relaxing , listening to music , and catching up on my questions . i spent an hour watching my friend s stream on twitch before , which was hella fun .","295394":"i like everyone i follow , but these people usually have intriguing and thought out answers sweetnothings urlsareshittbh kittiemeowsie jonesymo misphire","295395":"yeah , that s one of the new ones i ve heard from her that i enjoy . i also liked nightmare when i first listened to it .","295396":"it would depend on the reason why he doesn t have money . if he doesn t have enough money because of unfortunate life circumstances , but he still puts the effort in to work extremely hard and take overtime to pay for his bills and generally be responsible , then i wouldn t hold it against him at all . however , if someone doesn t have money because they re irresponsible and spend it on useless things , then i have no desire to be associated with a person like that .","295397":"well , neither option sounds remarkably appealing . however , if i had no other choice , i would choose to be a vampire . at least i wouldn t have to worry about turning into a creature against my own free will .","295398":"i remember watching dragonball z and thundercats a lot when i was a child .","295399":"i don t advertise my paypal on the internet .","295400":"i can only handle medium spicy things , haha . anything more than that is too much for me .","295401":"i know she used to be problematic kissing an underage fan or something ? but i haven t heard anything since then . i do like her new songs , though .","295402":"i haven t been to the library since high school , lol .","295403":"ah , i see . i m sorry , that s a difficult situation to be in . i hope everything gets resolved ! !","295404":"i was getting paid minimum wage when i first started working retail when i was years old .","295405":"i ll definitely look it up on youtube . thank you ! !","295406":"stability , mostly emotional stability because i ve been a wreck lately .","295407":"yes , definitely ! ! i haven t been up to playing lately but i still watch walkthroughs and let s plays on youtube , lol .","295408":"uh . . . is this supposed to be a sex reference ? ? lmao .","295409":"no , i ve never needed to use a fake id before . i never owned one either .","295410":"i started driving when i was years old .","295411":"i haven t sat down to play video games in a long time . however , i enjoy some first person shooters and open world rpgs . my favorite games are skyrim , fallout , destiny , halo reach , assassin s creed syndicate , the bioshock series , life is strange , the wolf among us , layers of fear , minecraft , and gta v .","295412":"i don t pay attention to other couples when i m out in public .","295413":"colors aren t inherently gendered , so one color isn t more feminine or masculine over the other . if you like one color , then you re allowed the freedom to purchase a phone in that color .","295414":"they don t have to match , but they have to at least complement each other . for example , i won t mix patterns but i will wear colors that complement each other .","295415":"sometimes i do , while other times i just ignore them .","295416":"no , i don t believe in karma . people who do terrible things don t always have something coming for them , and often people who do good things don t get the happiness or recognition they deserve . life is unfair that way .","295417":"the only things i do are shower , brush my teeth , brush my hair , and put on fresh clothing . so overall , it probably takes me around minutes .","295418":"i can t really make this sort of call because i don t known you or your friend . but personally speaking , it feels good when someone checks in on me , even if i don t have the energy to respond . your friend might appreciate your messages even though he doesn t say anything . he might also think you don t care anymore if you stop responding . you might want to ask him if you re annoying him with your messages , just so that there s communication there . if he says that he s ignoring you purposely or doesn t want you to message him anymore , then so be it .","295419":"they all had side effects when i first started using them , ranging from nausea to lightheadedness to insomnia to fatigue and weight gain . but i ve been on them for almost two years , so i don t experience side effects anymore .","295420":"i m not sure . i guess i m difficult to shop for because i never ask for anything and i never hint towards anything either . i would also much rather have experiences than physical gifts .","295421":"i don t give out my facebook name on askfm .","295422":"uh , i literally have blue hair . lmao .","295423":"i m not an inherently happy person , no . i struggle with depression .","295424":"if i m making hot coffee , then i use two stevia . if i m drinking iced coffee , then three pumps of sugar free vanilla syrup works for me .","295425":"i think my first kiss happened when i was like years old .","295426":"yeah , i definitely still have a baby face , haha . people always think i m much younger than i actually am .","295427":"one of my close friends .","295428":"i don t watch sports , so i don t have any thoughts .","295429":"it was a urine sample .","295430":"i ve never been to comic con , but i ve always wanted to go . i just never know when tickets come out , and by the time i do know , they re already sold out .","295431":"yes , i had to take a drug test when i was promoted to a supervisory position when i worked in retail . i passed otherwise i wouldn t have gotten the job , haha .","295432":"i m rarely flirted with in real life to my knowledge , lmao . i occasionally get flirted with on the internet , but they re mostly just gross s xual messages .","295433":"aw , thank you so much ! ! i like it because it emphasizes my tan , lmao .","295434":"lol , thank you . this is sweet .","295435":"i took out the labret because i simply wasn t feeling it anymore . i had it for three years between the ages of and . as for my nose , it fell out while i was asleep one night and closed up . i just never went back and got it redone .","295436":"caffeine . which is unfortunate , but it could be worse .","295437":"i ve had my labret and nose pierced in the past . i would likely get my nose redone again .","295438":"currently , snapchat or instagram .","295439":"yes , my commute is about minutes via car each way .","295440":"i m always honest , so i don t need an hour for that . if this is an excuse to get me to answer s xual questions , then you re clearly on the wrong page .","295441":"i m years old , as my bio indicates .","295442":"my boyfriend . he s one of the perhaps two people i feel comfortable going to if i m having a crisis . he s always known how to calm me down and rationalize everything and give me hope for the future .","295443":"my healthy coping mechanisms include venting to a friend , sleeping , talking to my therapist , and escaping through books or video games . my unhealthy coping mechanisms include getting drunk and or high .","295444":"no , i don t generally find pleasure in eating . if i could survive without eating , then i wouldn t eat .","295445":"would recommend .","295446":"i don t have any injuries at the moment , unless you include sunburn . lmao .","295447":"i would likely take a day trip out to montauk with my boyfriend and spend the day walking around town , eating at cute restaurants , drinking at the montauk brewery , and laying on the beach while listening to music .","295448":"i only know my grandparents on my father s side , so i unfortunately can t go any further back than that .","295449":"i m quite obviously three kids stacked on top of each other under a trench coat .","295450":"no , i don t believe in the devil .","295451":"my day was fine nothing terrific but also nothing terrible happened . it was just an average day at the office . however , i ve been in a good mood since leaving work because i m living vicariously through my boyfriend s happiness rn , i also picked up an iced coffee on the way home .","295452":"i enjoy spending my money on coffee , alcohol , and clothing . however , most of my money inevitably goes toward bills .","295453":"at the moment , i have , followers .","295454":"probably not . most extreme things like that i . e . , skydiving , parasailing , base jumping , etc etc frighten me because you never know what might happen . the only thing i would be tempted to do is ziplining .","295455":"my boyfriend and i normally spoon for around minutes , then we get hot and retreat to our own separate sides of the bed . lmao .","295456":"definitely not , lmao . i wake up , get dressed , drive to work for minutes , work for . hours , drive home for another minutes , eat dinner , shower , and watch television . my life is super boring .","295457":"my boyfriend called me all happy excited because he purchased a new car . this has been his dream car for many years now and he found one at an affordable price , and he worked overtime for like six months in order to put down a deposit on it . he finally went out and got it today , and he s over the moon with joy . i m so happy for him .","295458":"overall , i was pleased with the final season , even though it did have its downturns and questionable moments . the cinematics were beautiful in most of the episodes , but some character arcs took a turn for the worst and it felt as if some aspects of characters developments and plots were meaningless . the last episode was intense , and honestly the more i think about it , the more predictable it was . initially , i was a bit shocked but after speaking to a few people about the dynamics of some particular characters and their respective personalities , it made more and more sense . overall , everyone who survived ended up getting the ending they wanted or deserved .","295459":"considering i m turning and you re only years old , then yeah that isn t much . most of the people i interact with on a daily basis are older than you .","295460":"you re not much older than me .","295461":"your age is meaningless to me . if you think that you re a person who should be avoided , then yeah , you should avoid me . haha .","295462":"i never had a weekend job , lol . when i first started working , i was attending college so i worked on whichever days i didn t have class , which included both weekends and weekdays . i worked upwards of hours per week alongside having a full course load .","295463":"i guess i was thinking more along the lines of him hanging out with , for example , his best friend and showing him . it didn t occur to me until this message that you might have meant him sending those photos to random friends of his as well , which is obviously a more dire situation . either way , idk . compared to things i ve experienced with both my boyfriend and my friends relationships , sharing photos just doesn t really seem to be that high up on the list .","295464":"i prefer coffee out of those options . i drink at least two cups per day .","295465":"i d rather not collect anything because i m not the type of person to hoarde anything except mugs , lol . i wouldn t want excess clutter .","295466":"i don t really watch youtubers except for achievement hunter , markiplier , and chilledchaos . and i like them all .","295467":"according to the interwebz , it was made in .","295468":"the princess bride .","295469":"no , i don t have any toys anymore . i don t really know when they were thrown away or hopefully donated , but i don t recall seeing them since i was a teenager .","295470":"a trust fund basically refers to any legal agreement that holds assets on behalf of another individual , and is managed by a trustee . it protects the assets , so to speak . i think what the previous anon was referring to was a family trust fund , where a family opens a trust fund to benefit the entire family and protect their assets for the future generations . it usually refers to finances or real estate property .","295471":"if i am , my parents neglected to tell me about it . lmao .","295472":"in my opinion , yeah . they re not an adult , so i always call them children . lmao .","295473":"no , i don t believe there are any places like that around where i live .","295474":"thank you . they shift from hazel to green depending on the day , sometimes it s more pronounced than others .","295475":"yes , that s entirely due to toxic masculinity . men are supposed to exhibit masculine traits , which over the years has conditioned men into thinking that they have to be these stoic , stone cold figures with no emotions whatsoever . it s extremely damaging to men , and its one of the reasons why there s such an alarming rate of men who have mental health problems not getting professional help . it s still seen as weak in society .","295476":"yeah , i ve been sitting in the backyard in the sunshine and reading every saturday , haha . i m significantly tanner than what i was two months ago .","295477":"i started coloring my hair when i was , actually . so i understand why the anon wants to do it , and it s completely safe as long as you do it with a professional and have adequate aftercare . i don t remember when i first bleached my hair , but i was probably around the age of or .","295478":"take more time out of his schedule for himself . he works way too much , to the point where he exhausts himself beyond belief and burns himself out . it would be beneficial to him if he tried taking more time off from work , not for any particular reason but just for him to cool down and relax .","295479":"no , i wouldn t . not because social media is overly meaningful to me or anything , but because a healthy relationship wouldn t force you to have to choose between them and something else in your life like that . that s extremely controlling behavior .","295480":"i ve picked grapes from the vine , but that s basically it .","295481":"you can t convince your mother if she s already saying no . however , you could work something out with her if she s open to it for example , you can do some extra chores around the house in exchange for getting your hair colored .","295482":"i don t remember , honestly . it s been years since i read the book or saw the movie .","295483":"yes , it s actually one of my favorite movies as well as one of my favorite books .","295484":"tortellini alfredo or penne a la vodka .","295485":"i ve been running around like a chicken with its head cut off , so i haven t even gone to the consultation yet . i can t make an appointment until i consult with the tattoo artist , so i m assuming if i try to get there either this week or next week , i can maybe schedule a late july or august appointment .","295486":"definitely not , lmao . i have social anxiety and that s essentially my worst nightmare .","295487":"depends on the nature of your friendship , if you re close enough to him that he ll actually listen to you without getting defensive . if you two are close , i would suggest bringing it up in conversation and see where it goes .","295488":"i honestly don t really have a full understanding of what otherkin is , tbh .","295489":"you shouldn t stop your medication by yourself , no . that s dangerous . please talk to your doctor about these feelings and you two will come to a conclusion as to what to do , whether to try a new medication or do something else with the dosage .","295490":"idk , it depends on the individual . some people like having a label on their gender while others don t particularly care .","295491":"i would marry my boyfriend , haha . i don t have any wild dreams of marrying a celebrity or anything ridiculous like that .","295492":"i try to do breathing exercises so that my heart rate slows down and the chest pains disappear easier said than done , lol . it doesn t always work , though .","295493":"i don t remember tbh . i usually stay away from crowds of people so that i don t have to worry about people talking to me .","295494":"there s really no such thing as a number of genders , in my opinion . just like there isn t a number of sexual orientations both gender and sexuality exist somewhat in a spectrum , and we ve just developed labels for things as they come . i think students should overall have an overview of what gender identity is , what s the difference between cisgender and transgender , and how gender identity does and does not correlate with gender roles or expectations .","295495":"sexual identity ? ? like , you mean their sexual orientation ? ? you re not any less or different of a person if you re gay , and if you re having a hard time coming to terms with your sexuality , then try to talk to trusted friends or family members about yourself and gain their support , if possible . everything is better with a support system , and there s absolutely nothing wrong with being gay . there s so much more acceptance now than there was in the past , and hopefully we can continue down this road until there s universal understanding of sexual orientation .","295496":"yes , i absolutely believe that gender should be taught in primary and secondary schools . the only way to ensure inclusion and acceptance for our generation and future generations is to teach these things to children early on .","295497":"a lot of people are quick to reject notions that don t fit into their established square of beliefs and understandings . they weren t taught about trans people as children , for example , so therefore trans people s existences aren t valid or are seen as a phase . many people don t like their beliefs challenged because it makes them question themselves .","295498":"lol . nah , if anything it s my lamictal tablet because that medication has helped me most of all .","295499":"it s existed for centuries in many other cultures . it s just been rejected by mainstream society due to a lack of education i m talking about in the united states , i m not sure about other countries . there have always been trans and non binary people , but their existence has been oppressed and not accepted much like how gay people have been oppressed and not accepted over the decades and centuries .","295500":"those damn cops ain t getting our donuts , man . they can find their own donuts .","295501":"male and female are sexes , not genders . the reason why we were taught about sex and not gender is because trans people in general have always been ostracized and discriminated against in society , and its only been within the past few years that people have become more open about gender and gender education . it s the same reason why when we were growing up , we weren t taught about being lgbtq either . sex education was barely being taught as it is , and that education was only restricted to heterosexual sex . we weren t taught about sexual orientation either .","295502":"your gender doesn t change . much like sexuality , your gender is an innate part of you that you discover as you grow and get to know yourself better .","295503":"no , it doesn t annoy me . their beliefs don t affect or change my gender so it isn t something i spend time worrying about . when people ask me , i educate . what they do with that information is on them .","295504":"simply speaking , it means not of either binary . in the case of gender , the binaries are man and woman . non binary means , in its simplest terms , that you re neither a man nor a woman .","295505":"i find my boyfriend s beard attractive , yes .","295506":"my face , lol . i wouldn t want a tattoo on my face at all .","295507":"yeah , i am . it s on my driver s license .","295508":"i m a writer editor for a publishing company . i enjoy my job definitely have no complaints , it s something within my field and i m also treated with respect .","295509":"regardless of a person s gender , i would advise people struggling with mental illness to not be afraid to seek out help if they re concerned for their own well being . if they cannot afford professional treatment , there are also hotlines , text lines , and maybe even friends and or family who will be willing to sit down and listen until you can find a way to be treated by a professional . there s no shame in needing help .","295510":"what s best depends entirely on the individual , because different medication will work for different people . unfortunately , it s a trial and error sort of situation , and you won t know how something works for you until you try it for at least two weeks .","295511":"i currently take buspar in its generic form and i have a prescription for hydroxyzine for sudden anxiety symptoms .","295512":"i m diagnosed with major depressive disorder , generalized anxiety disorder , and borderline personality disorder . my diagnoses used to include panic disorder , but since starting anti anxiety medication , i rarely have panic attacks so i believe that s in remission .","295513":"no , i haven t . i definitely should have on multiple occasions , though . honestly , my mental health has been terrible this past month and i really did think about driving myself to the hospital two weeks ago , but i don t have the kind of money to pay for a hospital visit .","295514":"i don t believe i have , no . at least not while i ve been in my s . my mental health was significantly worse when i was a teenager , so i wouldn t be surprised if i experienced a psychotic episode during those days .","295515":"yes , i m on four different medications for psychiatric problems . i also attend therapy .","295516":"i sought help for my mental illnesses when i was around years old . i have been dealing with depression , anxiety , and s icidal thoughts since i was a pre teen , but my thoughts of harming myself those around me were getting progressively stronger as i got older . at one point , my depression was so severe that i didn t go to work for a week , and i needed a doctor s referral to a psychiatrist so that i didn t get fired from my job . that s ultimately when i decided to seek treatment .","295517":"i would rather please other people , although i know that i do need to place greater emphasis on ensuring my own happiness as well . i always put other people s needs before my own .","295518":"of course , i ve had my heart broken numerous times . it s pretty difficult to avoid that situation when you re my age , haha .","295519":"no , i don t believe in this phrase . people change as they grow older , and just because they cheated in the past doesn t guarantee that their mentality will never change . people are capable of un learning behavioral patterns and improving themselves .","295520":"i would perish if my body developed an intolerance to coffee . my veins are more coffee than blood , at this point . i don t have a coffee tattoo for no dang reason .","295521":"i haven t cleaned it in like two weeks , so it looks gross . i need to scrub out the bathtub and shower walls and clean the toilet and sink . it shouldn t take very long , but i ve been neglecting it because i ve been exhausted after work lately .","295522":"i m not sure . lmao . i don t consume dairy products to begin with except in rare occasions , so it wouldn t surprise me if my body developed an intolerance for dairy . i don t drink milk , i ll eat eggs but in small batches , and i mainly use soy milk or a small amount of half n half in my coffee .","295523":"nah , that only happens when i drink way too much coffee like cups , which is really rare . it also happens if i choose to have heavy cream in my coffee , which is something i ve been avoiding for a while now .","295524":"my weekend has been good , although not as productive as i would have wanted . i m going to make up for it today , though i just finished my freelance assignments , and after i eat , i m going to continue doing laundry , exercise for a little while , and clean the entire house the bathroom needs a serious scrubbing . i took yesterday as a personal day spent the entire day relaxing , reading , and even had an early afternoon beer when i was tanning outside . however , i feel like i totally wasted my day because i didn t actually get anything done .","295525":"no , i wouldn t change the time when i met my boyfriend . honestly , he is part of the reason for my recovery . he inspires me to better myself , and when we were teenagers , he supported me through my dark episodes and helped me recover from self h rm . i don t know if i would even be in a better place mentally had i not met him when i did .","295526":"i don t have side effects from drinking coffee . it obviously keeps me awake , but that s caffeine s intention in general .","295527":"yeah , i notice that a lot too . i wonder if it s due to a lack of education , although even in primary school students are taught about all of the different asian countries , not just japan , korea , and china . but a lot of people have the misconception that other types of asian people don t exist , simply because they re not fetishized as strongly as light skinned asians . any race that s dark skinned is stigmatized severely in our society .","295528":"i don t discuss my sex life on the internet .","295529":"on the weekends , i have three cups in the morning . on the weekdays , i have one cup in the morning and sometimes one cup in the afternoon .","295530":"ugh , that s horrible . i m sorry you have to go through that . as for why people of your race are fetishized objectified , i m honestly not too sure . i just think it s ridiculous how in a s xual context , asians are wanted , but in literally any other context , they re discriminated against .","295531":"no , you re definitely right . even if you look at the p rn s x industry , there s a high demand for asian clients and videos of asian actresses .","295532":"people like that have to really look inside themselves and figure out why they even have that prejudice against other races to begin with . realistically , someone s race does not define them and humans are much more complex than their race . so for a white person to say that their type is solely other white people comes from a racist history , likely because they were raised in an intolerant household and society .","295533":"i don t know the criteria behind it , but you re essentially right . most doctors don t take all insurances , they only accept certain insurance companies probably because they have longstanding business with some companies and not others . it s capitalism at its finest . therefore , even if you really want to see a certain doctor because they re knowledgeable and compassionate , it won t matter because if they don t take your insurance , you ll have to pay out of pocket for those visits , which is something not many people can actually afford .","295534":"that seems a little racist to me , yeah . you re essentially rejecting the idea of being assimilated into another culture before you re even given the opportunity to do so , and there s also nothing wrong with dating someone with a different culture from you . it s actually a wonderful learning experience . if it isn t racism , then it s definitely intolerant and close minded . you re essentially judging someone based on their race without getting to know them first , especially when you consider that not everyone is in tune with their heritage to begin with .","295535":"i can imagine it s the same in new york if you re not covered with insurance . thankfully , i just pay my co pay at each appointment so i m thankful that i found a facility that takes my insurance and doesn t have an extremely long wait list . although , i m changing psychiatrists and i have the number for a new doctor , i just haven t called her yet to see if she takes my insurance and how long of a wait it will be to get an appointment with her .","295536":"it depends on a lot of factors , such as what your insurance company decides to cover , what the psychiatrist psychologist charges for their services , whether or not the provider even takes your insurance in the first place , etc etc . for some people , it can be expensive . but for others , it may be the same amount of money compared to seeing a general practitioner . i can t even fathom how much money a psychiatrist or psychologist would be without insurance , honestly . i ve always been covered except for three months last year where i wasn t , but i didn t see my doctors during those three months . medication alone is expensive , so seeing the provider would likely be much more money .","295537":"mg brexpiprazole mg buspirone mg fluoxetine mg lamotrigine","295538":"i ve been reading the first book in george r . r . martin s a song of ice and fire series game of thrones , and it s really fascinating and intense thus far . i don t know if it would be classified as a summer reading novel , but it s certainly good .","295539":". . . what ? ? your metaphor makes no sense and isn t relevant to this question .","295540":"yes , it s unfortunately possible to still have bad days . i experience bad days every so often , but definitely not as often as they used to be when i was unmedicated . however , they don t exist with the same severity as what you re describing . you should talk to your doctor about it , honestly . you could need an adjustment in dosage , probably something a bit higher or an adjunct medication to enhance the effects of the antidepressant that s what i m on .","295541":"i plan on finishing my freelance work i slacked off yesterday , i spent the afternoon reading tanning outside instead of working . i also plan on cleaning the living room and kitchen , doing laundry , vacuuming , scrubbing the bathtub , etc etc .","295542":"i do enjoy hearing other people s laughter at times , especially in settings where i m with a friend and we re discussing something amusing they start laughing hysterically . i have one coworker whose laugh is very funny and contagious , and every time she goes off , the rest of us can t help but laugh too .","295543":"no , i keep forgetting to bring it up . this only happened last week , lmao . i do plan on telling him though , the situation was just hilarious .","295544":"asia isn t really a place i gave much thought into visiting , but i would probably enjoy visiting russia , japan , and thailand .","295545":"definitely not . coffee is my life fuel and sometimes the inspiration behind why i wake up get out of bed in the morning .","295546":"i m not sure if this was the funniest , but it certainly was amusing and a bit embarrassing . my coworker and i were talking about our s xual past and whatnot , and somehow the topic of p nises came up as well . something got lost in translation along the way , and my coworker said yeah , my husband is number four . obviously she was referring to the fact that he was her fourth significant other , but somehow i thought she was talking about p nis size . so i replied , yeah , my boyfriend is a hefty include inches here . so , she paused . and then she was like , uh , i was talking about how many partners i had . please don t tell my husband you thought he was four inches . lol . i was so embarrassed , but also hysterically laughing because i accidentally told her how big my boyfriend was , and i still regret it to this day . she laughed it off and whatnot , but i m still mortified .","295547":"uh , honestly bojack . lol . the web of self loathing , substance ab se , and obvious issues with self confidence are things i can all relate to . i really feel for his character , even though i also believe he s a bit self entitled despite his confidence issues , strangely enough and a bit of an attention seeker .","295548":"lol . yes , i ve only been watching it for a few days now . i didn t realize how many seasons there were .","295549":"i believe i ve had this particular account for two years .","295550":"i think i m on the ninth or tenth episode in season one ! ! the episode i watched last night , diane just leaked chapters of her book onto buzzfeed and bojack fired her .","295551":"i do feel awkward and somewhat uncomfortable , but honestly it s something i m just used to at this point . i don t want to be discriminated against or questioned if i were to bring it up in conversation and that s the last thing i need in a work related setting .","295552":"yes , i would stop being friends with someone if they were homophobic or transphobic . i don t have room for intolerance in my life .","295553":"yes , i m not open about my gender in most of my irl relationships . it isn t necessary for most people to know , in my opinion . it doesn t reflect or change my work ethic so whether or not they know my gender makes no real difference to me .","295554":"i m open with my sexual orientation , yes . that doesn t mean that everyone in my life knows about it though , lol . i don t advertise my sexuality in conversation or anything , and i highly doubt my bosses know because they don t follow me on social media .","295555":"bob s burgers and bojack horseman i recently started watching bojack became obsessed .","295556":"they shift between green and hazel , depending on the day .","295557":"what s the point in dying if you re just going to come back to life ? ? that seems utterly pointless .","295558":"having a spirit animal is a native american belief , it s part of their cultural tradition . i m not native american therefore , i don t have a spirit animal .","295559":"i m sorry you re experiencing this . i understand how it feels to be jealous of your friends , and it is a totally toxic emotion , not only for others but for yourself as well . unfortunately , jealousy isn t something you can just snap your fingers at and it will go away . you have to be mindful of your emotions as they re happening and try to adjust your state of mind accordingly . keep in mind that emotions like jealousy are going to hurt you more than anyone else , and it doesn t serve you to remain jealous .","295560":"yes , i do . my mental illnesses are pretty much chronic at this point , although they re a lot more subtle now that i ve been on medication and attending therapy for over two years . however , i ve struggled with depression and anxiety since i was a pre teen .","295561":"aw , thank you ! ! and no , you re absolutely fine . i appreciate the sentiment .","295562":"well , i would much rather have a large iced coffee than a small iced coffee .","295563":"no ,

to the point where i can t take care of myself anymore .","295567":"the only fruit i eat are apples , pears , and peaches . most of the other fruit i eat are berries especially raspberries .","295568":"i m actually quite the emotional person , haha . i m an anxious , neurotic , emotional mess most of the time . my writing style isn t a reflection of who i am i ve just learned how to express myself well .","295569":"skyrim fallout fallout assassin s creed syndicate bioshock halo reach the wolf among us outlast destiny minecraft","295570":"my boyfriend doesn t ask me to do things

gamer , but i do play video games on occasion . i used to play every day , but i haven t been in the mood to play in a while now .","295572":"my perspectives are for women s rights and align with intersectional feminism , but i don t label myself as a feminist because people generally don t take me seriously when i used to describe myself as one . new wave feminism and white feminism has turned everyone s opinions against what feminism actually is .","295573":"i m not hostile toward feminism .","295574":"most of my questions pertain to serious topics , or topics that don t require a witty or humorous response .","295575":"well , yeah . if it wasn t then i wouldn t be in a relationship .","295576":"i don t have a spirit animal because i m not native american .","295577":"simple is

wouldn t be good to be a funny human being all the time . there s a time and a place for everything .","295586":"cont . . . thus became angry with him . i was sure not to lash out but took it upon myself to completely ignore him for a whole two days and emotionally detach myself from him . i know it s terrible , but it s either that or i ll drive myself crazy with worry . yeah , i m totally the same way and i used to be worse when i was unmedicated . calling him x in a row if he wouldn t answer , texting him nonstop , asking him if he was mad at me , etc etc . i wouldn t lash out but i ve definitely internalized things instead and totally pushed everyone away to see if they care enough to contact me first .","295587":"lol . come on tom , it s just a number .","295588":"my favorite

mother . i still absolutely love that show even though it s been over for years .","295590":"it isn t that important to me , so yes . however , i do value having opinions about politics and having someone with whom i can share those opinions , so the person i date definitely has to have an opinion about current events and controversial topics .","295591":"i guess the closest thing would be

. i just don t want to give my friends a reason to not be friends with me anymore , and i also experience the whole questioning of whether or not i m clingy because i feel like i put more effort into my friendships than they do . idk .","295595":"this is a difficult situation to be in , and i totally empathize with you because i ve been in the same boat many times before . i m a clingy person myself and i take things really personally if i check up on someone , but they don t make the effort to check up on me . i think it depends on the person , though . she may not feel the need to check up on you , knowing that you re fine and that you two do talk occasionally . that may be her method of checking up on you . but if it still does concern you , perhaps for your own peace of mind you should try talking to her about it in a respectful manner .","295596":"i need to hear from him every day , otherwise i assume he s angry with me . even though he realistically isn t and has no reason to be , i m terrified of him getting angry with me and abandoning me justbpdthings . we usually text once or twice per day , but we prefer talking on the phone since neither of us are good at replying to text messages , lol .","295597":"i m listening to it now ! ! i didn t realize he put a new song out . i like it , it s different from his older music but it s still good . https www . youtube . com

you have a partner temporarily . if my boyfriend told that to me , then i would still consider it to be cheating . being drunk is not an excuse .","295599":"i actually agree with you , although i never liked taylor swift s music , lol . unpopular opinion mainstream pop music isn t automatically bad music . over the past year or so , i realized i liked a lot of top pop songs and now i ve totally embraced it . there s nothing wrong with liking certain types of music .","295600":"if he cheated on me now then i probably wouldn t take him back , considering how long we ve been together and the nature of our relationship . i don t really remember how long it took for me to trust him again , but i m thankful that he was understanding that i didn t trust him for a while since he knew what he did was wrong . to show me that he was worth trusting again , he became very open about his feelings and showed me respect with my own feelings and concerns about him cheating again . he didn t get angry or defensive at all .","295601":"no . there are different forms of intelligence , and remaining abreast of current events or reading books doesn t really define someone s intelligence at all . it s only one facet of what intelligence is .","295602":"honestly , at the time it was the least of our problems . without going into much detail about what we were going through , we were both struggling with serious things and so the idea of he sleeping with someone else was a bit meaningless compared to the grand scheme of things . and no , i m not angry about it . it happened like years ago .","295603":"sweet but psycho by ava max , haha . i don t really agree with the use of the term psycho in the song and i think it gives a wrong impression of women in relationships , but it s such a catchy song . https www . youtube . com watch ? v kbfd aozy","295604":"yes , he cheated on me once early on in our relationship . it was during a really difficult and confusing time in our lives , and he swore to change . i was hesitant to take him back at first , but i m glad that we got through that dilemma because our relationship has strengthened since then .","295605":"i have many favorite

a hidden entrance to the lake that s in some side street and took photos .","295607":"the most dangerous thing i ve ever done was drive while drunk . it was absolutely horrible and reckless , and since that happened , i haven t driven myself to the bar at all . if i go out , i normally ask a friend to pick me up or get an uber .","295608":"the only opinions i care about are those of my boyfriend and close friends . when you get older , you realize that the opinions of acquaintances and strangers are utterly meaningless to your life because they simply don t know you , and you shouldn t focus your energy on people who do not matter to your life .","295609":"that s a common misconception among the lgbtq community , unfortunately . i believe that being gay is an inherent part of someone , and no one turns gay or anything . it s just them going through life , having new experiences , and realizing their true nature . him dating girls was an experimental phase and probably the catalyst for him realizing he didn t like women . sometimes people need to experiment with their sexuality before coming to terms with whether they re gay , bi , or straight .","295610":"i don t remember the last actual gift i gave someone besides buying my mother flowers for mother s day , if that counts for anything . the last gift i received was an egg sandwich last week , lol . me and my coworker were both going through difficult times one night for different reasons , so another coworker surprised us with egg sandwiches the following morning . it was a really nice gesture .","295611":"i used to be a night owl , but i ve slowly transitioned into becoming a morning person due to my work schedule and routine . i cannot sleep in past am these days , and honestly i do enjoy my quiet mornings because i m able to relax without having to interact with anyone for a few hours .","295612":"no , it isn t offensive at all . it s really common and expected for people to question their sexuality . it also isn t anyone else s business what you identify as , because that s something personal to you and only affects you really .","295613":"the only times i talk about controversial or difficult topics with strangers or acquaintances is online , usually on here , twitter , or facebook . i don t really interact with strangers otherwise .","295614":"i would change the ab se i went through , so that i wasn t ab sed at all . it was the cause of nearly all of my mental illnesses and still affects me today .","295615":"yeah , although i think you need to be close with that person first so that they won t get offended if you mention it , lol .","295616":"yes , that s actually fairly common ! ! it s normal for people to question their sexual orientation and then come to an understanding of themselves . i used to think i was gay when i was in high school because all i liked were women , until i met my boyfriend and realized i found him attractive too .","295617":"i ve actually never broken a bone before .","295618":"i realized i liked more than two genders , but not all genders or regardless of gender . bisexual just fits me more and its what i used to identify with in the past .","295619":"it was just the keyboard , not the tower . unless you mean my laptop , in that case it wasn t soaked or anything . it just got on the keys .","295620":"one of my coworkers , lol . i honestly thought she was a b tch when i first met her because she s one of those loud , opinionated people . however , after i got to know her , i realized she was extremely passionate about her beliefs and is very empathetic towards other people and animals . we ve become quite close over the past year .","295621":"the trades , i . e . auto repair , hvac , construction , etc etc . that s why it s usually more productive to go to a trade school as opposed to a traditional college , because there will always be a demand for those services .","295622":"it is already illegal in some states , but legal in other states . apparently , first cousin marriages are legal in new york which i previously didn t know about . even so , the prevalence of such an event occurring is rare . i don t support the concept , though . it s basically inc st and can complicate genetics and cause unnecessary health problems if they decide to have a child together .","295623":"this may sound silly , but going to bed early and waking up early in the morning , even if you don t necessarily have anything to do . i always feel much better when i get good sleep and wake up around am , because then i feel as if my day is productive and not wasted .","295624":"i don t believe that me , as an individual , can change the world . however , i do know that i can change some people s lives through my advocacy of mental health illness awareness , as well as through my writing . overall , i want people to realize that there isn t anything wrong with having mental illness , that there will always be help available to them , and that they re not alone .","295625":"yes , safe s x also includes consent between everyone involved in the interaction and making sure consent remains through to the very end . if someone , at any point in time , says no or even appears uncomfortable , then everything should stop because then that isn t consent anymore . people are allowed to retract consent at any point in time .","295626":"not usually , no . if i receive a rude or harsh message from someone , then i normally just delete it . there s no point in responding to such inquiries , especially if you know what they re trying to say isn t true .","295627":"it depends on what type of music it is ! ! i usually listen to singles when it comes to vocal music , but i listen to albums when it comes to instrumental music . lately , i ve been listening to all of the game of thrones soundtracks on spotify .","295628":"i regularly go through my things and get rid of them accordingly , especially when it comes to clothing . every season , i try to sort through my clothes and donate clothing that i either don t like anymore or doesn t fit me .","295629":"my biggest pet peeve is people talking over me while i m already speaking , or basically not allowing me to finish my sentence or thought before they interject with their own story . i find it extremely rude and disrespectful .","295630":"i would likely be enjoying a cup of coffee outside on the back patio while reading a book and soaking up the sunshine .","295631":"no , they actually irritate me ! ! i can t stand asmr white noise audio or videos , they make me feel really uncomfortable for some reason .","295632":"i was a cashier at a drug store when i was years old .","295633":"caffeine , haha . i get withdrawal headaches if i don t have caffeine in the morning .","295634":"yeah , that seems a bit bizarre to me .","295635":"the sunset last night was gorgeous","295636":"most of my writing is work related , but i also write creatively on the side personal essays and poetry . i used to have an account on wattpad , but i haven t updated it in years .","295637":"yes , i do most of my shopping

don t have any concrete plans except getting my car from the mechanic this afternoon and working .","295640":"i don t like one gender over another , lol . i simply know that i find women and men both

. tomorrow i m working and then picking my car up from the mechanic , and sunday i plan on staying home and doing household chores .","295654":"lol , no . nothing happened to my keyboard , thankfully . i cleaned it and it had no issues .","295655":"i m in a relationship .","295656":"i don t really have a favorite character . although i used to love the movie atlantis the lost empire and had a crush on both milo and kida , haha .","295657":"nah , i ve never used a wax stamp before . i have a friend who has her own business , though , and she uses wax stamps on all of her envelopes .","295658":"i think i was in kindergarten in or ? ? i really have no idea tbh . i don t remember anything prior to the age of .","295659":"i m not really a picky eater at all . i just don t eat anything with most condiments on them , like ketchup , mustard , mayonnaise , etc etc . i also don t like most salad dressings except for a hint of ranch and that s only used to dip things in , like boneless wings .","295660":"i would be quite upset and disappointed with him . i would sit down with him and ask him why he thought it was an okay thing to do without my consent , and we would take it from there . i doubt i would break up with him over something that small , though .","295661":"i ve considered it , but i think i would look terrible with a shaved head . lol . however , it might be the only way for me to get rid of this certain hairstyle , since it would probably be best to start off with each side being even .","295662":"no , they usually feel too constraining on my head and i don t like the way hats look on me . if i have to wear a hat , i ll wear a beanie during the autumn winter months .","295663":"thankfully i haven t done it at my current job , but i did spill coffee on my keyboard at my previous job as well as at home on my laptop s keys . lmao .","295664":"my day was fine it went by slowly in the morning , but as time went on , it picked up and suddenly it was time for me to leave work . my commute was terrible , but i m just happy i m home now . i had to drop my car off at the mechanic , so i m car less for the next hours .","295665":"my main reason is that i m already in a relationship .","295666":"i m already grown up , lmao . i got my degree in communications professional writing and i ve been working in my field for five years .","295667":"yeah , i sent them to my boyfriend in the past .","295668":"i ve never had a corn dog before , so i guess hot dog .","295669":"idk , i ve never tried before .","295670":"nah , i just think it s still seen as taboo when there ideally should be more understanding of sex in general . people are allowed to enjoy sex as long as everything is consensual and safe .","295671":"i don t know anything about him , so i m indifferent .","295672":"i don t watch sports .","295673":"it doesn t concern me what other people do . as long as they re both adults , then it doesn t matter .","295674":"i usually wake up around am .","295675":"i m nice to people by default until given a reason otherwise .","295676":"probably within the next years considering how terrible climate change is right now .","295677":"probably try to return it to them , if that s even possible . i wouldn t do anything malicious .","295678":"hey friends ! ! i m kinda bored tonight since my migraine finally disappeared , so does anyone have any questions ? ?","295679":"i believe it s an ignorant life . it s impossible to avoid pain , but if you actively ignore it and don t try to learn from it or overcome it , and instead drown your pain with hedonistic pleasures , it can be extremely hurtful towards yourself and the people around you .","295680":"ideally , the best way to deal with heartbreak is through talking with your friends and or family about the ordeal , using methods of self care , and encouraging yourself that you re a strong individual and you can get through it . personally , i dealt with heartbreak through unhealthy coping mechanisms and constantly skipping from one person to the next in terms of who i was infatuated with , haha .","295681":"it depends on who the person is who committed the crime , their relationship to me , and what the crime is . i can t give a definite yes or no answer to this question , unfortunately .","295682":"no , i ve never been able to lucid dream before even though i ve tried a lot in the past , haha . my boyfriend can lucid dream , though . i have experienced sleep paralysis on a few occasions , which obviously isn t the same thing but i felt it was worth mentioning . it was absolutely terrifying .","295683":"if the situation was severe and dire , such as in a hostage situation , and i had no other alternatives , then yes . if my partner s life was being threatened and the only way to save him was to k ll someone else , then i would probably do it .","295684":"i ve stolen items for much less of a reason than that , so yes .","295685":"a basic life skills course , i . e . how to do taxes , balance a budget , take out a loan from the bank , apply for a credit card , sign up for benefits or a k , open a savings account or roth ira , etc etc .","295686":"i like personalized questions most of all , particularly questions regarding my education and career , my relationships , and my mental health and illness . i also love answering questions about music and art .","295687":"no , i don t believe that people should be required to pass a drug test to collect food stamps . first , you obviously cannot spend your food stamps on drugs because it s only used for food and other goods which is pre determined , and you only get a particular amount of money per month . second , denying someone food stamps if they re a user or an addict is essentially denying a person their basic need to eat , as well as their children s needs to eat . it s doing more harm than good , and there should not be laws preventing people from consuming something necessary for their survival . third , it s somewhat classist and ableist to suggest a restriction on food stamps based on whether or not a person uses drugs . drug use is more prevalent in populations of lower class or lower financial stability , which is where food stamps are also more prevalent . in addition , these people normally don t have the resources to get treatment and recovery , which further complicates the situation . people who are users or addicts shouldn t be stigmatized and prevented from a basic need .","295688":"i support the notion of physician assisted s icide , but only in cases of severe terminal illness , where the patient has x amount of weeks to live for example and they re without a doubt going to d e from their illness .","295689":"i believe life begins when the fetus has grown enough to survive outside of its mothers womb , which normally occurs after weeks .","295690":"i enjoy having a campfire in the background with my boyfriend and or a few close friends .","295691":"yes , i do know someone like this actually . it s terrible because as much as you do want to feel bad for them and try to help them , they make it awfully difficult because they feed off of the attention sympathy . they exaggerate their symptoms to get a response from those around them as well . it s really a slap to the face to people who struggle with disabilities and don t use their disability as an excuse for bad behavior . it portrays a terrible image of disabled people , because most disabled people act the complete opposite and wish they weren t disabled , and they usually try their hardest to live life as normal as possible .","295692":"i had a tremendous crush on one of my online friends whom i used to talk to everyday . i wouldn t say that i was in love with her , but i definitely did love her with every fiber of my being and wanted to be with her terribly .","295693":"i have several favorite movies , haha . i am not a serial killer , the crow , heathers , queen of the damned , the punisher , the lord of the rings , secret window , american psycho , the shining , v for vendetta , django unchained , les miserables , and sweeney todd .","295694":"for this headache to go away , ugh . luckily it isn t a migraine anymore i actually left work early because it was so bad .","295695":"there s nothing in my pocket .","295696":"lunampoeta is my backup account in case something happens to this account . i like logging in on the weekends and clearing my inbox of questions so that there isn t a backlog of questions waiting for me .","295697":"sometimes , depending on the person i m speaking to . occasionally i ll get bad vibes about a person they turn out to be correct .","295698":"financial , emotional , and relational stability .","295699":"i would like to lose more weight before the end of . i already lost some weight although i haven t weighed myself , so i just have to keep exercising .","295700":"this sounds materialistic , but having financial stability is the first thing that comes to mind when i think of success . even though realistically success shouldn t be defined by how much money you make , i would personally consider myself successful if i gained more prominence in my job and earned more money .","295701":"this is a boring answer , but i don t really have any special talents . my talents are in the arts , i . e . writing , photography , and painting .","295702":"not very often , perhaps once every few weeks . although i do post more pictures on twitter than anything else .","295703":"traveling more often , tbh . although i never really had the opportunity to travel when i was younger , i don t think i m able to travel much now unless i had a lot of extra spending money , haha . i m going to the caribbean next march , though , so at least that s something ! !","295704":"aw , that sounds lovely ! ! i definitely want to visit , i have a few friends who live in virginia .","295705":"no , i have no desire to wake up earlier than i need to , haha . i go walking at night after work .","295706":"nah , i don t use sunscreen . only tanning oil .","295707":"this is sweet . thank you .","295708":"it s simply not realistic . people push the idea of fake news to basically reject something they don t personally agree with , and it s always used in an ignorant or close minded manner .","295709":"yeah , i m not addicted to technology . three hours for social media per day isn t very much time at all . in addition , that s assuming that i don t have anything else to do in the evenings . when i have plans , then i m not on askfm either .","295710":"i just said i find the concept of fake news to be silly . i don t believe there s any kind of percentage related to it .","295711":"not really . i m primarily on in the evenings between pm and pm . i don t use askfm when i m at work .","295712":"most forms of the media are biased to a certain degree , in that they cater to a specific audience . they tell stories from one point of view instead of focusing on the bigger picture . at the same time , however , i find the concept of fake news to be silly and ridiculous .","295713":"no , i m not addicted to technology . i can easily go without most forms of technology if given the opportunity to do so .","295714":"i think it s difficult to group americans into one category like that , especially considering most americans are a mixture of a variety of other cultures .","295715":"no , it isn t really something that concerns me . most people are mixed , anyhow .","295716":"i ve seen bits and pieces of it , but i was never interested in watching the show .","295717":"i feel much better now thank you for asking ! ! i saw my boyfriend last night , so he was able to put things into perspective for me , understand my feelings , and encourage me to continue moving forward . we all have pitfalls every now and again , and i have to learn to be more forgiving towards myself .","295718":"i always enjoy reading urlsareshittbh s answers . they re always so educational and he puts a significant amount of thought into each answer .","295719":"the thought of immortality is curious to me . it certainly doesn t appeal to me , but i m not afraid of it either . it simply seems like an isolating experience , because you know ahead of time that your time with your loved ones if you even bother to make intimate connections at all is fleeting . you will outlive everyone around you .","295720":"i met my boyfriend s new puppy this morning . i went upstairs to leave the house to go to work , and the puppy walked around the corner to greet me . he was timid at first because he never met me before , but when i put my hand out , he immediately walked up to me and started licking my hands . then he jumped up on me and tried to play with me by tugging at my shirt . it was the cutest thing .","295721":"one year ago , i was in denial about my problems and all around unhealthy coping mechanisms . i genuinely thought i was doing well , when really all i was doing was suppressing my emotions and drowning them out with alcohol and drugs . fast forward to today , i have a better understanding of my unhealthy coping mechanisms and am actively trying to take back control of my impulses . i m trying to understand and process my emotions more , restraining myself from taking part in risky activity , and working on bettering myself both mentally and physically .","295722":"yes , i ve attended quite a few weddings my best friend s wedding being among them ! ! i m going to a wedding in two weeks actually . i ll be traveling for it , so my boyfriend and i are making a little weekend trip out of the experience .","295723":"long island is well known for the montauk monster , haha .","295724":"yes , i wholeheartedly agree . the human species is an incredibly complex species due to the range of emotions we experience . we are naturally complicated beings , and we always have been . frustrating , on the other hand , may be a matter of opinion , but i do agree with you in the understanding that humans are largely frustrating .","295725":"for my last birthday , my boyfriend drove me to the local aquarium and bought us tickets to a wine tasting event that occurred inside of the aquarium after hours . there were drinks , food , live music , and we could peruse the entire aquarium by ourselves . it was absolutely fantastic . honestly , i want to do the same thing for my next birthday . it was so low key and fun .","295726":"spirited away . i could watch that movie endlessly .","295727":"there s no such thing as a real versus a fake man . you re not any more of less of a man by either engaging in a fight or walking away from a fight . your gender doesn t correlate with your behavior .","295728":"having days off with my boyfriend , so we can spend quality time together by having breakfast , drinking coffee , smoking cigarettes , watching silly youtube videos , walking the dog , going to the park or beach , having a bonfire in the backyard , etc etc .","295729":"no , i m not an inherently happy person . i ve struggled with depression for as long as i can remember , and sometimes it feels as if life is preventing me from actually experiencing happiness sometimes i . e . , something terrible always happens when things appear to be going well .","295730":"i normally make myself a cup of hot coffee , put on relaxing instrumental music usually the skyrim soundtrack , and browse the internet so that i have something to distract me from my worries .","295731":"i m fairly book smart , but that s pretty much it . i scored highly on standardized exams when i was in school .","295732":"thank you , i really appreciate it . i m still struggling to control it , and the urges are almost always there , but i ve gotten a lot better over the past few weeks compared to the last year or so .","295733":"i rarely get bored because i don t have enough free time to be bored , haha . my days are normally spent at work , and then after work i normally run some errands , go home and have dinner , shower , and sometimes i ll see a friend if it isn t too late . otherwise , i watch television for minutes and go to bed .","295734":"brush my teeth , wash my face and or put on a face mask , and shower .","295735":"oh , to be young and naive again . especially to think that is old , lmaoo .","295736":"omg , i would be so excited . lol . i get an hour lunch break at work i would definitely introduce him to my coworkers even though he s met a few of them already , and we would sit outside and have conversations with them for the hour . i m close to three of my coworkers , so we would all chat and have a few laughs .","295737":"my favorite food is sushi especially spicy tuna rolls . my favorite drink is iced coffee .","295738":"game of thrones winterfell music ambiance

boyfriend to get out of work","295741":"i wish more people understood mental illness as a whole and how it s affected my life . sometimes others mistake my depression for laziness or my anxiety for an overbearing nature , and my bpd makes people think i m inherently manipulative when i m not .","295742":"i actually find that social media has allowed people the freedom and opportunity to express themselves more . in the past , people s feelings were mostly stifled and it was almost taboo to talk about your feelings . however , it s easier now more than ever to express yourself and get feedback on what it is you re feeling .","295743":"plagiarism , haha . one of my classmates accused me of plagiarism because apparently my term paper was so sophisticated that she didn t believe that i was the one who wrote it . luckily the professor had no issue with it and believed me when i told him that i did indeed write it .","295744":"trying to overcome an addiction in order to save a relationship with someone i love .","295745":"yeah , women in general are stigmatized based on a variety of factors , such as sex , gender , disability , sexual orientation , etc etc . it s more taboo , for example , for women to talk about sexual activity or express openness about their sexual behavior compared to men . there s also a lot of stigma regarding the social placement of women in the home and workforce , as many people still believe in traditional gender roles where women are supposed to be domestic housewives instead of a working class citizen .","295746":"i m somewhat of a materialistic person in that i value photographs greatly . my memory is poor , so often the photographs i take on trips and on other random occasions serve as a reminder of the good times i ve had . losing those photos would be losing a part of my life , in a way .","295747":"i really have no idea , lol . hopefully a good impression i know i can be standoffish at times , but idk if that s people first impression of me or not . i ve never asked anyone before .","295748":"no , not everyone deserves a chance for forgiveness . and this may be an unpopular opinion , but i also believe that in a lot of cases , you re not obligated to forgive someone else , especially in the case of ab se . if you don t want to forgive your ab ser , then you shouldn t feel pressured to do so .","295749":"ask needs to improve their reporting blocking system . often when you report a question or account , it falls on deaf ears and the blocking system is pretty much useless .","295750":"something low key and rustic that s half inside and half outside , with only close family members and friends . there would be a band instead of a dj , and the color palette would be all earth tones .","295751":"i have a tendency to hold grudges , but i ve been trying to work on letting go . holding a grudge hurts yourself more than it hurts the other person , so it s pointless to hold a grudge .","295752":"yes , absolutely . they re better company than humans in most cases .","295753":"nah , i have too many mugs that i go through to have a specific one for coffee , lol . however , i usually choose my biggest mugs so they hold the most coffee .","295754":"failure .","295755":"i m more of a realist than anything else . i would rather confront challenges and look at things from various perspectives to get a clear idea on it as opposed to having a pessimistic or optimistic outlook on things .","295756":"it makes me nervous when i ask my friends to text me when they get home like if we go out to a bar or restaurant together they never text me back . it makes me worry that something happened to them .","295757":"i d rather have an old phone with fast internet . i haven t upgraded my phone in three years anyway , lol .","295758":"no , i can t fathom spending that much money on one piece of clothing or accessory .","295759":"? ? happy pride month ! ! ? ?","295760":"i haven t tried since i was a teenager , rofl . probably not , though .","295761":"i d pay off some of my loans in , installments . lmao .","295762":"probably people asking me how my day was , or my favorite food .","295763":"no , i don t really change my accounts very often at all . i made a new email account when i was job searching after college , as well as a new facebook page , but that was all . they re both about five years old .","295764":"i appreciated the sentiment behind it , but my aunt bought me a bottle of wine for christmas that was likely gas station wine because i looked it up online it only cost . it also tasted horrible .","295765":"yes , i m very sentimental . i cherish things that people have made for me in particular , and i find it hard to give or throw away gifts people have gotten for me .","295766":"i would likely break up with that person . that s extremely controlling and manipulative behavior , and i wouldn t want to be in a relationship with someone who thinks that controlling their partner to that extent is okay .","295767":"having a hard work ethic . if you work hard and diligently at what you re trying to accomplish , you will eventually reach your goals because you ll do what s necessary no matter what it takes .","295768":"probably not , if it was cash at least . the police can t do anything with a random amount of cash laying around , lol .","295769":"yeah , it s truly horrid . especially when you re stuck in a car with that person and have no means of escape .","295770":"somewhat , sure . i m skeptical of most things . however , at the same time i don t spend most of my time questioning things because it isn t worth it or i don t have the time to do so .","295771":"november th .","295772":"uh , no ? ? mermaids aren t real , lol .","295773":"went to work , attended therapy , and ate dinner .","295774":"i don t have an opinion because it isn t something i care about .","295775":"for the most part , yes . however , when i m depressed then i have a tendency to let things get unruly and messy .","295776":"i highly doubt it .","295777":"is this sarcasm ? ? lmfao . no , i m rarely lively or full of energy . quite frankly , i m an exhausted pigeon .","295778":"no , i seldom have an appetite . i only eat when i m hungry most of the time , but sometimes i know i need to eat to keep my blood sugar up even if i m not hungry .","295779":"nah , i m bisexual . not gay .","295780":"uh , i have a boyfriend . lmao . but no , he didn t . he seldom does anything to anger me , and if anything , he calms me down when i m raging and destructive .","295781":"no , i don t typically ask anyone to do me favors at all .","295782":"people have tried in the past , but it never worked in their favor .","295783":"i slept for nine hours straight last night and woke up well rested , so i doubt it .","295784":"i m all right . i just got home from work and i m in a bad mood have been all day . i just want to sleep it off , but i also don t want to wake up in the morning .","295785":"no , i rarely do that .","295786":"happy pride to you as well","295787":"i don t discuss my finances on the internet .","295788":"to create a life full of purpose

especially if the driver is impaired in some way drugs or alcohol .","295792":"i m normally pretty good at saving money , although sometimes i like to splurge on things .","295793":"i normally don t , haha . sometimes i ll go out with a friend or two , though .","295794":"shemale isn t even a valid option , lmao . i m non binary .","295795":"no . i m quite looking forward to the future

.","295798":"no , i have no desire to grow old . i hope i perish before i get to the point where i need assistance for basic living .","295799":"it s a gender gender is split into two binaries , i . e . man and woman . non binary simply means that my gender is not man or woman , it s simply somewhere in between . it s under the transgender umbrella .","295800":"i don t really blame those women tbh , especially if they have continual bad experiences with men as time goes on . obviously there will always be men who are genuine and good people , but a large number of men are sexist people who feel entitled to women . the culture surrounding men and hypermasculinity doesn t help either .","295801":"uh , probably getting drunk and laughing until i was in tears when i was at my boyfriend s house last week , lol .","295802":"of course not . no one is incapable of making mistakes .","295803":"uh , do you mean who ? if so , then my boyfriend inspires me . he s always been such a strong support system to me and motivates me to be the best version of myself . he s pushed me when i needed to be pushed and he s always honest , even if the truth is uncomfortable . he s also one of the hardest working , funniest , most passionate people i know , and his personality alone is inspiring .","295804":"i think i would rather be aware when the world is ending so that i can get my goals and priorities straightened out . although honestly , the end of the world isn t too far fetched at this point in our lifetime .","295805":"i believe the night crew comes in and cleans every day .","295806":"i d like to think so , otherwise my friends wouldn t hang out with me , haha .","295807":"only if i m laughing really .","295808":"this is true ! ! i also don t know if i would even be able to do the strawberry blonde yet , i might have to transition to it in two sessions because of the blue that s still in my hair .","295809":"communications professional writing and a minor in english literature .","295810":"singing , lol . my voice is absolutely terrible but i love singing so much .","295811":"i honestly don t remember the first time i said i love you to my boyfriend , lmao . but considering i got attached early on , i probably said it within the first few months .","295812":"two weeks ago , i knocked my iced coffee off my desk at home and spilled it all over the carpet , ugh . honestly , i was more upset about losing the iced coffee than i was about it getting on the carpet . lmao .","295813":"sushi ! ! or eggplant parm .","295814":"i had a yogurt parfait this morning .","295815":"yeah , definitely . i m a full fledged scorpio and relate to most of the typical traits of scorpios .","295816":"insecurity in the relationship itself or insecurity in yourself ? either way , you need to communicate these feelings with your partner so you can work on them together . it won t get better by ignoring them or trying to suppress them .","295817":"i don t have any definite plans for the summer . i definitely want to go to this one venue on the bay though , it s right on the beach and they have food , drinks , and live music every night .","295818":"aw , thank you ! ! i m thinking of coloring it strawberry blonde this month though .","295819":"for me personally , it s all three the instruments , the lyrics , and the vocals . with some artists songs , one is more pronounced over the other , but generally it s a blending of those three factors that make a song great to me . as an example of some artists where one is emphasized over the other , i listen to artists like watsky and grandson mainly for their lyrics , but i also like two feet s instrumentals because the lyrics don t really mean much at all . i value the vocal range of bands like stone temple pilots , alice in chains , and soundgarden , but these three are also bands that also have beautiful lyrics and instrumentals .","295820":"i believe i have more friends who are women , but i also have a small handful of friends who are men keep in mind these numbers are small , though . i can name two men off the top of my head whom i would be able to talk to about anything , as well as perhaps three women .","295821":"i believe it s better to have loved and lost , as opposed to have never loved at all . although the experience is painful , it s all around better to have had that experience in the first place so that you re more aware of what to look out for in your next relationship or romantic venture . by not allowing yourself to love at all , you re doing yourself a disservice .","295822":"i seldom wear makeup , so i always go out bare faced . i only put makeup on perhaps once or twice a month .","295823":"i like too faced s products the most . i use their foundation concealer , as well as their highlighters .","295824":"i would probably want to learn how to use photoshop more intensely ! ! now that the weather is nicer , i want to go out and take some photographs and it would be useful to learn how to properly edit them .","295825":"the paperwork said he was about . years old , but my boyfriend thinks he s a bit younger than that .","295826":"they named him loki ! ! i m not the biggest fan of the name , but i think it suits him .","295827":"lol . well , he was technically adopted by my boyfriend s father and step mother . it s the family dog , but my boyfriend will primarily be taking care of him .","295828":"he s my boyfriend s new puppy ! !","295829":"he s so cute i m screaming . i cannot wait to meet this vibrant pup , omg . i m so in love .","295830":"i don t know the nature of your friendship , how long you ve been friends , etc etc . that s something you can only decide for yourself , depending on the types of changes he has made and what was the reason behind those changes . although , i will say this generally , people change as a result of outside influences on them , and if he has changed into someone you don t recognize anymore , it may be an indication that there s something personal going on in his life that he doesn t want to speak about . people don t change for no reason at all , and it s very possible that he s just trying to adjust to a dramatic change in his life .","295831":"you have to speak up against your family and tell them exactly how you feel . i know it s a lot easier said than done , but if you don t love someone , then marrying them would be a terrible idea you both would likely be miserable in the marriage , and you both deserve much better .","295832":"my boyfriend , one or two of my close friends , and my therapist . they all know pretty much everything there is to know about my life .","295833":"i don t post personal information like that on the internet .","295834":"i have a degree in communications and professional writing . i minored in english literature .","295835":"it s unbelievable in terms of my own personal achievements because i was struggling with mental health problems at the time and contemplated dropping out in light of those struggles , in addition to some personal things going on in my life . i know that so many students graduate with perfect . gpas , with summa cum laude honors , etc etc . however , i genuinely didn t believe i had that potential within me . it s something i ve always been proud of .","295836":"i don t remember my childhood , for the most part . however , i don t recall ever wanting to work for the government or even going into politics at all . i believe i wanted to be a teacher , if anything .","295837":"i graduated from college with magna cum laude honors meaning my gpa was between . and . .","295838":"after searching on google for some scientific discoveries in , i came upon a study that suggested noninvasive electrical stimulation could improve short term memory function in those with pronounced memory loss , such as in the case of dementia . the researchers reported that a study group of to year olds performed better in a series of working memory tasks after a half an hour of treatment .","295839":"i m not sure if the headaches are correlated with your coffee intake , but it could be a possibility . there are many factors to take into account are you dehydrated ? are you getting enough vitamins in your diet ? are you exercising ? etc etc . i get headaches sometimes , and migraines every so often , but they re normally hormonal for me or a result of a lack of water intake . i usually just pop two advil and call it a day .","295840":"i ve never physically hurt someone before , but i m sure i ve hurt people emotionally in the past without intending to . i ve also done a lot of questionable morally , at least things that were a negative influence on those around me , and i m sure they had to deal with the consequences of those actions .","295841":"hello i m doing well ! ! i woke up around am and have been basically lazing around the house since then it s almost am . i made a large cup of coffee , had a cigarette , and booted up my laptop to check up on askfm and ask answer a few questions .","295842":"no , i don t believe so . even if you re happy with where you are and your achievements , that doesn t mean that you should stop putting effort into your life by ceasing effort , you re allowing yourself to fall into a dull routine , and eventually , you won t be satisfied with yourself anymore .","295843":"generally speaking , everyone has the freedom to ab se drugs because let s face it , even though they re illegal people still have many ways to get them . however , drug addiction is a mental health health care issue first and foremost . being addicted to anything is detrimental to your health and well being , and everyone who s an addict deserves proper treatment and support .","295844":"of course i actually love satirical pieces .","295845":"i haven t been to the actual gym in a long time , so no . however , i have a treadmill and weights at my house , so i use those instead of going to a gym .","295846":"do you mean this in the sense that i confuse everyone ? ? lmaoo .","295847":"i have a tendency to be a bit messy , but normally i do try to clean several times a week to maintain a sense of cleanliness and organization . i function much better when all of my belongings are in their proper places and there s open space .","295848":"i prefer answering questions on askfm using my computer . it s just easier for me to type out the answers using a keyboard rather than using my cell phone .","295849":"thankfully this hasn t happened to me in a while i m usually good at falling asleep when i actually go to bed , probably because i m always in a chronic state of exhaustion . however , when i really cannot sleep , i honestly just scroll through my phone or try to listen to calm music to ease me .","295850":"i took this picture a few years ago using a minolta mm film camera , and fell in love with the way it turned out . i absolutely miss that camera . i really have no idea where it is now , but it took the best photographs .","295851":"honestly , i never thought i would live past the age of , especially when i was much younger and severely struggling with mental health problems . i thought my fate was s icide and that i would accomplish it sooner rather than later .","295852":"parents owe their children a loving , compassionate , open minded , and forgiving home . children did not ask to be brought into this world , and its the parents job to ensure the safety and welfare of their children .","295853":"no , not all mothers love their children .","295854":"unfortunately , you cannot force someone to change their behavior . in order for someone to change , they have to be self aware and realize what they re doing is wrong and then also put the effort into changing themselves . what you and her are experiencing is normal , though . teenagers usually change once they reach those years because they either want to impress their friends or fit into the crowd or act out against their parents . when she gets older , she ll grow out of it .","295855":"depends entirely on the day , lol . some days i m fairly laid back , but other days i m incredibly neurotic and anxious .","295856":"i have unhealthy coping mechanisms when i m stressed or angry , but sometimes i do try to vent to a friend or my boyfriend just to get it out of my system .","295857":"hyundai accent .","295858":"yeah , i realized that a while ago . lol . it s going to be in early march we re leaving out of new jersey , so it s going to be one hell of a ride .","295859":"a black lab pit mix ! ! i have one photo that isn t a great photo , so i m waiting for my boyfriend to send me a better one . they just brought him home today .","295860":"i ve never been on a cruise before . i hope i do like them , though i m going on a cruise next winter , lol .","295861":"i believe freedom is an inherent human right . everyone deserves freedom within reason however it s difficult to really control freedom without someone ab sing their power .","295862":"no , i ve never been backpacking before . it sounds like a lot of fun , though .","295863":"my boyfriend got a new puppy he s so cute , i m screaming .","295864":"i share your sentiments .","295865":"i m in a monogamous relationship , so i suppose so .","295866":"depends on my mood . sometimes i prefer poetry while other times i prefer getting lost in a book .","295867":"i don t remember my childhood , so i really have no clue .","295868":"think of how much better you ll feel when you get the work done don t have to worry about it anymore . i used to be a procrastinator , but as the years passed , i realized it was better for me to do things immediately as opposed to putting them off . it was unnecessary stress and worry .","295869":"depends on what you did to anger him and how much time has passed , as well as the nature of your friendship . if you were in the wrong , though , you should try to make amends .","295870":"no , i didn t work during high school . i took out loans for college and worked throughout college .","295871":"i ve always wanted to visit virginia , actually . two of my friends live there .","295872":"it s my passion , and i love every minute of it .","295873":"anyone have any questions ? ? i feel like answering some","295874":"coffee , always . i m actually thinking about making a cup of iced coffee right now even though it s pm , lol because i m still a bit groggy from my nap .","295875":"mumble rap , lol . it s become more prominent and originated with soundcloud rappers , i believe , but i never understood the appeal behind it because honestly , it s just bad music in my eyes . especially when their voices are autotuned .","295876":"yes , i have an irrational fear of people secretly hating me and that they re only friends with me out of pity or guilt , or that they backstab me and talk sh t about me behind my back . i feel hated by some of my closest friends at times , which makes me push them away and talk to them less because i don t want to give them an excuse to leave .","295877":"i know quite a few people who have roots in central america and south america , and they cannot speak spanish . one of my old coworkers is puerto rican , but really doesn t speak spanish at all because only english is spoken in her household .","295878":"cont i haven t been doing much except being depressed and anxious and i spent a lot of time at home so it feels like i wasted a lot of time and i can t get it back . it also feels like nothing excites me anymore and whenever someone asks me my hobbies it gets a bit awkward because i have none haha . i know this feeling all too well , unfortunately . when you struggle with depression and or anxiety , or other mental illnesses , it sorta takes over your entire life because it becomes so detrimental to your well being and how you perceive everything around you . try not to fret about it too much , even though obviously that s easier said than done . you re not wasting your life , and you have so much time ahead of you still to do the things you want to do . it takes baby steps , which you re doing because you re on the wait list for therapy and in the process of seeing a psychiatrist . things will get better .","295879":"we went to the same middle school and became friends due to our shared love of music .","295880":"getting into a car accident . they re always such stressful situations , and i m lucky that i was never hurt in an accident before , but the possibility is always still there .","295881":"yes , it s perfectly acceptable not to listen to someone is all they re doing is regurgitating hateful or oppressive rhetoric that harms other people .","295882":"no , i m not at odds or dealing with confrontation with anyone at the moment , either online or irl .","295883":"it depends really . someone s writing style could be great in terms of their phrasing , but if their punctuation is in the wrong place , then it could sound awkward and not give off its intended meaning . that s where editors come into play , lol . to better your writing , in terms of punctuation and grammar at least , it s best to read some how to books , i . e . strunk and white s elements of style or zen in the art of writing by ray bradbury those are two of the books i read in college .","295884":"yeah , especially when they re seasoned with sea salt and rosemary .","295885":"i can t change the world , at least not as an individual in this stage of my life . i don t have enough of an influence on the world to make a difference .","295886":"no , gender inequality should not exist . in an ideal world , people would have the same rights and opportunities regardless of their gender .","295887":"neither , really . i m not a fanatic , but i also write creatively sometimes on top of writing for my job .","295888":"i don t know enough about it to really have an opinion on it .","295889":"no one has sent me criticism , so i have no clue what you re talking about .","295890":"no need to apologize for the messages ! ! i m glad you gave me such deep insight into your history , so that i can give you an informed opinion . first off i hope you understand that what your mother has done to you is very wrong , and it s perfectly normal for that to have affected you negatively and even contributed to your depression . comparing yourself to classmates and other people in your culture will only hurt you , as you well know , and it truly doesn t matter what other people have gone through for all you know , they could be struggling just as badly . people don t outwardly show their struggles most of the time . you re not weak , unaccomplished , or a bad person for not being able to finish school . and honestly , perhaps you should try to apply for a different nursing program other than the one that rejected you , a different university maybe . if it s something you truly want to do , you should try to pursue it with all of your energy . and even if you get rejected , at least you ll have the comfort in knowing that you tried . as for your medication , there will be trials and errors . a lot of them . it took me two years to find the right cocktail of meds , and now i m much more stable than i ve ever been . please don t give up , i know it s going to be rough but it s so worth it . also , have you considered therapy ? i truly hope you re able to find some hope and happiness within yourself . you seem like a hard working , compassionate person and you deserve the best .","295891":"i can certainly try to help you . however , i cannot guarantee that i ll give an informed answer remember that i m not a professional , but i can give you insight from the point of view of someone who also struggles with mental illness .","295892":"depression and other mental illnesses , such as anxiety , personality disorders , dissociative disorders , psychosis , etc etc . is stigmatized so much in society because mental health is not taken as seriously as physical health . there are still a lot of people who believe that disorders like depression or anxiety is simply a state of mind , that someone can snap out of it or that it s a choice . obviously that isn t true . in order to decrease the stigma associated with mental illnesses , we need to continue discussing them and raise awareness of methods of healthy coping , treatment , and understanding .","295893":"i believe it s both . while happiness is ultimately a state of mind influenced by brain chemicals and neurons , we also need to put the effort in to ensure that we attain happiness in our lives , even if that happiness comes from little things .","295894":"i would never treat a retail or food service worker poorly . coming from my experiences as a cashier and pharmacy technician , there are so many customers who feel so entitled to your services that they spend most of their time disrespecting retail workers . they treat them as less than human and believe that they only exist to serve them , which is wrong . when i go to the store or a restaurant , i treat each worker with the utmost respect and patience . i understand how difficult the jobs can be at times .","295895":"yes , lmaoo . that happened the other night when i was texting my coworker . we were evidently talking about two completely different things , so i really had no idea what she was saying . also , she later told me that she was two glasses of wine in and also took two sleeping pills , so she later admitted that she also made no sense even to herself , haha .","295896":"yes , i ve had a few interactions with the ceo of the company . he threw a summer cocktail party last year , and at first he didn t know who i was , but we spoke briefly and he appeared to have liked me i think ? . i m also fairly close with the coo of the company , she absolutely adores me and believes i m an extremely hard worker , which is great . she was so happy that i showed up to that cocktail party and gave me a huge hug .","295897":"thankfully , yes . i was close enough with his family that they laughed about it in that moment , but i was still absolutely horrified that it happened . lmaoo .","295898":"normally i don t answer this question because i still feel shame in this moment , but i m feeling quite open right now , so i ll say it anyway lol . there was one time i was having a family dinner with my boyfriend his family , and when we were all finished , we were just sitting and listening to music and talking . i ended up accidentally farting so loudly at the dining room table with his entire there , and i was absolutely mortified . they still bring it up to this day at times , and this happened years ago . lmaoo .","295899":"i believe the internet has been an important and society changing invention . it s completely changed the way we view the world , and it s rapid spread of news and information has allowed normally under privileged people to remain educated on trending topics and current events .","295900":"i wholeheartedly believe that most people have the capability to change and adapt . being raised in a close minded and oppressive environment doesn t mean you can t unlearn the behaviors that you were taught , especially if you take the time to educate yourself on topics such as mental and physical disabilities , racism , sexism , the lgbt community , etc etc . of course , there will always be some people who cannot change , especially if they don t want to change .","295901":"i go out of my way to be super nice to the hr representative at my job , lmao . she s known for completely turning on people if they express any sort of distaste , even if it isn t towards her , and i don t want to be a future target . luckily , she and i are on good terms for the time being because i always express my thoughts in my emails in a respectful and thankful manner .","295902":"yes , i do believe that it s just as painful losing a friend compared to losing someone you re attached to romantically . if you ve bonded with a friend so deeply that they become as important to you as a partner , then losing them will put a hole in your heart just as much as losing a partner would .","295903":"i actually have a rough sketch of a plot written out regarding a book i want to write in the future . however , i feel uncomfortable sharing the plot because i don t want to give anyone else the idea .","295904":"i honestly love billie eilish , and i ve become super obsessed with her music over the past few weeks , lol . one of my favorite songs by her is i love you . https www . youtube . com watch ? v wiinvuzh da","295905":"i keep my bread in a breadbox , although my family sometimes puts bread in the freezer to preserve it if we know we re not going to use it yet .","295906":"i normally pay with debit , although sometimes i also use cash . i only use my credit cards in rare instances , i . e . paying for something expensive so that i can pay it off in installments as opposed to all at once .","295907":"i believe it s good that major companies like gillette and chick fil a are open about their political stances . it shows the public their true endorsements and beliefs so that we can decide whether or not to support the company . i m strictly against companies like chick fil a because of their oppressive and conservative views against the lgbt community , which is why i would never endorse them with my money . however , gillette is rapidly becoming one of my favorite companies because of how inclusive they are .","295908":"my worst fear is being abandoned by my loved ones , namely my boyfriend close friends . i m irrationally terrified that they re actually tired of me and only put up with me because of pity , because they know how i would react if they were to leave me .","295909":"my self confidence varies depending on the day my mood . some days i m fairly self confident , while other days i feel like absolute garbage about myself .","295910":"i try to spend at least one day per week on myself , doing self care and taking each hour as they come . i get all of my chores errands done throughout the work week so when the weekend comes around , i don t have much to do . i typically spend the day writing , listening to relaxing music , maybe doing a face mask , drinking lots of coffee , and sleeping .","295911":"i don t have a dream car because i m not into cars at all . i m happy as long as the car is comfortable , has good mileage , and doesn t require constant maintenance .","295912":"i m an omnivert ! ! an omnivert is basically someone who is introverted in low stimulating environments , while also acting extroverted in high stimulating environments . when i m alone , i m very introverted and low key . i prefer the quiet solitude over anything else . however , if i m out with a friend or two at a bar or restaurant , then i become extroverted with some exceptions here and there . in those instances , i thrive and have a lot of fun when i m around a small group of people .","295913":"cheez its especially the white cheddar ones , and cheese doodles .","295914":"i used to when i was younger , but not so much anymore . when i was a teenager , i loved the music of ayumi hamasaki ! !","295915":"happy pride month ! !","295916":"weak by ajr https www

with butter .","295919":"i don t have a song stuck in my head because i m currently listening to music . i have a playlist of all the game of thrones soundtracks on spotify , so i listen to that nearly every morning .","295920":"you re definitely not the first person to say this , lol .","295921":"the last time i cried was last tuesday . there wasn t really a reason behind why i was crying , i was just wrought with emotions and it was overwhelming to the point where i started sobbing .","295922":"i used to like pokemon when i was much younger . i would collect the cards , play the video games , and watch the television series .","295923":"i unintentionally started a collection of mugs a few years ago , haha . i would just keep finding cute ones and feel compelled to buy them , until i realized that my cabinets were literally overflowing with mugs .","295924":"i normally like answering questions , but sometimes when i m bored , i ask a question or two as well .","295925":"definitely not , lmao . i can t even handle one of me , let alone multiple copies of me .","295926":"no , but i heard about the shootings there today . absolutely tragic . there needs to be something done about gun laws in this country .","295927":"no , i don t get outraged easily at all . however , when i am angry , it becomes explosive .","295928":"uh , not well at all . lmao . i have fairly unhealthy coping mechanisms , especially when it comes to my anger and rage .","295929":"no , i don t tell people if i follow them . i don t want them to feel obligated to follow me back . i also haven t followed anyone new in a long time .","295930":"i wouldn t be using askfm if i didn t like it .","295931":"i usually only wear makeup perhaps once per month or so . i only wear it if i m going out somewhere , like the bar or a restaurant with my boyfriend or a friend .","295932":"i m afraid of my loved ones abandoning me . the only way i can really manage that fear is through consistent reassurance that nothing is wrong and they still love me accept me despite my downfalls .","295933":"i m a full fledged scorpio .","295934":"i have a few of them , but i don t collect them .","295935":"i don t get that hungry , haha . i only eat when i m hungry and even so that isn t very often .","295936":"you have to weigh out the pros and cons of each , and determine which school would be better for your own education and well being . take into account factors like tuition , meal plans , courses offered , the professors reputations , how far away from home they are if that matters to you , etc etc .","295937":"yes , it s happened to me a few times . it isn t something i m comfortable going into , though .","295938":"yes , i have . it happens every now and again , especially when i m drunk , haha .","295939":"read , write , paint , play video games , exercise , and hang out with friends .","295940":"medium rare .","295941":"nah , writing is my cup of coffee .","295942":"lmao , that isn t true . cc celinem","295943":"too bad , y all .","295944":"i don t usually drink soda , but sometimes i ll get a mountain dew baja blast from taco bell .","295945":"i believe climate change is going to be one of the biggest if not the biggest challenges the next generation is going to face . humans have done so much to tear down the integrity of the environment , and the environment and atmosphere is deteriorating at an alarming rate .","295946":"no , i wouldn t take that risk . even though i m not completely happy with who i am today , i wouldn t want to risk changing something in my past you simply don t know whether or not that change will be for better or for worse . i have high hopes for myself , and that isn t really something i want to risk just on the sheer , rare possibility that i could be better .","295947":"i wouldn t be able to cope with any sort of lying or dishonesty , especially in terms of cheating . i believe that relationships should have open communication , so if you lie to me about something , i m going to assume that you simply don t trust me .","295948":"omg , i used to love that song ! ! personally , i used to be obsessed with the band muse , but i haven t heard their music in a long time besides when i saw them live a few months ago . i used to buy and listen to all of their albums , but after a few years , i stopped listening to them entirely because i didn t really like the musical direction they were going in .","295949":"i wasn t inspired by anything today , honestly . even though nothing terrible happened today , i m in a fairly bad mood . i ve been so unsteady and off these past few days i can t shake it .","295950":"i ve only ever been on a plane trip once before in my life i went from new york to austin , texas . i had a layover in dallas fort worth before going to austin , and the most inconvenient thing about that trip was trying to figure out how to get to the next terminal , haha . the rest of the trips i ve gone on , i ve driven there because they weren t far from where i live . i mostly go to upstate new york , which is an easy hour drive .","295951":"i would love to meet hang out with celinem , littlesha , shehitsback , urlsareshittbh , heartofstitches , and misphire ! !","295952":"i believe social media can be an outlet for those who are socially awkward because it can help them interact more with other people . i m a naturally unsocial person by nature , but i do like my exposure to social media because it provides me with the opportunities to talk to other people on my own terms . i think social media only increases unsocial behavior if you become so immersed in it that you begin to ignore your irl friends , family , etc etc .","295953":"i watched the trailer for the new video game layers of fear , and it shocked me actually gave me goosebumps because of how disturbing and thrilling it looks ! ! my boyfriend and i were sitting there with both of our jaws dropped to the floor , lmao . when the trailer ended , we looked at each other and were like , we need this game .","295954":"yes , i believe it s possible . as long as both people have moved on completely and are pursuing other interests even if those interests aren t romantic , then it s definitely possible for exes to be friends . one of my best friends is actually an ex of mine , lol .","295955":"i like my name the way it is now , it s gender neutral and it feels more like me than any other name .","295956":"i don t usually refer to my friends by nicknames , lol . my one coworker has nicknames for everyone though , it s hilarious .","295957":"aw , thank you . it s true , though a lot of people like to shove deep meanings into situations to try to justify them , but the truth is that there are no hidden meanings or ulterior motives behind events , especially saddening or tragic events . things happen because life is ultimately unfair , and instead of trying to focus on why they happened , we should focus on accepting that they happened , coping with the consequences , and moving on .","295958":"yes , that is indeed true . the longer you prolong getting treatment , the worse your mental illness will become . it may come and go in waves , much like a lot of other chronic illnesses , but symptoms do steadily get worse over time if you don t do anything to treat the illness .","295959":"no , not everything happens for a reason . some things happen simply because that s how the cards have fallen , and there isn t a deeper meaning behind it .","295960":"i prefer studio ghibli over disney ! ! i ve only seen a few ghibli films , but they were beautiful .","295961":"i prefer winter over summer . the summers where i live get too humid and gross , it s difficult to breathe on really hot days .","295962":"leggings , a tank top or tee shirt , and sneakers .","295963":"yeah , especially during the summer . the freckles on my face stand out much more when i m in the sun .","295964":"i have to actually know them feel comfortable enough with them to send personal snaps to them .","295965":"somewhere in upstate new york , where i can immerse myself in forests and waterfalls .","295966":"nah , not at all . he s my best friend as well as my boyfriend , so i tell him everything .","295967":"nah , i m not superstitious . most superstitions are simply old wives tales that developed over the course of several decades or centuries , and they re never usually true .","295968":"i believe it s somewhat the same thing , but i do admit that the feeling is x grander when you see your work printed in a book , magazine , or newspaper compared to it just being printed online . it s something tangible that you can hold .","295969":"yes , absolutely . you connect with your friends on deep levels , and you do develop an attachment to that friendship . to lose a friend could sometimes be worse than a romantic breakup , depending on the type of friendship it is or how long you ve been friends .","295970":"no , i wouldn t be able to cope with an open relationship . i would be too terrified that my boyfriend likes the other person more than me and would leave me altogether .","295971":"technically it s legal because your sister is a consenting adult , but that large of an age gap does concern me . normally men that age go after younger girls because they re vulnerable and easier to control . i would be concerned that the man has a nefarious motive behind dating your sister , and it also makes me wonder why he can t date people his own age .","295972":"yes , askfm has always had its issues with bullying though , just as any other anonymous question asking site formspring , curiouscat , tellonym , etc etc . the best thing you can do if you find yourself getting bullied is just report and block the messages .","295973":"i don t eat cookies or double cheeseburgers , lmao . i can t remember the last time i actually ate a cookie , normally sweets upset my stomach .","295974":"yeah , i know a few people who have bad tattoos . it s normally because they went to a non reputable artist and got their work done because it was cheap , not so much for the quality of their work .","295975":"there s only one person in my life who can make me furious , but other than that , i don t get angry at a lot of things . very rarely do i have episodes of rage .","295976":"no , cole slaw is gross af .","295977":"lmao , no . i don t normally ask for anything , and if i do then it s in my regular voice .","295978":"aw , thank you ! !","295979":"olives are absolutely disgusting no one can change my mind .","295980":"i m wearing jeans and a rust colored tank top .","295981":"thank you","295982":"no , the only denim things i own are jeans .","295983":"that would literally never happen , so .","295984":"my boyfriend and i went to texas roadhouse a few weeks ago , if that counts ? ? lmao .","295985":"i feel this so hard . it could simply be that you re on the wrong medication . it took me two years to find the right medication regimen to deal with my mood disorders . however , know that you re not alone . there are always resources to help and i m also here if you need to talk .","295986":"i ve never counted . however , i have an entire cabinet with three shelves dedicated to my mugs .","295987":"i accidentally started a collection of mugs years ago .","295988":"lmao , i wish .","295989":"we met through a mutual friend . we all went to an amusement park together , and him and i hit it off right away .","295990":"no , being creative is the last thing on my mind when i feel this way .","295991":"not generally . at least not outwardly . i don t drive recklessly percent of the time unless i m feeling this way .","295992":"i literally have zero clue . my day was ordinary at worst , but i was driving home and got so furious at the traffic , which led me to thinking about everything else that makes me furious , and now i m spiraling into a manic esque rage .","295993":"i love impulsive ideation ! i love feeling indestructible ! i love trying to cope with my racing thoughts and find myself falling into dangerous , reckless , destructive habits ! my rage is completely inconsolable , and the only thing i can do is angrily sip my coffee because there s no alcohol in the house ! i m literally going stir crazy rn , and all i want to do is go wild and drink and smoke and speed down the highway while blasting music on the loudest volume and scream . i can t i can t i can t .","295994":"it depends entirely on where i need to go , haha . for example , i would rather take the train into new york city as opposed to driving there . however , i do usually drive everywhere i need to go because there s no pressure for me to rely on anyone or anything else .","295995":"i believe that s the wrong way to go about starting a business . you should be focusing your efforts on marketing , improving the quality of your products , accessibility , etc etc . fake reviews are often obvious that they re fake , too . it doesn t do anything for your credibility .","295996":"it depends on the individual . some people appreciate being checked up on occasionally because it proves to them that others are concerned about them , while other people find it aggravating and demeaning . personally , i like when people check up on me maybe once per day . just a quick text is fine , something like , hey , how are you holding up today ? could i get you anything ? it s simple , but it means the world .","295997":"i could be much better than i currently am . i do admit that i m terrific at writing , but self sabotage is essentially my middle name . i keep doing things to myself to ruin my own life but never change .","295998":"i ve been to a lot of concerts , so many that i really have no idea how many there have been over the years . i started attending concerts when i was around years old .","295999":"no , i could never drive for uber or lyft . . . or drive for ubereats , doordash , grubhub , or postmates . i have bad driving anxiety as it is , so driving literally all the time is my worst nightmare ."}}
