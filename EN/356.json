both is even better . i also love good creepy horror like music . i guess it s a cathartic sort of feeling for the sad ones and i can just dig the mood beat in them , if that makes any sense . the hype hard songs because they can make me feel pumped and like i can do most anything . hopsin is an example of rap in that category , he s probably still my favorite rap artist along tupac shakur . i also find some songs like a decent portion of love songs sad , like a thousand years for instance . i guess because the associated memories with the subject . billie eilish , ava max , lana del rey , marina the diamonds , and dubstepgutter are some of my more recent favorite artists . i have way too many overall and would take several hours to compile them all in a list . some of my favorite songs

personality is more calculated before i get to know whoever it is i m around . probably always a bit more calculated , but less of a filter or a feeling of needing as tight of a filter . . i

remember . maybe this is slightly off topic , but you know that feeling you get sometimes ? maybe after you wake up or after a morning shower . i don t think i ve had it in years , but i remember having it at least more than a few times all thd way back to my very young days . i don t know why these events are so significant that i remember them along with the feeling back so far when nothing even really happens in the memories . basically , a feeling of being out of place , it s not so much an emotional thing , more physical and a feeling not talking about after making big changes decisions or after changing scenery moving house . like your life feels alien and you feel so distant from everything , especially your surroundings , everything familiar . it certainly happen even when surrounded by friends and family .","329364":"live and let live ? treat others ss you d wish to be treated ? golden rule i don t know . we don t really rank our rules , well , maybe a special few

long term decisions . this is not to say i think people getting married younger is inappropriate , that they are not mature enough , or that it won t last . just that the odds aren t as good . really , having a rational mindset doesn t even matter if it doesn t factor into your decision because you are madly in love anyway or other reasons . so all is fair in love and war , so they say

though , maybe just the extent i think it goes . not talking about adrenaline . sexual orientation , just like everything welse is a result of the interaction between nature and nurture . pets are not at all nearly as anthropomorphic as we believe or wish they were . this has little to do with the intelligence of pets . it has to do with human desire to find human ness in our surroundings or anything that resembkes us .","329387":"eat carolina reapers or peppers of that caliber . i had wicked heartburn and ab pain . no , i don t get the end of the tunnel stuff . going in and coming out

just list what i think are my top for appearance and otherwise five in order from what i notice first the most to least . physical appearance hair . makeup . high on the list for when it is very noticeable anyway . contrast , deep saturated colors . faces expression structure . height and figure . butts would be higher if butts were on the front . don t worry though , i don t get aroused when i look at your butt of the time if you are a stranger , much less so if we have a sexual romantic connection . it s more of a fascination and i will get an image in my head when i don t even look at it and it comes up in my peripheral . when i do get aroused its sometimes just that i happened to get a random erection at a fitting time or i haven t done anything in weeks . boobs don t make the list . probably belongs higher on the list , i just don t typically care about them . sometimes i ll be accidentally staring at them while daydreaming or spacing out thinking or too tired to think . don t get me wrong , boobs can be fun , but they are not really an object of sex in my mind . they can compliment a figure well though . when talking even more guessing voice . whether a shy or outgoing personality . sense of humor . mood . connection .","329391":"closest i can think of is to create and i do pretty often .","329392":"if i had one wish i would wish to stop the aging process .

audible cries , tears streaming down my face and lots of nose blowing . happens when i eat spicy food . i thought the carolina reaper would be spicier though , didn t even feel any need to drink milk

.","329412":"depends how you mean it , i use to find it hard to accept that we had to part ways friends when i was young , now it s more that i want to make sure the goodbye is appropriately timed and mutual . i mean , i don t necassarily want to leave , or for them to leave , but my mind is more occupied nowadays of course and i m more used to it as well as knowing i ll almost certainly see them again . in the case of saying goodbye forever because of death or another reason , i find that harder of course .","329413":"writing , worldbuilding , playing video games , watching anime , and drawing . i d like to learn to play piano .","329414":"eh , okay . only because it wasn t anything personal or private .","329415":"usually procrastination or taking small steps , just starting , when it stresses me out and i have a large course load . the former method is a biological response while the latter is a logical and informed method to reduce the stress via getting rid of the stressor ratger than ignoring it .","329416":"i would say my favorite memories are tied to who they are with rather than where they take place . not sure that i have a favorite memory , well , maybe , but it s a bit personal .","329417":"further than i probably should as long as i can deduce that it is mutual . i feel as if the me in love and the me not in love are two very different people and they can both observe themselves and the other self . it s strange . a lot of my views , ideas , and desires change . in terms of ideas views i try to be more consistent , also , how they change hasn t changed based on who the target is either . so i m not saying i adopt the targets views . i would also say the me in love is more bold or passionate in terms of expression through art for the most part . sort of like having a muse . maybe you could argue that the me in love is just more honest emotional and less pragmatic logical . some of it is also just biological . like how i will change my mind on kids for instance . where when i m not in love i think about it logically , but also less passionately . i think about how i wouldn t want kids until i m in an optimal place financially and once i learn a lot about raising children , child psychology , and have a good mindset going into it so that it is my best effort . there have also been times where i ve thought getting a vasectomy to prevent the in love me from doing anything stupid in the future . i also feel that having kids shouldn t be as easy as it is biologically when it is a huge responsibility and that the process of adoption is closer

wide range with every nationality , religion , and more for what people believe , how they express that belief or just how they live and the decisions they make . i don t believe it s right to tell

feel like wasting money on another when i might find it . i know for a fact my air mattress is still here somewhere and i can t find it , that also makes me more confident that my power bsnk is still here and i just am unable to find it . i m sure i didn t have my power bank in a position to be lost at ohayocon at any time . only had it out when it was charging my phone or in my pocket after fully charging it rhen back in my backpack . oh my god ! i just found it in my backpack after searching for half a dozen seconds . i remember fully emptying all my bags multiple times to look for it . what the hell . so , one of the things at the top of my wishlist is probably naokai urasawa s monster , the dvd set . it s not on any streaming service or anle to be purchased digitally to watch on any device either . only streaming services you can find it on are ones like kissanime . i watched it on one of those websites because i didn t feel like dumping tons of money on a show just to watch it

conciousness remained , no visuals outside of imagination . not sure if i d enjoy my conciousness wandering without any stimuli like that . i will say i d rather live forever and endure that over living a finite amount of time . if i think pragmatically , i might choose something like wealth distribution to be distributed more evenly . i could also just have sympathy and empathy to a fair or high degree in everyone for more than just your family friends and who you know and it could work itself out . also for being greedy to not be as rewarding with our brain chemistry . poverty causes or

surprise others or to not be seen . i do play stealthy classes sometimes in rpgs , but usually a tank or cleric . a class that works well with a team outside of providing high dps . anyway , i could

you first have to understand what manipulation looks like which is someone who is emotionally manipulating you may do so in subtle ways , like judging and criticizing your actions . they might make a mean comment about your choice of friends , for example . another sign of emotional manipulation is trying to create feelings of embarrassment or guilt . there s psychological manipulation too that you can look up . here are some ways you feel fear , obligation and guilt . you re questioning yourself aka they re gaslighting you . there are strings attached if you don t meet the manipulator s expectation , you will be made out to be ungrateful . you notice the foot in the door and door in the face techniques . plain old bullying . they pull the if you really loved me . . . emotional blackmail . playing the victim this is a huge one . gaslighting another big one . convenient neediness , they re always joking . what to do if you think you re being manipulated ? talk to a therapist or call the national domestic violence hotline as they know what to do . try not to let the manipulators behavior affect you personally . i know that s easier said then done but it s really important to not let them get to you . some more stubborn headedness , knowing your weaknesses , creating confusion , being passive aggressive . most of the manipulators are pathological liars . psychological manipulators are often what they call emotional vampires or parasites . that means that they will make you feel bad whenever they feel bad , or make you feel guilty because they feel bad . they pressure you . manipulators will often yell or put you in an uncomfortable situation because of their behavior . stone cold letting you take the initiative manipulators will let you speak first

or smarter , sotheyblame others . it s a coping mechanism to deal with insecurity .","329589":"honestly , there s so many reasons but i think the biggest reason is that i m afraid to love someone who is going to leave me . i spend so much time trying to convince myself that i don t need someone because i know for a fact that i do . i do need someone and that s scary to me . it s scary because i feel like nobody truly loves me or genuinely wants me . i have high standards and i know what i m looking for , but i fear that person isn t out there .","329590":"thank you !","329591":"but what if god doesn t bring you back to me ?","329592":"my depression and trust issues . although , i do push people away who prove they re not worthy of being my friend .","329593":"it s crazy how when you re

problems on themselves and want to point fingers instead of taking responsibility . the list could go on and on . don t worry , we re all going to die someday and it ll be fine .","329595":"i have a very artistic eye and i appreciate a lot of different types of art . i have always drawn , but never really painted and for the past few years i ve wanted to learn . i love that there are so many different types of painting styles and that you really can t go wrong with painting . the only person who is telling you your painting looks like shit , is literally yourself . because i have too much inner anxiety , i have an unsteady hand so all of my paintings are a little uneven . that used to piss me off until i learned that having an instead hand is perfect for some paintings .","329596":"i

dads accident . i stopped having friendships and told myself i didn t need friend and that i didn t want friends . i was so scared of losing another person that i loved and cared about that i ended up hurting myself . even years later when i got older , i had two best friends sammie and michelle . they were like sisters to me , we did everything together but i was dating the worst girl at the time and she threatened them to leave my life . after that i stopped completely . even today i find it hard to make friendships because of what happened . toxic relationships play into my abandonment issues too but shit . . . i m ok with being alone nowadays because i know people aren t meant to stay .","329606":"i don t care what strangers say about me , i care what my friends say about me

season and episode of .","329642":"i can only speak out of personal experience . intensive therapy helped me the most and regular therapy . it s important to feel your emotions and identify where they re coming from . allow yourself time to heal and do not get upset with yourself . put yourself first ! make sure the people you are surrounding yourself with care about you and are people you can count on . sometimes the one hurting has to speak first . let others know how you re feeling in the best way you can possibly describe it . get out of the house when you re feeling depressed it s ok if when you re out and about that you still don t feel the greatest . it s not always about feeling good while doing things , allowing yourself to be surround by positive does better your feelings over time . challenge your negative thoughts . tell them no because they re lying to you . every negative thing you ve ever felt is a lie . daily affirmations are helpful .","329643":"not always , it s a narcissistic behavior . they do it as a method to take control over you . that s not always the case if it comes to a partner , because sometimes they re genuinely bringing up something that may matter .","329644":"it can take up to months . it all depends on how fast you re recovering .","329645":"mmm i m ok with the speed of this year . it s been very weird .","329646":"for it

where the lack of it comes from is helpful because then you can start doing things that will improve it . focus on the positive things in life . avoid should and must statements . if you find that your thoughts are full of these words , you might be putting unreasonable demands on yourself or on others . removing these words from your thoughts can lead to more realistic expectations . remind yourself that nobody is perfect and we all make mistakes . that s how we learn . get movin ! do what makes you happy . celebrate the small stuff because they re important . do something creative . get clear on your values . heal your past . it s very important to stop worrying about what others think and to stop yourself from overthinking .","329652":"puppy sitting","329653":"want the food .","329654":"costa rica because i am my most at peace when i am surrounded by plants .","329655":"that sounds like something little kids would do . and no .","329656":"that sometimes you will go through your darkest of times all alone . that s a hard pill to swallow when you re barely surviving and on edge . it was hard learning to put myself and my needs before others because self care isn t selfish when your mental health is in the gutter . all my hardest lessons have revolve around mental health .","329657":"i have never met a guy who didn t .","329658":"because they re a joke . they re not ready for a relationship and lack common sense . they fail to appreciate the good people because they re shitty themselves .","329659":"yes ! that used to happen to me all the time when i was

ve got different moms but i wish they had the same . eh . . . i doubt that will ever happen . ? i m the one stuck in that dream . omg that s funny ! no worries , definitely not having another one until i m married .","329672":"haha oh gosh . . . . i don t see a real one or platonic one ever happening . nah , not weird . go have fun !","329673":"no , it s ok . i ve gone through the therapy , i don t mind talking about it . and yes , her adopted family were extremely understanding and sometimes she stays with me . haha i ve got my year old living with me full time so not quite .","329674":"awe , thank you !","329675":"oof ! but also fun .","329676":"nope ! i would love to adopt someday . i have three kids . my eldest was conceived through r pe and i was forced to give her up for adoption . it can at times , but it s so worth it ! i love my kids , they bring so much happiness and love into my life . my youngest is normally at his moms during the weekdays and i get him on the weekends .","329677":"i don t ask for dating advice , except for maybe twice but that was more of a venting moment .","329678":"shh . . . it s cuter if you say it s a date . lol . it s kind of the only way someone is going to do something with me these days . it definitely feels like the right one doesn t exist m , you know ?","329679":"it could be a couple of different things . it could be something as simple as you calling him a man while talking , or wearing his clothes . especially being clingy in the right . i guess you won t know for sure until you ask him yourself .","329680":"thank you ! i think i need to clone myself in order for this to happen ? . you re probably right , it s good to do something nice even if the date is in a platonic way .","329681":"i want to take someone out on a date so bad ! but not just any kind of date . . . . one where we have a picnic in a field of flowers underneath a tree where can talk about life and snap a few polariods . i want to take someone out to an art gallery and then hit a record store to only bring one home that we can dance to .","329682":"it challenges our sense of value . criticism implies judgment and we all recoil from feeling judged . . . . if we re feeling threatened or diminished by another person s perceived shortcomings , providing constructive criticism becomes secondary to getting our value back .","329683":"? ? ?","329684":"ahhhh ! ! ! thank you ! ! ! ?","329685":"i agree !","329686":"you are so sweet ! ! !","329687":"definitely single .","329688":"i would ve told myself to wait until i was

much single .","329691":"i like attention when it s coming from that one person i like otherwise , no .","329692":"in a weird way , it s myself that inspires me the most . to be able to look back on

badly i want the new one which isn t often i normally wait until my plan is up . my laptop was the last thing i bought electronic wise but thats because my computer took a dump . i really don t buy anything else .","329694":"i kind of got along with everyone ? from when i used to be in public school but i was homeschooled for the majority of my years .","329695":"hmm . . . . ? i wouldn t call it

your relationship . recognize that everything you re feeling is normal and over time the pain will go away .","329732":"depression and anger . anger can lead to very dangerous things if not controlled and it s very damaging for your health . depression is more dangerous because if not treated , you will be lead down an extremely dark path that not everyone can get our of . you lose brainpower , become over or underweight . suicidal ideation , self arm , and at higher risk for heart attacks . it weakens your immune system and can lead to substance abuse .","329733":"why do adults try to say marriage sucks and that it s not worth it ? it s not my fault you re purposely damaging it by not communicating , listening or putting in the effort . of course marriage is difficult . everything that is worth it is . if you re both putting in the work , then your marriage could be a beautiful thing . it s when you stop , it becomes messy and hard to deal with .","329734":"depends on how i feel
