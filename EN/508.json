It's so dumb. I get a lot of \"are you fat, plus size\" and so many other things from time to time. It's like cool? Feeling bad about yourself or bored and want to project that to someone else. No thanks. They don't really know me, what i look like, my story.. ya know? They literally don't matter lol\n  \n  I've had a few people say things in person but it wasn't that horrible either? Rarely happened. Again, those people don't know you 100%.\n  \n  I have even had this young kid at the GYM say something before. Like what??? Literally working my butt off and they felt the need to say something rude. There's an indoor track that overlooks the basketball court. He should have been paying attention to his game and not me walking the track when taking a break from the actual gym area that's beside the track. It was also annoying since I lost a lot of weight before that. Like ok? Had the empathy that they don't know sh!t about me haha :)\n  ","545592":"\n  Not really creepy but it makes me think it's more trolling or trying to get a rise out of me somehow lol Has happened quite a few times. I get curious ones and then people who are just trying to be d!cks about it. Along with name calling even though they haven't seen me XD\n  \n  I don't really see it as sensitive anymore. It's just whatever. It doesn't define me as a person. I have a voice like everyone else. It really shouldn't matter how much I weighed or what I weigh now. I don't care about taking pictures even though I look better than I used to. Still not where I want to be. I'm not photographic at all. My fashion is pretty casual so I feel like taking pictures in blah clothing wont make me feel better about the picture\/myself either \ud83d\ude02\n  \n  As far as evolving, it's only been better with being more active + the gym. I've also done zumba in college. Eating more healthy. I still have junk sometimes. It had to be a lifestyle change for me. Diets don't work for me. I'd just yoyo. Eating in moderation and all that. I have also cut out soda and changed to just drinking tea and water. I have always loved swimming.\n  ","545593":"\n  I told myself to go to bed early (about 11) and it's 12 now.

I've talked about it countless of times on here.\n  \n  Ended up gaining weight when I had a bad reaction to mosquito bites and had to get a steroid shot to make them go away. Main reason, before that I was skinny. I also shared a childhood picture a few days ago. Clearly skinny in it :P It's creepy seeing pictures from the first and 2nd grade since I was skinny and then the next year I'm not \ud83d\ude10 There was a school note asking about it and I apparently put on 50 lbs back then.\n  \n  Also bad eating habits here and there. I have also been pretty good at maintaining the same weight.\n  \n  If anything I'm at the smallest adult weight even though still in the overweight crap. It had nothing to do with puberty if that's what you mean. lol. I think I might have pcos so that could explain a lot of it as well, especially when older.
