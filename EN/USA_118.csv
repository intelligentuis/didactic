  You can be realistic and optimistic at the same time. Just because you have had your heart broken doesnt mean you can control how the other person feels or control what they do.

  There's other ways to show how you are committed to a person instead of promising something that you truly dont have control of, you will technically at one point will leave her. Promises are for things like, ""ill buy you flowers"" ""yes ill be at your family reunion"" ""ill call you tomorrow""

  Youre putting words in my mouth. You cant compare generations to each other, they had different difficulties then we do. The economy isnt what it was 50 years ago. We're more a consuming society. We spend way more money. Inflation.
  
  The reason why i think my parents had it harder than me is because their parents were the depression generation, so they were the baby boomer generation. Post ww2. They had to build themselves up. They had to do everything themselves. They couldnt stay home if they wanted too, they would have gone nowhere. For them to make sure their kids (generations now) had a better life, luxurious, comfy life - they had to work extra hard.

  ","
  Maybe they cant afford gas at that moment? Or they want to get excercise? Car insurance is good even if you dont drive your car cause most people have it so if they are in someone else car and get in an accident they are covered, or if they drive someone else car and get pulled over or accident. Its just safe to have it at all times.

Things started to be thrown around and i go running to my dad crying like crazy. When he gets up to come to my room i see this crazy little girl behind him and i freak out but then she comes up and says she needs help. Then her brother comes up and they explain to me that they were murdered and all they want is to be happy.
  
  Then out of nowhere i randomly pop up at this womens house, im pretty sure she was the killer. And i kept calling my bf (im guessing idk who he was) and he kept saying like i got myself into this, its my fault blah blah blah. Well as soon as i started trying to make a plan for him to find me the women sneaks up behind me and makes me get off the phone then decides she wants to cut my skin off for her dinner and tried shoving me into her oven.

  Ok so i had a lucid dream last night that turned out to be on of the scariest fucking nightmares ive ever had.
  
  I was with a friend and we were gonna get in the car and leave, well demonic chucky was in there and he was coming after us. He put dynamite all around the house, but i kinda left my friend behind and went looking for every way out possible, i had to swim and then jump into another pool/pond from like 200 ft. At this moment, i tried waking up and since i didnt.. i thought it was real. I just kept running and i found people to help me except they were with chucky so i stabbed one in the throat and kept running. One crazy women tried helping me with a big knife and we kept running. My friend was dead and after us as well. The women charged chucky and he just bit her throat out and i heard the women yell ""he looks like a baby but he has shark teeth that are razor sharp! Keep running but watch him kill me"" i kept running until another women when huge dogs came to help and by then the other women was dead and crawling towards us so we just kept running. I was getting so scared i forced myself to open my eyes.

I start to feel terrible that im all dry and shes probably going to the pneumonia. So i do the right thing and i pull over, roll down my window and ask where shes going. As im speaking, two guys with guns come up behind my car and tells me to get out so they can steal my car, rape me, and stuff me in my trunk so they can murder me later.

  Ive had a few honestly, more than i want lol
  
  There was one time where i went into a childs room and there were protraits on the wall. I walked past and could feel the eyes watching, then i saw the eyes move to the side and back forward again.
  
  One of my best friends house was haunted.  I was in her kitchen and we both saw this dog run pass the opening  (she didnt own a dog) and it was gone in a flash. We both felt this overwhelming energy in one of her guest rooms. Her mom ended up getting someone to cleanse the spirits of the house, apparently the house was built on top of a burned house that killed 20 people.
  
  My other best friend had a haunted house as well. We would never go down a hallway, we run by it to get to her room. It was just guest rooms down that hall but we never. Then one day we just started talking about it and she asks me what do you think is down there, i reply ""a little blonde girl in a dress holding a doll"" and she freaks out because thats exactly what she saw.
  
  I could go on, i have many many stories.

  Why America is not the greatest country in the world (this will be long) ; ""...You know why people don't like liberals? Because they lose. If liberals are so fuckin' smart, how come they lose so GODDAM ALWAYS! And with a straight face, you're going to tell students that America is so starspangled awesome that we're the only ones in the world who have freedom? Canada has freedom, Japan has freedom, the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Australia, BELGIUM has freedom! Two hundred and seven sovereign states in the world, like 180 of them have freedom.
  
  And yeah, you... sorority girl. Just in case you accidentally wander into a voting booth one day, there are some things you should know, and one of them is: There is absolutely no evidence to support the statement that we're the greatest country in the world. We're seventh in literacy, twenty-seventh in math, twenty-second in science, forty-ninth in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, third in median household income, number four in labor force, and number four in exports. We lead the world in only three categories: number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where we spend more than the next twenty-six countries combined, twenty-five of whom are allies. None of this is the fault of a 20-year-old college student, but you, nonetheless, are without a doubt a member of the WORST-period-GENERATION-period-EVER-period, so when you ask what makes us the greatest country in the world, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about! Yosemite?
  
  We sure used to be. We stood up for what was right. We fought for moral reasons, we passed laws, struck down laws for moral reasons. We waged wars on poverty, not poor people. We sacrificed, we cared about our neighbors, we put our money where our mouths were, and we never beat our chest...""

  ","
  Ok honestly, ive been trying to figure it out for awhile. I have theories but idk truthfully.
  
  My first theory was maybe if you go to another country and start shooting/bombing people maybe thats why they feel the need to do the same.
  
  Another theory is they are terrified, and since nobody is listening they are gonna treat others the way they feel like they are getting treated, and thats terrifying others.
  
  Then i started thinking, what if its there form of war, and this is how they know how to fight.
  
  Now, what are they trying to prove? I think they are trying to send a message. In my eyes that message is, ""what you are doing with your life is wrong to my God, so im gonna sacrafice myself so you will open your eyes or im gonna kill people till you start living my way - the right way""
  
  Terrorism is fucked up, thats pretty much the conclusion ive gotten too.

   Aren't the Kardashians famous look at how attractive Kim Kardashian is she's so gorgeous. She is so beautiful I think people are jealous cause her booty all natural.  They all have talent why do people say that they don't when they do ?
  ","
  I'm guessing you havent seen the before the Kardashians got famous picture lol cause they werent cute. & kim isnt all natural, she has had so much plastic surgery done. They're famous cause their dad was OJ simpsons lawyer..  Also, if her mom hadnt told her to leak out her sex tape, they wouldn't be that famous. And thats how they got their show.

  Actually thats where you're wrong. Don't act like you have any idea what my life is like.
  
  My biological mom prayed for me every morning and night. She cried and cried for me everyday because she wished she never gave me up. Every year on my birthday, she'd go buy a cake for me and celebrate even though she never saw me. She wrote to me a lot as well, like in a journal. She would never have given me up she literally didnt have too. That wasnt a life for a child.
  
  My mom now, she never wanted kids. Her mom forced her into having kids because thats what you were suppose to do as a women so years before i was even adopted she was starting to realize she never wanted kids, and was slowly drifting away my sibilings. The only reason she took me in was because she was friends with my social worker and they thought it would be a good fit. My mom loves her kids, but she doesnt want to take care of them. And im the only one who she has pictures of around the house lol its my stepdad who doesn't want anything to do with me, my sister, or my brother.

  I was 12 years old and my best friend lived on top of a mountain, and she had a barn at the bottom of the mountain so you had to go around the whole thing to get to the bottom so she had a Gator which is like a golf cart but faster. Well she wanted me to drive and her hill was the steepest fucking hill ever and she wanted me to go down with no breaks for some reason. We were going down and for some reason everything went black, i could hear but i couldnt see anything. I could hear the rocks & her scream. But it was like i was lifted from it and then put back into it. I couldnt comprehend what happened, my jaw hurt really bad cause i smashed it. I should have had my legs cut off but somehow i got lucky. My best friend was flung onto a pile of rocks, if it were a little to left she would have died because i smashed right into a telephone pole and she would have flung into it. And her puppy was very badly hurt, and the puppy went running for help actually. So my best friend helped get me out and she could tell i was in shock, didnt understand what was going on so she said to follow her and find her puppy.. well some reason her puppy ran all the way to my house so we called her mom and told her and to this day her mom says, ""there was an angel there.. you two should have died"" she isnt religious

   When you look at a homeless person, what do you see? Like really see? Cause when I look at a homeless person I see what could be my possible future. How about you?
  ","
  I think everybody who sees a homeless person shouldnt judge them and realize ""that could be me one day, that could be my future"" when i see a homeless person, i dont think of them as panhandling low lives like everyone else, i see them as someone who struggled in life in some way and couldnt rise above it.
  
  I actually talk to homeless people, even the knes talking to someone we cannot see, i always ask, ""whos with you?"" And honestly they would smile so big and start telling the life of someone in their head. It makes them feel better if you dont make them feel crazy.
  
  One of the people ive spoken too told me they were in prison for false charges and when they got out nobody looked at them like they were a person, they will always be a criminal even if they were wrongly convicted.
  
  One was a father, his wife kicked him out, stole all his money, took his kids from him so he fell into a deep depression, started drinking and never got off the streets.
  
  I went to school with kids who lived on the streets, you have never thought because they didnt look like it but they were homeless, they didnt have a home to go to and they took showers in the locker room. They made something of themselves because of it, but people need to realize anyone could be homeless.
  
  My best friend was homeless because he wasnt accepted for being who he was, so he sold his body on the streets to have a bed to sleep in. He had money, he had a home to go to but they didnt welcome someone who was gay.
  
  Don't judge someone for being homeless. Who have no idea what theyve gone through.

  Clearly you cant read because i already explained this. My biological parents didnt throw me in a dumpster and say goodbye, they gave me to a suitable family, being adopted doesnt mean i was abandoned. If i was never adopted, i would have grown up with sibilings, in a tiny piece of shit apartment with a very very ill mother. Because i was adopted, i grew up in a mansion with very well off parents. I dont really see that as abandonment.
  
  The only reason i know all of this is because ive met my biological family and they told me everything, my biomom committed suicide when i was 18 years old.
  
  I gained more from being adopted, so stop trying to make it out to be something horribe when its not. Its a blessing.

  Reminded me of the telly tubbies and how much i hated that show, you had to do some serious drugs to enjoy that show i swear, except the sun didnt have sunglasses.. it was a baby but anyways.

  What in the fuckin hell are you saying

   you are very ignorant because anxiety medication can vary in a lot of ways and it doesn't just get you ""high asf"". also, I think its so fucking rude for you to say ""I don't need drugs to help"". In my opinion, that's a very rude and timid thing for you to stay.
  ","
  My mom worked in the pharmaceutical world lol most of the drugs she sold she wouldnt put into her body, also it takes just some education to know that a lot of times those drugs arent good for you, they might even make you worse and my therapist told me ""if you can get through this without medication, youll be bealthier""
  
  I got offered xanax as one of the drugs, i get high as a motherfucker on those like its bad lol so yes, it would get me high lol i know anxiety meds are different for everyone, but for me i just get high. Dont call me ignorant most of my friends are on anxiety meds and they love it cause they get fucked up.

   growing up, what was your family's attitude towards dinner? (i.e. did someone prepare dinner every night? did you eat around a table? in front of the tv? did you often scrounge something up individually?)
  ","
  We all had different schedules,  so we would try to have a family meal every week because if we didnt, we'd never see anyone lol i never ate my food in front of the tv, i always sat at the table or in my room.
  
  My dad worked 20 hour days (he still does) so he was never around. A good portion of my life i was left at home by myself for 2 - 4 weeks at a time, had to get myself to and from school, but my brother or sister would make me food when they got home. Or my best friend who was across the mountain (we both lived on top of our own mountains) and her mom would make me food all the time cause she knew i rarely had any parents around.
  
  My mom lived in Italy and still does lol
  
  So yeah it was pretty much if i didnt get the whole standard family thing. Everyone was crazy jealous cause i didnt have anyone telling me what to do but i was jealous of them cause i was always alone.

  ","
  This question is phrased really weird so ill try to answer it because ive kinda have had an experience where i was with someone who made me question everything i valued, we really liked each other, like super good chemistry.. he even came back and said he was still in love with me.
  
  I was dating someone who would pick me up right before school started so we would go to his friends house and get completely trashed, and drugged up. I ditched so much school and didnt come home till like 4am.
  
  He was no good for me because he had this way of getting me to be super crazy and adventurous. When i was with him i felt like nothing could go wrong and i did things i never thought id do.
  
  Like he came over at midnight, he took me to a club till 3am which a bunch of my friends were at and some drama went down lol and  i did a bunch of drugs then had to sneak into my house through my window... and i had to work at 11 the next morning.. i didnt do that, i was usually super responsible.
  
  Like lana del reys song ride, is literally how i felt. If i stayed around him i would have probably ended up in jail.

   you think theere are aliens living in the earth? now that is truly absurd. the pressures inside the earth are like 10's of thousnads of atmosphere, there enough to reshape rocks, there are no open spaces inside the earth past a few miles down. it's impossible
  ","
  There's a documentary about it, it was just released in like 2016 lol
  
  I wouldnt be shocked if there were, they are so far more technologically advanced then us, who fuckin knows what they are capable of doing. They can probably do things that we never even imagined lol
  
  We're not superior, theres so much we dont know. The possibility would not shock me.
  "
638289,"
   Also the earth isn't round. it's a conspiracy by the arilines to say it's round. If it's flat the distance between countires is less. But if they say it's round it increases the diastances and they can charge you more.
  ","
  HAHAHAHAHAHAH the earth isnt flat. Why the fuck would every planet be round but earth? How would everything be in rotation? Have you ever looked out on the ocean and watched a boat, you can actually watch it curve..  how would Earth have an axis? People have traveled around the world in a full circle ???
  
  You're right that they dont go in a straight line, but its not because its flat ??? they do it so they can have higher charges on fuel.
