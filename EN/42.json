Depends on where ya mean on this question.. Are ya meaning.. the poor people are the problem? or the fact that no one will help them and put them in a home and feed them and stuff.. Cause honestly.. There is a story for\/with each one and some of them want to be homeless. That's just how some people are. Literally.\n  \n  It's just like going to jail. Once you've done it for so long you adapt to that life.. and can't live like any other way, so people usually just prefer that life that they're living, at the time.. They try to change places and it's a shock to them.\n  \n  South wouldn't exactly say that it's the root of all evil. Either way. Cuz like I said each person \/ family has their own kind of story to it all some of them fall off the edge and lose everything and can't get back up and they have kids to take care of. It's still can be mistaken poor decision-making on their behalf but is understandable because as I said people make mistakes.\n  \n  Some people are poor because they throw everyone out their life and they have nobody. They can't work with people in an environment so the end of not having money to pay for bills or anythin. They got to do what they got to do to get money and live. And a lot of them end up behind bars. Not all of them but some because they don't get along with anyone. That's why they are poor. They just become trouble.\n  \n  Another instance is some parents have enough of their kids and they throw them out because they're not acting correctly or according to their standards. So they throw them out at a young age and they have nowhere to go and some of them become completely homeless. Living on the streets. Trying to work themselves up.\n  \n  Floods. Earthquakes. Not having the right insurances. People getting kidnapped and taken to other areas of their country or other countries and then when they finally escape they have nowhere to go. This is a more rare situation. There are so many ways that people become homeless it's an endless conversation. It's sad...\n  ","45408":"\n  You was probably half asleep\n  ","45409":"\n  Yea definitely not.\n  ","45410":"\n  Yea.

My husband just recently bought me some army boots and they have been doing me great.\n  \n  Sadly I love Converse. Journey Converse, Chuck Taylors, you know... I love those shoes. I always have since I was little. A while back I got some USA designer Converse snd they were just outstanding. I loved the shoes. They were gorgeous.\n  \n  I recently tried to buy them again, the same kind and was not able to find the replica made and found some that were made kind of like them but they were supposed to be All Star Converse. They were the same size as my other ones and for some odd reason I could not adjust to them. They're a little bit better on my feet noow but like.. when I first got them they were just made strange... almost like they ran small. But I have the same size and on my shoes and even one pair of that is one size smaller and fits me fine. But for some odd reason these seemed like they might have been knock-offs. I still use them. They are still really pretty but I wish that I would have maybe return them right after I got them and got my money back because they just did not seem like the regular All Star Converse. But like I said mistakes happen. And plus I got them for a good price.\n  \n  Another good purchase that I got was at a Whole Foods I got a huge salad for only $7 and it consisted of eight different leafy green choices, carrots, strawberries, tofu, cucumber, chicken, egg, celery, and so much more.

It almost makes me want to jump into the story and save her. Makes you nervous and makes you think too much I feel.

Life is precious.\n  ","45582":"\n  Definitely depends.

I let her know that he was more than likely going to cheat on her because I could tell, and not even a while later of dating him, he did cheat on her and I stopped talking to her because everything I kept warning her about she to do the opposite about. She didn't care about herself. She was stealing things from my family and lying. Hygiene was not well and her environment in her house was not cleaned. There was nothing I could do about it.

No nothing.\n  ","45618":"\n  Sadly not everybody knows this and ones that do, still use them. I've been researching Ouija boards for over a decade. Ouija boards cause more than 85% if not 90% of hauntings in the world. Without them the world would be a way better place in the spiritual world. There would be, more than likely, less psychotic killers. Considering if there wasn't so much negative energy on the planet, there wouldn't be so many negative people.

Sometimes they just hurt people and other times they don't. And negative presences can haunt people and places and items. Not every time when you go to the place, no. Usually when you make some sort of communication with them, they will follow you but not every time it just depends. When you play Ouija boards they can attach themselves to you, so you don't want to play them. When you use dowsing rods, they can attach themselves to you. When you do spirit boxes, they can attach themselves to you. When you do the writing paper trick, this is kind of like using the Ouija board. But if even other objects, they can attach themselves. When you seem weak and scared they usually attack those kinds of people. When you make them angry they will also. You don't ever want to anger and challenge a negative presence. When you take certain objects from haunted places sometimes they will follow you because of the objects. Usually when you leave the areas\/places you usually say a prayer. You also tell whatever that is there, to not follow you, that it is not allowed to follow you to your home.\n  ","45642":"\n  O.o\n  ","45643":"\n  Evening and just cause. Long day.

We could also get donuts every morning and watch Disney Channel movies with her and play board games when we got bored. Plus we want to spend time with her while we were there.\n  \n  Another good memory is when we used to go to the food bank (that she started and she fed people for over 30 years) and help feed the poor and give out food to people that did not have anything and supplies.
