of distance . but yeah it was hard dealing with the distance . there s always going to be obstacles . you just always have to be talking back and forth , constant communication is important in any relationship , but especially for a long distance relationship . we would always be video chatting and calling one another and playing video games with each other . and yes , yes we ve had a lot of good experiences on the road in louisiana and mississippi . we met years ago on xbox on gta v randomly and unexpectedly . we played games for a while and right at the beginning we hit it off . we re really good friends and play games for a while and really started to like one another . about six or seven months dating we finally ended up meeting one another . we knew everything about each other s families both of our families liked each other . when we met it felt like any other day . it was awesome ! finally meeting . he s my best friend . always has been . we have been married a little over a year . been living here in mississippi for about a year and a half . we will be celebrating our year anniversary being together april nd . and yes it was really hard being in a long distance relationship . at one point we were away from each other for and a half months i think . that was reeeally hard going through . i always tell people nothings impossible if ya just try and set ya mind to it . patience is definitely one that you have to have with a long distance relationship . it s never going to be easy . it may take two years years years or even five years until you get to be together or longer . you just have to be patient . trust is another one . loyalty . if i could go back and meet him all over again i would . he s always had me at hello . one of my paintings it took me two years to finish . i love this painting . it is for him . meaning him blue and then me redish pink and then us together blue and red making purple in the middle ?","39303":"hey . i am good . i m

want to travel all over the united states of america . he can t really fly much and he doesn t like boats so if i was to visit anywhere outside of the usa i would have to visit alone or with a friend or family member . i hope to visit many places outside of america . but i do love to travel very much . my favorite way to travel is my car . i love her trips . i love visiting different gas stations and seeing some of the things that they sell . i like seeing different pawn shops and antique shops on the way . the landscaping is beautiful . this sky s are awesome . the weather makes it interesting . we also bring my dogs occasionally . so they make the trip really fun and exciting . they have fun also . we like to stop a different rest stops and let them walk around and play with them . i want to one day travel from north carolina all the way to california . that is a straight shot completely across usa . i would like to visit alaska and canada one day . i would like to visit the uk . i would also like to visit australia and many different places within australia . i wish to visit japan , india , malaysia , and so much more . pakistan . bangladesh . brazil . argentina . i want to go to antarctica one day . but i really do love to travel . me and my husband were in a long distance relationship for about five years so we constantly had to travel back and forth from where he lived and where i lived to see each other . so distance and traveling has always been a part of my life . we always did vlogs on the way back and forth . throughout the whole long distance relationship we took videos . alot of them are on my channel too . ?","39311":"keeping alive today .","39312":"? what","39313":"i just watch and hear them . it s not more or less like what they say to me as more of those like why do you have to say that to someone else . i usually don t pay attention to what they say to me i usually just ignore them . . . it s just like other people and how they react to it naturally . . . it s a little upsetting dot dot dot when they do get upset because in the end it s so uncalled for . to have to be so rude and ugly . there s a time and place for things . sometimes it s better to just not say anything . that s what keeps me thinking . why do you have to say that to them . is it really worth it ?","39314":"i go to work hard to go shopping or just to get

.","39321":"i have been studying the paranormal for over years now . it s funny how you mention ouija boards because i have been on this topic for a few years now . learning them and about them . i try to dis promote using them because to of hauntings are caused by them . . they cause nothing but negative energy and ruin people s lives . even in the correct way of using them you re not sure who you re talkin to truthfully . . . if you were talking to something negative and unhuman it can follow you and caused a lot of grief in your life . . . it s very hard to get it away from you once it clings to you . i don t promote using them because they are no joke . they are hard to use also . alot of those negative energies make people go insane and do things that they re not even meaning to do and they turn into really dangerous people . black out . these are things that i have uncovered while studying the board and the people sho have used it before . the cases i have seen are very intense . sad . very scary . things you d never believe that could happen . one of my user names i go by is bella ouija . because i want people to talk to me about the boards so i can tell them these things . because they are all real , the things i say . i have seen it . alot of people are skeptical to it all and that s fine . i just ask for them to respect me and i ll respect them . their thoughts and opinions on it all . this is what i have unravelled from it all in my research .","39322":"jason . my husband .","39323":"aw . thanks","39324":"i liked it a lot . i like your videos and

study and succeed , but at the same time honestly they need to just want to earn it and just do it without being offered money or any kind of reward . when learning , you should just do it because you want to do it . to succeed . and i m not saying don t celebrate in any type of way . . no . . you should celebrate . be proud of yourself . . . but there is just . . like a type of moral that comes along with it . . . like . . if you have no interest in what you re doing and then get offered money and then . all the sudden you are in . . then i feel like you don t want to do what you re doing in the first place . . . ? why not just not do it ? if you re not happy with what you re doing then why do it ? but honestly school s not really going to be the funnest ride the whole time . . . you re going to have your hiccups and frustrations , but still . . you re studying something you re supposed to be soon enjoying . so you should get some sort of of excitement out of it . but for some people

way . i feel that art is a positive in my opinion . though some art can give me different feelings also . art can describe a whole story . to one person it could mean something completely different ,
