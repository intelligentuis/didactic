.","9257":"to reaper s surprise when he wakes up , he s on the couch with a magic iv hooked up to his soul , there s a note on the iv i had a feeling you weren t doing so well on your magic levels , a nagging feeling in my soul , so i might have borrowed an iv . love geno","9258":"daw","9259":"geno clinks reaper s forehead i m glad","9260":"reaper ?","9261":"can t you just erase this place from his

recently he doesn t know reaper knows about it","9274":"true it s probably good geno didn t hear what reaper was thinking","9275":". . . so now what , i actually don t know what to do without some sort of crisis happening . . . probably not healthy","9276":"things you don t share with anyone . . . ?","9277":"i really hope you re right . . .","9278":". . . dammit reaper we re gonna need a different hospital now","9279":"not right now . and i m not in the casts cause i teleported out and threatened you , or have you already forgotten","9280":"geno freezes up realizing he said something about the afterlife , what reaper papyrus said has been haunting him too","9281":"don t . just wait till the doctors say you re ok to leave , better that than you ending up in a hospital again","9282":"my old man already told me about them showing up . they re not mine , my chara moved on to the afterlife , i saw it myself . besides my chara was non binary , this chara is a girl","9283":". . . you re still attached to a bunch of hospital equipment , or had you somehow forgotten that","9284":"do . not . let . geno . find . out . wherearetheknives","9285":"sounds nice , we definitely need it","9286":"geno sighs ok fair enough .","9287":"you re always worried","9288":"yeah , i m feeling a lot better .","9289":"are you feeling any better ? hopefully being on all the various ivs will have helped reaper anyway even if he didn t sleep","9290":"geno has been asleep","9291":"if you could have lunch with one person living or dead who would it be and why ?","9292":"then get some sleep , ok ? geno seems worried","9293":"it s not cute or adorable or anything . . wait did you start stuttering again ?","9294":"https ask . fm dontcallmesans answers did you know this ?","9295":"w what ? ! dammit . no mentioning that to the kids ever , ok ?","9296":"kinda surprisingly geno says nothing about possibly disturbing the hospital equipment like he usually would and instead just carefully lays down where reaper patted the bed sounds like a good idea to be honest","9297":"they had me on an iv for awhile , i m fine . . . mostly , just have a bit of a skullache","9298":"yeah , i did , so don t go and get yourself hurt worse . geno uses psychokinesis to get reaper back in bed","9299":"i don t have any specific question , so you can tell me one thing that doesn t know anyone else","9300":"his eye light flickers back into existence as he turns to look at reaper what on earth are you doing ? do you have any idea how hard the doctors worked to stabilize you ? i may have had to threaten a few lives so they d actually focus on you and not my damn k ! ll wound","9301":"the anons may have been right , geno is definitely not himself right now , he hasn t moved from leaning against the wall , his lone socket dark , yet at the same time he s clearly awake","9302":"just look https ask . fm reapertalepapyrus threads","9303":"welp your brother broke your husband","9304":"geno gently pushes reaper back down onto the bed stay . please .","9305":"well for the moment socket is trapped in hell , and reaper wouldn t know who did any of this anyway since he was still unconscious","9306":"geno just silently complies with reaper s demand using the life flower on himself","9307":"geno s eye opens back up you re awake , thank the stars . . .","9308":"at some point later geno teleports back to reaper s side , not only are his normal injuries looking worse than normal but he has several new knife wounds . he sits down and rests his head near reaper s , blood soaking onto the bed please wake up . . . please . . .","9309":"what you re scared ? he laughs","9310":"you better pull through this","9311":". . . . no thanks . . .","9312":"geno is just silent","9313":"that s fine , i just need to be there","9314":"you don t . trust me i just need the magic iv , i m otherwise in the best condition i can be in . getting m rdered by a human tends to mess you up badly . . . . you don t understand , everyone dusted and i was never there for any of them , not even my brother , i can t not be there for my husband . . .","9315":"he was what ? ! . . . i need to see him . . . please geno went from angry to suddenly hopeless sounding his lone eye light went dark","9316":"just answer the damn question geno is just frustrated","9317":". . . . the person who i came in with , how is he doing geno would have some serious depression spring up","9318":"they better . . .","9319":"of course this sends geno into a full blown panic , though maybe a few days of bedrest at a hospital will do these two good","9320":"geno just teleports them both to a hospital no scaring the doctors , this way we both get help and neither of us has to worry about the other","9321":"stop you re going to dust yourself !","9322":"the smartest thing would probably be to get you to a hospital where they could put you on magic transfusions like they do for raven and i sometimes geno i don t think he knew you needed them . . .","9323":"shit that bad","9324":"ok truth time , how badly hurt are you from life s little tantrum ?","9325":"geno puts a hand on his kill wound remembering how his own fight against frisk ended . . at least you survived . . .","9326":". . . . could chara reap geno if she has your original scythe ?","9327":"do you have any ideas how to cure it ? i know dream can lessen the effects of hatred , but i doubt cross would be happy if we just borrowed him . . .","9328":"and you don t have all the same attacks i do without it . . . but wait , your soul is fully corrupted , that s why it s no longer white ? !","9329":"your brother seems to have suffered some severe memory issue , he has no clue who i am . . .","9330":". . . your brother is asking about your chara , apparently she s been helping him ? . . . i m at a loss as to what to even tell him since i have only ever heard what happened . this is your story . . . . .","9331":"i ll just ask puppetmastersans to yell at hewhocannotfeelcreates for us , he probably is the only one who can knock sense into ink anyway","9332":"when you re healthy enough we re moving out , asgore has offered to let us stay with him since ink still hasn t gotten around to recreating our house . . . bet he forgot","9333":"geno just hugs him","9334":"geno summons a blaster aimed at thegoddessoflife hurt him again and he won t be the only one in pain !","9335":"he can hear us just fine ! i m not falling for it ! she moves dontcallmesans aside and slaps the death god we need to have a talk death !","9336":"can you not hear me ? ! ? !","9337":"some anon had to tell life about well my full condition","9338":"even though reaper clearly should not be bothered , toriel was very upset with him after seeing genos full bone structure , how could he allow himself to even accept help from geno when his bones are in that bad pf shape ! ? she yanks the blanket off of him and the hoodie deeaaathh ! ! wake up ! !","9339":"d don t glare at me like that . . ! this entire situation is your husbands fault ! toriel huffed in anger as she walked after them death ! ! just so you know this isn t over ! we will still settle this !","9340":"go on reaper s page see an ad for mausoleums","9341":"we were talking about how you re going to get some much needed rest","9342":"i think i m worrying the right amount , you should lie back down . he takes reaper back to their room giving thegoddessoflife a bit of a glare since this is her fault","9343":"you re never in good condition if you re stuttering","9344":"don t call me that , you re still stuttering a bit . . . .","9345":"guess no one escapes death forever geno says in a playful manner","9346":"geno just hugs him it s fine love , as long as you re still here with me i don t care how injured i am .","9347":"you are not responsible for geno s injuries . it was frisk who dusted him to begin with which resulted in his original half alive state . if there is any blame to be had , blame the kid","9348":"it is what it is , i mean i spent far more time in this state on the save screen than i ever spent uninjured . and hey think of it as proof i m still alive and here , the dead don t bleed . . . though i bet life would have a panic attack if she saw the condition my ribs and spine are in . . .","9349":"what makes a teen popular in school ?","9350":"you were cold to the touch , i didn t have a blanket so i used what i could . . . though life freaked out when she saw my arms . . . reaper can see geno s arms as well they re in the same state as most of his body , sporting healed fractures and missing mass","9351":"geno finally starts waking back up are you feeling any better ? asgore said he d heal you . . .","9352":"when reaper wakes up , geno is still holding him , protecting him from life s wrath , even though he s completely unconscious , he really wore himself out , reaper also notices geno s hoodie draped over him","9353":"dammit , i can t trust her to heal you , and life flowers don t really work for wounds inflicted by gods . . . geno shares a little magic with reaper hoping to at least get him conscious again","9354":"geno teleports to reaper s side , holding the death god close , it d be impossible for thegoddessoflife to attack him without also hitting geno now","9355":"what is the main reason for you to refuse a date ?","9356":"geno is at reaper s side in an instant , all the anger gone let s get you back to bed ok ? i ll stay with you this time so you don t have to worry about anyone yelling and waking you up","9357":"oh f ck off anons ! geno catches reaper so he doesn t hit the ground","9358":"i was only trying to say you trapped geno in a state of heii think about it hes forever dying in pain thanks to you","9359":"that anon better hope i never figure out who they were","9360":"stop , don t let them provoke you right now , you need to recover . just ignore their bs comments for a little while","9361":"did you know limbo is considered the outermost circle of hell ?","9362":"s sorry . . ! ! i m sharing my magic with him to see if it would help any since . . my normal healing magic wasn t having any affect . . i wasn t counting on him screaming from it wait , did you say allura has a pill to cure this ?","9363":"geno was up in a bolt and by reaper s side , he heard him shout tor what the hell did you do . . . wait this is toxintale s poison . she might be able to get that antidote pill","9364":"however life doesn t really know what else to do i m this situation so she is going to start sharing her magic with him","9365":"oh dear . . this isn t working is it . . ? what is this ? is this the poison . . ? she looks at the black liquid running down his mouth this isn t good . . hold on , we can t disturb geno , he s not fairing any better than you are . . maybe . . i know its risky and may do more harm than good but if i share my magic . .","9366":"toriel then sits beside reaper as she tries to heal him but her magic isn t capable of curing poison . . i hope this works . . i don t think geno would take this well if you were to dust like this","9367":"little do you know that coffee was filled with toxin","9368":"hands you coffee you look like you need it","9369":"you re account name actually . lol","9370":"so you

have to deal with goth apologizing to his siblings , i need to be with him to keep everyone calm","9427":"i am still right here ! ! omg ! !","9428":"considering you got me actually arrested the one time we did that , no , not indulging that fantasy again","9429":"how did you do that ? ! she s shocked are you really a reaper . . ?","9430":"stressed .","9431":"geno is rubbing at his lone temple ,

being able to save anyone","9436":"me in the hospital is a better than you as s pile of dust ! stop fighting me on this , i ll be fine ! yeah not talking him outta it","9437":"toriel actually slaps reaper once seeing he and geno came back before starting to heal him again your a idiot ! why on earth did you take off like that earlier ! ? i said to keep a eye on geno , not disappear with him ! especially in your condition ! what would of happened if you dusted in front of him ! ?","9438":"you ll dust if i don t ! ! geno amps up the amount of magic he s sharing , don t get into it with the determination skele cause he won t back down","9439":"sorry ! ! i just don t know what else to do to help you he tries sharing magic with reaper since his magic levels are back to normal . he looks at life pleadingly","9440":"despite the dangers geno picks up reaper and teleports him back to thegoddessoflife who can hopefully save his ass","9441":"love , are you still dusting , i need to know just how bad the damage is","9442":"what ? ! i admit when i saw everything going to hell i may have said some stupid things but i d never do that , geno rests his forehead against reaper s i love you too much to do that","9443":"is there anything i can do to help you , i mean weren t you still dusting ? ! each one of them is more worried about the other","9444":"w what ? !","9445":"put me down you re in no state to be carrying me right now ! what could she possibly have said that would make you leave while she s trying to save your life","9446":"reaper what on earth are you doing , she was trying to heal you ! !","9447":"i don t mean to alarm you but . . she whispers to reaper so geno doesn t hear her . . you need to keep a eye on geno . . i heard some very worrying news that he might try to .

death what were you thinking ! ? you knew how serious your wounds were and you didn t listen !","9449":"geno s eye goes wide as he teleports to get life and bring her there","9450":"reaper , you re bleeding hatred . . . i m going to get you back to thegoddessoflife","9451":"geno hugs reaper fo that statement no i think he was just being weird","9452":"you need to rest you re seeing things and my cat started licking my computer mouse i m like what ? ?","9453":"geno picks the flower back up and uses it on reaper s wounds well the fact that i save some is saving you right now , i worry about you too","9454":"you are lucky i save half the ones you try to give me geno pulls another life flower from his scarf here","9455":"then i ll stay here , what the hell got into goth , he says you erased palette s memory but even if you did his response to it was way beyond what was necessary","9456":"i think you and geno need to sit the kids down and tell them what s going on with you . you re not doing anyone any favors by hiding this .","9457":"geno is at reaper s side how much worse are the injuries , do you need anything ? it should be very clear geno does not hate reaper","9458":"please do , i can t leave him with ink because that won t help his memory issues any . i hope cross meant it when he said he d be ok with palette being around me","9459":"ok , ok i need to calm down as me panicking helps no one .","9460":"you what ! ? ? ! dream had sensed something wrong with palette","9461":"the smol starts waking up huh what happened , where am i . . . . who am i ? ! ? he seems panicked nice job","9462":"f ck that s so cliche , can t believe that actually happened fortunately the book reaper placed with geno is one he has been reading guess getting some fresh air while i read might not be the best idea . . .","9463":"ngh geno starts waking up what happened , wait what the his glitches vanish for a moment and he pulls an apple out of the melted half of his skull . . . guess some fell on him after all what the hell happened ? ?","9464":"as much as you may want to , do not reap goth for what he did , i don t think geno could handle it","9465":"it gets worse reaper , goth is responsible for all of this . he also reaped silver , who had just been brought back by life , and he slashed sorell before shoving him into the lake knowing he wouldn t know how to swim . . .","9466":"he s already at stone raven s side , both talking to him trying to get an answer from a statue and muttering things to himself from the gen cide run","9467":"and plague told geno what happened to raven , almost immediately his eye light went out again","9468":"it isn t but geno pulls reaper to his feet","9469":"i d like that he s a bit worried about reaper s stutter though","9470":"no , i need to check on the kids , i ve had this nagging worry in my soul over them , like something horrible happened . . . . stars i hope i m wrong","9471":"love , i m fine on magic , i m just a bit shaken , always happens after i have flashbacks . besides remember back at the hospital they had me on a magic iv drip , my magic levels are normal","9472":"not really , but i can keep myself together for everyone s sake so he says but he doesn t know what goth did yet . . .","9473":"it takes a few minutes of comforting before geno s eye light returns what just . . . i flashbacked didn t i . . .","9474":"d don t make me see it again that s all geno manages to mumble out but it should make it pretty clear what s going on","9475":"geno just stares before his eye light suddenly goes out , he s having flashbacks","9476":"not now , you have no idea how worried i ve been , i m glad the life flower did something . right now what i need is to see you make a recovery","9477":"geno takes them back to life s place , and uses one of the life flowers he kept in his scarf on reaper in hopes of easing some of the pain before calling for the goddess herself","9478":"you re back to normal ! ?","9479":". . . . there s only one thing i could do to possibly help , if i reset to before your ma , before all your injuries . . . . i don t know if i d make it to the other side of a reset like that . if i don t i m sorry with a snap geno vanishes to the save screen","9480":"anon magic . . . become a skelly belly again","9481":". . . . it s as if something in him broke and the smaller skeleton just mutely nods agreeing to the doctor s suggestion","9482":"fucking hell he s a god of death he isn t allowed to die so easily ! i can t . . . geno would probably attempt to off himself if something happened to reaper . . .","9483":"damn right i want to hear it he s panicked","9484":"geno presses the emergency call button most hospital rooms have , upon responding reaper is immediately taken for surgery because what else can human doctors really do they don t have magic","9485":"the only good thing is all humanized versions of reaper are taller than geno naturally reaper ! ? ? ! anons wtf did we ever do to you ! ? ? !","9486":"m ! a human reaper","9487":"your really selfish for not thinking about geno your hurt but hes eternally dying you should be taking better care of him","9488":"if that s what you need to feel better","9489":"they can take their opinions and go rot with them , i know you re trying it s just lately it seems like the entire multiverse has had it out for us . i m sure things will calm down eventually and you can go back to overly coddling me geno flashes him a playful smile","9490":"geno overheard the anon and pulls reaper into a hug instead ignore them , they just like causing trouble , heck they re the reason i m even in the hospital right now instead of us both resting at home","9491":"i m guessing you have something to do with why i m still here he holds one of reaper s hands gently , smiling","9492":"geno is awake now someone turned him back to normal","9493":"that s a funny joke nopony is not you either . he isnt real . .","9494":"jinx quartz . she bows and you are skeleton monster ? she stands up","9495":"poor skeleton you look so beat up . . .","9496":"what would you do if humans took geno from you ? i mean he s an undying monster with determination , i m sure there are labs out there with an eye on him . please don t reap me , i ask this question so you are prepared for the possibility . it s a warning not a threat .","9497":"geno takes reaper from weaponhusbando thanking the kid for trying to help and teleports them both directly to life","9498":"very much aw with that he ended up looking for vulgarwaifu as she should still be relatively near by . and she was like his bff so he believed she d know what to do to help . kaineeeeeeee ! i need help ! please !","9499":"geno teleports back after hopefully scaring cross off for good reaper , can you hear me ? dammit this can t be happening","9500":"mhm most certainly he was worried even though he didn t know what the liquid he found was . however he picked death up piggyback style . thankfully he wasn t too heavy . although the blood would stain his white shirt since his jacket is who knows . and thus emil carried him away looking for help","9501":"with emil skittishly crawling on the ground it wasn t long until he felt the blood from under him . however due to having to have a blind fold on he didn t know what it was . m mr reaper ? ! are you alright ? what s going on ?","9502":"emil let out a confused eek noise as he fell off of the bed . luckily he wasn t harmed in the slightest but very much confused and scared w whats . . . w what s going on ? !","9503":"cross teleports in and immediately swings his sword down at death everyone else forgot what you did but i sure as heii didn t ! you reaped dream and got him kidnapped by nightmare ! now your going to pay for that !","9504":"pretty much . exo comes back with the stick dropping it","9505":"geno carefully uses his psychokinesis to separate the two , placing the kid on some nearby pillows so he can hug those while leaving reaper on his lap","9506":"oh well lmao . . . hm ? he murmured as his consciences was fading away . soon to be replaced by the soft and quiet breathing of the sleeping child","9507":". . . . and now there s also a human asleep in my lap . . . . this is beyond awkward","9508":"well screw him , he can deal with it because it s happening and he can t stop me d lmao w well . . . you better the boy seemed to have smiled finally . with his arms still gently wrapped around him . he yawned slightly . which was expected he really tired himself out .","9509":"not that geno would take emil cuddling reaper well right now either reaper , you re staying in bed , if you need something just tell me . yes i m aware of the extreme irony here .","9510":"geno takes reaper s scythe from him just ignore the anon , and rest , please .","9511":"so when death dies does your soul go up or down ?","9512":"yes xd watch emil fall asleep and cuddle reaper like a teddy bear at first he was startled as he was quite surprised but quickly relaxed into his touch . w why shouldn t i be worried ? y . . . you re my friend he was sniffling as he was trying to wipe away his tears","9513":"geno isn t trying to move him yet so he s just petting reaper s skull with a free hand","9514":"geno gives him a slight smile , toriel had been healing him for a long time now , he s no longer on his deathbed right fyi you re the one who has to stay in bed these next few days . geno s gaze flicks away for a moment you barely . . . you barely pulled through","9515":"you can hear me ! ? thank goodness , i m right here love , we re both on our bed and you re resting in my lap . see if you can focus on me talking , please wake up","9516":"y e s lmao emils probably around like ft or smth i . . . i i didn t wa . . . want y you to . . . d d die , mr . . . mr reaper ! he sobbed happy that he was at least alive .","9517":"i don t know what kind of fever induced nightmare you re having , but i d never leave you","9518":"a fever dream yeah","9519":"you re having a nightmare . in the waking world geno is crying praying you ll wake back up","9520":"as if it s happening somewhere far away reaper feels tears falling onto his face please you need to wake up , i need you to be ok . you can t leave me like this that s definitely geno s voice","9521":"well i can probably just possess you if needed , besides at least with that fragment of my soul some of you is free of hatred","9522":"i m not gone , but what would have been the point of still being here if you had died on me . i wouldn t even be able to look after our kids , i d just be too broken","9523":"that i couldn t just let you die in my arms . . . i had to do something , anything . . . geno seems depressed","9524":". . . you aren t going to like it . . . but your soul isn t breaking apart anymore","9525":"emil hasn t had to deal with losing someone for like a thousand years , he let out a tiny gasp . gently propping reaper up and into his lap . his tears which slid out from his blindfold would splash against his skull . r reaper . . . ?","9526":"as a ghost now tied to reaper geno s injuries are gone i m sorry , i couldn t think of anything else that might save you . . . .","9527":"sh ! t , sh ! t , sh ! t what do i even do about this ? ! ? . . . there might . . . there might be something i could do for his soul geno places his hand over his own fragment of a soul","9528":"i m assuming he s unconscious here emil waited a little death . . . ? more silence . he d call out again . the third time . his voice cracks and he starts shaking him . fourth time . he started crying .","9529":"geno moves aside reaper s robe in a near panic so he can see the death god s soul","9530":"ikr well done death hmmm . . . well . . . i have hot chocolate . is that any good ? he tilted his head after getting out a metal flask","9531":"geno s at a loss as to what to do , he shouts for thegoddessoflife afraid to leave reaper s side you have to be alright , you just have to","9532":"w what ? ! ?","9533":"well you re sick right now , love , how badly hurt are you , i need to know","9534":"emil would take of his like fancy jacket and having an idea where death was he placed it on him . coffee ? i m sorry but i ve never heard of it","9535":"i m fine , reaper , since when do you run fevers , and what happened to your eyelight ?","9536":"ikr lol the boy instantly flinched and finally got off of reaper and stopped hugging him right , you re still injured ! sorry ! do you need anything , mr . reaper ?","9537":"arms gently wrap around him i would never be fine without you , love , what s going on , how badly hurt are you","9538":"ikr fun fact this account was originally gonna be a silver the hedgehog account lol because it s like a symbol of friendship i think . . . i m not sure exactly but nier said that s what some people do when they re friends !","9539":"same , then we get sonic in kingdom hearts lol oh they re like pair or more of matching bracelets . and both participants get each other s name on there s !","9540":"you better hope geno doesn t hear you talking like that . .","9541":"sega gets taken over by square enix emil laughed slightly i m gonna make us friendship bracelets !","9542":"if you believe you truly are going to die , you ll need to take geno with you . his soul can t handle such a loss , you d be left with someone unable to die who has no desire to live","9543":"screw sonic hero s we have emil hero s instead lol no is not in my vocabulary in making friends !","9544":"he chases after it . this is a toxintale blaster beast alphy finalized it was orginally toxin tale gaster s first working blaster beast","9545":"ikr lmao when reaper go hatred he s gonna try the the anime super power of friendship trope emil nodded enthusiastically of course ! i never lie or wouldn t be not serious about something like this ! he s too pure to do that .","9546":"? ? ? ? ? ? ?","9547":"pt ! so that won t stop me from wanting to be your friend ! reaper better brace himself for friendship bracelets","9548":"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?","9549":"pt emil was pretty naive . and even for someone like him to someone who actually knew him would be surprised well . . . that s normal right ? even if i don t want to die . . . it s going to happen . and i m friends with someone who wouldn t consider herself to be good either . . . but i think you re both good","9550":"is it morning ? and more importantly are there any catastrophes in progress geno still seems tired , he needs time to recover since he has to restore his dt naturally","9551":"if you could pack up right now and leave , where would you go ?","9552":"wonder what he ll do when he finds out this isnt geno s exo picks up a stick wanting to play with reaper","9553":"can t be one of geno s he can t keep them summoned that long . he d have had to have summoned it before he fell asleep and there s no way he could have managed that","9554":"it grunts tail wagging","9555":"until what time do you sleep during holidays ?","9556":"emil would shake his head . you risked your life for me . something which you didn t have to do . so i m really grateful for that . you didn t do it for any personal gain either so that definitely means you re a good person ! if reaper won t accept his friendship he ll keep trying lmao","9557":"you really think you can hide this from him ?","9558":"when reapers good he gets rewards lol emil nodded as he turned his head to face his . whilst there was no point in it at all he was being polite like always . yea . . . that s why","9559":"the mini gaster blaster beast approaches you curious","9560":"hearing reapers voice thus knowing where he was . at least direction wise . he ran over attempted to hug him . thank you , mr reaper ! i i m sorry you got hurt ! i would of turned him to stone b but in didnt want to risk hurting you","9561":"you should get life to look at your injuries , don t want to worry geno more","9562":"i ll always worry about you because i love you he falls asleep shortly after finishing the sentence","9563":"i was already tired , cross , that d uche i ve had to use a lot of major magic lately . has life looked at your newest injuries ? geno actually lies down on the bed as opposed to just being seated on it sorry guess i m outta energy","9564":"geno explains what has been going on , , but by the end of his explanation it s clear he s exhausted","9565":"love you need to stop geno grabs one of his hands gently you got hurt pretty bad you shouldn t be sharing magic right now , it will just make it harder for you to heal . . . . and you don t remember what happened , why we re staying with life","9566":"we re at life s house , you know where we ve been staying the past few months . i m just tired , i don t have any injuries , well aside from the usual ones , though i definitely need time to recover my magic","9567":"mr reaper ? ! and the blind boy went looking for death . legitimately dragging along vulgarwaifu with him in his search","9568":"geno s been napping off and on since he got them back from the fight with d uche sans oh good you re awake , are you doing any better ?","9569":"what s your favorite pic ?","9570":"that s fine . . . . i really hate that guy","9571":"lets just get back to reapertale","9572":"geno frees reaper from the trap before looking at him with a tired eye so i dunno about you but i need a break again","9573":"hey lemme use vines to h ntai the b ! tch lazyskeleton again first . humiliation and what not","9574":"i m sorry but yea i haven t . maybe i have but i ve probably forgotten them by now","9575":"actually the humans have countless incarnations of death , some of them being even more powerful than you , being able to kill someone with a look or thought .","9576":"i know this because geno hates that song . like how humans hate it s a small world after all .","9577":"he sings spooky scary skeletons and if anyone laughs , groans or is offended , he knows they re a skeleton .","9578":"i see . . . o oh well uhm i met palette and goth and they told me that they were skeletons ! i didn t know you were one too . mr reaper","9579":"it s all right lol well um . . . i have been teleported a lot lately . and i ve met two skeletons because of it . i can t teleport myself . so someone had to be teleporting me","9580":"d dead ? ! b . . . b but i don t want to . . . die ! this must be some sort of mistake . . . i haven t . . . done . . . o or come into contact with anything that s could of killed me ! worriedly he protested the idea . surely he couldn t be dead . he still had to help his friends defeat the shades and help save yonah","9581":"goth is , raven is , shino is , and if you hadn t reaped them silver would be and sorell . just don t say stuff like that in front of them , last thing we need is them repeating some of what you say in front of say dream s kids .","9582":"hello . i m david attenborough , and for today s documentary i am going to show you the stupidicus maximus , which is truly a wonder of our modern day world . the wonder , dear viewers , is how it has survived .","9583":"fine most of the time i do , but not when it s in front of the kids","9584":"no , not in the mood , just been having those damn nightmares again . i swear though some days i need to just hit you with a rolled up newspaper everytime you say something perverted","9585":"did you have to dress up like that in front of goth and raven though ? seriously ?","9586":". . . and here i had blocked this memory out","9587":"do you have a favorite memory ? what is it ?","9588":"what is something is missing in life that was in your life and you love that ?","9589":"you finally have geno crying with joy . good job , reaper . gives you a cookie","9590":"i m crying because i m happy you goof , thank you for saying that","9591":"by his seemingly annoyed tone he held his staff close i i m sorry . i keep appearing places these days and i don t even know myself","9592":"geno never expected to hear reaper say they were in fact equal in strength , he tears up from happiness and buries his head against reaper","9593":"geno rolls back over and hugs reaper for a moment sorry just sometimes it gets to me","9594":"exactly lmao poof . and here we have a smol innocent boy just yknow lost . the perks of being blind","9595":"if all of you are that worried about me i ll just sleep , i can t get in worse condition if i sleep . he rolls to face away from reaper and mumbles the next bit at least asleep no one is looking down on me for my injuries or mortality","9596":"i think i need some space . sometimes being surrounded by gods gets to me .","9597":"he s now annoyed with life for treating him like he s incredibly fragile too reaper i m glad you care , but you shouldn t forgo your own health for perceived issues with mine .","9598":"yeah yeah everyone make sure the fragile mortal is ok first , god forbid something happen to the glass skeleton geno seems bitter . . .","9599":"geno sighs and lies down fine but let life heal you first , i don t have any physical injuries she can heal","9600":"hey compared to you i m the picture of health , i just need to recover my magic , cross never managed to even touch me .","9601":"geno re enters the room sorry i needed some fresh air","9602":"toriel was told about reapers condition from geno and starts healing the death god . . you really shouldn t be so careless when you have a family that needs you . .","9603":"geno notices and is worried about him","9604":"how long do you sleep ?","9605":"nah . i came to see the kids . unlike you they like me . are over the whole stealing geno from you thing ? im more into a special catfish girl than skeletons .","9606":"stay . you re clearly hurting . i ll be right back","9607":"geno just picks reaper up and places him back on the bed i m allowed to be worried about you too . unlike me cross used overwrite on you , i can t imagine you re doing well after that","9608":"who do you most admire in life . . . ?","9609":"it seems like in cases where someone ends up trapped in limbo they re stuck in a state of having whatever wounds k ! lled them . . . so what if someone died of natural causes and ended up in limbo would they be uninjured ?","9610":". . . . they ll see how tall you are love , i get it you re worried , but i know how dangerous getting attacked with your own scythe is for you . besides i m less likely to end up in a pointless argument with raven . . . . you stayed up to keep an eye on me didn t you ? just get a bit of rest","9611":"well that certainly is an interesting answer , do you trust him ?","9612":"i ll get more sleep in a bit , i should just explain to the kids that we re both recovering and to not run off and get into trouble . i can walk around just fine and use my psychokinesis a bit , but i m still a bit too drained to use any other magic geno sits up","9613":"what about dontcallmesans don t you want him to trust you ?","9614":"is it already morning ? glitch skele seems tired still","9615":"daw you have a heart after all , well for geno anyway","9616":"you ve also tried to slice into little bits before . fish glares from under the table understandably i dont trust you .","9617":"ink was there because cross literally grabbed his arm and dragged him along xd","9618":"let make this quick ! socket runs over grabbing reaper s scythe that s on the floor he strikes him with his own blade","9619":"ink left tired of being dragged into cross fight and is going to look for dream on his own and i m pretty sure that stupid overwrite doesn t work on me like everyone else","9620":"i won t get hurt , but they sure as hell will geno s eye is ablazein red and blue fury","9621":"yeah , but considering it s v i think i should even the odds geno snaps and all three of his blaster beasts appear , rumbling at crossingoutnames","9622":"geno teleports to reaper s side reaper , can you hear me , how bad did the hatred get ?","9623":"the smol quite literally got dragged along for the ride yikes , i think retreat is the smarter option here ! ink paints a line on the ground and pulls crossingoutnames through it","9624":"how can he summon chains if he s paralyzed ? cross uses his blaster to take the hit from reapers while he tries breaking the chains again but he was having some trouble with it this time . . f ck ! ! ink ! ! hewhocannotfeelcreates get me out of this ! !","9625":"cross uses his sword to break free from the chains and quickly blocks reapers scythe with it i don t give a damn ! i will use everything i can to bring you down ! even if it means relying on that damn kid ! chara then appears and presses the overwrite switch which makes reaper become paralyzed","9626":"damn it xd cross blocks with his sword before having a blaster fire from directly behind both of them , hitting both reaper and himself , he didn t seem to care about any of the damage he just took you think you can beat me ! ? all i have to do is use the overwrite and your done ! !","9627":"cross teleports to reapee and right away fires all of his blasters your so f cking dead ! ! !","9628":"you re really lucky to have dontcallmesans","9629":"not possible , dream can t be gone , i visited haventale on my way over and everyone is just as happy and at peace as they always are . positive emotion still exists , dream still exists . maybe you hurt him badly but he s not gone . i know it","9630":"what happened to dream ? ! ? ink actually seems panicked","9631":"what do you mean ? you ve successfully confused geno","9632":"gone , not that reaper can do anything to nightmare anyways","9633":"cross is going to m rder you","9634":"perhaps you should mercy geno now before the multiverse falls apart , while he still loves you . compared to the chaos that s coming , reaping him would be the merciful action","9635":"mind out of the gutter , this is a serious problem . . . besides it would reveal how tall you really are","9636":"not now that i ate dream s apple . thanks reapers peepers !","9637":"if the whole multiverse doesn t come crashing down on our heads i m getting one of those child harnesses for you","9638":"dream is dead ? ! ! ?","9639":"now you have bigger problems , nightmare stole the last golden apple , now it s not possible to revive dream anyway","9640":"dream had collapsed , his hands slowly turning into dust . . . yeah you really f cked up","9641":"i d ! ed once and was trapped in the underworld for two years you dont scare me !","9642":"reaper accidentally caught dream with his scythe , the smol had been visiting loserskeleton","9643":"reaper i m invisible bullies emil emil bandage falls off reaper haha ! turns to stone sh ! t lmao","9644":"suddenly a hatchet hits reaper from behind pick on someone else bully !","9645":"great lmao well here s the thing tho . emil is pretty much has medusa eyes so if the bandage blindfold covering his eyes doesn t anymore . and makes eye contact with reaper . whoops","9646":"is reaper gonna bully the pure boy ?","9647":"cheater ! the psychotic bear laughs at reaper sadistically","9648":"not again ! fish hides","9649":"i dont fear you . lol that s not true he gets freaked out when reaper acts like a maniac trying to dice him into fish sticks","9650":"my scans indicate that you re a bit of a hypocrite about height , y know !","9651":"no , that s more my students sort of thing .","9652":"daw your tsundere admitted he misses spending time with you https ask . fm dontcallmesans answers","9653":"what s wrong with being fish ? he folds his fins","9654":"sorry had volunteer stuff . . . . well by your standards i suppose you are","9655":"what is your relationship status ? ?","9656":"aw come you couldnt kelp yourself . i wont say if dont . winks lol","9657":"you re not happy to sea me ?","9658":"would you rather tell your parents the truth or lie to your best friend ?","9659":"depends on if you can behave yourself for the rest of the date","9660":"even k ! ll him if that s what he truly wanted ?","9661":"what do you mean ? geno is now confused , and choosing to ignore his other comment","9662":"i m just going to order you a burger , geno leans across the table and clinks reaper s cheek i do love you , even if you ve done some pretty terrible things . but we re working on that .","9663":"given how much you love geno would you do anything for him ?","9664":"pfft you managed to get him smiling not now reaper , i meant something off the menu , geno places a hand on his head and shakes it smiling what am i supposed to do with you","9665":"hey reaper !","9666":"i don t think anyone here would attack me . . . but can we just try and act like a normal couple for a little while , anything in particular you want ?","9667":"heeeeeeeeeey ! nice color scheme !","9668":"this causes geno to freeze up can . . . can we not talk about that ? let s just try and enjoy ourselves without starting fights for once . . . ok ? geno s eye has a far away look","9669":"i ll keep him in line grillbz , come on lets sit at a booth before you end up in a pointless fight . geno speaks more quietly remember these people are my friends , they aren t going to hurt me anyway so there s no need to scare them","9670":"tori do i need to get the rolling pin ?","9671":"instead death needs coffee breaks","9672":"geno facepalms my husband , i don t take him out often , and i m sure you can figure out why . reaper seriously ? first thing you say when we get in is a threat ?","9673":"geno chuckles slightly no threatening to reap grillby either , he s still an old friend of mine","9674":"how about grillby s , as long as you think you won t make another scene again","9675":"i m not supposed to be here either , remember . silver is in limbo like i am and sorell is a reaper like you and goth and shouldn t have ended up in the underworld to begin with .","9676":"he dodges similar to a sans ah ! scythe talking to ya but i better go he runs for his life","9677":"instead geno grabs reaper s hand and teleports them to the surface we don t need more reasons for horror to hate you .","9678":"can we just agree you won t try reaping people while holding me","9679":"how bout we go to the surface and do something for our date before you manage to put your foot in your mouth geno is smiling as he says this but it s true reaper does do that . . . a lot","9680":"holy crap geno has to duck suddenly from reaper swinging his scythe like that","9681":"when was the last time you kissed someone ?","9682":"are you done being crazy ?","9683":"so ? even death needs a break once in a while . in an alternate universe , reaper would probably be clinging to swap right now lol","9684":"that would be my business , not yours .","9685":"maybe i shouldn t have to help you , but i want to help you . no one can handle everything on their own","9686":"i only just got here i wanted to ask miss life something . . . .","9687":"geno smiles weakly yeah i think i d like that , let me just ask life to look after sorell while we re out . yes sorell is staying . reaper remember we re partners , if you ever need help with anything just tell me .","9688":"agreed , geno needs more happiness in his life , he s always blaming himself for everything that goes wrong","9689":"reaper , seriously though you need to stop trying to get rid of our kids . please , they mean as much to me as my papyrus did . i don t want to let family dust again geno s actually teared up , thinking back on before he was geno is still hard","9690":"you have an opportunity to make one person absolutely happy , but not yourself . who","9691":"you when it comes to geno https youtu . be tbrxzguq k","9692":"i m perfectly fine , and i m still mad at you , but at the same time i miss spending time together tsundere blushes red","9693":"geno said he needed help with his kids , you of all people have seen firsthand what i do to people who hurt berry and so poof . here i am . oh and i bought you some starbucks since you look like you need a break . awww","9694":"it took a few hours but geno is back completely unscathed , he has everiastingsorrow with him and places the kid in one of the beds in the kids room so he can rest before coming over to talk to reaper again did you still want to go on that date . . .","9695":"nice hoodie , pal . casual skele is here","9696":"after an anon told geno where sorell was he vanished to go get the kid","9697":"because i m pretty ticked with you right now","9698":"and if i say i don t want to spend time together ?","9699":"you mean the same place both he and silver died ! ?","9700":"death sometimes i swear . . . you can t even share me with our own kids ? !","9701":"a hand tightly grips his shoulder what the fuck did you do to sorell ? reaper has a knack for pissing people up","9702":"d ad ! ? d ad . . i know d ad i was d ad old man . . i was eaten alive by a monster in horrortale . but now i m back . we both got a second chance we both deserve our best shots at living again !","9703":"no but it aint cool throwing kids through portals .","9704":"hey ! he gets hit by a rock","9705":"actually what would you do if geno just walked out on you one day","9706":"one of these times geno is gonna just walk out on you , and frankly he should","9707":". . . then i ll remind him myself , and you can t reap me , you ve already tried . like i said memory wiping won t save your ass anymore","9708":"hey death figured you might need someone to spell this out for you , but it s clear if you erase geno s memory of silver and sorell that anons will remind him about them . memory wiping won t save your ass anymore","9709":"geno sicced epic on you . . . and if you remember the fight you two had several months ago , this could end very badly","9710":"it s who he is . . . if you really do love him , then let him be himself .","9711":". . . geno has always put the health and welfare of his family first , you out of anyone should know that","9712":"i think meeting his dead son might have broken geno . . . .","9713":"god forbid geno have anyone else in his life that he cares about","9714":"the point of a family is to take care of each other and help each other . you re missing the point .","9715":"hello !","9716":"geno seems to mouth the names , then shakes his head no the names don t feel familiar at all , whatever you did when you erased my memories of them has really stuck . . . .","9717":"if you ever bothered to actually act like a parent as opposed to me having to do everything then i wouldn t end up in trouble trying to take care of them normally geno would have sounded angry or at least frustrated , but right now he sounds just . . . empty","9718":". . . fine . . . all of his earlier anger is gone , replaced by what seems like a void of hopelessness","9719":"geno is just staring at the blood and dust eye wide , he doesn t acknowledge reaper talking to him . . . actually it s not clear if geno even heard him or not","9720":"you did what was easiest for you to handle . because going to the save screen isn t using magic but using his determination geno does vanish to the save screen with a snap of his fingers . . . but when he gets there their kids aren t there","9721":"geno is just glaring at reaper death get the hell away from me .","9722":"why do any of it ? ! ? i get it you re protective of me to a degree you do stupid sh ! t but how did any of that help ! all you did was make me lose even more family","9723":"so you left them in the same half alive state i spent an eternity on the save screen as ? ?","9724":"does the how i know really matter ? you do realize you also just admitted that you did in fact reap of our kids and leave the remaining three near dusting","9725":"we ll just pretend it got answered","9726":"uhm did you delete that ask ?","9727":"do you have a pet ? share its photo !","9728":"geno just shoves reaper away for the moment","9729":"yeah geno really doesn t seem happy with you today . . .","9730":"who is left to bother me ? geno is not happy with reaper , he knows about their other kids and what reaper did to the kids they have","9731":"whom have you hugged today ?","9732":"really you re suggesting that right now ? when i m clearly not happy with you ? ! geno pulls a pillow over his head","9733":"cough losing geno cough","9734":"you know who i mean","9735":"shakes your hand deal !","9736":"guess we ll see . . . can i at least know the name of the two you reaped that i have no memory of geno looks away from reaper for this question","9737":"when were you truly scared of smth ? tell in details","9738":"geno called you death , not reaper ?","9739":"well it s definitely sealed all my attacks and my teleporting but i m also just having more trouble getting around in general","9740":"geno opens his eye and looks up at reaper i m really tired death , ever since my magic got sealed i ve had trouble just living , guess my soul s condition is finally getting to me","9741":"reaper s noticed since geno s magic was sealed he s actually seemed frail spending a fair amount of time asleep","9742":"no , just no . besides wouldn t it be harder to protect me on the surface ? playing the safety card","9743":"couldn t you just carry me like you do over half the time anyway , besides i m fairly sure life doesn t want you teleporting off with one of her beds","9744":"that really won t work you know","9745":"i thought you were afraid to let me out of bed","9746":"cease your evils , threat to the multiverse , or you will be forced to endure my full power for what very well may be the first and last time !","9747":"geno refuses to turn and face reaper again","9748":". . . . geno looks down with his lone eye , he doesn t really have a choice , without his magic he s helpless , he rolls over and faces away from reaper though","9749":"you can t leave geno s side though , you ve made it so he can t defend himself , if someone like cross wanted revenge while you were off fighting error nothing would stop him","9750":"where are they staying , can i at least see them , make sure they re ok ? in the antivoid i suffered through countless visions of losing all of you , please i need to know they re not true","9751":"reaper , you have officially killed geno more than he ever could on his own . well besides error murdering him in empiretale . . .","9752":". . . what happened to our kids ? geno feels even more powerless than he did on the save screen","9753":"enter ! i swear my accent messes things up ! picks

move reaper to the other side of the bed , despite the height difference reaper is actually heavier than geno since geno is missing at least half his bone mass","9832":"geno wasn t expecting reaper to suddenly collapse like that so he wasn t braced to support him , meaning reaper knocked them both over onto the bed","9833":"geno moves to sit on the bed to at least get reaper sitting

to show signs of recovery soon , geno has been thinking of pulling an x chara cross and fusing his soul with yours to strengthen you , , even if he would be a literal ghost at that point . so don t do anything stupid so geno doesn t do something stupid in his efforts to save you","9857":"geno just sighs and sits in a coomfortable chair in the corner of the room if you re so injured you can t even put your robe back on , i don t feel comfortable doing anything , i don t want you ending up hurt worse","9858":". . . reaper why haven t you put your robe back on , you re all but hiding under the

no idea what the hell just happened","9863":"geno is just giving the vocaloid a shocked look as well , he uses his psychokinesis to remove universalvocaloid from the room so reaper can get redressed without anyone aside from geno seeing","9864":"i was worried about you , you just fainted in the middle of a sentence","9865":"uni yanks off reapers robe just to see if his soul looked like genos","9866":"good you re awake geno is very good at hiding pain , he s going to ask goth for a life flower when he gets the chance until then he s keeping the fracture secret","9867":"geno s keeping that hidden from reaper , and is hoping reaper doesn t realize what exactly geno did","9868":"universalvocaloid might be shocked when geno s one ninth of a soul lights up as he begins transferring magic to reaper , not the action of some scary zombie please , you need to wake back up","9869":"reaper , you can t be summoning your scythe right now . please , stop using your magic .","9870":"ah !

determination can only do so much","9878":"geno gives him a sad look . . . we both know that isn t really true . . .","9879":"i can sit on the edge of your bed but i can t lay down with you , i d get in the way of the hospital equipment geno indicates the dual soul ivs reaper has","9880":"something you said made me think of something , why geno ended up with you , you re right most people fear death , but when you met him geno had already accepted his death he merely had a mission to complete first , so unlike everyone else he wasn t afraid of you","9881":"well no i didn t because i stayed awake to keep an eye on you . . . i was too worried about you to sleep and i mean i technically don t need to sleep anymore , looking after someone i love is worth losing a night of sleep","9882":"you actually got a decent night s sleep for the first time in awhile , none of the nightmares you ve been having lately","9883":"well they ran a bunch of tests on me and when they came back with me having no vital signs they were quick to latch onto any explanation . i just figure it s better they don t figure out who you are , it s never gone over well other times you ve seen doctors .","9884":"yeah , i don t know where we d even go though , but no vacation until you re at least able to be out of bed without needing emergency care right afterwards . oh heads up i lied to the doctors and said i m a vengeful spirit so they wouldn t figure out you re death and then be too afraid to help you","9885":"your a god yes but your not indestructible i think you and geno just need to work together when a problem appears","9886":"we ve just been having a rough time since your gaster stole your magic , i don t think you ever fully recovered from it before more trouble started happening","9887":"your head was all but falling off your shoulders , you definitely needed it more","9888":". . . geno pulls a life flower out of his scarf , it was one reaper had given him before that he didn t use and uses it on the cleaver wound","9889":"i m sure you will , but if anyone bothers you , let s just say they are going to have more than just a bad time","9890":"geno squeezes reaper s hand to try and reassure him it s gonna be fine , i ll be at your side as much as i can","9891":"hey love , you look like death right now . please , don t leave bed again , i can handle dealing with the trouble our kids find for a little while . but please , just stay here and let the doctors patch you up , it hurts my soul seeing you like this . geno s sat down on the edge of reaper s bed","9892":"yes , i need

kill me","9898":"basically , i m still able to interact with the world of the living though .","9899":"when all of geno s reports show he has no vital signs he explains that he s in a state of limbo , though he claims he was unable to move on due to a grudge against the one who did this to him so they don t flip out about reaper","9900":". . . . yup same old same old","9901":"geno got him back to

the living room and kitchen . . okay ?","9255":"reaper however didn t know that , he actually began panicking and started calling out for geno love . . ! ? love ! !","9256":"lol okay reaper sighed okay . . as long as you don t say anything about this place . . you can stay . . and you can only go in the living room and the kitchen , that s it . . the rest of the house is off limits . . he chuckled a bit so anyway , you actually liked being chased by the grim reaper ? you have some problems kiddo","9257":"reaper rubbed his eye sockets as he looked around , he noticed the iv hooked to his soul and noticed the note hanging off the iv , he pulls down the note and reads it love . . he sighed but he was smiling i better go find my tsundere . . i hope he didn t go exploring the house . . oh sh t ! am i on the couch ! ? reaper quickly moves off the couch but why was he freaked out about that ? it makes no sense . . why doesn t he want anyone to look around the house ? there must be a

happen but none of the gods want to risk it","9266":"you mean that cat ? i m guessing that s why you decided to hide in my hood reaper just sighed . . just don t go telling this everyone . . but let s just say the reason i act so crazy sometimes is because . . i have some kind of illness . . a few people already found out about it when i tried keeping it secret . . so i might as well just say it . . i m normally like this when it doesn t act up reaper chuckled a bit you sure you don t want me trying to reap you ? i thought you were having fun","9267":"i don t know . . reaper wasn t happy about hearing any of this either but would geno be happier if he was at lifes ? he couldn t help but question it now . . . . . . you wouldn t get to see me , sorell or goth anymore but the other kiddos

is oddly nice right now ?","9269":". . reaper sighed love . .","9270":"reaper was startled , how did fish even get there ! ? was he secretly following him ? well he could of hid in reapers robe w what

that bothered you at the hospital . . you didn t tell me what it was . . i have a idea what it might of been about but . .","9275":"reaper just shakes his skull how about i remind you then ? before that anon decided to give me poisoned coffee we were spending time together he wraps a arm around geno before heading towards that house they were at . . reaper despised the place but he figured it s probably safer to talk inside than outside though he tensed up once they were inside f ck it . . there s really no other safe place to go . . it s either i put up with this place or be out in the open and risk geno getting hurt again . . he thought to himself we could sit in here and just talk ? nobody would bother us here","9276":". . why would i tell you about the things i keep to myself ? reaper folded his arms you don t need to know anything about me . .","9277":"now who worries too much ? reaper chuckled a bit before setting geno down if you need anything , i can take care of you myself","9278":"don t worry love , i don t think we need a hospital now , your all better now and i m doing fine now reaper then begins taking off all his hospital equipment , before getting up to his feet and scooping geno up in his arms and teleporting back to that secret house they were staying at","9279":"reaper summons his scythe just to scare the doctor further r i won t reap him then but . . he turns to the doctor you put my love into those casts again , you ll have a date with death ! i m the grim reaper dr i havent forgot but i thought we were past that wait what ! ? ! ? your the real grim reaper ! ? ! ? and we helped you ! ? omg ! ! aaahhh ! ! ! the doctor runs out the room screaming","9280":"love . . ? reaper gave a worried look hey , you okay . . ?","9281":"mod fell asleep on

protectively","9283":". . i forgot . . it s called he wasn t really paying attention but i should be fine if i take them off . . i think reaper then sets geno down on the bed before sitting beside him so he can take off the hospital equipment but is that really a good idea ?","9284":"holy sh t there s a chara now ! ? problem is . . geno is right with reaper , he might overhear this","9285":"reaper then gets up to his feet and scoops geno up in his arms , wait should he really be doing that ? what about all the equipment hes hooked to ? you wanna go now ? i m feeling better and your doing better now","9286":"reaper then lays against geno hey . . after this , do you wanna go back on vacation ? nobody aside from the anons , could reach that place we were at . . and i know now i can t be taking coffee from them anymore","9287":"can you blame me ? reaper chuckled a bit it s hard not to worry about the one you love , your always worried too","9288":"reaper then nuzzled him though something seemed off and it wasn t just because reaper was tired . . he didn t forget what the anon showed him his brother said . . but he was unsure if he should bring it up you had me worried .

out he s going after him regardless , nothing will be able to stop the death god even in the current condition he s in , he would try taking socket out with him","9306":"reaper was relieved seeing

be bad . .","9310":"reaper doesn t respond or move in the slightest . . it doesn t seem like he heard you but hopefully he does pull through this . . maybe geno can get some sort of response out of him ?","9311":"the doctor hands geno a candy bar anyway before leaving , they felt bad for him","9312":"the doctor was a bit worried and sets geno at reapers bedside dr before i go . . do you want like a candy bar or something ? it might cheer you up","9313":"the doctor didn t agree with this but they cant say no after hearing everyone else geno knew dusted , they help him into a wheelchair , hooking the iv stand on the back before wheeling him to reapers room where they see the god of death laying in bed with a lot more than just a iv hooked to him , he looked bad dr we re trying to keep him from dusting . . but if he doesnt wake up . . i m sorry . .","9314":"dr that s what all your injuries are from ! ? you were attacked by a human like us ! ? we can t just let you go like that !

have to move","9315":"aw . . c dr i know your worried but we cant let you see him until your better . . which . . might take a while . . how do we fix melted bones . . ? ?","9316":"the doctor

should worry more about yourself right now , i don t even know how your walking ! ! all your bones look melted !","9318":"i m going to guess if they don t , geno is going to have a episode like reaper did lol meanwhile they help geno as best as they can , hooking him up to a magic iv and literally covering him in bandages like he was a mummy and putting both his arms and legs into casts , the doctors always freak out whenever they see him dr you should be okay for now . .","9319":"they could use it thanks to genos panicking , he caught the doctors attention and they both get taken to separate rooms to be helped . . but he had a good reason to panic , there was dust trickling down reapers robe when one of the doctors picked him up and took him away , did he really just dust himself from sharing magic ! ? maybe the doctors can save him , he isn t gone yet","9320":"though reaper falls over on the ground not long after geno said that , on the plus side he won t be scaring the

be fi w wait . . what ! ? he definitely didn t know that , despite how bad he s doing right now , he actually starts sharing what magic he has with geno","9323":". . reaper slowly nodded , he didn t want geno to know but he cant hide the fact he s been doing poorly . . i don t have m much . . magic left . . after it . . but don t s share yours . . okay ? it isn t . . that bad . . he says that but . . that s why he s been having so much trouble , lifes magic damaged his when she shared hers with him and her attacks definitely didn t help , she might be on genos bad side for a bit","9324":"reaper then froze , he didn t really want to answer geno . . but what he doesn t know is his silence alone might be enough to let geno know it s pretty severe . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

point . . . . ngh . . . l love . . ? he was disoriented enough he confused life for geno","9339":"reaper didn t seem to hear life though , once geno laid him down , the death god was out like a light . . but you can tell he clearly wasn t doing well since not too long after that he started coughing and he still had genos hoodie covering him like a blanket along with a actual blanket on top","9340":"that s too perfect lol","9341":". . w what . . ? ? . . i can b barely hear you . . are y you okay love ? m maybe . . you should rest a bit . . that s not good , he needs to lay down though i have a feeling life might have to deal with a angry geno though since this was both hers and the anons fault","9342":". . reaper ends up having to almost be carried into their room , he could barely hold himself up . . huff i i . . d damn . . it . . i feel . . like ink . . i forgot huff . . . what we were just . . talking about . .","9343":"i m f fine . . y you worry too much love . . though after speaking he was completely out of breath and started panting , like he just ran a marathon , that definitely wasn t fine . .","9344":"w why not . . ? your a adorable like a b bunny he winks d dont worry about it . . i i ll be a alright love . . just . . need some more r rest is all . .","9345":"he chuckled a bit well you didn t and i m glad y you didn t reaper holds one of genos hands it would be deathly silent w without my glitch bunny","9346":"aw reaper was actually blushing bright blue hearing geno say that and he hugged him back with one arm same goes for me , i love you love . . w who would of thought you d e end up with the grim reaper ? bet you never thought death would be your shield","9347":"w well . . . that s true but . . i didn t help much . . reaper sighed the kid put him in this condition yeah . . b but . . they also got him off the s save screen . . where he was healed . . me and geno still saw eachother after that . . and i put him in limbo . . causing him to go back to b being injured . . . . sometimes i wonder if i made the r right choice . . it s just . . i m immortal . . and he isn t . . he would leave me one day . . . . i put him in limbo to avoid it . . i don t want to lose him . . . . but by doing that . . he has to deal with being i injured all the time . .","9348":"well , that s o one way to l look at it , it s t true though . . your still l living . . for the most part reaper then lays his skull against geno . . i just w wish i could of . . helped you somehow . . i made it so you c cant die but . . you went back to being injured like this . . don t show life your ribs or s spine . . she might rip mine off for it . . he chuckled a bit","9349":"heii if i know . . i never went to school . . does he even know what a school is ?","9350":"i . . thanks love . . reaper frowned , he knew about genos arms since . . well , he s gotten geno to change his clothes a few times but he still didn t like it . . . . s sorry . . . . . i d didnt think you would s still be hurt like that in limbo . . .","9351":"reaper gave a smile up at geno . . a l little . . i m getting t there . . b but are you okay love . . ? and . . thanks for . . w well . . he nods down at genos hoodie which was still covering him though the fact geno had done that really surprised him , he was still blushing over it but if he didn t have something covering him right now he would be freezing . . it s really odd he was so cold . . was he close to falling down ? it s a good thing geno shared that little bit of magic when he did , that was probably what kept him from falling down","9352":"reaper winced as he finally started to wake up . . n ngh . . l love . . . . ? though he noticed geno was sound asleep and . . holding him even in his sleep , but his hoodie was missing . . reaper then noticed it was actually covering him like a blanket which really surprised the death god , he couldn t help but blush , geno was really that worried about him","9353":". . . luckily it was just enough to get him concious . . he opens his eyes though . . his lone eyelight looks faded and kind of glossy but should geno be sharing magic right now ? even if it s just a little bit . . . .","9354":". . n ngh . . reaper just lays in genos arms , he didn t appear to be concious now and his robe now had holes from toriels flames which had bl d seeping through . . . since toriel and reaper are the exact opposite of eachother , their magic is very dangerous against eachother , meaning they could easily dust eachother if they were to fight","9355":"i m taken","9356":"aw . . l love . . reaper then falls into geno as soon as he tried to move further ugh . . !","9357":"aw reaper lays in genos arms , oddly he felt really cold . . i think the anons should leave him alone for a while . .","9358":". . reaper was about to swing his scythe at the anon again but he collapses before he can . .","9359":"reaper lays his skull against genos . . we can b both . . kick t their a if . . we f find . . out . . .","9360":"reaper sighed before laying back down beside geno , at least he listened . . s so . . much . . for our . . v vacation . . . . . never . . t thought . . it d . . get . . r ruined . . by coffee . .","9361":". . . . reaper dispite everything , summons his scythe and swings it at you","9362":"reaper now had tears streaming down his skull as he laid his skull on dontcallmesans lap","9363":"reaper lays his skull on genos lap as he gripped his robe while continuing to scream , he was in unbelievable pain ah ! !","9364":"but as soon as she does , the death god let s out a scream g geno ! !","9365":"reaper grips his robe as he continued hacking , if life shares magic with him , he will definitely d e , hopefully she doesn t . . .","9366":". . reaper starts hacking while toriel tried to cure him and a black liquid spews from his mouth . . it wasn t his hatred though . . this liquid looked very similar to alluras toxin . . ngh . . ! ! g geno . . !","9367":". . i knew something would happen , well f ck","9368":"huh . . thanks i guess . . . kinda weird to have a anon thats friendly . . or anyone that s friendly towards the grim reaper . . he takes the coffee","9369":"your not allowed to break the th wall ! that s cheating ! i break the th wall all the time though mod . . the only reason you get away with it is because you can k ll me and they can t . . ? . . . f ck . . nevermind","9370":"what was your first clue ? the long black robe or all the talk about reaping and death ?","9371":"good point . . i have reaping jobs for that timeline but the heii if i m ever doing them . . that timeline is bad enough to keep even death away !","9372":"huh ? that s true . . but . . reaper sighed . . i m so used to being the god of death . . i dunno how it would be if i wasn t anymore . . would geno even see me the same . . ?","9373":"dontcallmesans","9374":"that s just great . . so if i ever have to reap anyone in your timeline i could get eaten . . kinda glad i haven t had any jobs there yet . . geno would probably force reaper to stay home if he ever had to go there","9375":". . . what the f ck kind of timeline are you from . . ! ?","9376":"wait what . . ? ? you have to eat humans or you turn into literal monsters ?","9377":"your right on that , i haven t heard of your timeline but guessing by the name . . it isn t a good one . .","9378":"reaper just laughs i don t think that would be a good idea , i d keep all the coffee to myself . . on second thought . . reaper no !","9379":". . getting away from being the grim reaper . . . i almost had that freedom thanks to gaster . . but i don t know what else to do if i ever stopped being the god of death . . i was made just for that reason . . to be the god of death . . to reap souls whether i wanted to or not . . and all i ve known was that . . reaping and k lling . . no matter how much i hated it . . i got used to it over time . . so when i almost had that freedom of not being a god anymore . . i panicked . . it was all i ve known for all these years . . even though i wanted that freedom for so long . . i don t know what to do if i wasn t a god . . i don t think i would have a purpose anymore","9380":"reaper chuckled a bit at the pun ha , you wish you looked as good as me anyway who are you and how did you even end up at deaths door ?","9381":"does geno count as a dessert ?","9382":"dontcallmesans","9383":". . . my love knows how to cook but . . me ? not so much . .","9384":"reaper sighs alright . . i ll just stay here . . i don t mind being next to my adorable tsundere , and i can protect you by being right here he winks","9385":"i . . . i can try . . i mean i will , don t worry love . . though that didn t sound very encouraging","9386":". . . f ck you anon ! !","9387":"true , and i m happy i met my adorable tsundere reaper nuzzles him before blushing slightly over hearing geno was worried about him you were worried about me ? love , you shouldn t have to worry , i m the god of death remember ? i ll always be okay , i m more worried about you . . you should lay down for a bit","9388":"reaper just nuzzles geno i would of done something like that myself if you hadn t already , but don t overdo it on magic this time . . okay love ? we don t need you on your deathbed . . . . sorry about you being trapped on the save screen . . but hey , you aren t there anymore","9389":"he . . did ? reaper just clinks dontcallmesans skull i m so proud my tsundere has a dark side","9390":"days . . ! ? sh t . . i was hurt worse than i thought . . reaper sighed sorry i left you on your own that long . . but love . . don t worry about my hatred . . i got it back under control . . i think . . i can t remember what happened . . .","9391":"hey love . . how long was i out ? reaper then pulls geno down on top of him and hugs his tsundere you look de d tired . . maybe you should lay down a while","9392":"why not ? speaking of dates . . i think we need another one","9393":"reaper is now p ssed , he teleports to the d uche","9394":"dontcallmesans","9395":". . . reaper takes out his scythe and swings it at you i ll k ll you first . . !","9396":"reaper tries to respond to geno but all he does is let out a pained groan instead , he can t really talk at the moment even though he wants to , he hated having geno so worried but honestly given he almost dusted the other day and now is literally about to be blown to bits , how can he not be worried ?","9397":"aw c reaper lays his skull against genos shoulder , which isnt helping genos worry , he doesnt respond and his eyes were shut tight as his bones were shaking slightly , all signaling he was in pain","9398":"i m no ngh ! reaper had suddenly winced as he laid in genos arms , going silent . . .","9399":"well sh t , maybe reaper shouldn t have threatened to kick s a reaper winced as he held onto dontcallmesans","9400":"reaper blinks , i m assuming this is geno just anon by accident lol he blushed bright blue suddenly being picked up by geno like that l love . . ! hey ! ! i m supposed to carry you not the opposite !","9401":"what do you mean cure me ! ? love , i m fine and we don t need the kiddos ! you can tell reaper is clearly not himself i m gonna go kick right in his a ! i m the god of death ! he can t just make me explode !","9402":"you didn t even hear what i was planning to do yet . . i was thinking we sneak out of here and take that vacation . . teleport another version of ourselves here while they aren t paying attention and leave how could that possibly end badly . .","9403":"maybe not . . i have a idea . . oh great . . his ideas usually aren t good ideas","9404":"do you want me to have reaper message your page then ? lol","9405":"and you mean nothing to me ! mod facepalms but since we clearly don t give a sh t about eachother . . how about we call this meeting done and we go our separate ways ?","9406":"i didn t know someone bossed error around . . well sh t . . . . . is it too late for us to take that vacation now ?","9407":"what ? at this moment reaper knew , he f cked up","9408":"? ? reaper has no idea who that is","9409":"coming from the skeleton that looks like he belongs in micheal jacksons thriller . . reaper isn t taking any of this seriously","9410":"and you look like your on weed ! who the f ck are you ? pinocchios brother ?","9411":"they re the reason you even need rest in the first place . . reaper muttered slightly to himself if it wasn t for them you d be fine right now . . . . i m dusting goth and sorell when they come back . .","9412":"how am i the reason ! ? it s their fault ! they have to go !","9413":"but love . . i m protecting you from them . . ! they have to leave you

it . . . doesn t matter , you need to lay down okay love ? he reaches for shinos bow to take out of genos hand","9417":"sh t . . reaper teleports beside geno once noticing he was staring at the dust on the ground and puts him right back in bed love , it s not what you think . . that dust isn t from any of the kiddos . .","9418":"wait ! ! he burned down starbucks ! ! though reaper pauses when geno whispers that to him . . . fine . . okay . . i ll stop . . for you . . but i m destroying undernovela again later . .","9419":"because it s true , your my adorable tsundere","9420":". . . you know ,

dress up as a maid , you would look so cute in a dress mod facepalms","9429":"reaper just gave a grin yep , the one and only , at least here , i reap souls and send them to the underworld , you could be next","9430":"we could still take that vacation . . or have some alone time first since we re both doing better he winks we could even pretend to be a cop and prisoner again maybe that s not a good idea , reaper went overboard with it last time , even putting out wanted posters of geno","9431":"reaper got up and hugged geno from behind , he didn t catch his murmuring though . . hey , what s wrong love ?","9432":". . i i ll try . . thanks love . . reaper smiled a bit over at geno","9433":". . i am the dark . . you should be afraid of me . .","9434":"i have a few ideas in

had to tell him . . . . reaper clearly didn t want to but he rolls down his sleeve to show geno he still had dust falling from his wounds . . his arm was partially gone . . . s sorry . . . .

i stayed u up or not . . death . . never sleeps . .","9611":"o of course i trust him . . just not myself . .","9612":"love . . you just stay in bed . . i can h handle it . . reaper then stumbles out of bed , he himself was tired especially having been slashed by his own scythe but he was far more concerned about geno i can handle more than y you can . . if your that worried . . i can t talk to the kiddos for you . .","9613":". . . . . . . reaper was oddly silent and didn t respond to your question . . judging by his silence . . it seemed like he didn t want geno to trust him . . but why ?","9614":". . y yeah . . morning love . . hey , for once you didn t have any nightmares . . m maybe i scared them off . . he winks . . you s still look tired . . maybe you should get some more sleep . .","9615":"reaper then looked away from you s shut up . .","9616":"that s a good thing , you aren t supposed to trust death kid , maybe you should go back to the ocean","9617":"poor ink xd just drag the poor smol into crap","9618":"reaper was shocked , he didn t expect socket to show up and does end up getting hit by his own scythe f ck ! ! i thought we got rid of you ! ! geno , run ! ! dontcallmesans reaper then summoned magic imbued chains after he tells geno to run and tries pinning socket down with them","9619":"i hope not . . . . reaper sighed , he didn t understand why ink was even there to begin with but all he knew was he felt completely useless like this damn it . .","9620":"reaper summoned red magic imbued chains to block geno so any attacks made at him would hit the chains instead , reaper may not be able to freely move but he s still going to make sure geno was safe your not alone in this love . . i m right here with you","9621":"w wait , love . . ! reaper was now worried about geno getting in the middle of this and tried to get up in order to take him away from the fight but he was still paralyzed damn it . . i can t move . . ! love , you need to go ! i don t want you getting hurt !","9622":"l love . . ? reaper looks up at geno , luckily his hatred didn t get to that point yet where he couldn t recognize geno but he was currently paralyzed thanks to cross using the overwrite and couldn t get up which wasn t helping . . i i ll be fine . . . . just hearing that kids voice again . . are you okay . . ?","9623":"that s probably for the best , otherwise this would have gone badly . .","9624":"because reaper doesn t need to move to use his blaster or chains , reaper unlike most sans , can t summon bones , instead he uses chains , his scythe and one blaster , which most of the time he doesn t use his blaster , not because he doesn t want to but it s just too difficult for him to use , when he uses his blaster most the time it will misfire , that s why he only uses it when he feels he has to now your going to get ink involved ? that s a bit unfair don t you think ? at least let me free so i can have a more fair fight . .","9625":"reaper was shocked he was suddenly paralyzed . . but that doesn t mean you stopped him from attacking , more chains appear and wrap around cross , this time they were glowing red meaning reapers hatred was starting to take over , his hatred makes his attacks more powerful but the more it takes over . . the less control he has over it . . the chains pin cross down as a blaster fires at him","9626":"reaper had used his wings to quickly shield himself from the blast how about instead of using the kid as your backup , you actually fight me one on one ? or are you too afraid of death ? he summoned blue magic imbued chains that wrap around cross and pull him towards the ground , giving reaper the chance to slash him with his scythe","9627":"reapee ? lol reaper was caught off guard and does end up being hit by the blasters but that isn t enough to take him down . . knew i would have to deal with you sooner or later . . but you forget , i m the god of death , if anyones going to die here , it would be you . . reaper then summoned his scythe and charges at cross , swinging his scythe at him","9628":"that much i know . . i really am lucky . .","9629":". . are you sure ? o saw him dust , ink and nightmare had his apple and ate it . . the positive emotions dream had could be just taking a while to fade away . . meaning it isn t gone just yet . . but will be . .","9630":". . i accidentally reaped him . . nightmare ate his golden apple afterwards and basically . . . the entire multiverse is now going to be destroyed . . you won t exist , i won t exist and neither will error . . if nightmare goes through with his plan . . none of us will be here . . and we both know there s no way he s passing up a chance like this . . reaper didn t seem worried but instead seemed very depressed . .","9631":"i mean . . do you want to stay with me . . ? even if i destroyed the multiverse and it falls apart . . would you still want to be here with me . . or would you rather i . . . reap you . . ? reaper had to choke out the last part of that sentence . . was he crying ?","9632":"reaper would have still tried to anyway","9633":"we have bigger problems than cross . . reaper then turned away from geno as he pulled down his hood to completely cover his face so all your able to see is his mouth . . . . . love . . i know this isn t really the best time for this . . but . . . . be honest with me . . even if it s a answer that might p ss me off . . i have to know . . do you . . want to be here . . ?","9634":"reaper then takes his scythe and immediately slashes you with it , he clearly didn t like anything you had said but he did wonder if you were right . . if the multiverse does really collapse and all timelines start being destroyed . . . . maybe reaping geno to spare of him of those events would be a better option . . but if geno were to be reaped , that would be it , he wouldn t be able to come back since unlike everyone else , he has no timeline to come back to . . but if reaper believes the entire multiverse is ending and everyone will cease to exist anyway . . he might consider it . .","9635":"nevermind then . . but don t worry love , i m working on solving it , just have to kick nightmares a then it ll all be back to normal ! what . . ?","9636":"what ! ? ! ? at this moment reaper knew , he royally f cked up reaper then summoned his scythe and swings it at nightmare , he might f ck things up even more","9637":"maybe if we were to use that harness to have some fun together i wouldn t mind seriously ! ?","9638":"i can explain ! i was trying to reap loserskeleton since he was supposed to be dead a while ago , he s been on my list for a while but dream took the hit instead . . so . . yeah . . i accidentally k lled dream . . but i can still fix this !","9639":". . f ck . . you just single handedly destroyed the entire multiverse . . good job reaper i can still fix this . . i m the god of death . . i know i can . . how ? . . i haven t figured that out yet . . .","9640":"oh sh t . . uh . . i can fix this , i just need to call in a favor from life and it ll be fine ! if half the multiverse don t k ll you for this first","9641":"who do you think put you in the underworld in the first place kiddo ? you really wanna go back ? i can arrange that , reaper then swings his scythe at rora","9642":"f ck ! ! at this moment reaper knew , he f cked up . . again , cross if he gets online anytime soon , is going to murder reaper along with half the multiverse","9643":"lol that will probably happen xd reaper hey , you wanna see a magic trick oh right your blind ! emil . . i can see just fine . . rips off bandages , reaper turns to stone reaper well f ck . . .","9644":"reaper did not expect that and turns around to see what the heii just hit him . . . you have a death wish kiddo ? didn t your parents teach you not to play with death ?","9645":"lol this is going to go so well then xd reaper more than likely will be a d uche to emil so i can imagine what will happen","9646":"probably lol reaper isn t very nice to many people unless your geno","9647":"whos more crazy ? psycho yandere or psychotic bear lol how do you know i m not really this tall ? reaper pouts , someone doesn t want to admit they re short shut up mod before i reap you ! !","9648":"i knew you were afraid of me reaper laughs and puts away his scythe it s supposed to be that way , if nobody feared death , i d be out of a job","9649":"oh really ? reaper raises his scythe just to scare poor fish lol","9650":"reaper is triggered lol all you have to do is mention height or make short jokes hey ! ! ! i m not a hypocrite on height ! ! i m taller than you pal ! ! reaper floats up so he appears taller than monokuma lol","9651":"your students . . ? your a teacher ? no offense but you don t look like a teacher . .","9652":"i know , isn t he adorable ?","9653":"nothing . . unless your the grim reaper . . i m not supposed to have friends kid . . reaper frowned . . nobody would fear me if i did . .","9654":"that s okay i fell asleep on accident reaper then nuzzled geno that still counts as behaving , doesn t it ?","9655":"happily married","9656":"reaper folded his arms despite the fact he found the puns funny . . . i would be a laughing stock to the other gods if they saw me joking with a fish . . you better not say anything about this to anyone . .","9657":"reaper ends up laughing at the pun but he was upset with himself afterwards . . he didn t want anyone to view him as nice so even though he has nothing against fish now , he still didn t want to be friendly towards him damn it . . i have a reputation to keep , i m the grim reaper . . remember ? i m not supposed to be joking around with a goldfish . .","9658":"how about we talk about how adorable geno is instead ?","9659":"i m behaving so far , aren t i ? besides the fact you threatened to k ll grillby","9660":". . . . . reapers eye had disappeared as he summons his scythe and instantly reaps you with it by slashing you","9661":"reaper realized he had let that slip and quickly tries changing the subject n nothing , its nothing love , so after we eat , can i have you for dessert ? seriously . . he has his mind in the gutter . .","9662":"a geno burger ? i wouldn t mind eating you , if you get what i mean reaper omg your in a restaurant ! the death god went silent for a moment and turned bright blue from geno clinking his cheek would it help at all if i told you not all my actions were my own ?","9663":"you know i would","9664":"kiss me and tell me you love me ? reaper winks but okay then , are strawberries on the menu ? i wouldn t mind having a strawberry tsundere","9665":"oh great , its you . . reaper rolls his eye , aw come on , be nice to the fish","9666":"well , there is one thing i want and hes standing right in front of me reaper , seriously ?","9667":"are you being sarcastic ? reaper raises a nonexistent eyebrow","9668":"reaper then pulled geno into a hug once seeing he was really bothered by what reaper said s sorry love . . i didn t mean to upset you . . just i worry about you and as long as nobody tries hurting you , i won t need to fight . .","9669":"but love . . reapers voice had suddenly shifted into a more serious tone . . we both know from experience just because someone says they re your friend doesn t mean it s true . . your frisk said they were your friend and k lled you love . . i m just looking out for you . .","9670":"reaper sweats a bit lol unless it s for baking then no . .","9671":"reaper ends up laughing hey , who can resist starbucks ?","9672":"r but love , if everyone is afraid of me they ll be too scared to do anything to you g . . so this is your husband ? is he going to be a problem ? r i ll only be a problem if you cause any problems for geno","9673":"alright , fine . . i won t threaten to reap him . . reaper sighed , you have a feeling he will still make a scene somehow since his social skills are zero g hello geno , right ? i m still not used to calling you that . . who s your friend ? r your worst nightmare ! reaper ! ! no , bad","9674":"reaper blushed bright blue at the mention of that embarrassing incident and silently takes genos hand , teleporting them to grillbys , at least he won t be chasing a goldfish this time if he does make another scene lol . . don t bring that up . . . i ll behave this time . .","9675":". . i guess you have a point . . reaper sighed sorry love . . . i ll let them go . . for now . . until one of those kids do something to you . . anyway , now about our date , any place you wanna go ?","9676":"rora is very lucky geno took reaper away from the kiddo and teleported the death god away to the surface with him otherwise rora would be rora toast","9677":"but love . . that kids on my list . . him , silver and sorell are already dead . . they aren t supposed to be here . .","9678":"sorry about that love . . i won t do that anymore . . reaper sighed","9679":"reaper blushed slightly , he was a little embarrassed because it is true , it won t be long before he manages to p ss someone off or get into trouble , actually i think he s already done that by trying to reap rora . . l lets just go on our date . . after i reap this kiddo first","9680":"oh sh t ! s sorry love ! ! reaper , you need to be more careful , your still holding geno i can solve that he then sets geno down beside him sorry . .","9681":"today","9682":"hm . . . not yet reaper then takes his scythe and swings it at rora , omg reaper ! ! what ? him , silver and sorell are already dead , they have to go !","9683":"i can see him doing that if swap refused to give him that starbucks lol reaper just laughs kid , death never sleeps , meaning i don t ever take breaks but . . thanks for the coffee . .","9684":". . huh , didn t think you would say that , you aren t wrong but thats just not the response i was expecting . .","9685":"reaper then clinks geno on the cheek thanks love but if they re a god , they should be able to . . i used to handle everything on my own before i met you . .","9686":"huh . . ask her about what ? reaper was curious since he doesn t really see dream talk to her very much","9687":"fine . . . reaper then frowned and looked away from geno for a moment and . . i know but . . i m a god love . . i should be able to handle more than this . . you shouldn t be having to help me at all . . a anyways , about that date . . what do you wanna do love ?","9688":"reaper was startled by seeing dream so suddenly appear and falls on his back lol , good job death when did you get here . . ! ? but it s true , he does blame himself for stuff that s out of his control . .","9689":"love . . reaper then hugged geno close , he hated seeing him cry . . i m sorry love . . i really can t help it . . i have this voice in my head that . . tells me i need to get rid of them in order to protect you . . . i can try harder to fight it off . . but . . reaper then paused in the middle of his sentence and quickly changed the subject since he wasn t sure he should be telling geno any of this anyway , how about that date ? that ll cheer you up , i know you love the surface and this time i won t need to strap you to a bed and drag you with me","9690":"if i could i would make dontcallmesans happy , if anyone deserves it , it would be him","9691":"aw shut up ! lol you mad cause you know it s true shut up mod ! !","9692":"aw , admit , you can t stay mad at me long reaper then scooped geno up in his arms i can tell since your a strawberry again love , no matter what , you love me","9693":"reaper seemed really confused and even tilts his skull slightly from his confusion , why was swap being nice to him ? he does know reaper is the god of death . . right ? i can understand you wanting to help geno and getting him something but why me ? you do know i m the literal grim reaper . . right ? i can dust you just by poking you . .","9694":"first . . are you okay love ? your not still mad at me , are you ? reaper them went behind geno and nuzzled his tsundere","9695":"reaper just raises a nonexistent eyebrow your underswap papyrus . . aren t you ? why the heii are you here on deaths doorstep ?","9696":"damn it . . reaper sighed i hate when he disappears like this . .","9697":"aw , is my tsundere is a little angry ? reaper then nuzzled geno i know what ll make you feel better , how about we go on a trip to the surface ? you can visit grillbys , i know you like visiting him and having a couple burgers","9698":"why wouldn t you want to spend time with me love ?","9699":"relax love , i ll take him out of there before he dies this time . . yeah like that s encouraging . . right now , i want us to spend some time together","9700":"is it a bad thing i love you that much i want you all to myself ? reaper then wraps his arms around geno relax love , i ll get the kiddo out of underfell after i spend some time with you first he sent sorell back to underfell . . the same place where the kiddo died with his brother , good job reaper","9701":"it was at this moment , reaper knew . . he f cked up he looked back at his tsundere who is clearly angry calm down love , i just sent the kiddo away for a bit . . we need some alone time together too he winks","9702":"reaper is going to reap poor rora now that he knows this kiddo died before too , though reaper was responsible for silver and sorells deaths and now he s going to be responsible for roras , allura and horror are going to be very angry skeleparents reaper then grabs rora by the scruff of his shirt and flings him into a portal along with sorell you know i m the grim reaper kiddo , it s my job to make sure whoever dies stays dead and if your telling me the truth here , your times already been up . . but i ll tell you what kiddo , if you really want another chance at life , you can try living in underfell , let s see how long you last there","9703":"reaper rolls his eye listen kiddo , that kid everiastingsorrow needs to go , he s not supposed to be here , i k lled him before , he needs to stay dead . . parent of the year award goes to . . shut up mod !","9704":"reaper looked really annoyed as the rock bounces off his skull . . who the heii thought it was a good idea to throw a rock at death ? you have a death wish kid ?","9705":". . he wouldn t leave me . . reaper is a yandere don t forget , he won t accept the possibility of geno actually leaving him and may do some things that are a bit crazy . .","9706":"reaper takes his scythe and slashes you with it how about you stay out of my marriage ?","9707":". . he doesn t need those kiddos , if you were smart , you d let me get rid of them . . .","9708":". . says you ! i ll k ll all the anons if i have to but i m erasing his memories later on ! he doesn t need to know about those brats !","9709":"geno wouldn t of done that , he loves me you did k ll of your own children and put the remaining in comas . . geno is probably p ssed and he has every reason to be","9710":". . i do love him and thats why i get worried about him . . i know he cares about others but he needs to see he s in worse shape !","9711":"doesn t mean he should . . he s in the worst shape out of everyone in this family !","9712":"reaper is definitely going to try k lling silver again over this but first he s going to go get someone to help geno","9713":"he doesn t need anybody else ! reaper then swings his scythe in order to reap you , someone is angry","9714":"reaper just kept his gaze away from both you and geno , truthfully . . with the way he was raised and the fact hes never had emotion before , he didn t know that s what family is about . . even if his hatred wasn t affecting most of his actions , he wouldn t know how to be around his kids , he didn t even know how to act around his own brother or even with geno","9715":"who the heii are you ?","9716":"that s a good thing , means you won t remember them after this . . at least one of the things i erased finally stayed erased reaper chuckled a bit you named silver well silver because when he was alive , he had silver colored eyes and you thought it fit him , he doesn t have that anymore now since i reaped him and sorell you came up with by combining not just our names but fells too since he was still your adopted brother at the time and you wanted him to feel part of the family . . i erased all your memory of them right after you named them and sent them off . . and i m going to do it again here in a minute . .","9717":"love , i did try to parent them . . by dumping them in underfell , you even dumped goth there a few times , good thing geno doesn t remember that i don t think we were ready to have that many kiddos , it s better off they re gone , now we can just focus on eachother without having to worry about anyone else , your upset right now but i know you ll forget all about this later and we ll go back to cuddling","9718":". . reaper was now worried , geno went from angry to upset in just a matter of seconds . . if geno had his magic functioning again though i think he would have strangled reaper for this the death god then proceeds to take geno back home and lays him back down in bed . . love , i know you don t like this . . but i m just doing what i can to protect you . . those kiddos got you into more danger than anyone else . .","9719":"love . . ? reaper walks up beside geno and scoops him up in his arms we should get you back home . . come on , i ll get you back to bed . .","9720":"geno might think the kids somehow dusted given how much bl d and dust is now scattered across the floor on the save screen . . yeesh , that s going to end badly . . love . . ! ? how in the wait ! reaper then teleports right after geno love ! you shouldn t be here right now ! i don t even know how you still managed to get to the save screen but you should get back to bed !","9721":"but love , i did that to protect you , we couldn t handle any kids before we had goth , we weren t ready for it and the we do have now , cause enough heii for us , we can barely handle them let alone more ! i did what was best for us . .","9722":"love , listen to me , it was for the best . . the first needed to go , they came along before we even had goth . . we weren t ready for it . . i know i couldn t deal with kids , so i sent them away like i did with raven and erased your memory . . but they unlike raven , didn t survive underfell and i ended up reaping them . . reaper omg i tried getting rid of raven , goth and shino for now so you can recover without anyone bothering you . . we don t need those brats causing you to get hurt . .","9723":"mod leaves the building , this is going to get ugly , your on your own reaper ! i . . well . . . reaper sweats a bit and nervously rubs his skull , he knew this all sounded preeettyy bad well , good news is as long as they stay there , they ll be fine . . i knew you wouldn t be happy if i flat out reaped them like i did the other . .","9724":"f ck . . listen , love , i know this looks bad but there s a good reason for why i reaped the other . . and i was going to leave the other on the save screen so they aren t dead . . but by that statement , that means . . raven , goth and shino might dust if moved from the save screen , they would need healed immediately if they were taken out of there , much like geno when he first left . . yikes . . that would really p ss off geno","9725":"works for me , so basically geno called reaper out for reaping a couple of their kids and leaving the remaining kids left to dust","9726":"no , i was just about to say i think ask just ate it . .","9727":"did i mention he is adorable ?","9728":"love . . ? ? reaper was shocked hey , hey , what s the matter love ? you playing hard to get again ? you know it s impossible to resist me","9729":"he ll be fine , he always gets mad at me for something but he gets over it and we make up","9730":"me reaper then goes under genos pillow and nuzzles him , he wasn t sure if geno knew what went on with their children or not but even if he did , that wouldn t stop reaper from coddling him nobody is brave enough to mess with death , so of course nobody will bother you while i m here","9731":"just this adorable skeleton dontcallmesans you know , he s really adorable when he s angry","9732":"love , hey , come on . . love , i know you aren t happy i sealed your powers bit i did it so i could protect you and its worked so far , your safe and sound in bed , nobodys bothered you either now have they ?","9733":"you want me to reap you ! ? someone is triggered","9734":"i i really don t love . . how about once your feeling better , we have some alone time ? he winks but seriously reaper ?","9735":"reaper was already off soon after he shook bill s hand , he really was in a hurry to get geno some help and without further ado , reapers scythe glows and he traps glitterymermaid in limbo by tapping her with his glowing scythe without giving her a chance to even realize what was going on","9736":"w what ? reaper was really surprised by that , he can t mean the kids he reaped so long ago . . can he ? didn t he erase genos memory ? how did he even know about them ? maybe he means someone else though that question really made reaper nervous . . w who are you talking about love ?","9737":"smth ? ? i don t know know what the heii your talking about but i ll let you know i m not scared of anything . . i m the grim reaper , it would take a heii of a lot for anything to scare me !","9738":"i noticed , he s mad at me for sealing away his powers but i had to in order to protect him","9739":"sorry love , reaper nuzzles geno maybe it s only temporary since your not used to not teleporting to get around . .","9740":"it shouldn t be doing that . . i thought having your magic sealed would help your soul , you just won t be using any to fight or teleport . . it shouldn t be hurting you . . reaper frowned","9741":". . love ? reaper was now worried and slightly shakes geno to see if he was okay hey , love , wake up . . you okay ?","9742":"i could just k ll everyone on the surface . . reaper no why not ? he would be safe and free to do anything he wanted and i don t mind k lling every human and monster there , it would be quick if i used my death touch you can t just do that ! . . . i bet geno wouldn t mind if i k lled everyone there","9743":"i normally would but . . you nearly had every bone on you broken into pieces , i don t really want to risk hurting you so for now , carrying you is out of the question and i don t think life will mind if i bring it back in one piece , i can t have any fun with you while your like thsi love reaper is going to embarrass the heii out of geno if he does this","9744":"how won t it work ? it s not like we ll be going in a restaurant , unless you really want to , then i might have to put you in something smaller . . i was thinking of going to watch the sunset that wouldn t be embarrassing to be trapped in a bed outside watching the sunset lol","9745":"who said you were leaving the bed ? wait . . your not seriously thinking of teleporting geno with the bed to the surface , that would be one heii of a scene","9746":"reaper rolls his eye and immediately slams the door in gasters face get out of here old man before i kick your a","9747":"love . . come on , i know you aren t happy about this but it s the best way to protect you . . we could go on a date to make you feel better , i know you love seeing the surface","9748":"love . . come on , don t be like that , you know as much as i do how hard using magic is on your soul , i did this to protect you from hurting yourself . . reaper then sits right beside him on the bed","9749":"who said i would leave geno here unprotected ? thegoddessoflife can help protect him along with me , i wouldn t leave him by himself unlike cross who leaves dream in danger . . . but i ll destroy error later , i m going to spend some time with geno first","9750":"love . . when your all better you can see them but right now , you shouldn t . . trust me , they re fine . . your the one who isn t okay right now , you nearly had all your bones broken when i found you , your not leaving this bed until i know for sure you wont break into pieces as soon as you get up . .","9751":"i haven t done anything besides protect him and . . error did what ! ? i m going to k ll him !","9752":"don t worry about them love , they re staying somewhere safe , away from us , so me and you can have a break away from them reaper then clinks geno on the cheek , though the glitched skele was clearly not happy you ll be safer like this , trust me","9753":"i can do that , so no destroying the castle , got it reaper winks as he goes inside , searching for the monocle she wanted him to take , this happened before geno woke up","9754":"i didn t cripple you love , i just made it so you can t do anything dangerous , from now on , you ll just have to rely on me to help you with certain things , i m sure your eyesight will return and if it doesn t , i ll be your eyes","9755":"reaper was trying to k ll his own kids so leaving them with a psychotic robot wouldn t bother him at all how the heii did you get here ? and if you really want the brats you can have them , if they leave the save screen they should d e anyway so you won t have to deal with them for long","9756":"relax love , it s for your own safety , you should get some more rest . . i ll be here to protect you and if you need anything , i m right here to get it for you , i don t want you hurting yourself by using magic so i did what i thought was best","9757":"hey , calm down love , it ll be alright . . reaper nuzzles his tsundere it s only temporary since i sealed your magic , it can still power your soul and basic things like that but if you try teleporting or fighting , you can t do that anymore , you ll have to rely on me from now on","9758":"you want me to destroy the castle ? i can do that after i get that monocle for you","9759":"reapers never seen antifairy world before or has ever seen fairies until now for that matter , he takes a quick glance around to see the area looks almost as dark as reapertale . . except not as dead and filled with fairies . . so wheres this castle at ?","9760":"nevermind , make that reasons , i ll do it but since i ve never heard of your world , you might have to take us there","9761":"so you really do have someone you care about ? that s shocking . . i thought you were bluffing . . i ll help but you better heal geno after this and you won t be allowed to do anything harmful to him afterwards . . deal ?","9762":"that explains , so you want to get back at him by stealing his monocle , i figured he had to be the boss since it sounds like a easy job , there s no other reason why you couldn t do it yourself","9763":"that changes things when you mention geno , now reaper is interested in helping you . . as much as i hate you right now , i know your powerful enough to help geno . . whose the person you want me to save ?","9764":"just a monocle ? that doesn t seem too hard , i m gonna guess the reason you can t do it is cause whoever that is , is your boss , am i right ?","9765":"depends on what you want kiddo , just don t expect me to have everything under the sun , i m the grim reaper , not a department store he winks , as long as she doesn t appear to be a threat towards geno , he won t have a reason to disrespect her","9766":"there , all of the kiddos are knocked out and out of our way , now to find someone capable of sealing away his powers . .","9767":"reaper was a little startled but once he saw the smol he had then grabbed shino up by her scarf and teleports them both to the save screen before slamming her into the ground sorry kiddo but i m not letting you kids bother him anymore","9768":"he better not bring any a holes with him . .","9769":". . that would be a different story . . but i don t think he s going to help with that . .","9770":". . don t think i ve forgotten you insulted geno and attacked me with a shotgun . . i m passing on your little deal . . reaper then swings his scythe at bill","9771":"i m not releasing these chains until you undo whatever that was that froze me . . i m not to be messed with either kiddo . .","9772":"so what if i did ? you see what just are doing to geno can you imagine ! ? i did what was best for us , why do you think i sent raven away ?","9773":"does it look like i give a damn ? those kids are part of why he s like this ! he may love them but they re k lling him ! i have to do whats best to keep him safe ! i killed kiddos before and i don t mind adding more to that list !","9774":"reaper then drops gothofdeaths and deathreaps as he takes off to go get geno i ll deal with them after i rescue geno . .","9775":"you should be far more afraid of my wrath ! ! i choose whether or not you live or die ! i m the actual grim reaper ! demons die at some point , so do humans and so do monsters . . who do you think is responsible for that ? me ! red magic imbued chains spring from the ground and wrap around flug , dragging her to the ground now undo this or so help me . . you will die . .","9776":"what the f ck ! ? reaper didn t expect that and does get stunned , falling down to the ground . . you do realize you just attacked the grim reaper ! ! i will send you to the underworld ! !","9777":". . reaper immediately swings his scythe at the human with the bag over his head f ck off ! !","9778":"hey ! ! ! lol you just got roasted i m going to klll them ! ! reaper takes out his scythe and slashes the anon while the mod laughs at him","9779":"i just thought of this . . if she grants reaper wishes . . this may or may not freak everyone out lol well those names i m used to , reaper chuckled slightly i think you already know me , who doesn t know the grim reaper ? but your a bringer of bad luck huh ? i have a few people in mind i wouldn t mind giving bad luck to . .","9780":"but they aren t in the void ! damn it . . reaper has no idea geno went to the underworld and is going to try getting in the antivoid but that might not go well","9781":"who the f ck are you ? by the way , god of death isn t supposed to be peachy reaper gave a glare towards the fairy that just appeared , he s not going to like that fact she can t die","9782":"love ! ? what the heii are you doing ! ? reaper wraps red magic imbued chains around geno in order to stop him and pull him over to him","9783":"reaper rolls his eye and fires his blaster at error if i say or do anything to you , it s only to you , not to my geno , you aren t him and you never will be , future or not","9784":"love . . ! ? reaper sighed and teleports right after geno to the save screen since that s usually where geno goes when he vanishes","9785":"i didn t send them to the void love . . i sent them to the underworld . . so we don t have to worry about that happening . . besides only i can access the underworld , nobody else here can and i m pretty sure we could use a break away from the kiddos so . . i m not going to go get them just yet he lied about all of that but he isnt going to tell anyone the truth","9786":"reaper now looks confused love , you need to stop using so much magic , i m not the one you should be worried about right now , let me carry you . . he scoops geno back up in his arms and continues to carry him back to their bedroom we could forget about all of this and have some fun when you feel better","9787":"funny thing is , i thought we already were in heii , why else would you be here ? wow","9788":"geno wouldn t fight me , he loves me he knows i m just protecting him , the kids were putting him in danger . . so i corrected it , they won t be bothering him now . . and if they still do , they ll get a nice visit to the underworld . .","9789":"so what ? even if it is , you still need to rest love , come on . . reaper then scoops geno up in his arms and carries him back to the bedroom i have everything under control , you didn t need to do anything . .","9790":"i was keeping you safe love . . you are my family . . reaper takes a few steps towards geno though he may notice reapers eye has a reddish glow around it given how close they are to eachother now","9791":"reaper holds out his scythe , he looks prepared to fight errors blaster beasts you really wanna fight death ?","9792":"love , come on . . your supposed to be resting , i gave you magic but you weren t supposed to use it already . . reaper frowned as he looks at the blasters . .","9793":"good girl , now if you don t want to get sent to heii with all the other little sh ts you ll behave yourself . .","9794":"reaper was extremely shocked and froze in place as he stared at geno wide eyed l love ? you aren t seriously going to attack me . . are you ? come on love . . i m just trying to protect you . .","9795":"reaper then takes a pack of duct tape he mysteriously kept in his robe which is very weird . . and uses it to tape shinos mouth shut and even tie her up , wrapping tape all around her you aren t saying sh t you got me ! ? or else . . do you want to end up like gothy ?","9796":"reaper sweats a bit . . i thought you were asleep . . you need to go back to bed love , i don t want you tiring yourself out , i just had a little talk with the kiddos is all . .","9797":"love ! ? you shouldn t be up right now , go back to bed , i am looking after everyone , the kiddos are fine , they re right here , goth is . . asleep and raven . . is just being a trouble maker as usual but it s nothing i can t handle , go back to sleep . .","9798":"reaper then knocks out goth by smacking him in the skull with his scythe you going to the underworld is what s going on . .","9799":"what ! ? reaper . exe has crashed","9800":"reaper is no where near as bad as x chara and we all know it lol","9801":"reaper was very shocked , error definitely did seem like geno at that moment . . wait a minute . . no way . . . your . . really another geno ! ? how the f ck . . ! ? you don t even act anything like him most the time ! this is the first time i ve seen you ever act similar to him ! it s . . . kind of hot . . reaper","9802":". . reaper takes out his scythe and slashes you with it let this be a lesson to you anons . . you get anywhere near my geno or try saying any sh t to him . . you ll be dead","9803":"reaper was surprised to hear error and turned around to see terror standing there . . holy sh t . . what the f ck happened to your blaster beast ? by the way , last i checked these brats were mine . . i don t tell you how to raise yours . .","9804":"reaper then lifts raven up by his scarf before throwing him through a portal he created with his scythe have fun in heii kiddo !","9805":"hurt you ? i m going to do more than that . . your going to feel the wrath of death . . . reaper then summoned his scythe which had a red tint to it . . how many times have i told you kids that your mom can t handle all of this ? look at him ! thanks to you , he s on his death bed ! you either straighten up or i personally send all of you to heii . .","9806":"reaper grabs raven by his scarf as he tried to run and yanks him back over to him what was that kiddo ? you want another trip to the underworld ? or do you want to have a death battle ?","9807":". . . be careful what you tell reaper he still has hatred and it can get out of control , he s attacked their kids several times before because of it . . gothofdeaths reaperintraining deathreaps . . kids . . can you come here for a minute ?","9808":"reaper then takes one of his spare robes and covers geno with it like a blanket , it was definitely big enough be a blanket","9809":"here s your answer , all i need is geno","9810":"first i m making sure your okay love . . reaper hasn t stopped sharing his magic with geno yet , he was pretty worried about him i ll check on everyone else as soon as i know your okay","9811":"my adorable tsundere dontcallmesans","9812":". . that human that nearly killed me with that damned overpowered shotgun is that stupid talking pyramid ?","9813":"don t worry love , i should be fine now . . reaper then nuzzled geno just get some sleep okay ?","9814":"a week ! ? reaper then held his skull . . . i slept for a entire week . . ! ? damn it . . i took more damage than i thought i did . . . sorry love . .","9815":"love obviously and i don t need to explain why , you should know on your own . . money can t replace people or monsters . .","9816":"reaper was definitely surprised and even blushed slightly , usually geno isn t this cuddly with him . . geno . . . . . . . . okay love , i can stay a bit longer . . . . . how long was i even out ?","9817":"that made reaper even more worried about his tsundere and he just lays geno down beside him while still sharing as much magic as he can with him . . it s fine love . . you don t need to do anything . . okay ? i can take it from here . . he doesn t know what happened yet but when he finds out , everyone better run especially their kids","9818":". . damn it . . reaper sighed as he hugged geno back with one arm and held his skull with the other . . we really need that vacation . . just stay here love . . i got some rest in , now it s your turn . . alright ?","9819":". . . . . . . . . . . reapers eyes have darkened , he wasn t happy about anything hes been hearing , it seemed like everything went straight to heii while he was recovering but he couldn t help it , he took some serious damage from the last fight he was in , if he didn t get any rest he might of ended up as a pile of dust","9820":"you really shouldn t have shown reaper that , your going to have a very deadly time that image has triggered reaper beyond belief , he takes blue magic imbued chains which wrap around you and slam you into the ground and while your on the ground , he takes his scythe and decapitates you , yikes . . anyone else want to p ss me off today ! ?","9821":". . . reapers eye flares a ghostly blue color . . does he really want to p ss me off ? i m going to kill him . .","9822":". . . . . reaper takes out his scythe while he was sharing his magic with geno and swings it at you , someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning can you blame me ? i just recovered and i find the love of my life is almost dead !","9823":"reaper was shocked when geno just suddenly collapsed on him like that but he noticed his soul and begins sharing magic with him right away . . what the heii happened . . ! ?","9824":"reaper sits on the edge of their bed , looking at geno as he walks in love ?","9825":"if he doesnt , i m going to kill you anon . .","9826":"what ! ? reaper is p ssed , well lust is going to die","9827":"reaper had finally regained conciousness after being knocked out for days and boy is he going to freak when he learns what happened while he was out . . i don t know . . is it morning right now . . ? wait . . where s geno ?","9828":"aw but reaper was still out cold and laying in the same spot ever since they got back to lifes house","9829":"reaper didn t seem to hear you and stayed sound asleep without even moving a muscle . . this was unusual for him to be out cold like this but maybe it s nothing to worry about","9830":"that s really cute reaper was still out like a light and stayed sound asleep while geno left to check on everyone","9831":"that would be true , didn t think about that though when reaper was moved , the death god was shivering like he was cold ngh . .","9832":"whats worse is reaper didn t seem to be awake and was laying right on top of geno , if anyone walked in . . that would be a very awkward scene","9833":"reaper of course follows his tsundere but once they were seated on the bed , he collapses against geno","9834":"what was that love ? reaper then lays his skull against genos your back to being my strawberry tsundere your red like one again","9835":"actually reaper has done that lol is it a bad thing ? it shows i love my adorable tsundere he then hugged geno close to him you ve been pretty worried about me lately too love , it s really adorable","9836":"reaper looked relieved and immediately nuzzles his tsundere i m happier , you had me worried love . .","9837":". . reaper didn t like geno going anywhere alone especially when knowing he s been hurt but with his current condition . . he really can t follow him , unless he really wants to give geno a heart attack , he decides to stay put for now","9838":". . you didn t think that through did you reaper ? the death god shakes his skull as he unlocks the door , he didn t lay down yet and was still floating beside geno you need healed first , i don t want you getting hurt on accident . .","9839":"you should stay in bed with me love . . . if you want . . you could be my adorable nurse seriously reaper ? even when he s injured he can t keep his mind out of the gutter","9840":"reaper had nearly fallen over just from geno tugging on his hand , he really wasn t in any condition to be out fighting anyone just yet though that wouldn t stop him from trying but geno will w wait . . love , what about your arm ?","9841":"reaper was definitely surprised and looks at geno wide eyed , he didn t expect geno to grab him like that or teleport them to lifes house even though he was against having geno help him , he really didn t want to continue to use a blanket as a robe so he really didn t have a choice , that whole incident with that robot was very humiliating and embarrassing especially when he had to resort to using a blanket to cover himself , not like there s really anything to see considering they re skeletons but it was still embarrassing . . thanks love , while i m out destroying that robot , you should get life to heal you","9842":". . . stay here love . . reaper you do realize your going to walk out of there naked . . right ? i have a blanket mod ! s shut up ! ! i m going to destroy that robot and get geno a life flower . . that means i have to lose these he yanks out his ivs and all the rest of the equipment that was on him before teleporting","9843":"love . . ! ? reaper knew something was wrong and seeing geno wince confirmed it , he wasn t being overly worried , he may be having trouble to stand on his own and was visibly shaky but he wasn t going to allow geno to help him further knowing he himself was hurt i knew s something was wrong ! why didn t you tell me . . ! ?","9844":"damn it . . are all the bills masochists ? there s one i need to payback for nearly putting me on my deathbed . . and that one , bill sans , i ll come up with something to get him back for saying that to you . .","9845":"i know one thing that could help but . . i could use a hand first . . he winks as he held up his left arm which was in a cast","9846":"damn it . . reaper then sighed and puts away his scythe . . does hurting the body they use hurt them at all ? if it does then it d still be worth it","9847":". . okay , i m going to kill him . . reaper your still in a hospital i don t care mod . . he s going to see why i m called death . .","9848":"love . . hey , it s okay , i ve been dealing with it for a long time . . it s been like this ever since i met you but . . reaper then paused as he changed the subject how about we forget about this and talk about you , you never did answer me if your okay or not","9849":"reaper couldn t help but chuckle at that but he didn t trust or like any version of bill thanks to a certain incident involving a over powered shotgun , he immediately summons his scythe right after y you better leave . . before you find out why i m usually grinning","9850":"l love . . hey , it s okay love reaper was honestly surprised geno was that worried he was crying , he then hugs the glitched skeleton close you don t need to worry love . . i ll be alright but . . are you alright ?","9851":". . sh t . . you saw it . . ? reaper now looked nervous , when geno finds out his soul itself is so full of hatred that it s color turned black . . he s going to freak out isn t he ?","9852":". . mngh . . geno managed to wake reaper and the death god looks up at the glitched skele . . g geno . . ?","9853":". . love . . i ll be f fine . . don t . . worry . . about . . it . . . reaper soon closed his eyes after that","9854":"reaper sighed in relief once hearing geno wasn t going to do what the anon said he was going to but now he was nervous , there s no covering up the puddle on the ground , the same liquid even made a puddle in the bed he was laying in , even the blanket he covered himself with now was soaked with that same black and red liquid . . that s just . . . . . . from my robe ? i don t think hes going to believe that","9855":"though thanks to that incident , there was a big black puddle on the ground with some red liquid in it and the same liquid had appeared on the blanket reaper still had wrapped around himself and the death god seemed to be in immense pain once back in bed , there were actually tears now streaking down his skull . . l love . .","9856":"w what ! ? love ! ! reaper then despite everything , tries to dart out of bed towards where he saw geno but that ends with him falling off the bed and onto the ground which causes the death god to start screaming , i don t think you should have told reaper that information f ck ! ! ! g geno ! ! !","9857":". . love . . you wouldn t of hurt me , i m still the god of death , i don t get hurt that easy . . though the fact you ve been hospitalized a couple times and have actually died once in front of him . . i think geno knows your not invincible now , someone strikes you with your scythe and it s over","9858":"reaper looked nervous as he motioned to his other arm which was in a cast . . i . . sort of . . can t love . .","9859":"what s the worst that can happen ? come on love . . you can t hurt me reaper gave him a smile we could . . even . . play doctor if you want to","9860":"lol that works reaper then motions for geno to lay beside him . . you . . should lay down love . . you look like death . . he winks","9861":"i i ll be fine love but . . just . . be careful if your going by yourself . . reaper didn t like that he couldn t go with geno but with the current state he s in , he really can t do anything about it , also he would still need to get up to use his powers and with his condition . . he really can t so he s just going to have to live until he fully heals , either that or he relies on geno but . . he would have a lot of explaining to do since that would mean he has to show how him how much his hatred is affecting him","9862":". . i don t either . . reaper was a bit nervous as he took his robe and sets it on the bed right beside him , with the condition he s in , he can t exactly put it back on so he s just laying it there . . . are you okay love ?","9863":". . um . . that happened . . . reaper then gave geno a worried look love . . ?","9864":"reaper peeks his skull out from the blankets , his entire skull was blue lol that had to be awkward for them s sorry love . . and f ck you universalvocaloid what the hel ! ?","9865":"are you serious ? not that there s anything really to see given their skeletons but that was shocking as heii reaper starts screaming and quickly covers himself with the blankets on the hospital bed before anyone can get a glance at him what the f ck ! ? ! ?","9866":"though reaper can tell whenever something is wrong just like geno can with him since they have a strong soul bond but he won t know exactly what was wrong sorry about falling asleep like that . . i was dead tired . . are you okay love ?","9867":"he s going to figure it out sooner or later and when he does , he s going after uni but right now he doesn t know what happened yet . . love . . ?","9868":". . mngh . . . reapers eye started to open slightly when geno started giving him magic , he doesn t like when geno shares magic since he only has a ninth of a soul but he s really not going to like finding out genos arm was fractured by that android","9869":". . sorry . . l love . . . reaper drops his scythe to the ground and closed his eyes , did he just faint ?","9870":"reaper blocks her umbrella with his scythe and summons blue magic imbued chains that wrap around uni and pull her to the ground , but that action alone seemed to really wear out the death god . . a are you done now . . ?","9871":"you have the best apology ever reaper was now very p ssed and summons his scythe in his hand despite the fact he s in no condition to do so . . . . you better leave before i personally . . send you to heii . . i m the grim reaper kiddo . . geno let you off easy compared to what . . i would do to you . .","9872":". . reaper just blinks as she vanished , he was honestly surprised","9873":"just show the world dontcallmesans","9874":"i never thought nightmare . . was a yandere . . or expected him to . . be into you . . or anyone . . that s really shocking . . but . . why did you help . . ?","9875":"reaper couldn t help but chuckle and clinks geno on his skull hey , remember ? til death do us part ? i never said we were parting","9876":"reaper was surprised to see nova of all people in his doorway but he noticed she was wearing something on her head but with his blurry vision , he couldn t make out what it was exactly wait . . you got horror not to eat me ? i thought geno did . . wait . . why would he take orders from you . . ? and . . what s that . . thing on your head ?","9877":"hey , it s okay love . . the death god just nuzzles geno and hugs him close i might of . . exaggerated a bit . . . but i promise , you won t lose me again . .","9878":". . geno . . . . . come here . . reaper then held out his arm to him for a hug","9879":"i m sure it ll be fine love . . it s not like . . you can kill death . . reaper chuckled a bit but geno is probably right , that would be a bad idea , if one of those were to accidentally get knocked out of place it could do some damage","9880":"reaper just blinks , honestly he s never seen it that way before but that does explain why geno didn t fear him when they first met and even told him off , most people he s run into would be too afraid to do that since well it s the grim reaper you d be telling off , someone capable of killing you just by poking you","9881":"love . . reaper then tugged on genos arm , trying to get him to lay beside him though hearing geno was that worried about him and even admitting he loves him has the death god blushing , its not very often geno admits he loves him being he s a tsundere but you aren t used to being . . in limbo yet . . you should still get some sleep love . . i worry about you too . .","9882":"that s cause . . i have you with me . . reaper then smiled up at geno but honestly he didn t like the fact geno now knew he has nightmares but at least he has zero idea what they were about i don t think . . you had . . any nightmares this time either . . love . . did you ?","9883":"that s . . because they . . fear death . . reaper winks morning . . by the way . .","9884":"i have a few ideas , we could take a vacation in the bedroom or . . while we re here . . we could play doctor he winks , even though he s on his deathbed he still has his mind in the gutter but . . wait . . they really believed your a spirit ?","9885":". . . . . . reaper was unsure how to feel about this , the idea of having geno fight alongside him honestly worries him , he could get into serious danger . .","9886":". . reaper sighed i think . . we really could use a long vacation . . at least long enough that we can recover . . i know i m not the only one . . hurting here . .","9887":"maybe my skull was . . too thick . . and that was why . . reaper chuckled slightly before closing his eyes you know . . it s really f cked up . . i m a god . . i should be stronger than this . .","9888":"reaper sighed in relief as the wound was now healed . . thanks love . . but . . you should of held onto that . . in case you needed it . .","9889":"reaper had blushed bright blue from hearing geno sound so . . protective of him , it was really surprising , it s not often he sees that side of geno honestly . . i don t think he has seen that side of him am . . i r rubbing . . off . . on ngh . . ! ! i . . i might . . n need . . to . . stop . . t talking . . for a . . . bit . . it . . hurts . . . . reaper then placed genos hand on his neck , he can feel a large groove there that was shaped like horrors cleaver","9890":"heh . . t thanks love . . i . . i know it ll . . be okay . . ngh . . reaper then lays his skull as close as he can to geno","9891":". . i . . i . . a am . . death . . . . l love . . reaper winks but . . i i can . . rest . . f for a . . little . . w while . . . . don t worry . . b but . . i don t . . . l like . . the fact . . you . . h have . . to take over . . while i do . . . . ngh . . ! reaper had winced and gripped onto genos hand f ck . . !","9892":"the doctor then nods to say okay and leaves the room so geno and reaper can have some time together the death god had heard his tsunderes voice and looks over in genos direction . . g geno . . ?","9893":"the doctor was surprised at genos response dr are you sure ? you don t have to stay if you don t want to though shortly after the doctor spoke , you can hear the death god calling out genos name","9894":"the doctor then leads geno to reapers room where they see the death god wasn t looking his best . . he had ivs hooked to his soul along with a monitor and one of his arms was in a cast along with one of his legs , just how much damage did he take ? it was looking grim for grim reaper","9895":"dr do you want to see him ? his condition looks like yours except for the skull and soul . . . and he s not a ghost yet . . the doctor tried to joke but that was pretty terrible and hearing that probably didn t help geno","9896":"dr okay . . your friend is being helped by the other doctors but from what i heard , he isn t doing well . . he keeps calling for someone named geno . .","9897":"dr i guess not . . but it can t be good walking around like that . .","9898":"dr so . . . we shouldn t worry about your injuries ? you look as bad as your friend . .","9899":"the doctors were confused for a few minutes but they come up with he must be some sort of ghost , at least that stops them from putting geno in a giant cast and they won t throw reaper out . . yet , when they find out he s the grim reaper which more than likely reaper will tell them that at some point , it ll be a different story dr i m sorry all that s happened to you , so your a ghost ?","9900":"dr what do you mean same old same old ! ? you look half dead ! ! they then take geno into another room and even go as far as duct taping bandages to his skull and try sticking him in a full body cast lol","9901":"shockingly once geno had brought him back the doctors seemed panicked and right away picked up reaper and headed off , that was odd , they usually avoid him like the plague , maybe he hasn t told this hospital he was the grim reaper yet otherwise they definitely wouldn t be helping him although after they took reaper , once getting a good look at geno , they begin to freak out dr omg how are you alive ! ? we should of helped you first ! ! get the bandages ! ! they begin wrapping geno in bandages like he s a mummy","9902":"reaper had left his hospital room the other day when he noticed geno wasn t there beside him but he really shouldn t have been up and moving around just yet , now he was just laying on the ground outside . . ngh . . .","9903":". . love ? reaper looks back over at where he heard genos voice and saw his tsundere was back beside him and lays his skull on genos lap . . mngh . . .","9904":"reaper peers down from his hospital bed but he was pretty disoriented and not very awake . . geno . . ? h how did you get so small . . ?","9905":"i forgot something . . ? ? love . . i m okay . . i don t need to . . rest . . but soon after he said that , he was nearly falling back asleep and struggled to keep his eyes open . . .","9906":"but love . . i am better ! we can reaper had suddenly stopped mid sentence . . w what . . were we talking about again . . ?","9907":"that gives me a idea . . we should go see a movie on the surface , that s something i don t think we ve done yet but reaper was cut off in the middle of his sentence as he began having a coughing fit , he may not be well enough to leave the hospital just yet . . just . . g give me a m min cough minute . .","9908":"i . . i did . . ! ? reaper has no memory of his actions while his hatred was in control i i m sorry love . . . are you okay . . ? is your leg still hurt . . ?","9909":"you saved me from horror . . ! ? love . . what were you thinking ! ? he could of
