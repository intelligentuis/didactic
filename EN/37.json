or maybe just have more toilet paper and paper towels ? because when you go to the restroom there should always be more paper in there than needed . better to have more than close to none . and at least have five or six stalls or something ? more than ? ? maybe ? sometimes i don t even go to the restroom there . we have a subway right next door and i like to go there because their bathroom is extremely private and it is a single bathroom . but they have another single bathroom that is separate . that is nicer and more private . they never run out of paper and they always have paper towels . and is always cleaned . of the time .","34446":"connecting with nature and creativity like picnics and going on boat rides and going fishing . park walks . bring pets . doing things connecting with nature are always good ways to figure people out when you re our first with them . i find those kinds of dates the best but that s the kind of person i am . i m not sure how the person you are with is like . ummm . . . going to fun and productive places . like museums but fun museums . crazy enough . the zoo is the bomb when you re on a date . they have food and of course nature and animals are awesome . going ice skating because you are trying something that you re not really the greatest that and they might not be either but if they are then they can help you . working together is always a good thing and trying to connect with another person . working together i ve been trying to help one another not following your butt . crazy enough that i can actually become pretty romantic . sometimes taking them to a really beautiful spot around where you live at it s always a really good way to start a good first date or second date . telling them what makes that place so special to you and why you took them there . because you wanted to share that with them . and again . . . maybe bring a pizza or what are some kind of food that s delicious . picnic time . get you some cut fruit like a small mini mini fruit tray or something that s easy to tote and you can eat that with her . cheese and crackers . sammich ! ?
