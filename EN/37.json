Don't take it off completely it will smear onto ypur skin. But use the Q-tips and the nail polish remover to wipe away any skin that has contact with the nail polish. No one's perfect.

Maybe 14. Because it has a lot of alcohol and drugs and it shows a lot of sexual scenes. Nothing showing tho. If you don't like shows about vampires demons dragons and humans with fantasy like Powers then I would probably not watch.

Or just they are playing games... I usually just yeah... moved on and didn't show any more attention to them because sometimes people are just playing games... whether they are meaning to or not... it is messing with your mind and they're not serious about a relationship fully and you don't need to be in that kind of relationship because then they're not caring about your feelings... Ya see? Cause you are wanting it to get more serious. And ya wanna be with them and make something outta it. But like I said if they're changing their minds so it seems I would just move on and ignore them. They will realize that you're ignoring them and then they're going to be running back to you going oh my gosh what happened and you just need to ignore it because people like to play games. And it's just not funny.  like I said whether there meaning to or not.

When you take the best relationship opportunity slow they become the best relationships.. Trust one another and work together. Patience, trust, loyalty and then the biggest thing after all communication. Tell each other everything. Be open to things to each other. And biggest thing after all be responsible about the relationship. Remember your age and act upon that age. Do not hurry anything. You're younger ages will come by faster than anything in your life... Try to stay young as long as you can.... And not try to grow up too fast.

Jason gets off at the end of the day and we're supposed to cook a really nice dinner.\n  ","39977":"\n  None of these items goes to show how much I actually care for and love you. I greatly appreciate all of the Valentine's gifts and the last couple of weeks that we've been celebrating it together. Our anniversary is coming up also. For the past couple of weeks we have just been spoiling one another and showing each other how much we love each other.\n  \n  _____\n  \n  Jason got me this beautiful giant box of Wilmar's chocolates. There's some sort of beautiful red velvet carpet that surrounds this box also. I feel so special to have received this. It's just absolutely lovely. Which the chocolates were very very good, delicious. Both me and him eat on some of them. They were very good. All different.\n  \n  He also got me this really cute blue sparkly cup that I use at the house and at work. He also got me these cute diamond pens that I have been trying to order offline, but for some reason they keep not coming in. So he got them down for me. I love them. They are gorgeous pins. Very heavy. Perfect for drawing and creating. One is rose gold. And the other one is Silver. The ends of them. One of them is pinkish and the other one is purple like amethyst. He also got me a box of old school sweethearts that have the little sayings on them. Also got me a mug for cake in a cup. We enjoy nibbling on that when are watching movies sometimes. We have matching mugs now. Also good for soup nights.\n  \n  And then we have gone out on a few dates, too.\n  \n  I got him this really cool gift basket full of goodies snacks and chocolates. Has a cute little blue balloon that is sticking out of it. A box of chocolates is surrounded by a cute rose and some decorations too. Ribbons. Makes the box of chocolates really pretty too. And he loved it. I also got him a new wedding band. He went down to ring sizes. He absolutely Adores the new wedding band.\n  \n  I love you Jason! Happy Valentine's Day to you, honey!\n  \n  Happy Valentine's Day to you all!\n  ","39978":"\n  Sorry. My husband works tomorrow too. But we've been celebrating for the past week. And honestly we'll probably celebrate all next week as well. Next week will be Mardi Gras down in south Louisiana. We have a road trip coming up soon! Super excited! I get to see my mama!! I miss her so much! And then I get to see more family and friends!\n  ","39979":"\n  I know right? But really both sound awesome.\n  ","39980":"\n  Yea\n  ","39981":"\n  My husband\n  ","39982":"\n  Honestly, us both, play almost everything. There are a select few that we don't play, but there is a lot of games that we do play. We literally have a ginormous stack of games in our room and we have over 300 games waiting to download on our Xboxes.\n  ","39983":"\n  I don't exactly have any pictures but I might share a gif. I would probably stay in the camper. I wouldn't mind a tent but I just feel like a camper would be a little bit safer is all. I would feel more secure. Especially around here. We have Panthers and bobcats and snakes and everything.\n  ","39984":"\n  I 100% percent stand with you there. I never ever ever have gotten into Snapchat. I don't even understand the big whoop about It is. Same thing with tic toc and the musically app. I just could never get into them. Honestly haven't really gotten into Twitter too much either. I honestly only use Twitter to follow a few of my favorite YouTubers, honestly.\n  ","39985":"\n  Especially the ones that don't even know me? I pay no attention to them. Jealousy is a thing. If you do not know me? Then what other reason to why you don't like me other than what you see? All you see is different? If you do not know me, then there is no way that you can truly hate me. Get to know me, then judge me based off of who you have spoken to. Cuz I promise you now.... Because if these haters put in the effort to actually get to know me..? they wouldn't even hate and\/or envy me.\n  \n  Instead of hating on everyone elses successes... Why don't you get up and produce some of your own. ? Because we are all human and we all have the ability to do anything that we set our minds to.\n  ","39986":"\n  Both sound like a blast waiting to happen.\n  ","39987":"\n  I really like to use Club Penguin. I don't think I used the other ones.\n  ","39988":"\n  Mhmm\n  ","39989":"\n  Yes. But I'm afraid this is actually how it is in a lot of places all over the world. Not just where I'm at, but it is really bad where I'm at for some reason. Every other day, there's some sort of a shooting or killing. Terrible.  A lot of people like to blame other people for the issues that happened in the world. That gives them some sort of closure I suppose. A lot of times it's the uppers and the town.\n  ","39990":"\n  O.o\n  ","39991":"\n  Him and one if the things I got him! ? Happy Valentine's Day my love! ???\n  ","39992":"\n  Lol\n  ","39993":"\n  Thank you so much! Happy early Valentine's Day to you!\n  ","39994":"\n  Jason is the last person that made me happy.

He always is making me happy.\n  ","39995":"\n  Ooooh I think that I read the question wrong. If you were asking me how many I liked. I have liked a lot of videos and I know what you're talking about. The like list. I have thousands on that list. Lol.\n  ","39996":"\n  Ain't nothing wrong with that. And tomorrow me and Jason, my husband are cooking and great dinner and we have already exchanged our Valentine's gifts. And for the next couple days, We've just been binge-watching movies and stuff. We've already been out to eat Together. Tomorrow. I'm just going to take it easy and get some things done. We've been doing stuff together all week celebrating.\n  ","39997":"\n  I think the world would just get more and more inventions and knew everything. Definitely a certain point it would probably get really boring. Living in eternity, but I definitely think people would find new experiences possibly. New adventures. That would keep them going.\n  ","39998":"\n  I have been hearing this happening a lot lately. Everyone needs to be really really careful.\n  ","39999":"\n  I like electric too. But if you know what you're doing with the gas stove then everything is alright. Gas stoves are good for natural disasters. Work when even the electricity is off. And the heat things up very very very quick.\n  \n  Just my preferences is all. I respect everyone else's. Just as others should respect mine.\n  ","40000":"\n  Gas\n  ","40001":"\n  Not really where I I am at because it gets really hectic around here.\n  ","40002":"\n  Awe.

Y'all have a good day.\n  ","40016":"\n  A starter Pokemon would probably be an electric Pokemon.\n  \n  Or a ghost Pokemon.\n  \n  Just to think about that kind of a world if it actually exists it would be so cool. So many stories.\n  ","40017":"\n  ?\u2764???\n  \n  Almost Valentine's Day!\n  \n  And I shall spend it with the best! With this wonderful sweetheart!

If Pokemon were thing I would totally owned some and go into it. I would mostly have a team of fire and electric Pokemon. Probably. And some ghost types. My starring Pokemon would probably be a really good electric or fire Pokemon. Maybe a Raichu.\n  \n  I would want to own a Haunter! I also would want to own a Poochyena. I would most definitely want at least one flying type Pokemon. And then I would want a Charmander. \u2764\n  \n  And then I would just travel. ?\n  ","40021":"\n  Thanks. Ikr?

Really really cute. I was looking at it and he just came up to me and took it out of my hand and put it in the buggy. And then I walked away for a few minutes and was looking at something else and he grabbed that out of my hands and put it in the buggy too.

So he bought those because there are the perfect size for cake in a cup.\n  \n  We even have a meal plan food and pork chop sausage steaks. We're doing everything.\n  \n  And then for him, I got him a huge basket made. I don't think it's going to add up to as much stuff he got me, but I know he's going to love everything. ?

And then we became really really close. Meeting back and forth, all the long distance and back and forth... for four and a half years. Then we finally moved in together and we got married and we are loving every minute of our lives together. Are happy and everything. Sounds like something out of a storybook... Lol..

Something that was just really hard to battle and get through. But we did it.\n  ","40083":"\n  No.\n  \n  Smoking is not cool.\n  \n  It's honestly just supposed to be a stress reliever. But really you shouldn't smoke. The smell just gets absolutely everywhere. And if you smoke when you have white walls, it can go as far as making your walls yellow.... Your nails yellow.. Dry out your skin and lips. Make your breath stink some or even all the time. I am talking about cigarette smoking.\n  \n  If you're talking about a different thing. Some people use that as a reliever also and also for medication. It shouldn't be used as a cool thing. You shouldn't have abuse anything.\n  ","40084":"\n  Correction question\n  ","40085":"\n  You are most welcome. When my husband sees me really upset he will pull up videos of puppies being silly or taking care of babies.

At least the ones that truly care about you and want to be in your life. If they don't want to be in your life anymore than they don't care and they don't need to be in your life. What a good way to pull out toxic people in your life. You don't need toxic people.\n  \n  And you're going to have to accept the fact that people don't like some people that are bisexual or gay. There are people that are like this and if you want to be bi, you're going to have to learn to ignore people. People are hateful. People want to make you miserable and sad. People like to see people miserable and sad. You have to learn to be mentally stronger or you're going to be miserable for the rest of your life if you're caring about what someone thinks of you.\n  \n  I don't care what people think of me. I grew up like a tomboy around guys all the time. Wore very comfortable clothing and enjoyed getting dirty and playing sports and stuff. I liked alot of the things that guy's likes. People thought I was gay and called me all kinds of names but I wasn't gay. I was just a tomboy. I was very much like a girl. Still like to wear dresses, but very seldomly. And still like to wear makeup and look pretty. And like two guys. And only guys. These are just things that I liked. Guy things. But I didn't care what they thought of me. I still kept being me and ignored them. Eventually. They left me all alone. Jealousy is a thing.\n  \n  Do what makes you you and makes you happy and ignore all the rest. People will go as far as threatening you and hurting you, but you need to just walk around it. They want to see you sad and miserable and behind bars... because even people would try to get a reaction out of you. Do not give them that. Ignore them. Kill them with kindness.\n  ","40089":"\n  Iiiiii don't know honestly.\n  \n  I have tried writing in applications. I might have to do another one now. Maybe. Cause I haven't done one in a while.

Since about around Thanksgiving it started. My husband got a few surgeries and I have been taking care of him. He has not been feeling good until about around last week. I am so happy he feels better. He seems like he is more himself again and is not feeling bad anymore. But I am proud of myself because a lot of people say that people wouldn't stick around and help someone for that long but with me it is not a question. Through sickness and health. I love my husband and I don't care what happens I will take care of him. Even if it happens again and again. Same thing back to him. He would take care of me.\n  ","40684":"\n  ??\n  ","40685":"\n  Yea\n  ","40686":"\n  Sadly I have no Nails right now but if I did have nails I like mine to be kind of short. Just a few centimeters off of my finger.\n  ","40687":"\n  Thank you so much. It means a lot to me. I enjoyed making this painting very much.\n  ","40688":"\n  No prob. ???\n  ","40689":"\n  Actually a long long time ago actually maybe thought about this. For good dieting. But I would never do it though probably. I love to cook. Especially with meat and I love the taste of meat. Though I never forget to thank God for every piece of food that he puts in my mouth. Especially with hunting. I thank him for the game and then bring home to prepare for my family.\n  ","40690":"\n  ??\n  ","40691":"\n  Canada\n  \n  UK\n  \n  Australia\n  \n  Turkey\n  \n  Bangladesh\n  \n  Germany\n  \n  France\n  \n  Japan\n  \n  Malaysia\n  \n  Brazil\n  \n  Pakistan\n  \n  India\n  \n  Switzerland\n  \n  New Zealand\n  \n  Ireland\n  \n  Scotland\n  \n  and waaaay more I wanna go to.\n  ","40692":"\n  Thursday! Payday, shopping, cooking happy day! Almost Friday day and then the weekend!\n  ","40693":"\n  I definitely think I've heard of this but I'm not sure if I've seen it. But again I'm not sure.\n  ","40694":"\n  I honestly don't have too many of them. The only thing I get really upset about his losing family members and Friends.\n  ","40695":"\n  It's no problem. I never like to hear that people aren't feeling well and not having a good day. And I try my best to be nice. No reason to be mean.\n  \n  But of course again. Best wishes, prayers, positive vibes going your way for you to start feeling better.\n  ","40696":"\n  I'm honestly not too worried about it but all I know is they better stay over there. I'm sorry that they are dealing with that but I do not need to spread that stuff anywhere else in the world because that stuff looks like it's getting bad quick spreading.\n  \n  But I do wish the best for you too but I'm sure that you will be fine. Never too sure but I will send positive vibes your way and prayers.\n  ","40697":"\n  Some fireworks sales are good one's but some of them are just trying to trick you to buying what they're actually literally all worth. So honestly if you end up with a bad deal then that's probably be really bad... and suck.. pointless. Cuz what you were looking for was a deal so you could get cheaper and more.\n  \n  But I couldn't think of anything else that's could be worse.\n  ","40698":"\n  compassionate.\n  \n  (Even tho I know what this means. I was just filling in the blanks. Lol.)\n  ","40699":"\n  I see. Allergies. They can definitely be a pain.\n  \n  Thanks for asking how I was doing. I hope that you start feeling better though.\n  ","40700":"\n  I think that I answered this earlier but I don't mind sharing another one.\n  \n  This is something I painted a long long long time ago. I had a lot of fun painting this. I don't know why but I just had a kick that day and just started drawing painting and everything. My favorite part would have to be the little pink in the corner. I'm not pink person but I like that pink. Every now and then I add pink. I don't want too many pink shirts. But I did I do a few cancer ones. But I just wanted to do a red painting because that's my favorite color. This painting symbolizes distance. Distance will always play a big part in my life. It always has. I ended up painting this whole picture for Jason's family. Both them and I love this painting. It sits above our window in our room now. \u2764\n  ","40701":"\n  Sometimes I use the sinus pressure medicine and it helps a lot. Make sure you read the bag because you can take it throughout the day. Have you went to the doctor yet? Maybe you need a shot or something? But again I do hope that you start feeling better. I had this a couple weeks ago and it was not fun at all.\n  ","40702":"\n  Strong minded.\n  \n  Positive.\n  \n  Lots of confidence.\n  \n  Especially the confidence of knowing that they're able to take care of themselves and another person and even another person.\n  \n  Someone that is not over possessive. Not controlling or too jealous. Being any of these too much. Being any of these too much can ruin a relationship.\n  \n  Someone that wants to communicate and work things out and work together..\n  \n  Someone who is respectful to themselves and to others obviously. Respectful to all people. Both girls and guys. I never could stand or understand people that control people on who they hung out with and how many? Pick their friends. Especially based off of religion and race and personal views... And then expected them to treat everyone else horrible but them. Only be able to speak to their partner and no one else. This is not how people should be. They should be kind and want the same respect for all human beings, animals, things. Everything. Your partnership want you to socialize with other people. Help others and be kind.\n  \n  I like someone that's understanding and caring and wants to listen. Wants to give advice help one another.\n  \n  Hygiene plays a very big role in a partner for me. You have got to be organized or at least a little bit or know when you need to be. Be clean and have your area cleaned. Environment.\n  \n  You have to have some sort of Faith or hope and something. Determination. Passion. Patience. Patients plays a big part in a partner for me. You have got to be patient.\n  \n  I want a family one day.\n  \n  Have to have all of your priorities straight. Both parts.\n  \n  And of course one hundred percent love one another. Be spontaneous and surprise with one another. Be loving and romantic at times. Want to Adventure and have fun in the world. \u2764 ?\u200d?\u200d?\u200d???\n  ","40703":"\n  I'm doing well. I hope that you're feeling better? And having a better day and got a lot of sleep.\n  ","40704":"\n  Yeah... I mean anyone passing away is really sad. But there's a lot of celebrities that have passed that have made me sad. May God bless all of their souls. \u2764?\n  ","40705":"\n  It doesn't take much to care and be kind to others for me.\n  \n  Starting a conversation.\n  \n  Being creative.\n  \n  Socializing.\n  \n  Singing. \u2764\n  ","40706":"\n  Procrastination.\n  \n  Why wait when you could just go ahead and do it then? Especially something else you have been holding off on for awhile now and it's really not that hard to complete. Especially when it's something really important.\n  \n  It's really aggravating when they complain about it and then you're like why don't you do it and their like... nah... I'll wait till tomorrow and it's been like 2 months. Especially when it's something that you're going to get charged for? Or double charged for being late? Or could get in trouble for or even go to jail for?!\n  ","40707":"\n  Thinking someone's name is something and it's not and I've been calling them that for weeks or months. But it's whatever. LOL I think we all have made this mistake at one point in our life.\n  ","40708":"\n  I have been somewhere where a lot of different things were going on at once. Including the environment feeling very weird.\n  \n  Probably one of the worst things I've ever seen happen to someone while they're in a Compton place was get attacked pushed shoved scratched and choked. It's really scary when something you can't say can attack you. It's very confusing.\n  ","40709":"\n  CJ so cool on YouTube is pretty funny with pranks\n  \n  And then JessikaThePrankster  on YouTube is pretty awesome too.\n  ","40710":"\n  Just talk about today's society and where it is going. I would probably have a conversation with a few people for the good 10 mins.\n  ","40711":"\n  I honestly wear boots, Converse and crocs. I don't really own any shoes shoes besides the Converse and I have to untie them because they are usually ankle high Converse and they are near to impossible to take off without untying most of the shoe.\n  \n  I can take my boots off without untying a but... again it's very hard still, so usually I have to untie them completely. And Crocs are like sandals but usually closed-toed shoes. You don't have to tie them. They are slip-ons.\n  \n  So I guess I don't really have this opportunity to do this.\n  ","40712":"\n  This is a wood-burning piece that I did for me and my husband.\n  \n  It saying, \"Mississippi Man and I'm Louisiana gal.\"\n  \n  I worked very hard on this piece. Taking my time making sure that it was centered and done well. I still have it and I still look at it every day. He loves this piece. It means a lot to both him and I. I enjoy wood burning\/carving. There's not much to it. It's a very cheap kind of art to get into. I definitely recommend it to other artists that are looking for different ideas and different forms of new art to get into.\n  ","40713":"\n  Yes! I love those types of environments! We went to this pawn shop one time where I am from in Louisiana and there was this big dog just rosing around with a ball and just wanted to play. And honestly.. I think I played with the dog more than I looked around. Haha LOL. All of the customers thought it was hilarious and that the dog was really cute and sweet. He was a big dog, but I wasn't afraid of him. A lot of the customers were scared of him, but they started to notice that he was nice and they got used to him very shortly.\n  \n  In school the principal and the upper staff would bring their pets to school. Let them walk around and stuff. And then back in middle school we used to have pet day and we would bring our pets to show everybody. People with bring all kinds. Horses, cows, dogs cats, reptiles, hamsters, bunnies, rats, ferrets, frogs, birds and way more.\n  ","40714":"\n  Any type of Cajun folk music for the fiddle or violin blues or Jazz because that is my home quotes or music. \u2764\n  ","40715":"\n  Jello! Awesome ??? and a strange experience prob haha. Maybe gumbo? That would be kool and hot and kinda gross too because then like it is food but your bathing in it? So yeah? Ya know? Haha tho I am a pretty clean human being idk about random people joining if I'd want to feast then haha.\n  \n  Maybe like a soda? Or some yummy iced coffee! Would be so cold tho! ? Haha\n  \n  I be macaroni and cheese would be a weird one. Or like spaghetti. LOL\n  ","40716":"\n  Prob nothing really would be diff honestly. Haha. Idk.\n  ","40717":"\n  Avril Lavigne and under my skin and let go. Both albums were awesome.\n  ","40718":"\n  Losing a loved one. Getting injured and then having to rest to get better. Seeing loved ones in pain.\n  ","40719":"\n  ? food\n  ","40720":"\n  Everything has went pretty good this first month of 2020.\n  ","40721":"\n  Just being able to differentiate between right and wrong. Having a conscience. Random acts of kindness and then not expecting a thank you then returned. Not expecting a favor or a reward and return. Not even a praise. You just do the kind act and then move on. That is how it should be. Kindness in general. Not being so negative all the time. Be able to turn people's day is around. And even if your day is going bad, to be able to turn your own day around. Be able to ignore hate. To love. To accept. To have some kind've hope or faith.\n  \n  A good person can be many different qualities. Many different things. There is just so much.\n  ","40722":"\n  Half kids and raise them to be happy and heathly.\n  ","40723":"\n  ?\n  ","40724":"\n  Awe... I'm sorry bud.. Hope ya start to feeling better!\n  ","40725":"\n  Thanks for following.\n  \n  I followed you.\n  \n  I really appreciate it. ???\n  ","40726":"\n  I am a Cajun from south Louisiana\n  ","40727":"\n  Lol. They are just so cute.\n  ","40728":"\n  That would definitely have to be my husband and my pups.\n  ","40729":"\n  Honestly if you just give me a good gun some armor and a nice machete I can survive. That's three things but honestly you just give me those three things I can survive. And put the pic a fourth thing a good hiding spot.\n  ","40730":"\n  I definitely do not want to ever experience a volcanic eruption and very near it. A really bad one.\n  ","40731":"\n  Thank you kindly for your compliment. I followed you back as well. I really appreciate it! Thanks.\n  ","40732":"\n  I have two pit bulls. And they are absolutely the sweetest. And I really want a teacup Chihuahua. My husband is really thinking about getting one. I might wait a little bit though. One of my pitbulls likes to play with birds and frogs so I'm sure that he will be good with the little puppy. The other Pit Bull is a mama. I'm pretty sure that she would probably try to take care of the baby like it is hers. But I can definitely relate to you when you say that you feel really good about you're puppy looking at you as if you were absolutely the world and are the world. Mine look at us the same as well. We also have this little Chihuahua but it is my husband's grandmother's Chihuahua and he for sure looks at me like I'm the world. He can be a little mean but he's very protective and just doesn't like a lot of people. But honestly if I can get a girl Chihuahua he will be completely fine with that. He's not much of a fan of boys. It definitely feels good to feel the world to anything.\n  ","40733":"\n  Iiiii don't know. Sometimes it seems like it picks different people but other times it seems to pick a lot of the same people too. So I definitely know what you mean. I don't know if it just sends it to absolutely everybody?? and just the same people are answering them???? I don't know really. That's definitely a good question. The world may never know... LOL\n  ","40734":"\n  Bella in a lot of different languages means beautiful usually\n  ","40735":"\n  Yeah? I'm the same way I like block channels, Urban exploration and Adventures and then I like documentaries in history. Good stories. I also like comedies and of course I love Music.\n  ","40736":"\n  Lol Awe. That's awesome. That sounds about like me sometimes. Sometimes I like to get me a few drinks in and then I will turn YouTube on and sit there and put my dogs.\n  ","40737":"\n  Me and Jason are going down to south Louisiana to spend Mardi Gras with my family and friends. I am super duper excited!\n  ","40738":"\n  We do celebrate Valentine's Day. Even when I was single I would usually get my family something. Get everyone a little candy or stuffed animal or something. Just to spoil them and show them my appreciation. Both Jason and me usually get a few things for each other. And then around Valentine's Day a few days before in a few days after we usually cook really good and have some sweets periodically. Like strawberries or make beignets. Or make breakfast really early in the morning Or really late at night together. But we will bake and cook together. We'll go out to eat and get sushi. We'll go see a movie. We will go four-wheeler riding together and then get lost to have picnics. Considering our anniversary is a few weeks after Valentine's Day we usually celebrate from Valentine's Day all the way till the middle of April. These two months are very special to us. February and April because these are the two months that me and him first met each other in 6 years ago almost. But yeah I definitely celebrate Valentine's Day.\n  ","40739":"\n  I don't know. More than 95% of the time my questions are literally made up questions that I have thought of myself. I like to try to come up with new fresh questions. Things that I feel like people haven't seen a lot on here. And if they have been asked well we all are humans and we do have times when we do think alike and we have our definite times of being different. Some of the questions may seem alike at times. But like I said I try to be original with my questions. But I definitely see what you're saying. For some people it's hard to ask a question. To come up with something. Which I understand. But yeah who knows.\n  ","40740":"\n  My body just can't have cinnamon. Allergic. But you take it easy. Have a good night.\n  ","40741":"\n  Nothing. Not try.\n  ","40742":"\n  Sometimes revenge isn't always the answer, I guess. Even though how much we want to seek it, we shouldn't. We should learn to forgive or forget or both.\n  \n  Sorry that you are feeling this way. At least you're having a conscience about it. You're being realistic. You're thinking.\n  ","40743":"\n  It's a glitch that Ask.fm does when some people go offline. It glitches us into another leaderboard server. It happens to a lot of people on here and I don't know why. It's completely uncontrollable. 100% a glitch and I wish that they would fix it. So that's why. It's not supposed to glitch us over into another but does sometimes.\n  ","40744":"\n  The week has been going pretty smooth so far. Thanks. I hope that yours has been going good too.\n  ","40745":"\n  ? Hey. I've had a pretty good day. I hope that you have had a good day as well! Thanks for asking!\n  ","40746":"\n  I like alternative rock. Metal. Rock. Hard Rock. Gospel metal. Some screamo. Rap. Country rap. Country. Some R&B and pop. Jazz and Blues.\n  \n  My most favorite genre would have to be alternative rock.\n  ","40747":"\n  I do. I've been having it for a few years now. I am not that active on it at the moment because I'm trying to renew my membership. Once I renew my membership I will probably be more active again.\n  \n  IceFrozenVocals is me on there I believe. If you can't find me, let me know.\n  ","40748":"\n  Good & lol\n  \n  Enjoy one for me. I can't have Fireball sadly. Can't have cinnamon\n  ","40749":"\n  I have never been to Indonesia.

I just have so many questions that are in my inbox I missed some birthday wishes sadly... on accident. I literally have thousands of questions of my inbox. I wish there was a better way we could get to the bottom so we can answer the ones at the bottom.\n  \n  But my birthday was good. It went well. I turned 24\n  ","40753":"\n  I am sorry I am late.
