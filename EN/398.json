tolerance for disrespect or rude behavior. if you can't have a nice discussion about this without passively insulting me, then i can't continue this conversation.\n  ","427065":"\n  i don't think you quite understand what white privilege entails. systemic oppression is built upon hundreds of years of enslavement, torture, and abuse of a race of people solely due to the color of their skin. during the course of time, people are \"taught\" that people of other races are inherently bad, thereby creating stigmas and stereotypes regardless of how false they actually are.\n  \n  this means that in current times, people who are white have a general advantage over other races in terms of education, career opportunities, and other social and political platforms because of these pre-conceived misconceptions. the entire point of the recent BLM movement is to raise awareness of this unnecessary stigma and the inherent racism that's so ingrained in society today, to the point where a lot of people aren't even conscious of it.\n  \n  me pointing out that there is a historical and sociological explanation behind modern racism doesn't mean that i'm personally racist. these ideologies aren't stemming from my personal points of view, this is a model of our society and the general perspectives which have been further perpetuated by the media and government.\n  ","427066":"\n  this is

were unable to vote were young and reported to have wanted to vote for bernie sanders.\n  ","427078":"\n  without a doubt. i have no faith in the US election because the next president is always

knowledge of other nations.\n  ","427091":"\n  as much criticism this generation receives due to our savvy use of technology, i'm actually very hopeful for the future because technology has the ability to improve lives and progress society in a positive manner.\n  \n  we can talk to people from around the world at a second's notice. social media allows trending news topics to be spread from one side of the earth to another within minutes. powerful social justice movements have erupted with the help of technology alone.\n  \n  likewise, technology helps in multiple other fields as well. if a person cannot afford medical treatment in person or cannot travel to receive medical attention, they can video conference for consultations -- especially with respect to mental health. people

harassed by their peers, and sometimes even killed because people still believe that having feminine qualities is \"bad.\"\n  \n  women aren't dictating anything in that respect, and none of the

perhaps their only friend is their partner, so the internet becomes a diary for them to share their experiences.\n  ","427130":"\n  i understand that completely. but men also shouldn't be harassed,

want your product to beat out the competition, throwing in nudity to be \"edgy\" is unfortunately one of the better ways to do it. society is overrun by sex appeal, and something like that would have people talking about the product moreso than an advertisement that was modest in comparison.\n  ","427137":"\n  from a marketing perspective, it creates competition.\n  \n  the women they're selling the product to are being taught that they can be more appealing to men by buying the product. these women, in the company's eyes, don't want other women to be seem in the same light of sex appeal. so

had that lifestyle back then ?? how many people could say that they have this lifestyle now without experiencing financial struggle ?? the middle class is disappearing, families aren't perfect, and the concept that such an ideal described above is the \"dream\" completely precludes the struggles that POC, single mothers and fathers, lgbtqia people, the mentally ill, the disabled, and others faced.\n  ","427202":"\n  i literally couldn't find a single candid shot of myself where i didn't look like a smol child, lmao.\n  ","427203":"\n  same, tbh.\n  \n  And when i emailed askfm to see what happened and try to ask for my account back, they passively told me no and bolded the askfm guidelines where it says \"no bullying\" or something along those lines.\n  \n  i was so pissed at first because if anyone knows me, they know that i'm the last person who would bully anymore. but i'm over it. i'm kinda happy for the fresh start, actually.\n  ","427204":"\n  there's honestly no story behind it, i just thought it was a beautiful image. it combines my love of\/fascination with death and love of nature. it seemingly represents the duality of life and death and how flowers can bloom from decay.\n  ","427205":"\n  yes, my necklace (pictured below).\n  \n  it was a gift from my boyfriend for my birthday last year, and it's essentially a symbol of his promise to me to be more supportive and make more sacrifices for us. he hasn't disappointed me yet. :3\n  ","427206":"\n  eventually in the future, yes. it's funny because years ago i never wanted children, but the more i see my friends' children and interact with them, the more i eventually want children of my own. ?\n  \n  i can also see my boyfriend being a terrific father because we have the same perspectives when it comes to parenting and he's wonderful with kids.\n  ","427207":"\n  fun fact, they actually make edible, safe cookie dough now specifically for those who love the taste of cookie dough so that they don't run the risk of getting sick from the raw food. ?\n  ","427208":"\n  say what now.\n  \n  obesity occurs due to a myriad of factors -- calorie input\/output, thyroid function, hormone imbalances from other vital organs, genetic factors, side effects of medication, etc.\n  \n  it's unethical to assume that just because a child is obese that it means their parents are abusing or neglecting them. the child could have a medical condition causing unnecessary weight gain, for example.\n  \n  but it's definitely not comparable to abuse. i think that's extremely inappropriate to suggest, especially in the face of abuse survivors who have had to live with abusive parents for years.\n  ","427209":"\n  i wouldn't pose with a cigarette in my hand if i didn't have the intention of smoking it. lmao.\n  \n  also, does anyone else find it mildly discomforting that we can now save other people's profile pictures to our phones...? :\/\/\n  ","427210":"\n  *looks at my profile pic*\n  \n  no, the lit cigarette in my hand is purely for aesthetic reasons.\n  ","427211":"\n  absolutely. the black lives matter movement is extremely important, especially in light of the recent injustices committed by law enforcement. to deny that police brutality against the black community has become increasingly racist and out of hand is essentially encouraging these acts of injustice to continue. by taking a stand of neutrality, you're ultimately aiding the oppressor.\n  ","427212":"\n  i think it really depends what's in their past and how much of an impact it's made on who they are now. in terms of relationships, i think it's probably important to tell your current partner if you were ever previously married, divorced, or widowed. no doubt that has an impact on how you view relationships and how you behave in one.\n  \n  everything else can come with time and trust, especially regarding uncomfortable topics like if they've ever been arrested, hospitalized, undergone trauma, etc. that goes on a really individual basis, though, so a collective claim can't be made for everyone.\n  ","427213":"\n  i mean i'd be stoked if someone gifted me gummy worms (especially sour gummy worms, yum), but i'm trash, so.\n  ","427214":"\n  no ?? that sorta ruins the point of giving someone a gift. also, it's her birthday. you can't expect someone to give you a gift back if you're giving them a birthday gift. that's honestly just rude.\n  ","427215":"\n  you're about to have a cigarette and then get yourself a huge bowl of salted caramel ice cream ??\n  \n  oh, wait. that's me.\n  ","427216":"\n  as far as documentation is concerned, sure. but how many trans people do you expect are willing to report to census records about their gender ??\n  ","427217":"\n  me too, it's surprising when an anon actually apologizes for rude behavior !! haha.\n  ","427218":"\n  shoving pizza into my mouth hole and watching a show about forensic investigations re: murder cases.\n  ","427219":"\n  wow, thank you so much. this actually means a lot to me. :) :) thank you for taking time out of your day to tell me this.\n  ","427220":"\n  i believe that our souls \/\/ spirits \/\/ whatever you want to call them continue on after death, as death is merely the deterioration of our physical forms. it's extremely hard for me to grasp the idea that this life is the only concept of life we've ever given.\n  \n  as for what happens to our souls, idk. i always compared our souls to energy as it cannot be destroyed, only transfered. i'd like to think that perhaps we become the essence of another being or living thing in this universe.\n  ","427221":"\n  i think i look the same, but idk (( i literally took the pic on the left just now )).\n  \n  also, the picture where i'm wearing makeup was taken months ago so my face probably looks a little different naturally... i actually think my face got thinner since then ??\n  ","427222":"\n  there's a HUGE homeless population whose rights are rarely considered in social forums. a large portion of the homeless are lgbt and trans youth, the mentally ill, and veterans.\n  ","427223":"\n  my boyfriend just got over sun poisoning so i understand your worry. the skin is incredibly versatile so it'll bounce back within a few days. and sometimes even after the burn goes away, you'll be left with a nice tan as long as you don't peel the skin off.\n  ","427224":"\n  yeah. first, it's insinuating that you expect them to do so simply due to the fact that they're homeless. second, if you're choosing to give them money out of charity, it isn't your place to tell someone how to spend that money. and third, even if they did, it's just rude to tell that to someone, especially if they struggle with an addiction.\n  ","427225":"\n  can we talk about how cool this photo came out.\n  ","427226":"\n  i never saw the movie, but allegedly it's a great film for children to learn about racial oppression ??\n  ","427227":"\n  this basically defines my relationship with 99% of my family. we see my aunt and uncle and cousins once or twice per year for holidays, but it's always out of a routine obligation.\n  \n  i managed to get out of it a few times in recent years when i was required to work holidays in retail, but i have no excuse with my current job now that i have weekends and holidays off, lol.\n  ","427228":"\n  both, honestly. for someone to completely reject the idea of love means that they've been so terribly hurt in the past that any notion of love or intimacy puts them into a panicked, defensive state of mind.\n  \n  which is sad, because often the strongest thing to come to terms with those feelings is finding a person who loves you so genuinely that you can feel comfortable enough to break down your walls.\n  ","427229":"\n  i just finished eating a bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast wrap from the deli. unfortunately, i cannot post a photo because it's already being digested. ?\n  \n  as for what i'm drinking, it's coffee. my first love.\n  ","427230":"\n  i'd love to be a novelist or a freelance writer, working from the comfort of my own home with my own little office. i think i'd be much more motivated if i had my own personal space to do my work.\n  ","427231":"\n  LOL yes, my boyfriend had one ex girlfriend in particular who posed somewhat of a problem for our relationship towards the very beginning.\n  \n  she'd constantly message me and tell me that she was going to \"take him back\" and to watch myself around him. there was also another completely different girl with whom my boyfriend had a one night stand and she ended up sending me death threats over facebook one day.\n  \n  thankfully both of them now have completely moved one, they both have long term relationships of their own and one of them is pregnant. thank god for maturity.\n  ","427232":"\n  you're the only person who has asked me a question about conspiracy theories, actually !!\n  \n  i find them extremely interesting, but i don't know enough about most of them to determine which ones i think are true and false. i know people debate about the moon landing, but i think that event was 100% real.\n  \n  i'd like to receive more questions about them tbh, it's a good way to learn more about the theories that are out there so i can formulate an opinion for myself.\n  \n  (( also sorry i haven't answered your mandela question, i haven't had the time to research it yet ))\n  ","427233":"\n  i don't have anything against people who are against against abortion for themselves.\n  \n  however, if you mean people who are adamantly pro-life and push their agenda onto everyone else -- then i honestly think they're inconsiderate and ignorant to the effects an unwanted pregnancy can have on someone who isn't ready to be pregnant.\n  \n  abortion is a medical procedure that people utilize to terminate the unwanted fertilization of an egg in their uterus. being pregnant can have devastating effects on a person who isn't ready for children, in a financial, mental, and environmental sense.\n  \n  if someone who is against abortion cannot understand why the procedure is necessary for some, then i can't respect them as an individual.\n  ","427234":"\n  \"pap feet\"\n  \n  \"what would you do to me if i shrunk down to the size of an ant\"\n  \n  \"do you have your tonsils\"\n  \n  \"why do you support men if you're a feminist\"\n  \n  \"why are you depressed\"\n  \n  like seriously people, shut the fuck up and learn some common manners and decency.\n  ","427235":"\n  since i haven't posted a selfie in a while.\n  ","427236":"\n  i don't know the context behind the quote, but it appears to be extremely misandrous and biased, which makes me uncomfortable.\n  ","427237":"\n  i probably shouldn't have chuckled as much as i did.\n  ","427238":"\n  somewhat. i have a strong sense of intuition at times, but i try not to rely on it 100% because it doesn't necessarily mean it's reliable.\n  ","427239":"\n  my first instinct is to get angry and question why, but then i remember that it's just an answer on a social media website and i have no real reason to stress about it.\n  ","427240":"\n  probably not, it's impossible to go anywhere where i live without a vehicle and i'm not a fan of public transportation.\n  ","427241":"\n  i've never had a teacher who was as horrible as umbridge, but when i was in 9th grade, i had an earth science teacher who had a lot of anger and personal issues which he brought to the classroom... he ended up throwing desks across the room, a student's binder out the window, etc. we later found out he was on cocaine for the majority of his lessons.\n  ","427242":"\n  my best friend helped me temporarily leave a bad situation, but it was more accidental than anything else... however, if it wasn't for her, i probably wouldn't have stuck it out until the end. her support definitely helped reinstall a sense of hope within me; without it, i likely would have killed myself at a very young age.\n  ","427243":"\n  strange, i didn't realize that answering questions on askfm suddenly meant that my intelligence exists no longer.\n  \n  hm, who knew?\n  ","427244":"\n  yikes please don't. just leigh, thank you very much.\n  ","427245":"\n  international delight !!\n  ","427246":"\n  respect the dead as you'd respect the living. it's just common courtesy, desecrating a grave or a body is one of the most disrespectful things you can do.\n  \n  --\n  \n  in other news, should i take a nap or have a cup of coffee ?? i'm so undecided.\n  ","427247":"\n  i'd love to visit new orleans in general due to the rich history, and the cemeteries are just a plus !! just another item on my bucket list lol.\n  ","427248":"\n  i've always personally believed in the concept of souls. it's incredibly difficult for me to grasp the concept that this life is all i have, and once my body has deteriorated into the earth, there's simply nothing. it makes the concept of life seem pretty futile.\n  ","427249":"\n  i think that's a nice idea to have some sort of a gallery. i just don't know why the staff is choosing to update all of these aesthetic technicalities instead of focusing their energy on more meaningful changes, like to the reporting and blocking system.\n  ","427250":"\n  i don't use tumblr.\n  ","427251":"\n  broad generalizations like these typically are rarely, if ever, true.\n  ","427252":"\n  i strongly advocate for pro choice in regards to unwanted pregnancies. i believe people should be given the right to choose what to do with their own bodies, and the government should not dictate something that's medically oriented.\n  \n  that being said, i've never been able to wrap my head around pro life arguments. the only rationale i understand is if a person has terrible or traumatic experiences regarding abortion, and 99% of the time, they're not militant in their opinions anyway. most of the other pro life arguments i've seen were logically\/medically false or based in false interpretations of religious text.\n  ","427253":"\n  i think it depends on the severity of the crime. things such as felonies should be made available to know to the public for employers to see, especially if it's things like robbery or manslaughter or murder.\n  \n  lesser offenses can sometimes be taken off the record after serving the time for it, so i don't really think it's necessary for people to know those details.\n  ","427254":"\n  probably not, it's a cosmetic procedure more than anything else because there's nothing medically wrong with my teeth. if i had the money, i'd rather allocate it towards something else.\n  ","427255":"\n  you'll usually know immediately if you're not doing the right thing based upon the reactions of other people or your own personal feelings retrospectively.\n  ","427256":"\n  stereotypes aren't fun, kid.\n  ","427257":"\n  one of the single most disgusting sentences i've ever read.\n  \n  i hope you realize that most muslims will denounce isis and tell you that they don't represent any of the core values of islam. that's the same thing as saying no christians = no WBC. but of course nobody will ever say that, right?\n  ","427258":"\n  that's not insulting at all, and honestly, i'm definitely not surprised that the US is behind all of europe in terms of education. especially considering the fact that you stated germany doesn't have the best school system, but you were taught more languages than most public high schools can even offer students. in my high school, we only had the option of learning french, spanish, or italian (and we couldn't pick more than one).\n  ","427259":"\n  no, my gender has nothing to do with my opinions and it wasn't a decision i've ever made for myself. i've just always grown up not relating to ideas associated with women, but also not relating to ideas associated with men. i've always considered myself nonbinary and outside of the realm of regular gender norms.\n  \n  agender is typically seem as genderless, in which the person either slides fluidly between the gender binary, but doesn't adhere to any particular gender construct, or doesn't relate to a gender identity at all.\n  ","427260":"\n  not at all. i don't know much about private schools, but the public school systems are incredibly under-funded and under-staffed. students aren't getting adequate educations, science and art programs are severely lacking, and there's also a lack of alternative schooling programs.\n  \n  the US is behind many other countries in terms of education.\n  ","427261":"\n  reposting from a friend who reblogged this from facebook. personality disorders in general are extremely misunderstood and stigmatized, and borderline personality disorder is just one of several that people need to be more educated about.\n  ","427262":"\n  no. i think the justice system is extremely flawed, and a large number of police officers take advantage of their positions of power for their own selfish gains.\n  \n  however, at the same time i recognize that it isn't a reflection of all police officers or people in the justice system. but there's still a dire need for reorganization and reform.\n  ","427263":"\n  i'm honestly not too educated on this topic,  but i would assume both play a factor in how we can retain and recall information.\n  \n  on the one hand, there could be genetic factors that direct the kind of information you're more apt to recall. but on the other hand, you can also train yourself to retain and recall more information over time.\n  \n  sometimes there are also things people cannot retain no matter how hard they try, and that could be either a mental block sort of thing or as a result of an environmental or medical factor (i.e. dissociation or neurological impairments, for example).\n  ","427264":"\n  because it's the law ?? regardless of whether the other people were using or holding, they're still considered accessories or witnesses and they have to be taken in to determine the extent of involvement. getting arrested doesn't mean you're guilty of a crime, the charges come later.\n  ","427265":"\n  i like when people put effort into their answers, but it doesn't determine whether or not i follow someone. if they're able to give good, informative content with just a few words or sentences, then i would prefer that over a drawn out answer that says nothing at all.\n  ","427266":"\n  i don't think popularity is very important, and i've never considered myself to be popular. that being said, however, i think that it's good for those who are popular to use their platform for the greater good, i.e. talking about issues that need heightened awareness, promoting charities and other events, and raising money for good causes.\n  \n  obviously cons of popularity would be vulnerability to cyber attacks, stalking, bullying, and a sense of mob mentality when a group of fans misconstrue or mislead the public into believing the wrong thing about you.\n  ","427267":"\n  no, they just got off with a warning regarding the drinking. however, we were technically trespassing in a place we weren't supposed to be, so we were all written summons for loitering. we got off pretty lucky that night.\n  ","427268":"\n  because there are some times in my life where i'm not exactly rooted in reality, and existential thoughts about real versus fake and life and death make me really nauseous and feel as if there's no point in living. this is one of those times.\n  ","427269":"\n  everyone follow morgan's new page !!\n  ","427270":"\n  people obtain medical degrees and doctorates just to answer this question lol, it isn't exactly something that can be explained in a few sentences.\n  ","427271":"\n  lol no. the human race is quite possibly the worst species there is on this planet.\n  ","427272":"\n  depending on their circumstance, it's probably a hell of a lot better than where they're coming from.\n  ","427273":"\n  i fail to see how your statement is, in any way, correlated to the question the other anon asked me.\n  \n  you have the choice to be rude or considerate. it's simply rude and invasive to ask someone personal questions like that if they weren't specifically asked for in the first place.\n  ","427274":"\n  women get hate for dating in general, whether they're older or younger than them.\n  \n  i'm not too sure where the stereotype or the shaming originated from, to be honest. however, i've always thought that the expectation was, obviously, uncalled for. as long as both people are consenting and are of legal age, who cares.\n  ","427275":"\n  ARE YOU SERIOUS LOL.\n  \n  i can't even take this seriously anymore, you've gotta be trolling me at this point. especially considering you just referred to a group of people as \"illegals.\"\n  \n  ok ok the

\"all\" to broadcast to the world that he automatically expects an entire mass of people to be criminals. he isn't specifying his words by indicating \"well perhaps we shouldn't do this because

11pm anyway, otherwise i won't wake up for work the next morning.\n  ","427285":"\n  i'd rather not be stuck at home with my parents for the rest of my life, thanks. i actually have dreams and aspirations that i want to accomplish and a life to live on my own terms.\n  ","427286":"\n  i agree. there are a lot of luxuries that people enjoy that were actually funded, created, or built by immigrants. for americans to be so ethnocentric is hypocritical because most of the products we use everyday, the homes we live in, the cars we drive, the jobs we work in were a direct result of working immigrants in america.\n  ","427287":"\n  i suppose everyone is in a dangerous position, if they don't trust whom they're sending the images too. it's easy to leak pictures online and ruin a

the managers gave her shit about it, and she said no because she doesn't have to interact with clients. then she told me that it'd probably be the same for me since i don't interact with clients either.\n  \n  so i'm going to dye my hair bright purple and see what happens. lol.\n  ","427292":"\n  if by \"narcissism\" you actually mean self acceptance and self respect, then yes.\n

the hopes that they'd think about the consequences before doing something bad.\n  ","427296":"\n  i think my presentation online is more in tune with my true self, compared to how i portray myself offline.\n  \n  i'm actually really awkward, shy, and nervous in real life 99% of the time, which prevents me from doing a lot of things, and saying a lot of things, that i wish i could say and do.

difference between showing concern for a friend due to their weight (like if they gained or lost an extreme amount of weight in a short period of time) and, on the other hand, outright judging your
