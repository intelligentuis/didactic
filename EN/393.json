 virginity is a social construct and doesn't actually exist on a physical scale. people cannot \"lose\" something that has never physically existed, especially as the hymen can tear years prior to a person having sex for the first time.\n  \n  in addition, the concept of losing one's virginity can be complex, especially in regards to victims of sexual assault. not only is it an inappropriate

a breakdown of memory or identity that often causes a person to have no recollection of large portions of their life.\n  \n  as someone with dissociative amnesia, it's very problematic in my life

blunt person myself. it isn't an admirable quality but it isn't a bad quality to have either.\n  ","421731":"\n  somewhat, yes. however, they're all things that i've achieved on my own so it's moreso having to do with pride than gratitude. i'm the one who found my relationship with my boyfriend (well he did too, lol), i'm the one who worked hard through college to get a good job, and i'm the one who sought out mental health treatment to better my life.\n  ","421732":"\n  lol that is a pretty ableist thing to say. i know plenty of people who are mentally ill and own firearms and are

other words along those lines.\n  ","421744":"\n  i support the me too movement because it's brought to light a lot of abvse that has occurred in not only the entertainment industry, but also in ordinary people's everyday lives -- people feel more comfortable calling out their abvsers.\n  \n  the only concern i have are false accusations, because there's always the possibility of people falsely accusing someone of abvsing them just to garner attention. while the chance of this happening is slim, and i believe we should always take survivors seriously, there's always that possibility and that unsettles me.\n  ","421745":"\n  do you mean coloring books? if so, then yeah -- they don't really do anything therapeutic for me, but they can be relaxing. i always lose interest before i finish a page, though.\n  ","421746":"\n  i've never watched the movies or read the books, and tbh i have no intentions of doing so.\n  \n  from my understanding, they fetishize and normalize abvsive

aren't the same thing as exhibiting paranoia, and sometimes a person's paranoia can be justified.\n  ","421750":"\n  no, not really. getting this far was an actual surprise to me, i never really

where schools have drills in preparation for school shootings, because it can literally happen anywhere at any time.\n  \n  it's a sad truth. and they're becoming more and more frequent because nothing is being done to solve the reasons why they happen in the first place.\n  ","421793":"\n  if you read my profile, you would see that i'm non-binary.\n  \n  regardless, my day is going fine. i uploaded my first poem to my new instagram account, and people are noticing it, so that makes me happy.\n  ","421794":"\n  i'm pro choice. i believe people should have the right to decide if they want to abort a fetus or not.\n  ","421795":"\n  overreact to seemingly normal situations and invest myself too emotionally into people.\n  ","421796":"\n  cigarettes, beer, and my boyfriend.\n  \n  because, you know, priorities.\n  ","421797":"\n  i think people's personal businesses are theirs to own, and they shouldn't be subjected to judgment. if someone is single and wants to have sex, then there's nothing wrong with that.\n  ","421798":"\n  i'd rather not diagnose fictional characters with mental illness, especially characters who exist in the fantasy realm.\n  ","421799":"\n  uh... what.\n  ","421800":"\n  unconditional love and endless partying.\n  ","421801":"\n  yeah, i have. i once stole an engraved knife from an ex friend of mine when he was having a party when i was a teenager.\n  \n  i still have it, actually. it's next to me on my dresser.\n  ","421802":"\n  unbreakable kimmy schmidt depicts PTSD in a really accurate, yet subtle way.\n  \n  the united states of tara also depicts DID in a semi-accurate fashion, according to a few friends who have DID. i've watched a few episodes and it did a good job at bringing awareness to the disorder without ridiculing it.\n  ","421803":"\n  i can't even handle modern day new york, let alone new york in the 1970s.\n  ","421804":"\n  i usually try to sit there and rationalize it to myself -- i usually have good self control so i have enough time to tell myself that there are repurcussions to my actions and i'll regret them the next day. that's usually enough to deter me.\n  \n  however, lately i've been giving into my impulses. specifically, i've been drinking in excess, doing a lot of drugs, and engaging in other risky behaviors during the weekdays when i have work the next day.\n  ","421805":"\n  no, i don't do any of those things when i'm drunk. i'm just simply in a better mood, a bit louder than usual, more daring, and not afraid of social interaction.\n  ","421806":"\n  hey friends, i'm bored rn & drinking, so you should ask me questions. \u2661\n  \n  ask me about ;\n  \n  \u2727 mental health \/ my illnesses\n  \n  \u2727 my career \/ education\n  \n  \u2727 my relationships & friendships\n

exterminator.\n  ","421808":"\n  there have been multiple events that have shaped me into the person i am today -- i believe that we get shaped in small ways by every situation we encounter. while obviously bigger dilemmas and traumas shape us more dramatically, the small situations do as well, and we may not notice the effects right away.\n  ","421809":"\n  i would hope that the date doesn't exist and that my friends were playing a prank on me, because i'm already in a monogamous relationship and have no interest in dating anyone else.\n  ","421810":"\n  no, i generally don't like pancakes. i prefer waffles -- but if i have a choice as to any breakfast item, i'll pick omelettes every time.\n  ","421811":"\n  yeah, i would -- especially with respect to the whole threat to society part. they're still a pedophile, and i wouldn't trust them around children regardless of how much help they're getting. there's always the possibility of relapse, and thoughts like those never truly go away if they exist in the first place.\n  ","421812":"\n  i think hunting as a sport is completely unnecessary. if you're hunting to sustain yourself in the wild, then i think it's acceptable, but i disagree with all other forms.\n  ","421813":"\n  i didn't realize i was a 12 year old in middle school again.\n  ","421814":"\n  i have seven tattoos. this is my most recent one ;\n

if she responds positively then i'll feel better about posting them !!\n  ","421817":"\n  sooooo i wrote two poems today -- if i posted them, would anyone care to read them? i'm nervous to post them

","421819":"\n  the best thing would be if my boyfriend magically appeared at my house with a blunt & six pack of beer.\n  \n  the worst thing would be if everyone i love died somehow in a car crash.

personal treasure. i don't think i cherish anything as much as i cherish coffee.\n  ","421822":"\n  i'm protective of mental health rights & raising awareness of mental illnesses to erase stigmas associated with them.\n  \n  when people criticize those with mental health issues, i get very protective & defensive because it's something that's obviously close to me and there should be more understanding universally that mental illnesses are medical problems, just like any physical illness.\n  ","421823":"\n  it doesn't mean anything to me ; i just like photographs that look dirty \/ gritty, and i luckily found an app where i can edit my photos to give it that effect.\n  ","421824":"\n  i'm from new york.\n  ","421825":"\n  the older i get, the less bullshit i tolerate.\n

feeding off of my body, and occasionally moving to where you can see it from the outside -- that's something straight out of science fiction.\n  \n  i know people think it's beautiful and a miracle of life, but it honestly freaks me out and i don't think i would be able to handle that thought.\n  ","421828":"\n  the idea of being pregnant freaks me the fuck out, but i think i would like to have a child someday.\n  ","421829":"\n  i could never choose just one, lol. i love so many different flavors ;\n  \n  \u2727 earl gray lavender tea\n  \n  \u2727 summer rose black tea\n  \n  \u2727 cherry

progress that needs to be made, but it's hopefully headed in the right direction.\n  ","421831":"\n  i'm not going to continue answering \"is it racist...\" questions because it gets redundant.\n  \n  if you have any doubts whether or not something is racist, it's most likely racist.\n  ","421832":"\n  if you're a child or elderly, then personally i believe it is because children haven't developed a strong immune system yet and the elderly are most susceptible to disease.\n  ","421833":"\n  that's what usually happens during this time of year, especially with how erratic the weather has been lately.\n  \n  also, more people are coming down with the flu because the flu shot this year didn't cover the strain that's going around, and some people are considering it to be an epidemic.\n  ","421834":"\n  february has been all right thus far -- the only notable thing that has happened is that i've been sick, and i'm still getting over it (and probably will be for the next week or so).\n  \n  other than that, nothing much has happened. i went out with a friend last week, i've been seeing my boyfriend regularly, and admittedly i've been giving into my impulses a bit too much lately, which i have to regain control.\n  ","421835":"\n  i usually have 2-3 cups of coffee and 1-2 cups of tea per day. i'll have my morning coffee to wake me up and another coffee around lunch to keep me going.\n  \n  sometimes i'll make a third cup of coffee around 6:30 pm when i get home from work, but usually i just end up making tea, depending on my mood.\n  ","421836":"\n  me too. my previous bitmoji didn't look anything like me, but since they updated the app with new features, you can really customize literally everything, and its so fascinating.\n  ","421837":"\n  aww, thank you !! i'm low key obsessed with it, rofl.\n  ","421838":"\n  no, the definition of one who is centrist is that their political beliefs fall between liberal and conservative. they may share some conservative beliefs, but they may also share liberal beliefs as well, depending on the issue.\n  ","421839":"\n  it isn't unheard of, but it's definitely not as common since most LGBT people are left leaning. however, there are some notable conservatives who are LGBT, i.e. caitlyn jenner. she's a known republican.\n  ","421840":"\n  no, the only times i use a straw are when i order iced coffee from places like starbucks or dunkin donuts.\n  ","421841":"\n  sometimes, yes -- i fear that i'll never make enough money to live independently, i fear that my reckless decisions will negatively impact my future, and i fear that once i do everything i need to do to cement my future, i still won't be happy.\n  ","421842":"\n  no, there isn't much deeper meaning behind it -- i made my character according to how i perceive myself. however, everyone perceives themselves differently to how they actually look, so it isn't like this is an abnormal mode of thinking.\n  ","421843":"\n  i think it's a bit concerning that you're so well versed in the shape of my face to begin with.\n  \n  regardless, it's just a cartoon character -- it doesn't have to resemble me 100%.\n  ","421844":"\n  the cost of living is too high compared to the amount of money a person makes with their salary -- minimum wage hasn't adjusted according to inflation, which results in a lot of people needing to work 2-3 jobs just to survive.\n  ","421845":"\n  i'm quite confused as to how my bitmoji isn't \"honest\" in the first place.\n  ","421846":"\n  well i'm not doing the same things today as i was yesterday, so

depression, unfortunately.\n  ","421851":"\n  yes -- askfm, like many other social media sites, will eventually dissipate as new networks arise over time. i anticipate that what happened with formspring will happen with askfm as well.\n  ","421852":"\n  i love the new bitmoji update because now it rly looks like me ;\n  ","421853":"\n  i didn't really do much over the summer besides work a lot ; there was one weekend where i went to the beach with my best friend, but it was bittersweet because it was a day or two after chester bennington's death so we listened to his music the entire afternoon.\n  ","421854":"\n  my DNA makeup.\n  ","421855":"\n  as far as i'm aware, taking a break with someone you were previously in a relationship with pretty much means you're broken up with the slim chance of getting back together in the future.\n  \n  if you're in the middle of a break and have a one night stand, i don't personally think it's cheating. after all, you're broken up with that person you were previously dating. regardless of how you want to spin it, going on a break insinuates that you've broken up temporarily, regardless of what the future holds.\n  ","421856":"\n  no ?? catfishing is when you pretend to be someone else in a long distance relationship \/ friendship, i.e. using someone else's photos. if you're uncomfortable showing your boyfriend what you look like without makeup, then you're not catfishing, you're just insecure.\n  ","421857":"\n  yeah, i think that would be the best thing to do ; it doesn't necessarily mean that the profile is active, but she should at least be aware of what you found so she can discuss it with her boyfriend.\n  ","421858":"\n  hey friends, i'm bored rn & on my laptop, so you should ask me questions. \u2661\n  \n  ask me

companies when they decide not to cover your medication, etc etc.\n  \n  i think it's a bit ridiculous that most people just find themselves in adult situations when we've mostly had no preparation for adulthood whatsoever. high schools should really have a class that teaches you how to balance a checkbook, prepare your taxes, take out a loan or transfer bank accounts, and other valuable information.\n  ","421860":"\n  i can't really think of any events that have happened lately which have turned out to be significant. my life is pretty boring tbh, and i do the same things week after week.\n  \n  i'm getting my hair colored & shaved next week, if that counts for anything.\n  ","421861":"\n  there are a lot of celebrities who have been born on long island, but none from my particular town (to my knowledge).\n  ","421862":"\n  raspberries, blueberries, cherries, and peaches.\n  ","421863":"\n  it isn't so much the relationship itself, but it's the support i receive from my boyfriend which has validated me and helped me stabilize myself somewhat. if i'm ever in a crisis or having a bad day or slipping into an episode, then i can trust him to say the right things and do what's best for me.\n  ","421864":"\n  yes, i already have friends with different opinions than the ones i hold. it's possible to co exist with people and have civil discussions, even if you don't necessarily agree with some of their opinions.\n  ","421865":"\n  ... alcohol doesn't stay in your system for that long, lmao.\n  \n  trust me -- my alcohol consumption is perfectly fine, and there's no need for you to worry.\n  ","421866":"\n  where did i indicate that i wanted to get drunk? a person can have a few drinks without getting drunk, which i assumed was common knowledge.\n

honest, so there's no point in me doing an honesty hour. i also don't answer sexual questions.\n  ","421871":"\n  ideally, i would love to move down south to the carolinas or virginias. the cost of living is much cheaper there compared to where i live now, and my boyfriend and i would both be able to find jobs there easily enough.\n  ","421872":"\n  i always want questions, haha. they're a good way to pass the time.\n  ","421873":"\n  story of my life, tbh.\n  ","421874":"\n  ahh, i can't imagine that. i'm not like that at all tbh, once i cut someone out they're completely gone to me & i don't even give them a second thought. they become a number to me, not necessarily a person.\n  ","421875":"\n  everyone uses words to refer to themselves in the first person perspective because that's how we're taught to speak. people don't refer to themselves in the third person.\n  ","421876":"\n  sometimes, but it comes and goes in phases, and it depends entirely upon the interests of those around me.\n  ","421877":"\n  no ?? those are just words used to refer to myself. it has absolutely nothing to do with my interests or my personality.\n  ","421878":"\n  it depends on the vibe i get from the account, to be honest -- there are some people who use pseudonyms and don't upload photos of themselves, and they're not fake at all. they're just protecting their identity.\n  \n  however, i've also run into plenty of other users who are clearly fake.\n  ","421879":"\n  i'm not really in a clique on askfm. i'm my own individual.\n  \n  i'd be interested to see if anyone groups me with any other users, though !!\n  ","421880":"\n  idk, it's something i've always contemplated, but never found an answer. i have friends who have had experiences and have some of an idea of some possibility of life after death, but i'm not convinced myself.\n  ","421881":"\n  ... what the hell is this nonsense.\n  ","421882":"\n  lmao, no. the only hats i wear are beanies in the winter.\n  ","421883":"\n  i'm constantly faking at least some parts of myself in order to get by ; faking happiness so that others aren't concerned for my well being, faking stability so that i can survive the day, or faking wellness so that i can convince myself that i'm not sick.\n  \n  sometimes it's moreso an attempt to convince myself than other people. sometimes i'm convinced that my whole persona is fake and the real me got lost among the chaos.\n  ","421884":"\n  i personally don't think so. i haven't done anything amazing with my life thus far, and i don't currently do anything that would necessarily inspire or influence other people.\n  ","421885":"\n  i was never called into the principal's office when i was a child.\n  \n  the only related scenario that has happened was that someone wrote a death threat on a desk i usually sat in, so i was questioned by the police one afternoon. nothing came of it.\n  ","421886":"\n  i usually feel comfortable enough to freely talk to people who are open minded, aren't afraid to express their opinions, and are open to new possibilities. i also enjoy talking to people who offer new perspectives on situations, sides that i've never thought about before.\n  \n  it also helps when people are understanding, good listeners, and compassionate about others. it makes me feel good when i'm telling someone about my feelings and it seems as if they actually care.\n  ","421887":"\n  i would rather be a psychologist -- i actually debated on going into that field when i was in college because psychology has always fascinated me, and i've always been able to relate to people with mental health problems given my own history with mental illness.\n  ","421888":"\n\n   @my_name_isnt_eric\n  \n  and\n  \n   @princess_tal\n  \n  , because who said a valentine can only be limited to one person?\n  ","421889":"\n  no -- it was snowing earlier this morning, but then it turned to ice, and eventually, rain. it's currently raining.\n  ","421890":"\n  sometimes they're necessary, yeah -- especially during the winter if the dog has a thin coat.\n  \n  otherwise, i think they're cute. i know plenty of dogs who love wearing clothes.\n

would say it's the same 15 or so people.\n  ","421893":"\n  emotionally-charged music that you can really hear the emotions of the singer \/ band. one of those songs, for example, is \"drug dealer\" by macklemore. it's such a deep and powerful song.\n  ","421894":"\n  complex mental illnesses, such as personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and schizophrenia (or disorders on the spectrum).\n  \n  so many people talk about depression & anxiety, which is a great start, but i rarely ever see people discussing the aforementioned disorders, which leads a lot of people with those disorders to feel left out and invalidated.\n  \n  in addition, there are a lot of people who claim that they support those who are mentally ill, but when negative symptoms arise, they're nowhere to be found. people need to be aware of the negative symptoms of lesser-known disorders so that we can better understand & treat them.\n  ","421895":"\n  i used to be spiritual when i was younger, but i don't feel that way anymore. i wanted to get into eastern religions, but as i've gotten older, i've become less and less spiritual and now it isn't something i think about anymore.\n  ","421896":"\n  i'm done answering these questions. i'm not going to spend the rest of my night saying what ages are good to date or bad to date.\n  \n  adults shouldn't date children, that's the bottom line.\n  ","421897":"\n  no, not generally. people of those ages are at the same stage in life and can easily understand one another, and relationships between people who are 16 and 18 are actually fairly common.\n  ","421898":"\n  yeah, i would. i personally think that there will always be a reason why someone can't date another person their age, which leads them to look for people who are much younger and more easily manipulated.\n  \n  the age of consent doesn't really make a difference in that respect. it's still creepy and a red flag.\n  ","421899":"\n  society has expectations placed on people which makes it seem abnormal for others to, for example, get married late or decide not to have children or remain single or go down career paths that are less than conventional.\n  \n  people are so concerned with the lives of others that they often don't do any introspection into their own lives, not realizing that one person is no better than another and we simply cannot pass judgment.\n  ","421900":"\n  that's terrible -- the worst part is that we often don't realize the signs until it's much too late.\n  \n  i'm glad you're not in the situation anymore, though, and that you're currently with someone who values you and takes care of you.\n  ","421901":"\n  i relate to this so much. i only dated one man when i was a teenager, but it turned out to be an extremely unhealthy relationship and he ended up cheating on me, which i didn't find out until years later. he also pushed me to do sxxual things with him even though i clearly wasn't ready considering i was a child. the entire situation just makes me shudder now.\n  ","421902":"\n  that's true too -- that's kinda what i was aiming for when i said naive, but you just worded it a lot better than i did.\n  \n  idk, when i was 14, i dated someone who was 18 and soon turning 19 years old. i didn't realize it at the time because i was young and naive, but there was a reason why he couldn't find dates with people his own age and chronically went for people who were much younger than him.\n  ","421903":"\n  it's usually because they're creeps who can't seem to find a date with people their own age, so they prey on younger women and teenagers who are naive and don't know any better.\n  ","421904":"\n  people are sexually attracted to one another because they want to have sex with them, not for procreation, but for pleasure. humans are hedonistic creatures.\n  \n  people are also romantically attracted to one another because of the need for comfort, human touch, companionship, etc. there are also some people who do not experience sexual attraction, only romantic attraction.\n  \n  being gay isn't against the rules of nature like you're suggesting, especially considering humans aren't the only creatures who are gay.\n  ","421905":"\n  my first relationship was with a girl -- i've known that i was bisexual since i was 12 years old.\n  ","421906":"\n  it's a little known fact that only a fraction of women were granted the right to vote, and it excluded working women and women under the age of 30.\n  ","421907":"\n  i usually end up sleeping 10-12 hours a day, i can't eat, i can't shower or maintain proper hygiene, i start crying for absolutely no reason, and i barely move because it feels like my chest is weighing me down.\n  ","421908":"\n  this is probably the third or fourth time i've gotten this question in the past week.\n  \n  i love both dogs and cats.\n  ","421909":"\n  i believe that some people are capable of changing, yes. i think if they get hit with a major life change, like a loved one passing away or seeing a loved one get hurt (two examples), then some people can be motivated to change their ways.\n  \n  obviously not everyone is capable of that kind of transformation, but i've seen it before.\n  ","421910":"\n  bleh ;\n  ","421911":"\n  it makes me more confident in myself because admittedly i'm quite good at applying makeup, so i can hide all of my flaws rather well and embellish on my attributes.\n  \n  it's never felt weird to me at all, though -- especially considering the makeup i use is light and it never feels like there's anything on my skin.\n  ","421912":"\n  i obviously wouldn't encourage drinking alcohol when the child is under the legal age, but at that point, i would hope that they would have a strong enough relationship with me to tell me if they wanted to try it. if they wanted to try it, i would rather it be under my roof in a controlled environment as opposed to a party where they could easily be drugged or lose control.\n  ","421913":"\n  i haven't learned anything today. i've basically been a blob all morning, and the only things i've done have been making breakfast, making coffee, and blow my nose 3829 times.\n  ","421914":"\n  not generally, no. i have the tendency to hold a grudge, i view people differently if they've wronged me, and i usually can't get that scenario out of my head.\n  \n  it isn't the healthiest way to go about conflicts, but i can't help it most of the time. i've always had a difficult time forgiving people because you never know if they're going to do the same things over again.\n  ","421915":"\n  i usually go to ulta because it's easier to get to in my area and they have everything i need. i honestly haven't been needing new makeup in a while though, so i haven't been to ulta in over a year.\n  ","421916":"\n  sometimes, but not usually. right now, my favorite shirt with a saying on it is a grey tee shirt that says \"i run on wine and coffee.\"\n

significant other supports me during my bad waves of mental illness, always knows what to say when i'm feeling hopeless and lost, and gives me space when i need it. they put up with all of my annoying

of situation can be a trigger for my anxiety, whether it's someone's tone of voice when they speak to me, someone saying something i perceive to be threatening, someone not saying anything at all, loud crowded areas, being alone for too long, and sometimes for no reason whatsoever.\n  ","421931":"\n  no -- i'm insecure about myself, i have a fear of abandonment, and i'm always terrified that my

why a person chooses to commit murder, and i do love the gory aspects of certain crimes. at the same time, however, i also find the procedure behind solving a crime to be interesting because it takes a lot of investigative skill and intelligence to piece together a crime scene and locate a suspect.\n  ","422001":"\n  i can understand why some people would want those activities to be private, but i

aren't tried in court to the extent that they should be.\n  ","422003":"\n  that's a common stereotype, but no -- if someone says they're neuroatypical, it means that they've been diagnosed with a behavioral \/ mental \/ cognitive disorder. \"atypical\" means out of the norm.\n  ","422004":"\n  i don't have opinions on people simply because they may be autistic. people with autism exist on a spectrum of functioning, so it's impossible to group everyone with autism and make a judgment call on them on a universal scale.\n  ","422005":"\n  not usually -- i wear deoderant and body spray every

i meet the criteria, even though we've never talked about my trauma or how it's affected my behavior aside from regular depression and anxiety.\n  \n  she basically told me, \"i don't need to know your story because the past doesn't matter and you should move forward with your life because otherwise you'll remain traumatized. you shouldn't even be talking about this in therapy.\"\n  \n  like... how the fuck. trauma is what caused my behavior -- it's why i am the way i am today. even though the abvse isn't happening anymore, i still have symptoms resulting from it and just because you don't like labels doesn't mean you should take something off my chart that's been discussed in detail before and my precious doctor said i fit the criteria.\n  \n  i'm just so fucking pissed off at the lack

questions. \u2661\n  \n  ask me about ;\n  \n  \u2727 mental health \/ my illnesses\n  \n  \u2727 my career \/ education\n  \n  \u2727 my relationships & friendships\n  \n  \u2727 my hobbies, i.e. art, writing, video games\n  \n  \u2727 tv shows & movies\n  \n  \u2727 anything else you can think of !!\n  \n  \u2727 politics & social activism\n  \n  i don't answer sexual questions, so any questions regarding sex will be deleted ~~\n  ","422045":"\n  1. my father -- we were talking about him driving me to get blood work done next week.\n  \n  2. my first friend was someone whose name started with a D. i remember them solely because i was extremely upset when they moved away.\n  \n  4. i only have a closely knit group of a few friends, perhaps 4 or 5 at the most. it's all i need.\n

colors of the leaves, the cooler temperatures, halloween, etc etc.\n  \n  9. i don't dance regularly, but i will at special occasions such as weddings.\n  \n  10. my favorite fruits are cherries, blueberries, mangoes, and peaches.\n  ","422046":"\n  there aren't in my neighborhood since i live in a suburban area, but there are a few different fruits which grow on long island.\n  \n  if you head out east, you run into dozens of different apple orchards and vineyards. there are wineries and cidarhouses everywhere.\n  ","422047":"\n  i've personally always used xbox, but the playstation consoles are also really good -- playstation tends to have better console-exclusive games, but xbox is more of an entertainment unit in that it has more apps and features than just gaming.\n  \n  you should probably research the perks of both xbox and playstation, and go from there. every gamer has different needs.\n  ","422048":"\n  i usually just kill them, unless they're big enough to where i wouldn't feel comfortable killing them. then usually i'll just trap them and release them outside.\n  ","422049":"\n  i had deactivated for about a year once, due to a lot of personal problems going on in my life as well as not having enough time since i was a student.\n  ","422050":"\n  40 hours, or so. it definitely was not a fun time.\n  ","422051":"\n  today wasn't wonderful, but it wasn't terrible either. nothing particularly eventful happened, which i suppose can be a good thing sometimes because it's better than having a bad day.\n  \n  i'm just really looking forward to sleeping. a lot.\n  ","422052":"\n  i've already listened to it dozens of times over, it's such a heart wrenching rendition of his grief and i'm so proud of the courage it took for him to record those songs.\n  ","422053":"\n  i'm ambitious when it comes to my relationships and my career. i'm always looking to progress one step forward regardless of where i am, and i value honesty and integrity when it comes to both personal and professional relationships.\n  ","422054":"\n  i feel as if they're one in the same, because my boyfriend would be proud of me for doing things that make me proud of myself -- he understands the value of self love and reassurance, and he's always an advocate for doing things that make you feel good about yourself.\n  ","422055":"\n  black, naturally -- i need to keep my aesthetic strong.\n  ","422056":"\n  if they're questions that can be easily answered by what's already in my bio, then i'll answer the question and also refer the person to my bio.\n  \n  however, i also know that my page is very active so obviously everyone isn't going to read all of my answers. so in that respect, i don't really mind the repetition.\n  ","422057":"\n  nobody is addicted to

that i was able to get up in the morning, go to work, be productive for eight hours, and then survive the commute home.\n  ","422060":"\n  it doesn't phase me. i share birthdays with a lot of people.\n  ","422061":"\n  it would be a red flag if the person i was dating was rude to the staff of the establishment we were visiting -- i have no patience for people who don't respect retail and food service workers.\n  ","422062":"\n  i agree !! however, i'm probably biased because i think most animals are cute.\n  ","422063":"\n  i've only been on three interviews in my entire life, but i've been offered jobs from all three of them, so i guess i wasn't terrible.\n  \n  which is ironic because job interviews give me panic attacks, but i guess the hiring managers would never think that about me based on my conduct lol.\n  ","422064":"\n  -- listen to my favorite music with me\n  \n  -- buy me coffee\n  \n  -- offer to go to the bar for a drink and a chat\n  \n  -- give me an animal

","422068":"\n  i have so many emotions regarding his death. i've been angry, frustrated, in shock, grieving, depressed, broken, lost, and confused. he was my idol growing up, and he taught me how to survive in the chaotic world i was living in. i owe my life to chester.\n  ","422069":"\n  it depends on the day -- some days i get more bullshit than others. i usually delete racist propaganda, messages in other languages, and most messages that are statements instead of questions, as well as sexual questions.\n  ","422070":"\n  i don't really think about my future wedding because that's so far in advance from now and i have more important goals right now than getting married.\n  \n  ideally, i would like for it to be small and low key, but i know it's going to have to be an elaborate party because of the size of my boyfriend's family.\n  ","422071":"\n  self love is the ability to be comfortable and confident in yourself, embracing your flaws and attributes and understanding that your needs will sometimes come first before other people's needs.\n  \n  practicing self love and self care include doing things that make you happy, recharged, and relaxed when you need to be, whether it's through taking a bath or reading a book or taking a day off from work to give yourself a chance to breathe.\n  ","422072":"\n  i've never read any of her books, so no. i didn't even know who she was until this message.\n  ","422073":"\n  i've never felt an earthquake before, no. i have, however, experienced multiple hurricanes.\n  ","422074":"\n  i smoke every day -- i'm a smoker, after all.\n  ","422075":"\n  tomorrow, i'm going to work and then hopefully i'm going to see my boyfriend after work. my weekdays aren't really too spectacular.\n  ","422076":"\n  not generally, no. most people with mental illness function in society, so it's difficult to tell if someone struggles with mental illness based solely on appearance \/ behavior alone.\n  ","422077":"\n  that's an extremely harsh and misguided generalization -- there are dozens of reasons why people use public transportation, whether it's because they simply don't drive or because it's easier to use public transportation than to own a car.\n  ","422078":"\n  no -- i always have to be doing something in order to occupy myself, otherwise i become withdrawn and depressed. even if the things i'm doing are relaxing activities such as playing video games or watching a tv show, it's still something that takes my mind off of things and allows me to focus.\n  ","422079":"\n  i always believed in \"quality over quantity.\" therefore, i think a short but fulfilling life would honestly be better because although you won't live as long, you made the most out of every day handed to you and created beautiful experiences and stories.\n  ","422080":"\n  for work, i mainly write press releases and narratives for my company's clients, who are basically extremely accomplished individuals across the globe. i was also trained on writing newsletter features today, which is exciting because there's more creative freedom involved in those.\n  \n  aside from work, i write non-fiction articles for medium.com occasionally, usually about mental health and my experiences. unfortunately, i haven't written anything since last july.\n  ","422081":"\n  i actually really enjoyed science, and i was in all honors classes throughout high school -- i had taken AP biology, AP chemistry, and a forensics class through syracuse university.\n  \n  i liked forensics most of all because the subject matter was intriguing to me, especially learning about ballistics and blood splatter patterns. my teacher set up a crime scene as a final test and we had to determine what had happened, and we were graded based on our conclusions.\n  ","422082":"\n  if you have a recommendation from a previous employer, it looks better to hiring managers because you're being endorsed as reliable by someone who has worked with you in the past. depending on your resume, recommendations can make you stand out among other applicants.\n  ","422083":"\n  hey dumbass, don't forget to take your meds tonight before you go out so that you don't have a panic attack tomorrow ~~\n  ","422084":"\n  no, i think lightning is quite beautiful. i absolutely love thunderstorms.\n  ","422085":"\n  there isn't anything that makes me feel free from everyday struggles, but keeping busy does help keep my mind at bay -- whether it's through writing, being preoccupied with a tv show, playing video games, or catching up with a close friend.\n  ","422086":"\n  i don't own any gadgets, since i'm not really into new technology. the only cool thing that i have which is sorta like a gadget is a nightlight that's an exact replica of

crush\" since middle \/ high school, and i'm cringing.\n  ","422089":"\n  to the fullest extent -- addiction is a health care problem and to deny someone treatment because they're a drug addict is not only cruel, but it's morally wrong and goes against every code of ethics there is.\n  \n  drug addicts need medical treatment and support, not to be ostracized and ridiculed.\n  ","422090":"\n  love is an intimate, emotional connection you share with someone on multiple levels. lust, on the other hand, is fueled by sexual desire based solely upon physical appearance.\n  ","422091":"\n  yes and no -- if someone is young and watches pvrn, they might get wrong ideas about how sex actually works because they're inexperienced themselves. pvrn is grossly inaccurate when it comes to sexual conduct, which can mislead and misinform a lot of people if they don't know any better.\n  \n  i don't think pvrn has any effect on how people perceive love because sex and love are two vastly different things.\n  ","422092":"\n  no, i'm an athiest. i don't believe in any sort of higher power.\n  ","422093":"\n  i love visiting museums, but i haven't actually been to a museum in a very long time. i used to visit new york city and go to various exhibits, such as the ones in the museum of modern art and museum of natural history.\n  ","422094":"\n  i have seven tattoos so far -- i eventually want to cover my entire body in tattoos. my next pieces are going to cover my right forearm and the back of my right arm.\n  ","422095":"\n  you don't need to be religious in order to have a decent standard of morals. you can view scenarios as good or bad based on how they'll affect other people, with no influence from religion whatsoever.\n  ","422096":"\n  i don't necessarily feel comfortable with people touching me, but i do get my hair colored professionally and get my nails professionally done occasionally, simply because they're trained to be proficient in those areas and can do them better than i can.\n  ","422097":"\n  because i don't feel the need to properly capitalize or spell my words on the internet. i like the look of lowercase words better.\n  ","422098":"\n  yeah, he is. he was raised a christian, but he started doubting the existence of god when he was a teenager. he's an atheist these days.\n  ","422099":"\n  my eyes, my ability to put on makeup, my writing and research skills, etc etc.\n  ","422100":"\n  i don't remember the last time i actually used the word hell in a sentence (unless you can show me).\n  \n  either way, it's a hyperbole. a cliche expression. everyone uses the term hell to refer to something bad, it isn't really a big deal.\n  ","422101":"\n  not usually. sometimes i think of something witty, but it's rare.\n  ","422102":"\n  no, it's still quite active (at least my feed is active). it's certainly not as active as it was last year since a lot of regulars left, but i wouldn't consider it to be dead yet.\n  ","422103":"\n  my region is fairly dangerous, so yeah, sometimes i do feel unsafe where i live. i carry a knife and whistle with me at all times, just in case someone were to try to jump me.\n  \n  i'd like to change the drug epidemic that's sweeping my county. heroin is the most popular drug here, and lately it's been laced with fentanyl, so it's extremely lethal. i've lost many people to heroin over the years.\n  ","422104":"\n  i'm not attacking you. i'm merely stating that i don't have conversations with people on askfm, yourself included. for some reason, you can't take no for an answer.\n  ","422105":"\n  i watch things which capture my interest immediately -- usually gritty action films, psychological thrillers, and suspenseful dramas.\n  ","422106":"\n  it can be a mutual decision while also being a surprise -- knowing the exact moment when someone is going to propose takes away all of the fun and surprise of getting engaged.\n  \n  you can know that you want to marry a person without knowing when they'll propose to you.\n  ","422107":"\n  i can't exactly predict that, haha. if i knew, then that would take away the surprise.\n  ","422108":"\n  unfortunately, i didn't get to see him yesterday because he went into queens to visit his family. however, today we're just going to relax at my house (my family has gifts for him).\n  ","422109":"\n  skyrim, fallout 4, destiny 1 and 2, the halo series, life is strange, the wolf among us, assassin's creed, the bioshock series, dragon age: inquisition, and tomb raider.\n  ","422110":"\n  long island is the area where i live -- it's an island that juts off of the state of new york.\n  ","422111":"\n  my boyfriend's birthday was yesterday and he ended up ordering his own cake.\n  \n  i literally can't right now djfkdkajsjfkds.\n  ","422112":"\n  for my job, i edit press releases, magazine features, and other text related to my company's brand.\n  \n  i also write press releases for clients as well that are distributed on various PR websites. the CEO of the company wants more writing to be done in house (as opposed to remotely), so i'll be writing a lot more in the future !!\n  ","422113":"\n  well, yeah -- you're not a teenager anymore, so it's only logical to consider a 20 year old to be in their 20s.\n  ","422114":"\n  the only language i know is english, unfortunately. however, i've always wanted to learn russian and latin.\n  ","422115":"\n  through music -- if i can't find a way to express myself through writing, then i'll resort to music in an effort to show others how i feel or put my emotions into a melody to make me feel less lonely.\n  \n  i should clarify that i don't make music myself, but i do listen to music every day and stand by the notion that there is a song for virtually every mood or circumstance.\n  ","422116":"\n  obviously? lmao, the fuck kind of question is this.\n  ","422117":"\n  sometimes, i do. however, it's usually only when i've done my makeup and look somewhat presentable.\n  ","422118":"\n  if you're going to keep carrying on like this, then i'll have no choice but to discontinue answering your statements. spirituality is not at all correlated with mental illness, because one is a matter of faith and the other is a matter of science.\n  \n  i'm not in the mood to listen to this sort of talk because i get the impression that you don't respect my beliefs, and i'm frankly tired of people discounting mental illness for what it truly is.\n  ","422119":"\n  the way to treat mental illness is by taking medication and going to therapy, whether it's inpatient or outpatient procedures. to move on from my trauma, i have years of therapy to go through, because it's only through intensive CBT or DBT that i'll come to an understanding of my trauma, develop healthy coping mechanisms, and control my behavior.\n  \n  in addition, mental illness is mostly a chronic condition, and there are some mental illnesses that exist which afflict a person for their entire life. it can be treated and managed, but not eradicated completely. it's just the way psychology and physiology works, and it has no correlation with religion or spirituality.\n  ","422120":"\n  good thing i'm not a buddhist then. i'm 99% certain that my mental illnesses are a result of the 10+ years of abvse i endured, not because of some mindset that can't be substantiated by evidence.\n  ","422121":"\n  i honestly have doubts about living the life i live now, so living another life after this one would honestly not be appealing to me.\n  ","422122":"\n  i absolutely did. he had one of those personalities that attracted me on a romantic level, and all i wanted to do was get to know him better and talk to him all the time. you could tell there was mystery behind his eyes, and i wanted to know everything about him.\n  ","422123":"\n  i think my life would be more difficult and lonely if i didn't have a phone, because it means i wouldn't have access to social media, which helps me substantially when it comes to my mental health.\n  \n  i also wouldn't be able to talk to my friends as often, which in turn would make me believe that they hate me.\n  ","422124":"\n  abandonment.\n  ","422125":"\n  you're under no obligation to talk to people you're no longer friends with, regardless of whether or not you have a mutual friend. that mutual friend of yours needs to understand that you don't have to be friends with their friends in order to be friends with them (i hope that makes sense).\n  ","422126":"\n  it could be construed as \"creepy\" because it insinuates that you're interested in having sex with her and you want to make sure she's of legal age.\n  ","422127":"\n  i honestly don't remember -- quite a few months, as i had to accumulate more than 1,000 followers again in order to meet the criteria for verification.\n  ","422128":"\n  people use social media as a place to vent and receive validation, so by posting things that her child is doing, she probably was releasing her frustrations as well as expecting other mothers to relate to her experience.\n  \n  having an ill mannered child isn't really something unusual or a big deal, especially at that age. people are allowed to complain.\n  ","422129":"\n  BPD means \"borderline personality disorder.\"\n  ","422130":"\n  i'm a very paranoid person. i'm usually suspicious of people's motives, i always think people are following me, i have to check rooms for doors and exits, and i'm constantly aware of my environment.\n  ","422131":"\n  yeah, i actually love swimming. i can't swim very well but i love the feeling of being underwater. it's so peaceful.\n  ","422132":"\n  no, not really. i used to smoke a lot of weed in the past, but in recent years, it's only made me incredibly paranoid and i didn't like the way it made me feel.\n  \n  however, i'm interested in trying one of those new pens that are out now instead of smoking a traditional joint or bowl. it seems to be a lot smoother with better quality.\n  ","422133":"\n  this makes me laugh every time i see it ;\n  ","422134":"\n  no. i've never felt okay with the way i look. i also try not to look at my reflection in the mirror because it makes me uncomfortable and i don't want to upset myself.\n  ","422135":"\n  nothing too out of the ordinary, so no. it was just an average day at work, and i've just been relaxing ever since i got home.\n  \n  i guess you can consider it to be a good day since it's pay day and i got out of work an hour early.\n  ","422136":"\n  a life free from anxiety. it would be nice to be able to leave my house and actually do things without getting overwhelmed with anxiety or harboring the fear of having a panic attack.\n  ","422137":"\n  yeah, i'd rather not discuss my flatulence or bowel movements on askfm.\n  ","422138":"\n  when i'm angry, i do -- i tend to talk a lot faster and my accent slips out more, haha.\n  \n  but generally speaking, i don't think i have much of an accent. it's difficult to tell when it comes to your own voice.\n  ","422139":"\n  lol, no. i just happen to use it a lot because i have a caffeine addiction.\n  ","422140":"\n  the past can determine the future in some cases, but only if you allow your past to dictate your life -- even though terrible things happen in people's pasts that undoubtedly change them, it's ultimately their decision as to whether or not they're going to try to move forward.\n  ","422141":"\n  despair is more consolidating, in my opinion. people relate to each other more when they've shared similar experiences in times of struggle or hardship, and often when tragedy occurs, people bind together to support one another.\n  \n  there's comfort in trying times because there will always be someone who will offer a helping hand. you're never alone, and that's a beautiful thing about humanity.\n  ","422142":"\n  i'm doing all right -- tired because i stayed out late last night, and i'm probably going to take a nap when i get home.\n  \n  work has been well today, though. i've been writing for the past two days, so that makes me happy.\n  ","422143":"\n  if you're both comfortable with the concept and there's no sexual tension, then i don't see the problem. i've seen some of my friends partially nude before.\n  ","422144":"\n  haha, thanks !!\n  \n  yeah, i get a lot of hate here for whatever reason. it doesn't bother me though, no one knows my life except for me.\n  ","422145":"\n  god forbid i have a few drinks with my boyfriend and a few friends LOL.\n  ","422146":"\n  no, i'm at the bar with my boyfriend and a few friends.\n  ","422147":"\n  no. i'm non-binary.\n  ","422148":"\n  i don't have any haters in real life, haha.\n  ","422149":"\n  i can certainly sing, but that doesn't mean i'm good at singing. i'm actually quite terrible.\n  ","422150":"\n  no, i'm not engaged.\n  ","422151":"\n  my boyfriend and i might be going on a double date to manhattan on sunday to go ice skating !!\n  \n  i'm !! so !! excited !!\n  ","422152":"\n  a few years ago, perhaps sooner than that. i only really started identifying as non-binary two years ago, even though i always knew that i never identified as a woman.\n  \n  the first time i told my best friend that i was trans, she was shocked and said, \"you didn't know?! i've known this since high school!\"\n  ","422153":"\n  this damn animal, she's the cutest ~~\n  ","422154":"\n  this isn't a question, but hello regardless.\n  ","422155":"\n  considering i have dissociative amnesia and can't remember 11 years of my life, it would be beneficial to me to have memories of my past. it's something i've always sought after, and i'm considering going to a regression hypnotherapist soon.\n  ","422156":"\n  sometimes it's hard to see at first because it may seem like the wrong choice, especially if someone gets hurt in the process -- but generally speaking, if the decision you made will ultimately improve your life or someone else's life in the long run, then it's the right choice.\n  ","422157":"\n  no -- you need to to put in a lot of hard work to make a relationship last as well. if you love someone but don't put in the effort to show it or communicate your feelings with your partner, then your relationship might fail.\n  ","422158":"\n  that's a bit concerning if i look 15 years old, but thank you nonetheless.\n  ","422159":"\n  i look up to a lot of people on askfm, for their dedication, bravery, and intelligence. some have left askfm, but there are also others who still answer questions here.\n  ","422160":"\n  i'd pay off all of my loans and buy a house for my boyfriend and i to live in. i'd also buy my boyfriend a new car.\n  ","422161":"\n  obviously. consent is required for every form of activity, sexual or otherwise. sex just be consensual, otherwise it's assault or rvpe, regardless of whether or not someone is in a relationship.\n  ","422162":"\n  i don't really know how to cook, so no. i can make simple meals, but nothing extravagent.\n  ","422163":"\n  i used to be, but i haven't felt ambition in a long time. when i'm given no other option, then i can push myself to my full potential and make enormous strides. however, most of the time i'm content with where i am because i have too many other conflicts going on.\n  ","422164":"\n  yeah, there is. i really appreciate my job because there are a lot of opportunities for growth, managers are protective of their employees' rights, and they're incredibly understanding of health issues.\n  ","422165":"\n  i honestly don't know. i've never really thought about naming a future child, so there aren't any names that i prefer.\n  ","422166":"\n  yeah, sometimes. i mostly use his nickname, though.\n  ","422167":"\n  not at all. my dad and i get along well, even though our relationship is distant. my mother is the one who has caused most of my problems in my life, and she's just a difficult person to live with in general.\n  ","422168":"\n  not really, no. i usually just deal with things as they come up, otherwise i'll be too preoccupied with the \"what ifs\" of things falling apart.\n  ","422169":"\n  tapestries and string lights on the walls; big bay windows that shine natural light into the room; a reading nook with shelves for books; a king sized bed with a cozy, plush comforter and silky sheets; enough room for a fish tank and a big screen tv hooked up to my xbox; and paintings on the walls.\n  ","422170":"\n  i assume that my parents trust me when it comes to most things -- however, the topic never comes up, so i can't be sure.\n  \n  i don't trust my mother, though. she's abvsed and gaslighted me for my entire life, so i never believe anything she says anymore.\n  ","422171":"\n  venting to someone who's willing to listen is extremely helpful when it comes to dealing with personal issues, as long as the person you're venting to is responsive to what you have to say and is willing to support you.\n  \n  it's one of the only methods of treatment for my mental illness, which is why i advocate so strongly for psychotherapy. being listened to and validated is important.\n  ","422172":"\n  my boyfriend. he's my greatest support system and idk what i would do without him.\n  ","422173":"\n  pretty much, depending on the circumstance. as much as i preach about honesty and communication, i'm usually the person who fakes being fine in work and social settings, otherwise i'll just fall apart.\n  ","422174":"\n  no, it's not just you. that is rather aggravating, especially if you poured your heart out to them and they don't seem as if they even acknowledged your feelings.\n  ","422175":"\n  i never indicated that i was ever having top surgery.\n  ","422176":"\n  no -- i keep my relationships with my mentors \/ bosses strictly professional, as i find no reason to become emotionally involved with them. to become emotionally invested with a figure of authority in a work setting would only put my job at risk.\n  ","422177":"\n  people with psychotic disorders and antisocial personality disorder are just as deserving of compassion and treatment as those with other mental illnesses.\n  \n  there's no benefit to screening for such illnesses (not to mention it would be impossible anyway), and to suggest so is discriminatory toward people with those illnesses.\n  ","422178":"\n  if i didn't enjoy smoking, then i simply wouldn't smoke.\n  ","422179":"\n  yeah, that would be incredibly rude if you used their financial status against them like that. how much money a person does or doesn't have doesn't dictate whether they're right or wrong in a situation. it's inconsiderate of you to behave in this manner.\n  ","422180":"\n  i like menthol cigarettes, and these ones taste like peppermint sticks to me.\n  ","422181":"\n  i'm in dark mental places occasionally, but it isn't as bad as how it used to be when i was 18\/19 years old.\n  ","422182":"\n  i don't really walk around that often, so no. i mostly smoke in my car, on my breaks at work, and in my own backyard.\n  ","422183":"\n  i'd much rather have an informal, whimsical gathering of close friends and family. weddings are too expensive these days and place the couple in too much debt, and i would like to avoid that if possible.\n  \n  my boyfriend and i don't need a huge, fancy wedding to prove our love for one another. i much prefer the look of small, quaint, outdoor weddings anyway.\n  ","422184":"\n  i love mangoes, actually. they're among some of my favorite fruit !!\n  \n  my boyfriend's bearded dragon and i were sharing some mango slices the other day, haha.\n  ","422185":"\n  i'm tired and emotional -- idk why i'm tired, but i'm feeling emotional because i was thinking of the relationship i have with my boyfriend's family, and i feel so grateful to have his family support us as much as they do. i get along so well with his father and step sisters and step mother, and they basically consider me part of the family already. it makes me tear up.\n  ","422186":"\n  look at these badass fucking boots ;\n  ","422187":"\n  this is my most recent tattoo and among the ones which have the most meaning -- it's the symbol for the band linkin park.\n  \n  they've been an integral part of my life and it was the least i could do to memorialize chester bennington.\n  ","422188":"\n  which tattoo? i have seven of them.\n  ","422189":"\n  i live with my parents, so there's three of us total.\n  ","422190":"\n  i wouldn't give out compliments if i didn't mean them -- i think it would honestly be cruel if you complimented a person and didn't actually mean it just to make them \"feel better.\" most of the time, people can tell when a compliment isn't sincere.\n  ","422191":"\n  i'm not sure. this is one of those questions that i'll always contemplate but never know the answer.\n  ","422192":"\n  idk if any of you have played the emotional journey of life is strange, but i'm currently playing the prequel (life is strange: before the storm), and omg i'm in tears.\n  \n  don't play this game if you're emotionally unstable or get attached to characters. you will be heartbroken.\n  ","422193":"\n  ahh, thank you !! that means so much to me. :'))\n  ","422194":"\n  considering i said i was addicted to cigarettes, yeah -- i smoke.\n  ","422195":"\n  in the past, i wrote a lot of poetry and short fictional stories that were loosely based on my life.\n  \n  my most recent works have been articles that were nonfiction in nature, depicting my struggles with mental illness and my past. i have them up on medium.com.\n  \n  i've been wanting to write another article since it's been months since i've written creatively, but i have no idea what to write.\n  ","422196":"\n  not necessarily -- it's common nature for most children to act out in public, regardless of the way they've been raised. you can't expect a child to behave like a little angel all of the time, especially considering how much stimuli exists in most public places.\n  \n  what can indicate toward bad parenting is the way the parent reacts to their child acting out.\n  ","422197":"\n  i have the tendency to be, but i've learned to control my anger over the years because i've realized that i can be destructive when i'm angry and i don't want to be that person anymore.\n  ","422198":"\n  i've come across a few publications that do the same thing, and one of my online friends actually is an editor for one magazine that does exactly that !!\n  \n  it's something i definitely want to look into more once i start writing more often. i need to get my name out there and make something of myself.\n  ","422199":"\n  my family, tbh. i'm nice to them to keep the peace and to prevent arguments from breaking out, because it's a lot easier to lie and be nice to certain people than it is to say how you truly feel, unfortunately.\n  \n  it isn't something i would really recommend to other people, but it makes life easier for my own sake.\n  ","422200":"\n  lmao, the fuck?\n  \n  of course not -- that's not how it works. my father is still home every day to help out, and i can't put my life on hold because of my mother. she's the reason behind my mental illnesses, so the best thing for my own health would be to move out and move on with my life, instead of being stuck in the same abvsive environment for the rest of my years.\n  ","422201":"\n  i carry a weapon with me at all times.\n  ","422202":"\n  a support system. it's difficult to get through life if you don't have a person or a few people upon whom you can rely and who might offer love and compassion when you need it most.\n  ","422203":"\n  i double and triple check every door in the house to make sure they're locked within minutes of each other, and i always lock the doors the second i enter the house, regardless of who's home and what time of day it is.\n  ","422204":"\n  i believe that people's purposes become clear to them eventually throughout their life. some people figure out their purpose early on, while for others, it may not become clear until much later in life.\n  ","422205":"\n  somewhat -- i know that i want to be an advocate for mental health awareness and that i want to help people through my writing, but i haven't been able to really fuse the two together yet.\n  \n  i'm sure it'll come in due time, whether an idea comes to me or an opportunity presents itself to me.\n  ","422206":"\n  hell no -- i take selfies on the rare occasion when i feel good about myself, or there's something or someone else in the picture that makes up for how shitty i look that day.\n  \n  here's a photo i just took while i was taking care of quinn (she likes mangoes btw) ;\n  ","422207":"\n  LOL, this was a convo between myself and my boyfriend a few weeks ago. i have a really unhealthy obsession with baja blast ;\n  ","422208":"\n  no? even if i did, that's not something i advertise to other people, especially on askfm. my sex life is private to me.\n  ","422209":"\n  i'm doing well -- my boyfriend and i ended up sleeping for 10 hours straight after we finished dinner last night, and we spent the morning talking and listening to music and making breakfast and drinking coffee.\n  \n  we're about to go out and run some errands, actually. it feels nice to finally have a day off together.\n  ","422210":"\n  this is my boyfriend's beardie -- her name is quinn. \u2661\n  ","422211":"\n  i don't have one favorite song in particular, but lately i've been listening to linkin park nonstop. my favorite songs from them at the moment are \"sharp edges\" and \"talking to myself.\"\n  ","422212":"\n  i'm always honest in my responses, so every weekend is essentially honesty weekend.\n  ","422213":"\n  oh, then in that case, i think they're fun. as long as they're obviously not discriminatory, i see no harm in them.\n  ","422214":"\n  i shut down at first because my emotions overwhelm me and i feel frozen in place. i need time to calm down and collect my thoughts, and at that point, i can talk to the person about whatever issue we have.\n  ","422215":"\n  i have extreme and unstable mood swings -- one hour i can be content, the next hour i can be angry with no reason, and the next hour i can be depressed. there isn't really any in between with me, but my mood swings have gotten better with medication.\n  ","422216":"\n  i had no idea trump used askfm.\n  ","422217":"\n  yeah -- i used to be on formspring.me. before i migrated to askfm, and i'm also active on curiouscat.\n  ","422218":"\n  nobody ever uses pick up lines on me because i intimidate a lot of people in real life and deter people from talking to me.\n  ","422219":"\n  nothing has been inspiring me lately. i used to be inspired by nature, my relationship, things i encountered every day, etc etc. however, nothing has really popped out at me in a really long time, and its quite discouraging.\n  ","422220":"\n  fun fact #1 ; my high school made national news because someone filmed a brutal fight between two students on school grounds and it went viral.\n  \n  fun fact #2 ; we had at least two bomb threats per year which required us to take a bus to the local park while bomb sniffing dogs and police crew swept the entire school grounds.\n  ","422221":"\n  i want to continue going to therapy on a weekly basis and continue seeing my psychiatrist every month. it's helped me a lot to talk to people who have a deeper knowledge of mental health and want to actually make my life better.\n  \n  i also want to be more open about my feelings with my boyfriend. instead of pushing him away and isolating myself when i feel terrible, i want to reach out more and not be afraid that i'm burdening him with my problems.\n  ","422222":"\n  he's my best friend as well as my boyfriend. we can sit down and talk for hours straight without getting bored, we can share songs well into the night, and he understands me better than i know myself.\n  \n  he's always been there to support me regardless of how i was acting, he's sought to understand my illnesses where most people would push me away, and he's always respected me. i love him because he makes me a better person than who i was before and gives me a reason to continue living.\n  ","422223":"\n  this is a complicated question. i'm alive, and that's all that really matters.\n  ","422224":"\n  i've learned AP style of writing and editing, as well as learning how to pace myself and to work on assignments in an efficient but timely manner.\n  ","422225":"\n  my forensics teacher during high school was great -- he had come from a poor background but used his experiences to motivate him to become educated and use his knowledge to help students. he was really open about his past, was trustworthy, and taught me a lot. his class was also very interesting and entertaining.\n  ","422226":"\n  no, not yet. we're hoping to move in together later this year.\n  ","422227":"\n  i feel as if this is some sort of transphobic riddle that i want nothing to do with.\n  ","422228":"\n  -- supported me during my bad days when my mental illnesses act up\n  \n  -- respected my decisions, my career choices, and my inclination to be alone\n  \n  -- surprised me with my favorite things when i least expected it\n  \n  -- defended me when people have verbally attacked me or attempted to make me uncomfortable\n  \n  -- introduced me to his friends and wasn't afraid to show his love and affection regardless of where we are\n  ","422229":"\n  my current job isn't my dream job, but it's within my field of expertise, which is great. i can only hope to continue living forward in this path.\n  \n  i'd ideally also like to branch out into fiction writing, but that also requires me to write creatively when i'm not in the office, which i haven't had the mental energy to do in quite a while.\n  ","422230":"\n  if you're having sex and you're experiencing pain, then you're doing it wrong.\n  ","422231":"\n  i think it would be a good step forward for women's equality. however, i would like a president that's actually educated in politics and international affairs as opposed to someone who's a woman with no experience whatsoever.\n  ","422232":"\n  \"good old days\" by macklemore featuring kesha.\n  \n  \"sharp edges\" by linkin park.\n  ","422233":"\n  i like the taste of bacon, but admittedly i've been feeling guilty about eating it. i want to transition to a vegetarian lifestyle eventually.\n  ","422234":"\n  fresh balsam, gasoline, cigarette smoke, freshly brewed coffee, the icy smell of winter in the air, jasmine, and rose.\n  ","422235":"\n  no worries, anon, i have no interest in politics.\n  ","422236":"\n  i dislike my real name, which is why i only go by my nickname(s).\n  ","422237":"\n  i'm not really a part of any fandoms, but i've always liked the idea that hermione from the harry potter movies was black.\n  ","422238":"\n  i won't be old enough to run for president in 2020, lol. but i appreciate the thought ~~\n  ","422239":"\n  i'm presently in a relationship and have no intentions of dating anyone else.\n  ","422240":"\n  my schedule doesn't change depending on the season, unfortunately. i still have work, doctor appointments, therapy, etc etc.\n  \n  i've always wanted to go apple or pumpkin picking, but i usually get turned off from it because traffic is normally ridiculous and i don't want to walk around a pumpkin patch with 384828 other people.\n  ","422241":"\n  i would probably be shocked, angry, and concerned for his well being because it would be out of character for him. feelings don't suddenly change overnight so i would assume that something happened to make him react so irrationally, and i would be there for him.\n  ","422242":"\n  no. i'm uncomfortable with physical touch, and the only people i allow to hug me are my boyfriend and best friend.\n  ","422243":"\n  i wonder if these people realize that most porn on the internet is free.\n  ","422244":"\n  since when has my page been a dumping ground for assholes and idiots?\n  ","422245":"\n  i'm advising you that it's inappropriate to ask anyone about any aspect of their sex lives. it's not about \"how,\" it's about steering clear of the topic entirely.\n  ","422246":"\n  this isn't an appropriate question to ask a stranger. i would suggest that you refrain from asking strangers online about their sex lives.\n  ","422247":"\n  you're not going to get anywhere in life if you keep giving into your shy behavior. if you want something, you have to go and pursue it. if you like a girl and want to ask her out on a date, then you're going to have to step outside of your comfort zone and just ask her.\n  ","422248":"\n  ... why am i getting messages that make literally no sense.\n  ","422249":"\n  ... leigh. it literally says it at the top of my page and at the beginning of every answer.\n  ","422250":"\n  everyone needs a sense of identity -- a sense of who you are as an individual, your opinions and morals, your attributes and flaws, your personality which makes you unique. most people inherently have a sense of self, it isn't something most people think about.\n  ","422251":"\n  sometimes, sure. i often ruminate on the things i've said and done in the past and wish i could have approached situations differently.\n  ","422252":"\n  i'm really down today for some reason. i guess my therapy session last night got me thinking about my past, and it made me feel bitter and resentful about what has happened over the years.\n  \n  i was literally a child. i didn't deserve the things that happened to me, and even if i was an unruly child, that doesn't justify the abvse i endured for over 10 years. i can't get back what was taken from me and what i went through carries through to my adult life and negatively affects every aspect of my life.\n  \n  i know a part of recovery is acceptance, but how can i accept that this shit happened to me when it's contributed to my fucked up behavior and relationships and impulsive and self destructive habits and my desire to end my life all the time? how can i accept that? it's made me so angry and depressed and anxiety ridden and i can't control it anymore.\n  ","422253":"\n  of course not. people shouldn't treat others as lesser humans to begin with regardless of their IQ, it's just common courtesy.\n  ","422254":"\n  most of the time, no. however, it depends entirely on the question because sometimes they're silly while other times they have deep meaning behind them.\n  ","422255":"\n  i was born and raised in new york.\n  ","422256":"\n  i think your rationale is false -- nobody needs anyone in their life, and relationships shouldn't be based on needing that person. you enter relationships because that person makes you a better version of yourself and motivates you to do better, and necessity isn't a factor.\n  \n  if someone claims that they need you in that sense, then it's usually a red flag.\n  ","422257":"\n  i really have no interest in entertaining asinine notions like this.\n  ","422258":"\n  there's no correlation between having free will and being on life saving medication.\n  \n  i have free will regardless of whether or not i choose to take medication for my mental illnesses. if anything, my medication gives me more freedom to do what i want & need to do.\n  ","422259":"\n  i never liked this photo, so i never posted it anywhere (that i can remember).\n  ","422260":"\n  yes, i'm on a steady cocktail of psychiatric medication that i take every day.\n  ","422261":"\n  no -- i don't give out my facebook to people i'm not friends with, especially anons.\n  ","422262":"\n  i'm all right -- tbh, i'm a bit down even though i had a therapy appointment today, but i suppose i'm down because my appointment brought back some memories that i had suppressed, and i'm thinking about my past a lot.\n  \n  i'm trying to distract myself by watching some tv, but i honestly think i'm just going to end up going to bed after the episode ends.\n  ","422263":"\n  9:57pm.\n  ","422264":"\n  i wouldn't be able to choose just one because different environments would call for different filters to bring out the natural beauty of that environment. there isn't one single filter that works for every scenario.\n  ","422265":"\n  cigarettes, coffee \/ tea, alcohol, my relationship, and my friendship with my best friend.\n  \n  in a way, these things have ended up defining me, and i cling onto them because they provide me with a sense of purpose and a sense of identity.\n  ","422266":"\n  no, it's basically been a standard work day. i had a lot of work to do because a special project prevented me from working on my usual assignments, so i have a lot of catching up to do this week.\n  \n  i'm also leaving for my therapy appointment in a few minutes, which is good because i haven't seen my therapist in a while ever since i lost my insurance.\n  ","422267":"\n  i'm an editor \/ writer for a publishing company.\n  \n  he's a manager at petco, and he also picks up a lot of side work doing construction, HVAC, plumbing, etc.\n  ","422268":"\n  i don't understand why people send messages like these -- not only are they obviously disgusting and inappropriate, but they're also incredibly unrealistic and are merely vague hypotheticals.\n  \n  stop anonymously messaging random people that you want to have sex with them and focus on improving your own life instead. i guarantee you there will be better outcomes.\n  ","422269":"\n  i prefer solitary activities, such as writing, reading, art, playing video games, and photography.\n  ","422270":"\n  people are allowed to have different opinions as long as they're not discriminatory to a group of people. the idea of calling someone a snowflake is juvenile in my opinion, because people often use the term to describe others whose opinions are simply different than theirs.\n  \n  however, there are also a lot of people who find offense in literally anything, so sometimes i can understand why people who use that term so openly feel the need to use it.\n  ","422271":"\n  i often question this myself, lol. i think askfm is inherently addictive, and i've never been able to deactivate permanently over the course of the years i've been active here. i like the questions i receive and i like keeping up on my friends' answers, so that's a major component as to why i haven't left askfm.\n  ","422272":"\n  i honestly think it's silly -- toys shouldn't be gender specific, and there's nothing wrong with a boy playing with dolls or a girl playing with hot wheels. it doesn't determine which gender they are and develop into as they get older, and i think it's a trivial thing for parents to argue about.\n  ","422273":"\n  i think it's an archaic way of thinking and everyone's idea of success is different and very subjective. in today's society, it's much more difficult for people to get a college education, if they want to pursue college to begin with, and there's more pressure on young adults to get married and have children.\n  ","422274":"\n  it makes me wonder how badly a person has to feel about themselves in order to justify releasing that anger onto a complete stranger by criticizing something as minor as their appearance.\n  ","422275":"\n  my writing -- i've always wanted to be well known for my writing in such a way that my name would be known, but i wouldn't be recognized on the street.\n  \n  writing has always been my passion and it's a lifelong goal of mine to be published.\n  ","422276":"\n  i've only ever known one person who copied everything i did, from phrases to hobbies to style of dress to the friends i had, and it did annoy me a little bit. however, this was back in high school when petty things like that mattered because no one had a sense of identity.\n  ","422277":"\n  i'd rather not think about that because i would probably attempt svicide or voluntarily commit myself to a psychiatric hospital.\n  ","422278":"\n  my boyfriend -- he's the only one that comes to mind when it comes to security. he's my strongest support system and the only person i feel genuinely safe around.\n  ","422279":"\n  i have, it was actually a lot of fun. i went with a few friends and my boyfriend when we went away on vacation a few years ago.\n  ","422280":"\n  i wouldn't have a job anymore if phones, computers, or the internet didn't exist.\n  ","422281":"\n  i like earth tones ; maroon, navy blue, forest green, deep purple, and black.\n  ","422282":"\n  no, i don't like sports. the only sport i've ever been somewhat into was ice hockey, and that was because my boyfriend has been a team captain and coach.\n  ","422283":"\n  i tried out my brother's VR headset once, but all it did was make me incredibly dizzy.\n  ","422284":"\n  the purpose of askfm is for asking questions, not to have conversations. unless you have a question for me, you can kindly leave.\n  ","422285":"\n  no, i think that the use of social media and the internet spreads greater awareness and understanding of cultures other than our own. social media and the internet makes it easier for people to share cultural practices and teach others about the world that exists other than their own.\n  ","422286":"\n  i usually always read people's bios on askfm, and most other websites, because it gives a basic overview of who a person is. i like knowing people's names and especially their pronouns, if i have intentions of speaking to them.\n  ","422287":"\n  yeah, definitely -- especially if they don't say \"excuse me\" before they take the call. i can understand if someone was waiting on an important phone call, but it's courteous to let the other person know beforehand that they might be on the phone at some point.\n  ","422288":"\n  no. the only things i collect are mugs, and even so, my collection was accidental in nature. i just have this compulsion to buy mugs wherever i go, and now my cabinets are overflowing.\n  ","422289":"\n  i'm honestly not sure, if you want my honest opinion -- sexuality doesn't need to have a reason, it just simply is. it's the same concept behind why some people find cis men attractive but not cis women. it's not a conscious choice.\n  ","422290":"\n  my baby ;\n  ","422291":"\n  i like answering questions about myself (which sounds selfish but whatever), and i also like getting to know people through askfm and making friends. i've made a lot of good friends from askfm over the years to whom i can relate, and i genuinely care about them.\n  ","422292":"\n  thankfully, my boyfriend's father and the rest of his family love me. they've offered to allow me to move in if things at my house become too chaotic, and his grandmother also offered her home as well.\n  \n  they have their own sets of issues and drama, like any family does, but they're happy that my boyfriend and i are together because i've made him into a better version of himself over the years.\n  ","422293":"\n  i suppose it depends on how you look at it, because any self esteem at all is attributed to one's ego. generally speaking, however, if you refer to someone as egotistical, you're inferring that they're arrogant or entitled.\n  ","422294":"\n  it's actually relieving, so in a strange way, yes.\n  ","422295":"\n  somewhat -- but only people with whom i'm close. i can read the body language of my boyfriend and best friend, but i would be fairly clueless when it comes to strangers (unless it's something obvious like throwing their hands up in anger).\n  ","422296":"\n  it falls under the same idea as fear of the unknown -- death is an unknown entity for most people, and it strikes fear into those who simply don't know what to expect after this life. death also raises the question of whether or not this life is even worth living in the first place, which can be a frightening thought to people.\n  ","422297":"\n  hopefully i'm still alive by then, lol.\n  \n  married, with a bunch of dogs, living in a house with my current boyfriend, with maybe a kid running around.\n  ","422298":"\n  moving out of my parents' house into an apartment with my boyfriend.\n  \n  hopefully we can do it this year -- it's essentially the next step in my recovery, and it would benefit me a lot to get out of this house.\n  ","422299":"\n  for work, i write press releases for clients. that doesn't really adhere to a genre besides general non-fiction, i would assume.\n  \n  in my free time, i write non-fiction prose and i've also written dramatic fictional works in the past that were loosely based on my life.\n  ","422300":"\n  that happened to me often when i worked in retail. my coworkers and i usually did jobs that weren't necessarily our jobs, but they needed to be done anyway, so any time i would screw up, my bosses wouldn't be able to pinpoint who it was.\n  ","422301":"\n  no, i don't think i'm old at all. compared to the life expectancy of most adults these days, i'm actually quite young.\n  \n  in addition, most of my friends are older than i am, so i feel quite young in comparison.\n  ","422302":"\n  tried a cut crease, but you can't even tell from this photo. oh well ~~\n  ","422303":"\n  i want to do my makeup, but that's going to prompt me to go out, and the bars are going to be filled with people.\n  \n  however -- i also really want a nice beer. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  \n  debating on just sucking it up and attempting to go out, even though it's bitter cold outside. surely people won't want to go drinking in this weather, right?\n  ","422304":"\n  \u2727 what my greatest achievements are \u2727\n  \n  i suppose my greatest achievement was graduating from college magna cum laude. i had put forward all of my effort into obtaining good grades alongside working more than 30 hours per week. i was incredibly proud of what i did despite working so much and despite my mental health acting up on me.\n  \n  --\n  \n  \u2727 what words make me the best of myself \u2727\n  \n  i don't really know what this is supposed to mean -- i guess which words make me feel the best about myself?\n  \n  i like when people call me intelligent, because my intelligence is something i'm insecure about. i also like when people tell me i'm a good writer, because i often have doubts.\n  ","422305":"\n  deal with the source of your stress and try to alleviate it as much as you can.\n  \n  there are things you can do which can help you handle the way you cope with stress, such as doing your favorite activities or other things that allow you to escape, but those are only temporary. they don't actually get rid of the reason why you're stressed in the first place.\n  ","422306":"\n  \u2727 a description of my best friend \u2727\n  \n  my best friend is the strongest person i know ; she's endured an incredible amount of hardships and loss in her life, but she still puts forward 120% every day and tries to make the best of every situation.\n  \n  she's hilarious, really down to earth, and she's basically a greek goddess. she's beautiful but she has such low self esteem that she doesn't realize her own beauty, both inside and out. she's helped me through my own hardships and was often the only person who showed that they cared when i was at my lowest points.\n  ","422307":"\n  \u2727 my biggest pet peeves \u2727\n  \n  people who are condescending when they talk to me, or to anyone else for that matter. people who talk with food in their mouth. people who interrupt me or others when they're in the middle of speaking. people who insist on cutting me off while driving. people who drive 30mph in the left lane.\n  ","422308":"\n  \u2727 my favorite animal \u2727\n  \n  wolves. they're honestly so fascinating to me and i've had an interest in them ever since i was a child. i even have a tattoo of a wolf to symbolize my love for the creature.\n  ","422309":"\n  leigh lothlorien. ;))\n  \n  no, but seriously -- i don't give

cropped, dark brown hair. he has big, dark brown eyes and a wide, snarky smile. he's very lean with some muscles and a very defined back.\n  \n  personality wise, he's open minded and loves playing the devil's advocate. he's very opinionated and has no qualms about listening to other people's opinion and discussing differences in opinions. he has a very hard work ethic, strong family ties, and will give you his jacket if you're cold. he's intelligent and has a deep understanding of how the world works.\n  ","422311":"\n  \u2727 most embarrassing moment \u2727\n  \n  i'm probably going to delete this because it's absolutely MORTIFYING, but one time i accidentally farted when my boyfriend was going down on me.\n  \n  oh my god. i was so ashamed of myself. we laugh at it now, but i was so mortified and he was horrified.\n  ","422312":"\n  \u2727 what i find attractive in the preferred sex \u2727\n  \n  i'm attracted to both men and women, as well as trans men, so i'll describe features that are generally gender neutral ;\n  \n  big smiles with dimples, tousled hair, dark brown eyes, open mindedness, an ambitious attitude, a take-no-shit personality, and intelligence.\n  ","422313":"\n  \u2727 my best first date \u2727\n  \n  well, tbh i've only ever been on dates with my boyfriend (lol). but our first date was to see the wolverine movie that came out in 2009 in the theatre, and then we went out to eat afterwards. it was a lot of fun, we learned a lot about each other, and it made me really happy.\n  ","422314":"\n  this is an accurate statement, yes.\n  ","422315":"\n  aw, thank you !!\n  \n  tbh i only post photos of myself when i've done my makeup or when i'm feeling particularly confident that day in my regular skin.\n  \n  here's a photo of me today without makeup ;\n  ","422316":"\n  solid oak, four drawers, with enough space on top to place my vanity set and a mirror.\n  ","422317":"\n  AHH I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU, TEA IS AMAZING.\n  \n  it depends on which kinds of tea you prefer !! there's black tea, green tea, white tea, and herbal teas. i personally prefer various black and green teas, but there are also really good herbal teas out there as well.\n  \n  for starters, i would suggest trying out earl grey tea (black tea) because it has a nice bold flavor and you can put in sugar and milk, which makes it taste lovely. there are also a plethora of flavored green teas ; i personally like green tea with jasmine and green tea with lemon. however, there are countless other combinations that you can find if you go to your local grocery store, just pick a box that sounds yummy.\n  \n  there are also dozens upon dozens of herbal teas, like peach and raspberry and blueberry, as well as various chai teas (which have spices in them, so good). it's really all a matter of experimentation and finding your taste. i think the best option for you would be finding a box of variety teas instead of buying single boxes of one flavor !! that way you save money and can try out different flavors.\n  ","422318":"\n  it depends on the individual and what they're comfortable discussing. i don't think sex should be considered as taboo as it currently is, but people also shouldn't feel obligated to discuss their sex lives if they're not comfortable doing so.\n  \n  for example, i don't like talking about my sex life unless it's obviously with my boyfriend, or with my best friend. it doesn't mean that i'm ashamed of sex, i just personally prefer to keep it a private matter.\n  ","422319":"\n  i attend cognitive behavioral therapy sessions once per week, i see a psychiatrist once to twice per month, and i'm on a steady dose of medications that i take every day.\n  \n  my psychological well being has greatly improved over the past year that i've been in this routine, and i wish there wasn't such a stigma associated with mental health treatment. there's nothing wrong with getting proper, professional treatment for mental health, and it can greatly benefit you in the long run.\n  ","422320":"\n  i've always wanted to be a writer for as long as i could remember. i was writing stories even when i was a child, and by the time i was 11, i had moved into short stories and poetry. it's the only career choice that made sense to me.\n  ","422321":"\n  i've always lived in new york, which is probably the least intimate place in the united states, haha. people don't acknowledge strangers on the street, no one talks to one another waiting in a check out line, cashiers aren't treated as humans (which i think happens in most places, unfortunately), etc.\n  \n  it's something i've been accustomed to for a long time, so i've never been in a position where i could relate to a stranger in a public setting.\n  ","422322":"\n  death is permanent and unchanging. regardless of what we do in life, we will all end up six feet underground eventually.\n  ","422323":"\n  i enjoy twitter, but it isn't confusing to

","422324":"\n  oh my fucking god, stop sending me this \"woe is me, i'm so old\" crap.\n  \n  you're 22 years old. everyone you send this to, including myself, says you're young. in addition, the majority of people you've sent this to are older than you are.\n  \n  you can attend college at any age. most of my college classmates were older than me, and there's nothing wrong with that. instead of feeling bad for yourself, go out and live your life to the best of your ability.\n  ","422325":"\n  yeah, i definitely have. i missed the friendship and had second thoughts about ending the friendship to begin with.\n  \n  however, i had to keep reminding myself that i cut them off for a reason, they were a toxic person and their presence in my life caused more harm than good, and i'm a better person without them.\n  ","422326":"\n  i'm about to say no to this current glass of white wine because it's legit the most disgusting wine i've ever tasted and idk if i can even finish this glass.\n  ","422327":"\n  a beer bottle opener that's in the shape of a shotgun shell.\n  ","422328":"\n  i absolutely do -- after all, i've been with my current boyfriend for nearly eight years and we've essentially been through hell and back together. it takes a certain amount of love, support, dedication, and patience to withstand the things that we've gone through together over the years.\n  ","422329":"\n  i usually turn to alcohol, cigarettes, or drugs.\n  \n  i never said i had the best coping mechanisms. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  ","422330":"\n  i honestly think that they've become a way to divide the american people into two sides -- liberal and conservative. instead of banding together as one group serving an equal purpose, politics has divided the country and force them to quarrel amongst themselves.\n  ","422331":"\n  i don't have psychosis, so no. to believe one can converse with another aspect of themself is a symptom of hallucinations.\n  ","422332":"\n  the same way people believe in religion or extraterrestrial life -- faith.\n  ","422333":"\n  not generally, no. most of the time, i feel as if i'm looking at things from afar and studying humanity like i'm a scientist looking upon a lab test with mice.\n  ","422334":"\n\n   @Sometimes_Witty\n  \n\n  this is how much snow has accumulated. it finally stopped snowing around 6:30pm (two hours ago).\n  ","422335":"\n  no. i have enough going on in my life, i don't need to involve myself in other people's lives, especially those who mean nothing to me. gossiping is a juvenile act.\n  ","422336":"\n  those pictures don't do justice to what the snow looked like hours later, believe it or not!\n  \n  i think we got around 14-18 inches total, but the intense wind made the snow appear much deeper than it actually was.\n  ","422337":"\n  yeah, definitely -- tbh that idea has always appealed to me more than physically giving birth. being pregnant legitimately scares the shit out of me, lol.\n  \n  but that's plenty of years down the line from now, so it isn't something i really think about.\n  ","422338":"\n  not at all. with the life expectancy of humans these days, being in your 20s is quite young.\n  \n  not to mention the fact that all of my friends and coworkers are significantly older than me.\n  ","422339":"\n  i've been on medication and have been attending therapy for over a year now. i'm not as mentally unstable as i used to be, but i still have my moments and depressive episodes. they're just not nearly as intense now as they were prior to being in treatment.\n  ","422340":"\n  we share pretty much everything -- we drink from the same cup, eat from the same plate sometimes, use the same fork, and one time, he even used my toothbrush (although i find that one to be a little gross).\n  \n  i mean, we exchange bodily fluids so in comparison, most of the other things we share are mild, haha.\n  ","422341":"\n  i'm not really guilty to enjoy any of the things i enjoy, haha.\n  \n  i suppose the closest thing would be that i'm fascinated by serial killers and true crime, but that's a common interest shared by many people.\n  ","422342":"\n  i hated the fact that i often was attracted to people who had no interest in me, but i wouldn't say that i loved them.\n  ","422343":"\n  in case anyone is interested in what new york looks like right now ;\n  ","422344":"\n  i remember that too !! i was overwhelmed with happiness because it was so long overdue. i don't think people should ever be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, especially when it comes to things like marriage. there's a separation of church and state for a reason.\n  ","422345":"\n  i agree with you !! my boyfriend played hockey for most of his life and has worked construction for many years as well, so he has the most beautiful back in my eyes. he isn't overly muscular, but he's very lean and you can trace the shape of the muscles on his back and see the dimples on the small of his back.\n  ","422346":"\n  subtle beauty can be one of the most beautiful things about a person, tbh.\n  \n  i like thin wrists, collar bones, the shapes of people's shoulders, high cheekbones, jutting jawlines, and the groove down the center of people's backs.\n  ","422347":"\n  i'd venture a guess and say that health is merely a state of well being -- nobody is immune from illness, and it can be determined that while someone is sick with the common cold, it doesn't necessarily mean that they're unhealthy. an absence of illness is a rare thing, in my opinion.\n  ","422348":"\n  2017 was the year of the tattoos ~~\n  ","422349":"\n  women with sassy and defiant personalities who aren't afraid to embrace their individuality and tell the truth like it really is.\n  ","422350":"\n  i'm not vegan or vegetarian at the moment, as much as i would like to me. i have no control over the food that enters my household, so unfortunately i don't have much choice in the matter.\n  \n  i definitely want to transition to a vegetarian diet when i move out and get my own place, though.\n  ","422351":"\n  i do, actually. i'm in a fb group with a few other people as a place to vent and rant about our lives, and some of my old high school friends have revealed that they too have been diagnosed with BPD over the years.\n  \n  it's definitely helped a lot because it gives me a sense that i'm not alone in my struggles and there are people whom i personally know who understand the ups and downs of having BPD.\n  ","422352":"\n  google news -- it has most sources, such as NPR, the new york times, BBC, the washington post, etc etc.\n  ","422353":"\n  not at all -- it wouldn't be cost efficient to do everything by hand due to the amount of paper people would use on a daily basis. even if the computers somehow lost all of their files, they're backed up by cloud storage and can be easily accessible.\n  ","422354":"\n  no, i don't see a reason to pay for their services. i don't mind the ads at all.\n  ","422355":"\n  everything i do and have done has been on a computer. it would be nearly impossible to do my past and present job by hand, haha. everything i write and edit is stored in a database.\n  ","422356":"\n  sitting on my bed, drinking a cup of coffee, and having a gif war with my boyfriend over fb messenger.\n  ","422357":"\n  i cry at movies all the time because i'm actually an emotional mess and can't control my emotions.\n  \n  i can't remember which movie i cried at last because i don't watch movies very often, but the tv shows parks & recreation and how i met your mother made me cry plenty of times.\n  ","422358":"\n  not very often, mostly because i don't go out in public very often besides the occasional errand and for work. when i first colored my hair pink, though, i had like 5 strangers at my office building come up to me to tell me they loved my hair.\n  ","422359":"\n  i think it's a bit ridiculous that they're calling this snow storm a \"bomb cyclone,\" but i think it's also ridiculous that my office expects everyone to come into work tomorrow when my region is supposed to be hit with 12 inches of snow and wind gusts up to 40 mph.\n  ","422360":"\n  i do !! i haven't watched it in a long time, but i thoroughly enjoyed it.\n  ","422361":"\n  mostly, thank you for asking !! i still gab congestion and fatigue, but my abdominal pain is mostly gone. i'm happy it was only one of those 24 hour bugs.\n  ","422362":"\n  you sound like the same anon who had misconceptions about sex and gender and i had a few days ago.\n  \n  i'm not going to have another silly debate about gender identity with you because it's simply a waste of time. i won't be answering any more of your questions, unfortunately.\n  ","422363":"\n  in 2018, let's read people's bios before we talk to them so that we can get an understanding of their gender identity and which pronouns to use. ?\n  ","422364":"\n  there isn't any entertainment that's difficult for me to resist. i go in phases when it comes to media, i.e. movies or tv shows or video games. sometimes i'll be hooked to my tv screen playing a particular game, while other times i don't pick up my controller for weeks.\n  ","422365":"\n  i have online friends from the UK and australia. idk if they're easier to talk to simply because they're not american, but we happened to click when we first began talking, much like any other friendship of mine.\n  ","422366":"\n  sometimes, yeah. usually i'm given no other option but to make the best out of a situation so i do what needs to be done with no questions asked.\n  \n  however, other times i admittedly allow my depression and anxiety to get the best of me, which makes getting over obstacles that much harder. every day is different so i don't know what to expect.\n  ","422367":"\n  -- drinking tea \/ coffee and watching tv\n  \n  -- having deep and meaningful talks with my boyfriend or best friend\n  \n  -- being around good friends around a small fire while having drinks\n  \n  -- writing creatively\n  \n  -- painting \/ drawing \/ coloring\n  \n  -- sleeping in with my boyfriend on rainy days\n  \n  -- going out into nature and taking photos\n  ","422368":"\n  draco malfoy -- i always have had a soft spot for his character because he was obviously abvsed by his

internationally as the \"svicide forest\" due to the alarming high number of svicides there.\n  \n  i didn't watch the video, but he and his friends allegedly stumbled upon the dead corpse of a man who had completed svicide by hanging. instead of turning off the camera, they zoomed in on the body, was laughing and making jokes, and then he proceeded to upload the video to youtube.\n

","422371":"\n  logan paul is a vile human being who tried to exploit the death of another human being to garner likes and views on social media -- he wasn't trying to \"raise awareness\" for mental health and svicide prevention, and his \"apology\" was half hearted and narcissistic at best.\n  \n  you don't go into a sacred forest with a camera and continue filming, continue laughing, and zoom in and focus on a corpse in an effort to \"raise awareness.\" what he did was extremely disrespectful, and his decision to put that video on the internet for everyone to see was foolish and selfish.\n

positions. bad things seem to happen to them without warrant or reason.\n  ","422376":"\n  everyone i follow, pretty much. i wouldn't want to list certain people out and not others because i wouldn't want anyone to feel left out or angry.\n  ","422377":"\n  moreso the latter -- i always knew that i felt uncomfortable with my body and with the idea of being a girl or a woman, but i didn't know that being gender fluid or non-binary existed until a few years ago, thanks to the internet.\n  \n  when i did my research, i was amazed at how fitting it seemed and it gave me a lot of comfort and

rough, etc etc. it goes away relatively fast.\n  \n  depression is long lasting and doesn't need to have a reason. depression is defined by periods of sadness, fatigue, lack of interest in activities, loss of focus, svicidal thoughts, etc. to be diagnosed with depression, you must have a certain amount of symptoms (i think two or three) every day for at least two weeks.\n  ","422417":"\n  i think maine coons are so beautiful, and although i'm not much of a cat person, i would love to adopt one of those.\n  \n  as for dogs, i don't discriminate and basically love every dog i meet. i especially love huskies, german shepards, pitbulls, mastiffs, corgis, and golden retrievers.\n  ","422418":"\n  not a bother at all !! i love animals, and i'm going to adopt so many of them once i move into my own house, lmao.\n  \n  i definitely want at least one dog, and naturally my boyfriend is going to bring his fish and dragon with us as well. i also love guinea pigs and rats and hamsters, so we'll see.\n  ","422419":"\n  abnormal psychology -- dealing with disorders of the brain, behavioral health, cognitive dysfunction, etc etc.\n  \n  it's always been a subject that greatly interested me due to my own experiences.\n  ","422420":"\n  idk if i showed you this photo before, but look how tiny she used to be !!\n  ","422421":"\n\n   @echomyname\n  \n","422422":"\n  any instances of abvse,

have the wrong person because i'm not even a girl.\n  ","422425":"\n  i've progressed a lot in my recovery and i've become more accepting of my diagnoses -- i'm trying to use my experiences to educate others about mental health in general.\n  \n  in addition, i'm not as introverted and socially withdrawn as i used to be. i've learned how to be open with my feelings and put my foot down if need be, because i'm beginning to respect myself.\n  ","422426":"\n  i don't think it would hurt, but i also don't think it's overly necessary either. these platforms are functioning well the way they are now, so i don't think that it would make any significant difference. there are a lot of other changes these social media platforms can make that are of higher importance than that.\n  ","422427":"\n  ahh, thank you !! this means a lot to me ~~\n  ","422428":"\n  i already have.\n  \n  seriously though -- stop messaging me. i'm going to bed, and i don't want 2948593 notifications in the morning because you think i abandoned you.\n  ","422429":"\n  LOL IS THIS FOR REAL.\n  \n  on this note, i'm going to bed. thanks for the laughs, anon. i'll be going to sleep with a smile on my face.\n  ","422430":"\n  ... you're implying that my gender identity doesn't exist because you insist that i'm a girl despite me indicating otherwise.\n  \n  that's pretty much the same thing as invalidating someone because that infers that trans people's identities don't matter.\n  \n  i'm done debating about this with you, though.\n  ","422431":"\n  literally the entire conversation this anon and i are having is about identity politics, so your analogy is totally correct.\n  \n  regardless, i'm not going to entertain their thoughts anymore. it's stupid to go back and forth with someone who clearly isn't listening or acknowledging the existence of an entire group of people.\n  ","422432":"\n  i would entertain this notion, but i'm honestly not interested anymore because it's clear to me that you're simply transphobic and aren't worth any more space on my profile.\n  \n  trans lives are real and valid, no matter what you have to say about it. i'm not going to stop identifying as non-binary simply because an anon doesn't think i exist. that's silly.\n  ","422433":"\n  your rationale has been illogical thus far, and you haven't presented me with any facts either. you can try to hold yourself up on a pedestal, but based on your responses, you're having a rough time getting up there.\n  \n  to be fair, this entire conversation has been a derivative of identity politics. you're not doing yourself any favors by throwing that word around now.\n  ","422434":"\n  this is so cute, aw. thank you ~~\n  ","422435":"\n  i usually only answer questions on my phone, as i'm rarely on my laptop.\n  \n  a few years ago, askfm wasn't available on mobile, so answering questions on the computer was the only option we had. however, i do prefer it on the phone now because the layout makes it extremely easy to sort through & answer questions, and i can do it virtually any time of day.\n  ","422436":"\n  i can understand where you're getting lost too, and it's a shame that we can't come to a formal agreement.\n  \n  something that has been shared by millions of people is more than just a \"feeling.\" considering you're cis, you wouldn't understand this yourself, but being trans is more than just a \"feeling.\" it's someone's entire world, the definition of their being, something so significant that it dictates whether they live or die. the idea that so many people share these experiences, in so many different cultures, and throughout different time periods, assumes that being trans is more than just a fleeting \"feeling.\"\n  \n  it's clear that you're not going to understand the intricacies of being trans, however. we're just going in circles.\n  ","422437":"\n  i wasn't aware that i was blindly agreeing to anything -- silly me.\n  \n  is this in response to the fat question? my response wasn't a lie, if that's what you're wondering.\n  ","422438":"\n  if you've done any research at all, you would know that it's literally documented in history than genders aside from man and woman have existed for centuries. facts are based upon historical data and evidence -- if you took the time out of your day to research this evidence instead of having a debate with a stranger, you would clearly see that.\n  ","422439":"\n  thick is clearly just a politically correct way of stating that someone is fat.\n  \n  yes -- i'm fat.\n  ","422440":"\n  i called you condescending, your attempts to discredit me as childish, and your ignorance of trans culture to be a product of brainwashing.\n  \n  i don't really understand how you think that means i can't handle things that are thrown my way? i'm just simply pointing out what i've observed over the few interactions i've had with you (and people like you who have tried to question my gender in the past). you're all the same, tbh.\n  ","422441":"\n  LOL, that's actually hilarious.\n  \n  honestly, i don't really care about who my anon is -- i get these types of people occasionally, and they come and go after they realize that they can't squash the trans out of me.\n  \n  askfm is a lot more fun with anon activated, at any rate. my page wouldn't nearly be as active if i could only receive non-anonymous questions, and knowing me, i would keep forgetting to turn the feature back on.\n  ","422442":"\n  this condescending attitude is quite sickening, and i honestly believe you should educate yourself on trans culture before you think you can talk to a trans person as if you know them better than they know themselves.\n  \n  it doesn't matter to me what *you* think i am -- because it simply isn't the truth. so whether you would like to accept that truth or not, i'm still who i am at the end of the day.\n  ","422443":"\n  \"i can explain why you're wrong, so here's a completely random analogy that makes no logical sense in comparison to what i'm talking about and citing a myth that has no scientific basis and hasn't been included in mental health discussions since the 1970s\"\n  ","422444":"\n  it's honestly just a useless and childish way of trying to invalidate someone's identity and experiences -- perhaps if anon was actually talking about something that *wasn't* based on scientific evidence, then i would understand their justification.\n  \n  but gender identity has existed for centuries, and unfortunately those who oppose trans people have brainwashed themselves to believe that trans people have only existed in the past 10 years out of cultural spite instead of educating themselves on trans culture.\n  ","422445":"\n  if we're talking scientific facts, then you'll be delighted to know that gender identity is a very valid and real thing, existing for centuries in a plethora of cultures on anthropological, sociological, psychological, and biological levels. you can't simply disrespect trans individuals because you don't agree with the reality of the world.\n  \n  needless to say, there are more than two genders because your gender identity isn't equivalent to your biological sex. you're correct in that i'm biologically female, but i've never identified as a girl, nor will i ever.\n  ","422446":"\n  if you read my profile, you would know that i'm non-binary.\n  \n  regardless, i'm all right -- just laying in bed and watching the x files. i'm debating on going to bed, but i honestly don't want to wake up and go to work tomorrow morning.\n  ","422447":"\n  i like mostly earth tones ; blood red, emerald, navy, beige, gray, and black.\n  \n  they've always brought to me a sense of tranquility because they're colors found in nature, and they remind me of forests and oceans.\n  ","422448":"\n  my day was all right -- i had a throbbing headache for most of the day, which only disappeared about an hour ago.\n  \n  i also got out of work half an hour early, which was nice. i'm currently just relaxing, drinking a cup of coffee, and watching the x files.\n  ","422449":"\n  i have the mouth of a dirty sailor -- it doesn't show much when i type online, but it comes out pretty often when i'm actually speaking in real life.\n  \n  i mostly use the words \"shit,\" \"fuck,\" and \"bullshit.\"\n  ","422450":"\n  one of my old coworkers is obsessed with the x-files, so i found the series on hulu and i'm excited to start watching it !!\n  \n  i know it isn't the most exciting thing, but i always like getting into new shows, especially ones with a lot of seasons.\n  ","422451":"\n  i think feminism is an important part of everyone's lives, whether they realize it or not.\n  \n  feminism advocates for not only the equality amongst men and women, but also among different races, genders, sexual orientations, religions, etc etc. feminism promotes understanding and equality of all of these factors.\n  \n  in that same vein, feminism also benefits men -- it seeks to eradicate the hypermasculinity of society, thereby making it more socially acceptable for men to show emotion and grow up in a non violent environment.\n  ","422452":"\n  i've always wanted to learn how to play the piano. i've always been interested in music since i was young, and it's such a beautiful instrument.\n  ","422453":"\n  well no, to be quite honest. i don't consider myself to be very smart at all, but i thanked that anon anyway because regardless of my thoughts, it was a nice thing for them to say.\n  ","422454":"\n  as my bio indicates, i'm 26 years old.\n  ","422455":"\n  mostly because i'm uncomfortable with most male doctors. i've had male doctors in the past and i didn't have good experiences with them, nor did i feel comfortable with them, so i usually request female doctors.\n  ","422456":"\n  the only person from askfm i know in real life is\n  \n   @Courrtana\n  \n  !! we met after talking on askfm ~~\n  ","422457":"\n  i delete sexual questions and obvious attempts at trolling.\n  ","422458":"\n  that depends on the doctor, really. i've had some female doctors who were accepting and open minded while others weren't.\n  ","422459":"\n  i've always been more comfortable with female doctors, regardless of their specialty.\n  ","422460":"\n  blocking and reporting is unfortunately the only thing you can do on askfm. you did the right thing.\n  \n  however, don't allow it to discourage you. people who feel the need to harass others often have major inner conflicts of their own, and they never learned how to deal with them the right away. their words aren't the truth and they're a reflection of what they think of themselves, not you. don't allow those words to hurt you because they're empty and meaningless.\n  ","422461":"\n  dis\u00b7ease\n  \n  d\u0259\u02c8z\u0113z\/\n  \n  noun\n  \n  a disorder of structure or function in a human, animal, or

that i often get reminded of the things people have done to me over the years and get angry at them all over again.\n  ","422463":"\n  not really. my memory is terrible, but i'm more apt to remember names as opposed to faces. if i meet a person once, chances are that i won't remember who they are the next time i meet them.\n  ","422464":"\n  sorry not sorry for all of the selfies lately ;\n  ","422465":"\n  if you didn't get the hint from the fact that i used your last question as a filler, let me make it simple for you: i have no interest in answering questions like these.\n  ","422466":"\n  you're a good person if you have good intentions at heart. you want to help your friends or your family or even strangers, and you don't go out of your way to purposely hurt people. most people are good people.\n  ","422467":"\n  if the person is a stranger, then it isn't my place to tell them how to live their life unless they were actively svicidal and had intentions to end their life. then i would phone the police on their behalf and get them the help they need.\n  \n  if it was a friend or family member, then i would talk to them about their behavior and let them know how their behavior is affecting their relationships and that i'm there for them. you can't fix people who do not want to help themselves, though. you can only give them the avenues to recovery, but you can't force a person to get help.\n  ","422468":"\n  look at the moon nightlight my boyfriend got me, it's so pretty ;\n  ","422469":"\n  i don't usually bother with making resolutions because i rarely follow through with them -- not necessarily because i'm lazy or unmotivated, but because life often gets in the way and suddenly you find yourself living a completely different life than you expected.\n  ","422470":"\n  this defines pretty much three quarters of my life because i have memory loss and cannot remember the majority of my life (especially any age prior to the age of 11).\n  \n  in addition, i've endured a lot of alcohol- and drug-fueled nights where i would black out, so my friends would have to fill me in on the details the next day.\n  ","422471":"\n  i don't really remember the reason why i drank or smoked to begin with, since i was a teenager at the time. i do remember using alcohol in my freshman year of college as an escape from my depression, and smoking was a stress reliever for me.\n  \n  these days, smoking is simply an addiction and it calms me, while alcohol relaxes me at the end of the day.\n  ","422472":"\n  i suppose cigarettes is the most logical answer to this question -- i know cigarettes are terrible for your health and can kill you, but i still smoke and continue to purchase packs of cigarettes every few days.\n  ","422473":"\n  i absolutely love the peach palette -- i also got a lot of new makeup brushes, so i was able to actually apply the makeup correctly and with precision.\n  \n  my profile picture is the outcome of the peach palette and some winged liner, and it makes me so proud of my makeup abilities, haha.\n  ","422474":"\n  i have no intentions of becoming close to another person, especially considering you're an anonymous stranger from a social media website.\n  \n  you can ask me questions since that's the purpose of askfm, but that's the extent of what i'll be comfortable doing.\n  ","422475":"\n  ... i'm not here to argue with you because this is an asinine thing to argue with someone about. but 22 is very young -- i'm four years older than you, and i don't even consider myself to be \"old.\"\n  \n  you have the rest of your life ahead of you. enjoy your youth while it lasts.\n  ","422476":"\n  usually it's because they're creeps and perverts who think it's an acceptable question to ask someone simply because they're hiding behind an anonymous pseudonym.\n  \n  virginity isn't even a physical thing, in any respect. it's a social construct that doesn't realistically exist.\n  ","422477":"\n  my boyfriend got me a realistic moon nightlight, a new over the shoulder bag, a pandora charm, a keychain with words of affirmations on it, a destiny (the video game) journal, and chocolates.\n  \n  as for what the rest of my family got me, i mostly got clothing, coffee, snacks for work, a lot of tea, an eyeshadow palette and mascara, and a vanity set to store my makeup.\n  ","422478":"\n  i'm kind and courteous to everyone i meet unless they give me a reason to behave otherwise.\n  ","422479":"\n  i portray myself to be highly intelligent because i was taught how to string words into sentences in a logical and eloquent fashion.\n  \n  however, i'm always afraid that i'm not as smart as people perceive me to be, especially considering it's been four years since i've been in school.\n  ","422480":"\n  it depends on the individual and what they've done to me -- if it's someone i'm close with, then i'm more apt to forgive them if it's a first offense. however, if they keep repeating the behavior, then they're at risk of getting cut loose.\n  \n  if it's a person i barely know and they wrong me, then i have no emotional attachment to them and i cut them loose immediately.\n  ","422481":"\n  i took a video of it and put it on my snapchat because people kept asking me to do so, hahah. he's so excited, though. i can't wait to go to the concert with him.\n  ","422482":"\n  i am quite happy right now (although i am drunk).\n  ","422483":"\n  makeup of the day ;\n  ","422484":"\n  my xmas day has just begun, but it's going well -- i ended up staying up until 3:00am organizing my gifts and taking some things out of boxes.\n  \n  it's 9:30am now, and i'm just in the process of making breakfast. after i eat, i'm going to get together all of my gifts for my boyfriend for tonight and get ready for my aunt's house.\n  \n  and yes, i plan on getting absolutely trashed.\n  ","422485":"\n  serve me a glass of red wine or a cup of coffee.\n

don't have any photos from my childhood.\n  \n  here's a photo from when i was 18, though ;\n  ","422491":"\n  i can understand that -- my family does the same thing with the information they do know, which is why i don't tell them about my diagnoses other than depression \/ anxiety.\n  \n  you might have to sit your mother down again and explain how it makes you feel, and that she should respect your privacy when it comes to something as sensitive as your mental health.\n  ","422492":"\n  if i was single, then i would thank him for the compliment and tell him i'm not interested in dating, so i wouldn't be giving him my number.\n  \n  when i was single, i usually had no intentions of entering a relationship and pretty much wanted nothing to do with men. my relationship with my boyfriend was different because we ended up being good friends first before dating one another, so it felt more natural and it wasn't forced.\n  ","422493":"\n  if there's no chance at all of her having feelings for you back, then you need to tell yourself that your feelings aren't going to bring you any happiness and that you're only going to hurt yourself.\n  \n  i understand that it's difficult to get over a person, but you need to do this for yourself and you can't keep pining over someone who will never reciprocate your feelings.\n  ","422494":"\n  i absolutely love the snow -- i think it's beautiful and makes everything sound much more quiet.\n  \n  however, i hate driving in the snow. plows don't do their jobs well enough where i live, which makes the roads icy.\n  ","422495":"\n  i'm

boyfriend's late mother.\n  ","422498":"\n  if i had a choice of changing my career, i would want to become a forensic anthropologist. i find the subject matter to be incredibly interesting.\n  \n  i

it even became a fashion trend because it originated from gang members to indicate the deeds they've done to move up within the gang.\n  \n  needless to say, i wouldn't do that to my own eyebrows. i don't need to get any negative attention from the gangs in my area.\n  ","422504":"\n  lol -- to me, a night out on the town is literally just a friend and me going to the local pub for a few beers.\n  \n  i would probably wear whatever i wore to work that day, which is usually some sort of tank top with a sweater, skinny jeans, and boots. other times, it's a hoodie. i'm not looking to impress anyone, so i have no reason to dress nicely.\n  \n  we would go to the local pub that i've been frequenting since i was 21 years old. it's basically the only bar i go to because it's low key and i know the bartenders there.\n  ","422505":"\n  my favorite feature on my boyfriend is probably his smile -- he has a huge, cheeky grin with dimples on both sides, and it never fails to cheer me up.\n

particularly bad night.\n  ","422539":"\n  the only times i feel free are when i'm under the influence of drugs \/ alcohol.\n  \n  when i'm sober, i often feel restricted and caged because i'm still

out to understand why people believe the ideologies that they do.\n  \n  it's unfortunate because we could all learn a lot from each other if people just took the time to allow others to explain themselves instead of jumping to false conclusions. they have unresolved anger, and the only way they honestly know how to express that is by ragging on other people on the internet.\n  ","422563":"\n  where have i used white feminism to insult women? i haven't even talked about feminism in months.\n  ","422564":"\n  it was toxic for me because i was part of the mental health community and it made

white feminism to make myself seem superior to other people because i haven't talked about feminism in quite some time.\n  \n  regardless, the idea of white feminism is still misguided and doesn't

i'm terrified to drive while it's snowing - which is why i got a ride to my best friend's mother's house today instead of driving myself. however, after it's done snowing and the roads have been cleared, i'm usually okay.\n  \n  snow is safe to drive in under certain circumstances - i.e. the roads are adequately plowed, you have the right tires to drive in snowy weather, you know how to handle yourself in case roads get slippery, etc etc.\n  \n  the problem is that most roads aren't plowed adequately, which makes it extremely unsafe for people to drive in snowy weather. especially in places like the southern US; they're not used to getting snow so they're not given the proper tools to make the roads safe to drive.\n  ","422594":"\n  it only started snowing today, but it's been snowing on and off all day - we've only accumulated maybe two or three inches.\n  ","422595":"\n  oh no - someone on the internet doesn't like video games. what shall i do now ??\n  ","422596":"\n  i enjoyed school a lot - the only thing i didn't enjoy was the bullying i endured from my peers.\n  \n  however, i always loved education and learning new things. college was really enjoyable for me because i was being taught things i was genuinely interested in.\n  ","422597":"\n  i have a terrible habit of keeping gifts regardless of whether i like it or not because i would feel too guilty

i don't believe that i can change the world by myself - however, i do try to make small changes within my online community by spreading awareness of mental health needs, stigmas that should be erased, etc. i'm also a strong supporter of disability rights, which is something that's also misunderstood in society.\n  ","422601":"\n  i'm doing all right - nothing terrible, but not well either.\n  \n  i had a panic attack last night and was crying for hours. i ended up meeting a few friends at the bar and we stayed out until 3:30am just drinking and talking. it was a good distraction.\n  \n  i've been dog sitting for the past few hours, so my mood has been somewhat even - it's quiet in the house, which is a nice change from what i'm used to. i'm just sitting at the kitchen table with a coffee and playing on my phone before i have to feed the dogs in a little while.\n  ","422602":"\n  there isn't a universal answer to this question, so it depends entirely on the people in the relationship.\n  \n  some people are ready for marriage when they're 19, others aren't ready until they're 30, and some people aren't interested in marriage at all. it's entirely subjective.\n  \n  if you can see yourself with your partner for the long haul, can deal with their flaws and quirks and bad habits, and \/ or can see them as a parent (if you're interested in having kids), then you may be ready for marriage.\n  ","422603":"\n  \u2744\u2744\u2744\n  ","422604":"\n  my father. he was kind enough to drive me to starbucks and then to my best friend's mother's house so that i didn't have to drive in the snow this morning.\n  ","422605":"\n  i express my emotions by talking about them or by writing down how i'm feeling. askfm is actually beneficial to me because it's a safe space for me to talk about my feelings and emotions without getting negative feedback from people in my life.\n  \n  i have a lot of strong emotions, so it's important for me to express them regularly.\n  ","422606":"\n  no. bad people don't necessarily get punished for their wrongdoings, and good people aren't rewarded as they should be. i used to like to believe in the concept of karma, but i've

exist.\n  ","422610":"\n  i'm unaware that ben said anything about me - regardless, his opinion is worth as much as a piece of shit on the bottom of my shoe, so it wouldn't phase me anyway.\n  \n

mad and upset because at that point, i would have raised them to know better than to have sex so young and without protection. however, considering the deed would have already been done, i would ask them what they want to do with the pregnancy and go from there.\n  \n  if i had a son, i would probably explain that he needs to be in that child's life one way or another, even if things don't work out between him and the girl.\n  ","422616":"\n  why would i be mad at them ??\n  \n  you can't control your sexuality and i would love my child regardless - no matter what their sexual orientation or

everyone else just speaks too slowly.\n  ","422629":"\n  it's obviously a false sense of power - they convince themselves that they're in control or have authority over others, when really they're very powerless due to the lack of control they have over their own life.\n  ","422630":"\n  like i stated before, it gives them a sense of power and control. while it doesn't directly improve the initial problem that they're trying to deal with, it makes them feel better about themselves temporarily.\n  ","422631":"\n  from my understanding, it's usually because the bullies often have dysfunctional home lives and never learned how to express their anger and frustration properly except through fear and violence - it's a power trip, bullies like having the sense of being in control because they usually have no control over problems at home.\n  ","422632":"\n  aw, thank you ~~\n  \n  you have to remember that middle school and high school kids are often cruel and selfish - they

candles, tea, being snuggled up in blankets, netflix, etc.\n  ","422636":"\n  sometimes, but i usually rationalize it to myself so that i don't feel as bad about the situation.\n  \n  for example, i tend to get jealous of some high school peers who i follow on social media - some of them have houses now, which used to make me jealous and angry until i realized that there was no possible way they could afford it on their own unless their parents contributed. it doesn't seem as independent anymore, to me anyway.\n  \n  however, over the years i've compared myself less and less with people because it only has bad outcomes. i should live up to my own expectations, not those cast by the people around me.\n  ","422637":"\n  i have seven tattoos !! they're on my left arm, left forearm,

for a retail setting. however, a lot of customers think that *all* retail employees act and behave the same way, which isn't true at all.\n  \n  i can't tell you how many times i've been verbally harassed simply because i worked in retail, as if i was a lesser human being because of my occupation and i wasn't entitled to the same rights and freedoms. some people who don't understand what it's like to work retail inevitably take unfair advantage of retail workers.\n  ","422645":"\n  we met in middle school because we had the same lunch period and both shared a love for linkin park.\n  \n

didn't have a similar sense of humor as me, or wasn't able to make me laugh or smile with their jokes.\n  \n  at the same time, intelligence is important to me as well because i require a person with whom i can talk about serious matters and have other intelligent conversations.\n  ","422650":"\n  i was born on a monday morning.\n  ","422651":"\n  no. i don't believe in god or the devil, nor heaven or hell.\n  ","422652":"\n  open world RPGs, mostly.\n  \n  my favorite games are the assassin's creed series, the bioshock series, the halo series, destiny 1 and 2, fallout 3 and 4, the elder scrolls: skyrim, minecraft, tomb raider, life is strange, and the wolf among us.\n  ","422653":"\n  i felt mentally and physically older than i actually was when i was a teenager. i went through a lot of events that forced me to 'grow up' from an early age, so i didn't have time or opportunity to really enjoy a normal childhood or time as a teenager.\n  ","422654":"\n  i've never posted a photo of my body on askfm, so this is a blatant lie. i'm medically overweight because i have a high BMI, so there's really no getting around that.\n  \n  regardless, i'm unhappy with myself and i want to make some changes. it doesn't matter what other people think of me, only what i think of myself.\n  ","422655":"\n  health care (i.e. ER visits, co pays, etc), and college tuition.\n  \n  people shouldn't be afraid to go to the hospital when they're feeling sick or having a medical emergency because they're terrified of the cost of health care. people shouldn't live without their medication because they can't afford it, especially medication required to survive (i.e. insulin).\n  \n  in addition, getting a standard education shouldn't put people in thousands of dollars of debt every year to the point where it takes them 20+ years to pay off their student loans. it's a backwards system and so many people are going uneducated because they simply cannot afford college.\n  ","422656":"\n  i've hated someone because they ruined my life, but the act of hating them didn't actually ruin my life, no.\n  ","422657":"\n  hell yeah, road trip !! that's my dream one day ~~\n  ","422658":"\n  i would realistically be in prison regardless of whether being stupid was a crime or not. i've done some fucked up shit in my life that i can't come back from.\n  ","422659":"\n  no, it's mental illness that makes me feel sad. i have clinical depression and a personality disorder, so i usually develop depression in waves as a result.\n  ","422660":"\n  i support polyamorous relationships; however, i would never participate in one myself because i wouldn't like sharing my boyfriend with anyone and would feel uncomfortable if he had another person on the side.\n  ","422661":"\n  oh god i know. it's cringe-worthy. and then there are the italian dudes with spiked hair and fake tans who try to fit in with black groups and fail miserably.\n  \n  i hate it here lmao, i wish i could escape.\n  ","422662":"\n  long island doesn't have red necks. we just have white people who steal black culture and adopt it as their own while simultaneously trying to show off their masculinity by driving pick up trucks and sporting chin straps.\n  ","422663":"\n  ... i have no idea what you're talking about.\n  ","422664":"\n  big mood\u2122\n  ","422665":"\n  laying down with my rock salt lamp, a candle, ambient lights, a cup of tea, and one of my favorite shows. ?\n  ","422666":"\n  my name is leigh ; i'm 26 years old and i work as a writer \/ editor for a publishing company. i graduated college in 2013 with a degree in professional writing. i also have a boyfriend with whom i've been together for 7-8 years.\n  \n  i enjoy playing video games, listening to music, writing, reading, taking photos, and doing makeup. i'm a coffee and tea addict, i smoke cigarettes, i drink beer and wine, and i love getting tattoos (i currently have seven).\n  \n  i'm an introvert with mental illness, so i prefer alone time or being with a small group of people in a private setting. one of my favorite activities is having a fire with friends and having good conversation.\n  ","422667":"\n

especially when it comes to complex disorder such as personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and psychotic disorders.\n  \n  a lay person is not going to know better than a medical doctor, and if someone truly thinks they have a mental illness, they should seek out a professional diagnosis, if they can. if they can't obtain professional help, then they realistically shouldn't diagnose themselves because it often becomes a self fulfilling prophecy and they could infiltrate communities of people who legitimately struggle with these disorders.\n  ","422669":"\n  with an americano and

pence.\n  ","422671":"\n  i'm looking forward to potentially moving into an apartment with my boyfriend. i just got a new, higher-paying job and he just got a promotion at work, so it'll be easier for us to save money.\n  \n  we're hoping to move out by the summer, but we'll see !!\n  ","422672":"\n  i've gone paintballing and have been pelted by paintballs plenty of times !! they hurt like hell, but the game is so fun.\n  ","422673":"\n  i don't have any new pictures - i seldom take selfies and its usually only when i've spent time doing my makeup, which is rarely.\n  \n  thank you, though.\n  ","422674":"\n  i'm against the death penalty. i think it's a barbaric means of justice and it doesn't teach the criminal a lesson regarding their behavior - it's essentially the easy way out. it's an antiquated means of punishment.\n  \n  in addition, it's more expensive to keep an inmate on death row and execute them than it is to keep them in prison.\n  ","422675":"\n  i'm anti-circumcision. it's a cosmetic procedure that has no medical benefit whatsoever, and it can actually be harmful to the child.\n  \n  in addition, children can't consent to activity that involves their body. if someone wants to cosmetically change their body, they should be old enough to where they understand the pros and cons of such procedures.\n  ","422676":"\n  i'm pro choice and believe that people should be given the option of abortion, regardless of circumstance.\n  \n  to prevent someone from having an abortion is an invasion of that person's bodily autonomy.\n  ","422677":"\n  yes, i was.\n  ","422678":"\n  i've been close to being run over, haha. new york drivers are ridiculous and think they can blow through stop signs and pedestrian cross walks.\n  ","422679":"\n  if you send them in separate questions, then sure. i don't remember which topics i listed in my previous answer, so it would be easier if you asked me specific questions regarding each topic (and other ones if you wish).\n  ","422680":"\n  good night ~~\n  ","422681":"\n  no problem, let me know how it goes. \u2661\n  \n  and no, not yet - my family doesn't usually put up decorations for another week or two, haha. it's usually such an ordeal because my mother is extremely particular about where she wants each decoration and it drives me and my father up the wall (she's disabled so she can't do it herself).\n  ","422682":"\n  practice, practice, practice. you won't get good at writing if you don't write consistently on a daily basis. even if you don't like what you're writing, it's a valuable learning opportunity and you end up teaching yourself your own skills. eventually you develop your own voice.\n  ","422683":"\n  people have accused me of being single, or rather that my boyfriend doesn't exist, because i don't talk about our relationship often and i don't post photos of him online.\n  \n  it's amusing, tbh. random onlookers always think they know our lives better than we do, and the fact that they care enough to begin with to make accusations is alarming.\n  ","422684":"\n  physically prepared, not at all. i don't own anything to help with a medical emergency, even though i should.\n  \n  mentally, i have a tendency to keep calm during emergencies because i don't want to add to the other person's alarm.\n  ","422685":"\n  i've attended an ugly sweater party and participated, but i didn't win, unfortunately. however, the winner totally deserved it - she glued cones to the chest portion of the shirt and rigged it with christmas lights.\n  ","422686":"\n  graduating from college with honors - most people think it's ordinary and expected for others to graduate from college because a bachelor's degree doesn't mean much anymore, but i was exceptionally proud of myself because i was dealing with mental illness at the time, as well as other stressors, and i didn't think i would be able to handle the courseload.\n  ","422687":"\n  no - in the past when i was 19 to 21, i would say yes because i was cold hearted and manipulative, but these days, i know better than to ruin a person's life.\n  \n  i'm still paying the price for the mistakes i made in my past, but i wouldn't dream of doing the same thing now.\n  ","422688":"\n  i don't do anything to keep fit because i don't exercise at all. the only thing i do to maintain my health is eat nutricious food, although i do have junk food from time to time.\n  ","422689":"\n  this is ridiculously adorable - thank you so much !! \u2661 it's anons like you who keep me coming back to askfm.\n  ","422690":"\n  unless your mind consciously blocked out those memories due to trauma - otherwise, no.\n  ","422691":"\n  some psychiatrists are so misinformed that its ridiculous - and the sad part is that it only adds to the stigma, as if BPD doesn't have enough stigma to begin with.\n  ","422692":"\n  i'm not interested in your answers, so i won't be following you.\n  ","422693":"\n  it isn't my money, so i couldn't care less about how people spend their money.\n  \n  if i had that type of money to blow, however, i'd likely spend it on vacations and tattoos instead of meaningless items on an app.\n  ","422694":"\n  i accidentally combined soy milk with skim milk while making my coffee last week at work ; i accidentally grabbed the wrong carton because i wasn't looking.\n  \n  it tasted terrible. 0\/10 do not recommend. i was so disappointed in myself and i was angry the rest of the morning, lmao.\n  ","422695":"\n  this is the background i use on my phone.\n  ","422696":"\n  yes, definitely - men are conditioned into thinking that they should suppress their emotions because it wouldn't be \"manly\" to express them, especially feelings like love and sadness. it's something that needs to change in society, especially with respect to mental health. men who have mental illness are less likely to seek out treatment because of the stigma, and in turn, there are higher rates of svicide among men than there are among women.\n  ","422697":"\n  i understand this completely - i have a tendency to self isolate when i'm depressed, which in turn only makes me more depressed because i feel guilty for trying to talk to someone about my feelings, knowing i pushed them away beforehand.\n  \n  i would make it clear to your friends that you don't intend to be distant, but it's a symptom of your depression and during those times, you require them to be pushy and try to talk you through your episode regardless.\n  ","422698":"\n  it wouldn't really be a road trip per say because we would go overseas, but i'd scoop up\n  \n   @Courrtana\n  \n  so that we could visit our friend steph in australia !!\n  ","422699":"\n  i have a window in my bathroom that's next to the shower - it's nice because you get fresh air while you're doing your business.\n  \n  it isn't a deal breaker for me, though. i'll be happy to find a place in general, haha.\n  ","422700":"\n  i only add people who i've spoken to extensively from askfm on facebook - i have a handful of askfm friends added to my facebook account because i trust them with my personal information.\n  \n  other than that, i don't add random people. i'm too paranoid that someone is going to stalk or harrass me. i don't need everyone knowing my full name, where i work, my friends, etc.\n  ","422701":"\n  i don't care about cars. as long as it runs well and doesn't waste gas, then i'm fine with it.\n  \n  i got into a fender bender this morning, and i'm pissed because i wasn't there to see it happen so now i'm afraid of how much money it'll cost out of pocket to fix my car. i hate people.\n  ","422702":"\n  i'd absolutely love to visit australia and new zealand - they both seem like beautiful countries, and i would also like to visit my friends who currently live in australia, as well.\n  ","422703":"\n  i believe witches are real people, but obviously not in the dramatic hollywood-esque way that people portray witches to be.\n  \n  correct me if i'm wrong but i believe practitioners of wicca (the religion) are called witches.\n  ","422704":"\n  i personally wouldn't feel bad in that situation - while i'm much closer to my boyfriend's family than i am to my own family, we do still have certain boundaries and it doesn't require us talking every time something miniscule happens, like getting sick.\n  \n  if i was in the hospital for something and they didn't at least text me to see how i was doing, then perhaps i would be mildly upset - but that's the only scenario i can think of.\n  ","422705":"\n  when i'm mentally, physically, and financially prepared to do so, i want to have a little family that i can call my own. i want to make something meaningful out of my life, and i want to be able to raise a family in ways that were completely different from the way i was raised.\n  ","422706":"\n  newborns can't understand complex language and don't have the ability to recall information at such young of an age. so realistically, it wouldn't matter what i can hypothetically tell a newborn one day because they won't remember it by the time they're older.\n  ","422707":"\n  i don't talk to my family about my personal problems, and i don't have friends who would disregard my feelings like that - so unfortunately, i can't relate to this situation.\n  \n  every one of my old friends who has treated me with such disdain or apathy usually weren't my friends anymore after that. i don't have room in my life for people who simply refuse to understand my feelings or refuse to care.\n  ","422708":"\n  this sounds like a question for an exterminator, not some random person on askfm.\n  ","422709":"\n  i just bought a hoodie from target the other day which says \"first i drink the coffee, then i do the things.\" it's so cozy and warm - i'm actually wearing it in my profile picture, haha.\n  ","422710":"\n  abandonment.\n  ","422711":"\n  because i'm a basic white bitch, i really like the holiday spice flat white from starbucks.\n  \n  i also enjoy gingerbread and pumpkin bread.\n  ","422712":"\n  i told my boyfriend about how down i've been feeling lately so he came home with my favorite kind of ice cream to bring some cheer to my day.\n  ","422713":"\n  i could never choose just one game. however, a few of my favorites include destiny 1 and 2, skyrim, fallout 3 and 4, bioshock and bioshock infinite, the assassins creed series, and the halo series.\n  ","422714":"\n  \u2727 i'm obsessed with guacamole and hummus.\n  \n  \u2727 i'm 26 years old.\n  \n  \u2727 i like watching true crime documentaries.\n  \n  \u2727 i graduated college in 2013.\n  \n  \u2727 i have seven tattoos.\n  \n  \u2727 i'm a writer\/editor as my profession.\n  \n  \u2727 i smoke cigarettes.\n  \n  \u2727 i like red wine more than white wine.\n  \n  \u2727 i drink at least two cups of coffee per day.\n  \n  \u2727 i'm obsessed with video games.\n  ","422715":"\n  thank you !! i'm definitely not a genius, though, haha.\n  ","422716":"\n  i'm never really in situations where i can make friends because i don't go to school or anything, and i'm too busy at work doing my job to interact with other people.\n  \n  however, i'm usually quite guarded when meeting people for the first time because i simply don't know the kind of person they are, and it takes a while for me to warm up to others due to a lack of trust.\n  ","422717":"\n  this is contradictory to my answer regarding your question, as well as the answers to the same question you asked other people.\n  \n  you're incredibly young (and don't argue with me on that, 21 is very young). focus on bettering yourself and progressing forward with your life, and the rest will fall into place.\n  ","422718":"\n  the only ways depression has affected my appearance is when i've been too depressed to keep up with hygiene - i.e. greasy hair, breaking out into pimples, having BO, etc. it's the days where i can't drag myself out of bed so my physical appearance falls apart.\n  ","422719":"\n  disclaimer - this website is for questions, not conversations.\n  \n  if you have a question for me, feel free to ask.\n  ","422720":"\n  ahh, thank you !! \u2661\n  ","422721":"\n  this is the most recent photo of me - it's from yesterday.\n  ","422722":"\n  ... that's a bit extreme.\n  ","422723":"\n  i'm introverted by nature - sometimes it would be nice to be extroverted, because then on days where i have a lot of social interaction, i won't feel run down and numb by the end of the day. being introverted means for me that social interaction physically drains me.\n  \n  i usually go by the book, although sometimes i do bend the rules to my favor as long as it doesn't put me in a risky situation.\n  ","422724":"\n  my entire persona is built from negative self image, unfortunately. i'm constantly doubting my potential, putting down my accomplishments, criticizing my appearance and weaknesses, and telling myself that i'm selfish and cold hearted.\n  \n  despite that, i still strive to become a better person than who i was in the past. because i have these negative thought patterns, it motivates me to do better.\n  ","422725":"\n  as long as it's consensual, i see nothing wrong with it. if both partners agree to having a third party enter their relationship and it works out well for them all, then what's the problem?\n  \n  obviously if a person is dating someone on the side and doesn't tell their significant other, that's a huge problem. but consent is important and there's nothing wrong with polyamorous relationships.\n  ","422726":"\n  i don't even know how to approach this statement because of how heated you are right now, so i suggest you take a walk before you come back to this conversation.\n  \n  in any event, me saying that someone pushing an unwanted fetish onto someone else is violating doesn't, in fact, take away from the experiences of people who have also faced the same types of volatile behavior (considering i'm one of them tbh). after all, a person who makes threats and refuses to listen to someone when they say no is more likely to become a predator, if they aren't one already.\n  ","422727":"\n  you're evidently unaware of the plethora of other questions this person has sent related to their fetish of choice.\n  \n  in any event, this entire anon message is dramatic as fuck so you're not doing yourself any favors by complaining about my word choices, lol.\n  ","422728":"\n  thank you ~~\n  \n  i just get so angry over certain things, and the past two days have been somewhat of a breaking point to me and i don't know how to handle it anymore. i get such intense urges to either be reckless and stupid or drink myself into a coma whenever it happens.\n  \n  it'll pass hopefully but for now i'm still seething and i'm going to try to sleep on it because anything else i do would only hurt myself.\n  ","422729":"\n  no, and it isn't something i'm ever interested in getting.\n  \n  all further questions from you will be deleted. obviously explaining to you why your behavior is wrong didn't work, so i suppose i'll just have to block and report from now on.\n  ","422730":"\n  i guess some people never learn, even if the truth is smacking them in the face. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  ","422731":"\n  no, and it's wrong for you to assume such about any person in general, not just me. 99% of people on this website are not comfortable with such interactions pertaining to unwanted fetishes, so my advice to you is to keep your inclinations to yourself.\n  ","422732":"\n  i've never posted photos of the bottom half of my body, let alone my feet, so for all you guys know, i could suffer from chronic foot infections and deformities.\n  \n  regardless - imposing your fetishes onto a stranger like this is extremely violating and disgusting.\n  ","422733":"\n  they were, and sometimes still are, extremely critical - i grew up in an abusive environment, so their unhappiness was often taken out on me or i was blamed for what went wrong. as i've gotten older, i was conditioned into thinking that things were seemingly my fault by nature, and in turn, i've never been happy with myself.\n  ","422734":"\n  i wouldn't want to pick favorites because that would be unfair to the other people i follow - i enjoy everyone's answers, which is why i follow the people whom i do follow.\n  \n  i'm also closer to some people as opposed to others, and i wouldn't want other people to feel as if i favor my friends over those whom i'm not as friendly with, if that makes sense.\n  ","422735":"\n  i never believed i had much influence over other people, simply because i'm a nobody. however, i'm aware that i have a strong presence on some forms of social media (askfm, being the biggest) so i try to do my best to portray myself in an acceptable light and not glamorize the unhealthy things i've done to myself.\n  ","422736":"\n  these foot fetish questions in my inbox need to stop.\n  ","422737":"\n  awesome !!\n  \n  i'm doing well - i got a new job which i enjoy more than my last job, it's a lot less stressful. there really hasn't been much going on with my life besides that, lol. how are you, friend?\n  ","422738":"\n  LOL, trust me - the night is young. i've already had three glasses of wine and it isn't even dessert time yet, plus the family is playing a game later.\n  \n  we also have peach vodka, which is my jam, so i may have a little bit of that too. ?\n  ","422739":"\n  this joke wasn't even funny. 0\/10 effort.\n  ","422740":"\n  it's perfectly acceptable and it is ok to do so - just because you have a fragile sense of masculinity doesn't mean you can impose your vulnerabilities onto other people's lives.\n  ","422741":"\n  if this was true, then we wouldn't have complex emotions such as love, hate, anger, passion, sadness, etc etc.\n  \n  we're more than just sexual beings, and there's a whole realm of existence besides merely sex.\n  ","422742":"\n  absolutely - people are capable of moving on from past lives given the right amount of time and experience in life. i've moved on from my exes, as have most of my friends from their exes. we have the capability to allow love to dissipate and make room for other people in our heart.\n  ","422743":"\n  i've never encountered such a scenario - i avoid misogynistic men like the plague. i don't doubt that this exists, though - people in general tend to be hypocrites and only think about themselves.\n  ","422744":"\n  no, i would personally become too depressed to function if i chose to stay home instead of work (assuming you mean if i didn't develop a disability).\n  \n  working provides structure to my day and gives me a sense of accomplishment.\n  ","422745":"\n  this question doesn't make any sense. if a person doesn't want to be pregnant and they subsequently get an abortion, they're not a parent and thus can't be called a deadbeat.\n  \n  if that person does have a child and doesn't want to be in that child's life despite having rights over that child, and further doesn't do anything to make themselves a better person, then i think they deserve that title of being a deadbeat regardless of their gender.\n  ","422746":"\n  i have an open mind to it - i believe in spirits and such, and i have a few friends who are physics who do believe in it. i just don't think it's to such an extreme as movies portray it to be.\n  ","422747":"\n  i'd inform him that it's my decision to make because it's my body, and even though he may want a child now, i don't feel capable of handling a child at this point in my life.\n  \n  realistically, he understands this and supports my decision - whatever i decide to do if this situation arose.\n  ","422748":"\n  i'm doing fine - not too great but not bad either. i was discussing with my therapist last night about how i feel like i'm just coasting through my life because nothing significant has happened in a while, and admittedly my job is a bit boring.\n  \n  i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that there's nothing for me to look forward to.\n  ","422749":"\n  i'd obviously feel angry at my friend because he's spreading false information about me, especially something on such a personal level.\n  \n  if i were you, i'd confront him head on - it's the only way to resolve the situation, even though it might be difficult. they need to know that what they're doing is wrong and a violation of your privacy.\n  ","422750":"\n  it's amazing that people would rather risk dealing with the often inaccurate responses of other people rather than doing their own homework.\n  ","422751":"\n  i overthink things all of the time - the downfalls of having mental illnesses. most of the day consists of me thinking critically, and sometimes my mind wanders and makes up a lot of \"what if\" scenarios.\n  ","422752":"\n  one of my first few dates with my boyfriend included going to the beach - it was during the middle of the week so it was fairly quiet, and we spent the time talking and listening to music. there was also a food bar on the beach, so we were able to eat as well.\n  ","422753":"\n  i'm fairly good at remembering passwords, but sometimes it takes me a few tries because i have different variations of passwords depending on the site i use.\n  ","422754":"\n  i met the members of linkin park back in 2008 during one of their concerts. they were the nicest group of people i ever met, and i'm so grateful that i met them because of the profound influence they've had on my life.\n  ","422755":"\n  aside from the obvious answer of money, i believe it's how happy a person is with their life and the type of support system they have to help them deal with life's stressors.\n  ","422756":"\n  money is one of the most important aspects of my life, so paying me in money would be best - i need to pay my bills, pay for doctor visits and medication, etc etc.\n  ","422757":"\n  she bought me a soy candle, an organic lip scrub, and a bath bomb. they're all from a local business that makes all natural bath products.\n  \n  my boyfriend bought me a bottle of disaronno, my cousin bought me a starbucks gift card, my brother bought me some snacks to take to work, and my parents bought me a leather jacket with a hoodie sewn inside for the winter.\n  ","422758":"\n  the gifts my best friend bought me for my birthday !!\n  ","422759":"\n  there's nothing really to do because there's simply no room for her anyway - it's only a one bedroom, and that's reserved for you and your husband. even though she would like to move in, she realistically can't.\n  ","422760":"\n  everyone is coming over my house tonight and all i want to do is be left alone.\n  ","422761":"\n  my weekend has been good so far!!\n  \n  i left work early on friday so that my boyfriend and i had time to drive to the motel we were staying in to check in. we met up with his family that evening and went to a wine tasting event at an aquarium, and it was so much fun - a lot of delicious wine, a variety of huge fish, and live music !!\n  \n  we spent the night in the motel, grabbed breakfast with the family, and then headed home. i got home around 3pm yesterday and spent the afternoon relaxing, napping, drinking tea, etc. at night, i went to my best friend's house and we hung out for a few hours.\n  \n  today, i'm not planning on doing much. i'm going to relax all afternoon and then some family and my boyfriend are coming over for dinner to celebrate my birthday.\n  "}}
