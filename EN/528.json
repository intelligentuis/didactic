about being an uneducated conspiracy theory bottomfeeder .","488668":"i m not trying to insult you . you literally said all those things and then you lash out when you re challenged . if you review your conduct , you were the first person to condescend . when you act like that , why would you be surprised when it elicits rudeness back ?","488669":"do you not see what s wrong with posting a screenshot of an out of context snippet and extrapolating those numbers onto the society we live in ? wake up . there s still time for you to save yourself from being swallowed by the abyss .","488670":"what planet are you living on ? now you re trying to pretend that you never talk up yourself ? you ve talked about what a genius you are on here ad nauseam . i tested so high they thought it was fake harvard blah blah it s a joke .","488671":"? ? ?","488672":"you invent insane numbers and when asked for where you got it from , you post the contact info from a professor . yeah , that s not how this works . you clearly don t know where tf you got those numbers from .","488673":"no one asked you to apply anywhere . we both know this . you never had a genius iq either . you ve created this grandiose version of yourself that is utterly baseless .","488674":"beautiful name","488675":"yes , i do . those insane numbers you listed and over half killed their children have no basis in reality . if they did , you d post exactly where you got them from .","488676":"who am i ? who are you ? just because you made up a story about getting into harvard doesn t mean you know anything about what you re saying . all your foolishness is humored because it s usually not so egregious .","488677":"i wasn t talking about serial killers ! i literally repeated myself to you multiple times saying that i wasn t the one who brought that up . your inability to comprehend questions is astounding . you look at every question you read and assume we re all the same person even when we tell you otherwise .","488678":"you are the reason why conspiracy theories run rampant in this country .","488679":"then do it .","488680":"women are not more likely to off people they re close to than men . look at the domestic violence related fatality numbers . they re overwhelmingly men caused . but because some random psychologist says ones committed by women are underreported , you ve wildly misinterpreted its implications .","488681":"h ?","488682":"so what s your real name ?","488683":"that is my argument and my only one . you re not talking to the same person with all these questions .","488684":"the point is the same men are more likely to kiii","488685":"oh i believe you . i m not trying to act like all women are angels . there are all kinds of evil ones , but the example i m giving , which is the easiest way to inflict the most damage , is something women don t do even a fraction as often as men . there has to be some kind of reason behind that .","488686":"it is the same to an extent murdering","488687":"so you think women are more evil than men ?","488688":"and also , most of those awful mass casualty situations were not patternless or random at all . the person , usually a late teen to something man , often has some sort of agenda that they ve outlined and chose where they d do it pretty carefully . women almost never do this .","488689":"sure but what you re saying doesn t hold if we take into account that with modern technology we re able to tell if someone s was poisoned . even then , there are still more men who are like that than women","488690":"how about all the crazy active shooter situations ? almost all of them are men . seems like a strong correlation .","488691":"has anyone called you charlie boomket yet ?","488692":"why do you think is it that most serixi kiiixrs are men ?","488693":"you wouldn t . it was a trick question which you handled perfectly . this was like when willy wonka went off on charlie at the end to see how he d react .

matter","489144":"instead of hating our lives , we should love our lives . if that means living in solitude , so be it . if that means living in antarctica with those cute penguins , so be it . if it

.","488668":"oooooooooooooooh , you just dont like being corrected or have your strong willed opinions looked at from different perspectives","488669":"im utterly shocked . ive been starring at your response just in amazement of how hard you are trying to sound smart . god i wish i cared as much as you sometimes .","488670":"wanna know the difference between someone who s intelligent and someone

for assuming its the same person talking about the same thing youre not fucking anonymous . so dont try and insult me like im incapable of comprehending your lack of intelligence when you re too much of a pussy to come of anonymous to show me your a different person instead of being all booty tickled i don t just assume you re all just a different group of keyboard warriors .","488678":"do you know what a conspiracy theory is ? conspiracy theory a belief that some covert but influential organization is responsible for a circumstance or event . i do not really see how be arguing that women are probably just as equally capable of being serial killers a conspiracy ?","488679":"bro , have you been even reading the thread . i posted multiple times they dont even have all serial killers documented whatsoever . its extremely difficult . how can you make a theory when you arent even able to calculate the correct numbers ? if not all serial killers are documented throughout the last few hundred of years how can you even think you can make an educated guess ? also , who the fuck are you ? are you some psychologist with a phd studying the brain at harvard , who are you to make a definitive argument like this and not even be able to give me more than one example other than mass shootings ?","488680":"hahahhahahhahahahhaha killed at least one person in their care , and nearly half of them have killed their children .","488681":"hey lovely ? how are you","488682":"my name is savannah","488683":"your argument is very easily debunked","488684":"no thats not the point at all ? women are more likely to poison you men are more likely to mass shoot up a school . women are more likely to kill you in the hospital they are called angel killers men are more likely to stalk you . women are more likely to kill someone they get close too . men are more likely to kill a stranger . from a psychologist who study serial killers literally said exactly what i said .","488685":"your example isnt a serial killer . your example is a one time planned event . serial killers are clearly separate murders at different times . dude its in the fucking name serial series your argument should be women do not commit mass shootings .","488686":"no , you asked about serial killers . serial killers is one of the different types of murders . they are not all the same . some are more heinous that they get classified as serial .","488687":"i know women are more fucked up and crazy than men . women are patient . they crawl inside your brain and twist shit around .","488688":"i think people dont give women enough credit . i dont think people believe women are smart but actually they just manipulated men into believing their not smart so the man thinks the women are too stupid to work so the women gets to stay home all day and just wait for the husband to leave to do her real agenda . have you studied about the teen girls that kill their students by luring into woods ect . its tragic . if you take the time to study youd see theres a fuck ton of fucked up but brilliant females . you wouldnt believe me but some of the notorious serial killers are women . i own a book called serial killer files it has a pretty equal amount of genders","488689":"yeah maybe if the body died recently and was kept well but not in the s and before . . . how the fuck would you be able go get a good record of all those people who were being murdered left and right since there was no modern technology . also , women are snakes . if you go read about women serial killers today they are more terrifying than the men . at least the men will just cut your hand off in your face but women will manipulate you . have you not paid attention to the women that somehow always has a rich old husband that keeps dying ?","488690":"those arent categorized as serial killers . those are mass murders , manslaughter . a serial killer is someone that systematically is killing individual victims with a pattern and or motive . its more sinister , dark , wicked . mass murder manslaughter is someone that kills one or multiple people at one time with no pattern or system just a random selection of victims . thats why car accidents that have casualties are manslaughter because its random and not planned .","488691":"no that is a new one ! ! ?","488692":"i would say that most are men , i just over time in history men were the ones more likely to get caught because women had be a little bit more sneaky to kill . . theres been so many women who poisoned tons of people but never got caught cause in the time nobody figured it out yet . and i would say that most people vision men to be more animalistic cause they hunt and they are bigger stronger . people dont realize that over time women have manipulated those men into doing awful things for them . so you cant really make it so black and white when we dont even have a proper record of all the people killing people","488693":"omg , another point for me ! ! teamboomdoesitagain ?","488694":"you must be new here","488695":"the boombonic plague wouldnt be negative . it would be positive . it would be a virus that makes your body

in kindergarten my brothers best friend let me come over with my brother and this family in was making about million a year . then my best friend for many years , her father made million a year around . so you can imagine how much they probably make now cause they still make a lot of money today . i dont think its really fair that they make this much money . like if they just took million and gave , to people that could help out our economy so much . . . ive seen stupid wealth and luckily the families i know give back a lot but theres a lot of people that should help but dont .","488725":"thats

skinny dipping at night and now all my friends go to nude beaches and shit ?","488739":"good morning . i just woke up . yesterday day i got a jellyfish lava lamp and now i cant look away . never give a stoner a lava lamp if you want them to do stuff ?","488740":"how do you know that name ? ? and i was really stoned and i was like whats an adjective that you wouldnt want your blow ? and then bam creamy was born .","488741":"someone please cheer me up !","488742":"its funny cause ive already thought about this and ive thought id be the perfect mistress hahaha","488743":"i would love that ?","488744":"broccoli bacon pasta the way my stepdad does cause its amazing ugh i need to learn it . its my favorite","488745":"i would love to make food for you . i wanna make you all my favorite foods and see what you think of savvys little twists to regular food !","488746":"i need a hour massage lol","488747":"chicken ?","488748":"travel the globe ?","488749":"i drive slowly and evenly and i dream about home","488750":"be my stars","488751":"this is probably the best thing youve ever said to me ?","488752":"i just bacon and egg pasta . i like cooking when nobody is up lol ?","488753":"i ended up ordering japanese food and then make italian food at like am","488754":"clever as the devil and twice as pretty","488755":"yes and no . i believe if karma was in full effect it would definitely be what goes around comes around type life but since theres so much corruption it doesn t exactly let those who deserve good karma get good karma or those who deserve bad . . .","488756":"yeah , we cant really be friends anymore . its kinda awkward cause we were best friends but now that i know the truth its just not the same","488757":"im a really jealous person . what s stupid is i don t understand why im getting jealous cause you would think , she has no reason to be jealous . but i do . i get really fucking jealous over the stupidest shit . i just have to think everyone is doing and is better than me . that other people are more worthy .","488758":"in a way , our intelligence would in fact make us superior but no one would accept it but its the truth . if we are capable of not going through glitches , thats pretty superior ?","488759":"yes , i believe so ?","488760":"im ready to soar through the night sky with you ! ?","488761":"saturn","488762":"where will we go ?","488763":"no it doesnt babe","488764":"but time is such a strange , incomprehensible thing isnt it ?","488765":"of course you think that ? ?","488766":"i used to look forward to going out with my friends and go dance ? my little heart out","488767":"knowledge . strength . when a person get crushed by the world around them but the rise from the fire like a phoenix and start again to end up successful again .","488768":"i could be more sexy tho ?","488769":"that would make a lot of sense because my whole life people would tell me how they remember certain things and i always have to correct them and i can give like small details about everything too . people make the excuse we all perceive things differently but what if we just say that cause we don t understand that our simulation was just glitching ? or i have a couple friends that literally go off into space so intensely it looks like they leave their body . . what if the simulation is paused and thats why that happens ?","488770":"whoa and what does it mean if your a person that never had a glitch like that and managed to go their whole lives remembering exactly how things went ?","488771":"thats a really good point . maybe he really was so smart to see what s really going on !","488772":"maybe john lennon knew thats where he was headed ? maybe thats why people commit suicide ? those thoughts in their head that tell them that this life is meaningless and sad because they somehow have knowledge without realizing it about the world that comes after and they cant wait any longer or maybe they got a message for the supervisors saying , its time , you can come home now .","488773":"well it s essentially why they would want you to start as a baby cause whenever someone comes out of a coma what is it like for them ? its like they turned into an adult baby . . but the hosts didnt have years to wait . . . they need to start in a year or so . . and thats why theres so many stories of people in comas waking up with talents they never had before , talking about people theyve never met , and have memories that arent even theres ! omg wait , this is kinda making sense .","488774":"no to look so sexy ?","488775":"lets say its three times and the clue to know whether your in the first or second simulation before the rd is the first you go into it knowing nothing , unable to see whats right in front of them cause they have to learn so much then the nd simulation you know a bit more , you re more open minded and see the world for what it is because you took all you learned from the first time without even knowing it . then the rd is what people call heaven but its not actually heaven its here on earth but in a different dimension in a different simulation the best simulation . .","488776":"what if people who go into comas because they get pulled out of the matrix but they leave the body able to have a new host unless the body is too damaged and they just take it out completely ? but what if the ones that wake up are never who they were when they fell into a coma ? what if its the fastest way to switch host without going through the whole birthing process ? stop it spencccyyy my brain might explode with all these ideas . lol ?","488777":"ohhhhhh . . . now im getting it . why do you think it must be three times ? why couldnt it be infinite until you deliver whatever your destiny is preprogrammed for you in the matrix and you have to keep going into its done correctly ?","488778":"the amount of one worded answers is just a disappointment . i had to read that over times to fully grasp what you are saying and i still think that concept is so obscure that my brain is like buffering ? how would the true simulation being different than the matrix inside the matrix ? what about dying twice makes it where you re able to go to where we re living in ? and why is it where we re living is the special place , what if we are just in our first matrix ? are you able to tell in the matrix that you are in the matrix , are their any clues ? look what you did to my brain , are you proud ? ?","488779":"i think you need to teach the rest of us the secret to getting happiness like this . .","488780":"yeah exactly . like change it up a bit . some questions are deeper than others . but to these boring fucks think all questions are the same ?","488781":"its fucking sunny and hot ?","488782":"im over here all like , wow you must be a fucking blast at a party . ? i feel bad for having short answers i have to put emojis or i feel so disrespectful ?","488783":"thank you hun","488784":"dude i would get more enjoyment out of talking to a rock . there s people i do not understand have so much activity when their answers consist of no yes idk and thats it . like maybe its not their fault , maybe its the people on here condoning this boring plain behavior ?","488785":"there was this one time where i went on a full vagina pampering spree so i was buying all this shit for my period ect and the girl started laughing and was like i should call you up when im about to be on my period cause you just created the ultimate period package .","488786":"its fascinating seeing how during the years ask has changed . it went from people kinda using it to post whatever they want to now people take this shit so seriously . i rarely see a funny ask anymore . i miss italy . fuck . she was so funny .","488787":"i think you deserve a gold star for thinking this ?","488788":"its not so much a bad answer i got from someone but its just there answers on here in general . i understand that sometimes questions may have a quick answer but literally all i see is one worded answers all day long . im like boo , you re so boring . also , like put some effort into it . care a little bit more . people are asking to get to know you , its just kinda rude .","488789":"simplest way of gaining someone s respect is by being there when they think you wouldnt be . simplest way of losing it is being a different person when they arent around and talking negatively about them .","488790":"i love to write . i love how you can take different words and make so many different variations with them . you can feel peoples words , like paper is their canvas and their pain is transferred to the words that they choose . everyone has a story to tell , and writing makes it possible to read them all .","488791":"luv u booboo","488792":"i want more muscle ? ?","488793":"im not . . . im in a constant state of anxiety . i thought i was stronger than this . i thought if there was an apocalypse i would be the badass but im just weak and anxious about nothing for no reason ever . . .","488794":"i get infatuated with one aspect of the person and then i learn more about them and then im like nope . not for me . .","488795":"i was in kindergarten but my mom had to pick me up cause school was canceled and then we just sat in the living room watching the news for hours . .","488796":"what if life isnt truly meaningless but the truth is something we arent even capable of comprehension ? what if that thought alone scares people more than thinking life is just meaningless ? what if we all have our purpose positive or negative ?","488797":"no i do not . i am very lucky for that too .","488798":"i see you ?","488799":"what flower would you like to be ? ?","488800":"a little bit of me died . but you know what ? a lot of me doesnt give a shit .","488801":"i feel like i might have irish cause i do not tan for my life and i am amazing

simulation . its like the found a secret button in our brain and i wanna know everything .","489038":"when i was in nd or rd grade my school had us do an exercise to see what type of people we were . if theres people on the train track tied down with a train coming , you can save of them and yourself but lose the rest or you can save all of them but you wouldnt make it . what do you do ? wanna know what my teachers predicted i would be ? a leader or hero of some sort . because at years old i was willing to sacrifice myself like i understood wtf that meant lol but i just remember everyone else chose the other one and thought i was weird anyways . . . . you gotta sacrifice in anything you want to achieve greatness in . if you re not willing to sacrifice for the better of yourself or humankind then whats the point ? if there was a disease that was so deadly in a little village in africa , so we went over there and studied it and used the people to test vaccines ect is it wrong

yet ?","489039":"wait , can you explain ?","489040":"it happens all day for me","489041":"oh my god , bro yesterday i actually made this point to someone . im not sure if you saw it . what if our idea of whats good and bad was just created from our own freewill ? what if things went differently bad things were good and good things were bad ? so what if we are preprogrammed as a simulation and it s called alternative realities because they preprogrammed different outcomes to different worlds because of different realities and freewill ? what if some are supposed to commit suicide , kill people , eat people , steal , and just awful things ? we dont know why yet , but what if all of it doesn t actually have a reason that we would all agree and like ? what if they preprogrammed this world with such fuckery to see how we would react and quite possibly in another universe you could possibly be way worse or way better ? its a see what happens ? ? kinda superiority honestly . i dont think they control everything we do but i do think that based on the personality they give you , they want to see what choices we make . thats where this idea of freewill comes from , its the illusion

first time riding a bike i was so scared , my brother had me go down a steep hill my first time . i fell into bushes but kept riding ever since . first time swimming in a pool i was scared of water , my brother threw me in the deep end and i swam everyday after that first time in the ocean i was terrified of the waves , my friend made me run into a wave with her and kept going . i was scared of opening up my mind to the pain , but i found a therapist that i actually trust . and now ive been diving deeper than i think i like lol i had this fear of change , my cousin was next to me through the

cells or decoding our dna to find the marker that is actually a timer that stops your body from creating cells it needs to in order for you to start dying because the aliens wanted us for labor of metals and gold , they didnt want us to live as long as them cause that was counterproductive . or we are in a simulation and we technically never die because we technically never alive . or our souls keep reincarnating over and over again in different lives which would make it so we are immortal just switching hosts .","489173":"why wouldnt you want to live for yourself ? ?","489174":"what do you
