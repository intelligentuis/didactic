the break up ? do you feel better when you re not with them ? it s questions you have to ask yourself . remember your happiness comes first before anyone else","592199":"but food and shelter clothing for the homeless","592200":"did they break up with you or did you break up with them ? and i mean only some people deserve a second chance depending on what they did for the reason for a break up in

most hospitals and first responders are helping those who have the virus first .","592655":"sunny but not too hot . i like a mid to low with a pleasant breeze","592656":"of course","592657":"valekrys she just knows how to make me happy no matter how i may be feeling","592658":"people are free to change by their own will . you shouldn t try to make someone change if they don t want too however you could try to shout them a different point of view","592659":"sure","592660":"no . i just don t want there to be fights between you and emma .","592661":"highly doubt that if in the us but

someone","592674":"i told you to stop calling me that i m already taken by someone and you need to respect that .","592675":"because being honest can hurt people but what they don t know is that a lie hurts more than the truth","592676":"that s a good question","592677":"inside the heart","592678":"yes","592679":"yes","592680":"facts . just more reasons to delete my account","592681":"i

want you can follow mine mtaubs fitness","592692":"they will constantly ask where you are , what are you doing , they won t let you hangout with anyone else but them , and there s a lot more . they can be deceiving , they can make you put them first before yourself and your family .","592693":"the theme parks and locations","592694":"standing up for you no matter what","592695":"it s an inside joke for a reason","592696":"not really specifically . i just get jealous when people try to brag more about things i can t do that they can do when i m with my other half .","592697":"steak and mashed potaters","592698":"lol","592699":"yea but being weird and nice are two different things lmao","592700":"lmao you don t know me . i m a weirdo","592701":"cause i m a

everyone else and that they re untouchable .","592708":"you have to trust someone to be betrayed . . . i never did","592709":"hey","592710":"my girlfriend . she s absolutely perfect","592711":"my relationship with family and my soulmate","592712":"at my house sleeping","592713":"california","592714":"positivity","592715":"girlfriend boyfriend because it s more meaningful . i rather spend my time and life with someone who makes me happy then to waste my time for a one night stand","592716":"fun","592717":"watching tv","592718":"it depends on the secret . if it s telling someone you like them then try to set up a nice scenery where you can tell them","592719":"hey","592720":"bet","592721":"yes","592722":"for me , yea i get kind of jealous when she does but i kiss her afterwards so her friends know what s up","592723":"idk what ?","592724":"scorpio","592725":"which ever you prefer . my insta is mtaubs fitness","592726":"the amount it takes to hit a rep . so example if you re doing a squat . it should take you x amount of seconds to reach full position of a squat for it to count as a rep","592727":"for abs . do a count flutter kicks , sets hanging knee ups , sets toe touches , sets russian twist","592728":"alright . sounds good . i ll write you a program on your ask page when i get home from the gym later after finishing back day","592729":"haha no problem","592730":"back , biceps and triceps , chest , hamstrings , quads , shoulders","592731":"of course . send me what two muscles groups you want to work","592732":"if you want i can give you a couple certain muscle group to workout for a couple day as a trial .","592733":"well for one my programs are . they are a day program based off beginner , intermediate , or advanced workouts depending on where you re starting from . each workout program consists of a particular muscle group for each day and includes meal plan for muscle growth and body leanness .","592734":"i know the term v line or v taper lol . that s how i know it . pull ups , lat pull downs , deadlifts , squats help . basically full body stretch exercises","592735":"adonis belt ? i m sorry i don t think i ever heard that term before","592736":"that s true but remember . contractions are the best way build muscles . it s better to do lighter weight with more slow squeezing reps than heavy","592737":"well it could be anything","592738":"maybe you just used too much weight . or you over extended the exercise at that time","592739":"it could just be that you hit legs a lot more at the gym then you do with upper body . like for example i probably hit legs once or twice every other week so when i hit legs my legs are always sore . however when i hit any upper body it s not really sore . maybe try doing different leg exercises that your body isn t use too .","592740":"good so then it should be safe","592741":"with the virus . . . my mom doesn t want me to go to the gym anymore but i go because i m passionate about working out . it s one of my favorite things to do and it allows me to help out those that want to change their lifestyle . just make sure you wash your hands really well after the gym and wipe down equipment before and after using it and you should be fine .","592742":"she already treats me as if i was the best thing in life . she makes me feel special and needed and honestly gives me a feeling that no one ever has before","592743":"i do sometimes . just not all the time . i don t spend too much time on social media","592744":"honestly right now i live to work because my parents support me mainly financially . but once i m probably settled with my own family and land a good job as an engineer hopefully as well as being a ceo of a company with my masters in business administration hopefully it turns into work to live because i would want my kids growing up knowing they have to work hard for the things they want in life","592745":"ok so everyone asks this question a lot . rest days are important to allow your body to recover especially if you don t meal prep and intake the daily nutrients you need to build mor muscle . i normally take rest days and maybe more depending how hard i push myself . this week i went to the gym times and am doing rest day . next week i m probably going times and taking rest days . you never want your body on a set schedule in the gym . you want to trick your body to experience muscle shock to build muscle . hopefully this helps stay grinding","592746":"i would for sure keep some of the money but i would probably donate it to those that are less fortunate like our veterans and the homeless as well as donating to animal shelters","592747":"no . she s not in pr","592748":"i m famous what can i say","592749":"she s in pr","592750":"the person who i have feelings for","592751":"it can take up to hours for a body part to get sore . for example i didn t hit legs till tuesday and starting today when i woke up my legs were sore . it s been at least hours . also it could be that you re just not doing enough repetitions . remember key to building muscle is pushing it past it s breaking point to where you need to push for each rep","592752":"it s up to you","592753":"stretching or protein shakes . some massages too help","592754":"coffee , late night fires , enjoying the outdoors","592755":"of course . you got to remember it s my business so it s my source of income . all i ask is that you don t waste my time","592756":"yes . and the thing that reminds me of that person are the people i hangout with because she s always around the same people","592757":"not sure .","592758":"my st . it s where i found my soul mate","592759":"ok","592760":"thanks and about the video i can t really help you out cause i can t see the workout you re doing . next time you go to the gym try to take a video of you actually doing the exercise so i can let you know if it s right or not","592761":"yes sorry . had to take an important phone call","592762":"of course","592763":"it s next to the camera button when someone asks you a question . you can only post pictures videos when answering a question .","592764":"then tell them that . but honestly if you re going to break up with someone you have to do it in person . don t do it over the phone . that s just wrong .","592765":"you can try to get back together with them if you were the one who broke up with them .","592766":"i mean i sell my programs for and it s usually a month program that comes with a meal plan as well for best results but it includes a full day gym routine . but for an at home workout with a meal plan i can give you one for","592767":"focus on mainly body weight exercises . pushups , dips , squats , leg raises , jump rope if you have one , jogging up and down stairs if you have stairs","592768":"can you explain more ?","592769":"but the processed shakes that you say i m recommending aren t meant to be drunk everyday . they are more just for the days that you have sugar cravings . but good luck","592770":"hey . . . do me a favor though and don t call me baby . i m kind of talking with someone right now and we re working on getting together . so just do me a favor and respect that please . i ll be more than happy to be friends and get to know you but nothing more than that .","592771":"yea .","592772":"personally it s better to focus on one particular part of the body . because the best thing about focusing on one specific part of the body is that there a muscles there that no one really ever works out or knows about","592773":"do you eat fast food ? cause all that stuff is more processed then the shakes i m recommending lol","592774":"hey","592775":"ok . well i m not going to answer that question lmao","592776":"yes","592777":"yes","592778":"everything involves chemistry even the food you eat does","592779":"why does it matter to you ?","592780":"it s good lol . there s no need to start a fight between anonymous","592781":"well i mean the stuff i listed is all plant based clean . really great flavor and everything . especially the s mores flavored evofusion . it tastes just like hot chocolate .","592782":"yea so just be careful","592783":"at times but i mean if your gf worked hours a week , is a full time student in college . . . do you think it s really selfish as it ll help her relax from all her stress cause you ll be doing her a good thing . ?","592784":"basically focus on lean meats like steak , chicken . oz of white brown rice , and oz of any vegetable . then for your sugar intake have like a protein shake . i recommend using isoject or evofusion . you can use my off discount code as well for your purchase to help you save money as well and i can send you the weblink .","592785":"she s your girlfriend . you ll learn this saying happy wife , happy life .","592786":"i let her . she works full time and in school . she deserves it","592787":"most likely . if it was days a week it would be a different story . but by diet i don t mean a strict meal plan but eat clean","592788":"yea but it s and you have all these people that they get called gay or something or you ask them if they re gay it offends them . that s all i m saying","592789":"if you re going to lose kg in months without fitness you ll have to diet .","592790":"but you should seriously watch what you say when you say it . . . cause some people when you call them gay i society will beat your ass on the spot . just saying","592791":"cause i m a fitness trainer . it s my business i run and how i make my income .","592792":"do i ?","592793":"don t know who told you that but nah .","592794":"do you even spell bro ?","592795":"no not really lol","592796":"i mean i wouldn t own a pair of girls leggings lmao . but i wore my friends pair for wacky tacky day at school","592797":"yes lol","592798":"yes","592799":"i m not really religious","592800":"you re right . it is hard to forget memories . especially memories that were really good . i don t think anyone ever truly tries to forget memories because even during certain cases those memories may resurface even if you re trying to hide them from coming back","592801":"no work , no bills , easy classes . all i would have to focus on would be school and spending time with friends","592802":"it s like those who see a glass half full . some people will say it s half empty , others would say it s half full .","592803":"hey . i m not sure if you have any plans this weekend but would you want to grab a coffee or a bite to eat ?","592804":"basically . time is endless","592805":"dope","592806":"ice cream","592807":"by my dog yes lol","592808":"hopefully working my dream job and being able to support a family","592809":"if i live beyond i would be happy tbh","592810":"nope . i m straight","592811":"sure","592812":"i broke that scale lmao","592813":"you remember the memories you love and want to relive","592814":"probably the same but more careless","592815":"tranquility","592816":"why life is the way it is","592817":"self doubt","592818":"you have to trust someone to be betrayed . i never did","592819":"comedy or action adventure","592820":"to live and bring good to those who don t have good in their life","592821":"grandmas cooking","592822":"that everyone is the same in terms of having rights","592823":"this isn t an easy place . you will be judged and pushed to the test but just remember to stay strong and keep moving forward","592824":"we realize how much of an impact those people had on us","592825":"to help others","592826":"because we want to feel better than everyone else","592827":"steak mashed potatoes rice","592828":"my study habits","592829":"being me","592830":"idk .","592831":"i would be huge","592832":"as old as the first person who first came into your life","592833":"motivation","592834":"i don t think it s possible but depending on actions it can show a lie","592835":"idk","592836":"animals","592837":"how does he have so much passion even when he fails","592838":"i own my things","592839":"i would ask the person who created education system why is education so different throughout the world to where no one learns the same thing ?","592840":"everyday","592841":"don t wait to get something done when you can get it done right away","592842":"that s tough but i think i ll have to go with bruno mars cause i like more of the pop upbeat music","592843":"my sister and a bunch of other people in my life","592844":"donate it to multiple charities","592845":"my family","592846":"well what kind of setup do i get on another planet ? do i get to take someone with me ? am i allowed to bring my pets ?","592847":"diction because of where

a possibility . i feel like some things should be changed but i rather suggest the ideas instead of actually going in for days to change it","592877":"probably worse . because then they wouldn t see the effect of their wrong doing","592878":"why do we waste all this time judging people who are different ? instead of starting conflict we should all get along and share our ideals and
