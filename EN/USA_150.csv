  ppl might say that's stupid to have 1 at 18 but not 21 but nobody knows anybody's situation all ppl can do is judge. if i was to say i'm not ready to bring another baby into the world but say i do then i'll get hate. so it's never a win win situation especially on this site

  thank you. their just mad at my opinion
  "
805478,"

  lmfao
  "
805479,"
   some states you can

  ","
  Lmfao obviously not bc you can't have a. abortion after 3 months lol
  "
805481,"
   some people still abort even when there is brain activity tho so whats your explanation to that ????
  ","
  never heard of someone doing that but ok anon
  "
805482,"
   Jfc. Anons, the heart beat means nothing if there is no brain activity. If there is no brain activity within an adults brain they are considered brain dead & taken off of life support whether or not their heart's still beating. A fetus is NOT considered 'alive' until they start having brain activity

I was having contractions but I thought they were cramps lol. Barely felt them tho. We went in the back to go check me out and I was already 6cm dilated (btw I was only 30 weeks) so the lady told my boyfriend this bby needs to come out asap! And we both were freaking out. So they bought me back to have am emergency c section . At 10:31am on 10.21.13 I gave birth to the most perfect little human ever . Weighing at 3lbs 2oz 16 1/2 inches long. 💙💙💙💙.
