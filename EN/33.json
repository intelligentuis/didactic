It goes to show the kind of people in the environment if they don't see that that is wrong. If something is wrong.

I don't try to focus on types I just try to to afford get something I can afford. I can wrok with just about any type pf makeup. Because makeup is just so much. I like to go to the cheap stores where they have makeup that they aftermarket and drop down to like one or two dollars that is usually like $15 or more.\n  \n  So instead of spending hundreds of dollars I only spend about $10. For the same type of product.\n  ","36230":"\n  I don't wash it too too often.\n  \n  Because for one lice are attracted to really really dirty or really really clean hair and I don't want to thin my hair out and washing it a lot will do that. it'll also cause a lot of baby hairs on your forehead because the hair is breaking. I try not to put too much stuff in my hair other than shampoo products and conditioning. When I do wash my hair I try to shampoo it twice very well. I use scalp shampoo for my scalp and then I use different shampoo for my length and then I use conditioner twice and I let it sit in my hair 5 to 10 minutes apart. Then don't wash all of the conditioner out and leave a little little bit in your hair so when you go to brush your hair after, not only is it easy but it also leaves a really good shine and a good smell in your hair. But you wash out most of the conditioner because you don't want to be too oily. I use a detangling wet brush so I don't rip all my hair out and I'm very delicate with brushing my hair. I do not blow dry my hair because too much heat can break hair easily and damage it. I very rarely straighten my hair. And I try to keep it away from really harsh breezes because it can cause really difficult knots to get out in your hair. Having really bad knots in your hair can cause you to rip out your hair. You want to brush your hair two or three times a day and keep the knots out of it. When you go to sleep at night usually put up on top of head in a bun because when you go to sleep the back of your head can collect really bad knots. The only other thing that I put in my hair sometimes is hair perfume but I honestly try to stay away from that.\n  \n  When I go to my hair stylist which is a very close family member and friend inwhich is pretty much the only person I've ever let touch my hair. I am very picky with who does my hair. She hooks me up always. I keep my natural hair color except the only thing that I color is my underneath front of my hair which we call them peekaboos.

Even door slamming and opening and closing multiple times in a row.\n  \n  Having Electronics on us completely drained of their battery and it's more than one thing. It's like five or six different things everything just drains battery. Everything was fully charged not even minutes ago.\n  \n  Drastic temperature changes. Walking into rooms where the temperature drops almost 20 to 30 degrees sometimes. When it's not even cold outside and there's no air conditioning in the house.\n  \n  I have legitimately witnessed and seen with other people around me things being thrown. Sometimes being thrown at us and sometimes just being thrown somewhere or maybe just across the room. No explanation, nobody touching it, nothing pushing it causing it to fall... no vibrations of any sort... no small earthquakes or anything lile that. Just really really strange crazy scary. Yeah..\n  \n  Me and the team have caught apparitions orbs have heard many disembodied voices that were completely and utterly unexplained.\n  \n  Some people have appeared to have been attacked choked get nauseous sometimes on investigations. Some people get pushed and tripped..\n  \n  We have seen chairs movie.\n  \n  And sooo much more.\n  \n  This is just a few things that has happened to me and a few other people that have been with us and have experienced the same thing at the same time\n  ","36393":"\n  I really appreciate this comment.
