live in the current moment and urges you to describe the things going on in that present time so that you gain a sense of grounded-ness. it's really interesting and it helps me on occasion.\n  \n

my normal routine is beneficial to my mental health because it provides me with a sense of stability -- getting up and going to work everyday, doing household chores when i get home, making or ordering dinner, cleaning, and then settling down to relax at the end of the day.\n  ","399221":"\n  i'm not a member of any online support groups. however, when i was a teenager, i found that my time spent on active forums unrelated to mental health actually helped distract me from my life and provided me with a place to vent and a sense of comfort, knowing that there were other people on there who felt the same way. i've grown close to a lot of those people, even though we've never met IRL.\n  ","399222":"\n  i think of narcissists, who are generally people who only think about themselves and how situations can affect themselves solely. people who put down others if it means enhancing their own lives. people who won't admit that they're wrong even when presented with evidence proving the contrary. people who are all-around selfish too confident in themselves to the point where it becomes detrimental to those around them.\n  ","399223":"\n  i don't recognize her. but perhaps i'll

sleeves up halfway to my elbows, with flannels and basically any other long-sleeved shirt.\n  ","399280":"\n  i try not to be jealous of anything or anyone, because jealousy is a toxic emotion and only leads to greater harm to yourself than anything else.\n  ","399281":"\n  children rarely ever get sent to jail because they're minors, and if anything, they'll be sent to juvenile centers as a \"punishment\" for their crimes.\n  ","399282":"\n  like i said earlier, i believe in open communication with children. this would mean that if i felt that my child shouldn't go on a specific field trip, i would explain in depth why i believed so, in order for the child to have a better understanding of my opinion and possibly come to terms with it or learn from the experience.\n  ","399283":"\n  well, the law is the law and it exists for a reason. if a child broke the law and got caught, they should learn from the experience and deal with the repercussions of their actions. whether or not a parent wants to deal with it themselves doesn't negate the fact that the law was broken in the first place.\n  ","399284":"\n  i'm not really sure how i feel about this type of situation because, to my knowledge, it never happened when i was in school. teachers would give students permission slips to bring home for their parents to sign allowing them to go on field trips.\n  ","399285":"\n  i wouldn't be embarrassed or anything, but i believe that i would be concerned more than anything else. obviously there's something going on in my child's life that they're not discussing with me, and because i've always envisioned myself having a communicable and open relationship with my children, i would feel as if i've done something wrong in helping in their upbringing in order for them to feel as if they need to bully other kids.\n  ","399286":"\n  i believe that could be a component of it, yes. however, i also believe that there's something deeper going on, such as having troubles at home where they're being scolded and\/or not giving the attention they need.\n  ","399287":"\n  personal growth, including now that i've been given the opportunity to learn from, grow, and heal from my past trauma now that i'm not in that toxic environment anymore.\n  ","399288":"\n  no, definitely quite the opposite. teachers have difficult jobs, but from what i've heard, they're also quite rewarding in the right circumstances. however, teachers definitely don't get paid enough for what they do.\n  ","399289":"\n  yes, usually specific examples come to mind but i don't always go into detail regarding those experiences and, instead, i base my answers on my feelings at the time or what i've learned from the experience.\n  ","399290":"\n  i'm largely self-motivated, and i've always been dedicated to my writing, as well as my job and my relationships with my partner and close friends. i'm not quite sure where the motivation comes from exactly, but i've always been very motivated to make a better life for myself and life easier for other people.\n  ","399291":"\n  i find nature to be beautiful, as well as my partner, my friends, and the shared bond i have with certain animals in my life. i find music and the arts to be beautiful, and witnessing the creation of a work of art to be ultimately inspiring.\n  ","399292":"\n  yes, i took the 23andme test a few years ago to find out what my heritage is. the results were very interesting.\n  ","399293":"\n  my love language is \"words of affirmation,\" followed closely by \"quality time.\" i just took the quiz now, ahah.\n  ","399294":"\n  say yes to more opportunities instead of hiding away like a hermit in my house. i've become quite the homebody ever since i moved into this house because it's become my safe place.\n  ","399295":"\n  i believe our physical bodies perish, but our souls (or energies or whatever you want to call them) get transferred to different mediums, mostly in nature or out into the universe somewhere. energy cannot be destroyed, only transferred, and while i don't believe in an afterlife or reincarnation or anything, i do believe that the essence of our beings does go somewhere.\n  ","399296":"\n  i've always wanted to visit iceland because it looks so interesting and a very unique holiday destination. i had an old high school friend who went there for her honeymoon after she got married, and it was absolutely beautiful.\n  \n  i think i would try to spend each day being immersed in nature, experiencing the culture, and going on various tours to learn more about the country.\n  ","399297":"\n  the little things in life keep me going. having a cup of coffee in the morning, spending quality time with friends, playing video games on nights where i know i have no responsibilities, experiencing a chilly yet sunny day, lighting a candle and listening to calming music, being surrounded by animals, etc etc.\n  ","399298":"\n  in order for me to actually think about doing that at all, they must have done something absolutely terrible and unforgivable. i wouldn't put it past myself to hurt someone intentionally if given the appropriate circumstances.\n  ","399299":"\n  good morning !!\n  \n  it's 10:30am, and i wish i could have woken up a little earlier to get laundry started, but it is what it is. i woke up 30 minutes ago, and i just finished brewing some coffee while i wait for my laundry to be finished.\n  ","399300":"\n  -- switch the laundry at 11:15am.\n  \n  -- go get gas at some point this weekend because i'm almost on E.\n  \n  -- go grocery shopping tonight or tomorrow.\n  \n  -- go to my parents' house to clean tomorrow afternoon.\n  \n  -- withdraw rent money before the end of the week.\n  ","399301":"\n  uh, i'm not 30. and god forbid i have a few drinks with my friends during a holiday celebration, lmaoo.\n  \n  if you think i was bad, you should have seen my other friend. he drank 2.5 bottles of wine by himself and was hungover until 5:00pm the following day. he was vomiting all night long.\n  ","399302":"\n  i like starbucks, but i have to be in the mood for it. i prefer their hot drinks over their cold drinks, so whenever i go, i'll just get a venti pike place with vanilla syrup and cream.\n  ","399303":"\n  \"you're welcome,\" obviously.\n  ","399304":"\n  the last movie i watched was sweeney todd: the demon barber of fleet street. it's honestly one of my favorite movies, i've re-watched it at least 10 times once i found out it was initially on netflix, haha.\n  ","399305":"\n  the last risk i took was deciding to get drunk on friendsmas last wednesday, knowing that i had to wake up at 7:00am for work the following morning. lmaoo.\n  \n  nevertheless, it worked out well. i had a great time and even showed up to work early, even though i had a terrible hangover. the day was hell but i got through it.\n  ","399306":"\n  physically, getting my ribcage tattooed.\n  \n  emotionally, witnessing the reaction of someone close to me when their parent died and they felt they had nothing left to live for.\n  ","399307":"\n  if you've tried talking to her about this and she can't see your progress, then perhaps you're better off discontinuing your sessions with her. ideally, a therapist is supposed to analyze and compare your emotions and behavior in the now to how it used to be, and if she isn't focused on you right now, then there's no way to progress forward.\n  \n  i would talk to her about this if you haven't done so already, and if she isn't receptive, then yeah i would find a new therapist.\n  ","399308":"\n  also the fatty areas tend to hurt more, for whatever reason, especially areas that aren't exposed as often like the calves or inner thighs.\n  \n  i.e., my half sleeve was tolerable except for the areas that were leading into the inside of the upper arm, like near the armpit. omg, that killed me, lmaoo.\n  \n  but yes, they're totally addictive. it's been like... two years since my last one, i think? ugh, i need more but the ideas i have are super big and expensive.\n  ","399309":"\n  it would be cool to sit down and have a cup of coffee with gillian anderson.\n  ","399310":"\n  ah, okay. yeah that area doesn't generally hurt many people. :')) my coffee cup is on my forearm and that didn't hurt at all, except for the bits closest to the inner area where my elbow bends, lol.\n  ","399311":"\n  where on your body is it? it depends really on the area of the body, as well as your own pain tolerance. some places hurt more for people than others.\n  \n  the only tattoos of mine that really killed me were my ribcage tattoo and the one i got on the back of my calf.\n  ","399312":"\n  it'll be the only constant on this hellsite. lmaoo.\n  \n  i need a new tattoo so badly, omg.\n  ","399313":"\n  my little succulent sanctuary in my room is pretty cool. \u2661\n  ","399314":"\n  yeah, white privilege is definitely real.\n  ","399315":"\n  i think it's cute !!\n  \n  cc:\n  \n   @IsoleLemuria\n  \n","399316":"\n  nah, it just helps me live more in the moment and have good times with friends.\n  ","399317":"\n  i haven't heard about it until this very moment, but i think that's despicable. she shouldn't have gotten released early at all, she's a threat and a danger to others.\n  ","399318":"\n  i only smoke weed on the rare occasion, but it has no affect on my mental health. it just makes me silly.\n  ","399319":"\n  it isn't really important, but it's something my roommates and i enjoy. we don't always buy alcohol while grocery shopping, but if someone independently wants to buy something in particular, we'll just go out and get it ourselves whenever.\n  ","399320":"\n  no? i know it's going to come from the fridge. lmao.\n  ","399321":"\n  in light of what i've experienced, i've become passionate about awareness for mental illness and try to speak on the subject whenever possible (and appropriate). i empathize with others who have struggled with the same things that i have, so i try to use my experiences to reach out to others.\n  ","399322":"\n  yes, actually. lmaoo.\n  \n  i just finished a blueberry beer. :'))\n  ","399323":"\n  i wouldn't know what i would do unless it actually happened to me. i can't predict my own behavior, it entirely depends on my mood in that moment, how i was feeling in general, how my life was going, etc etc.\n  ","399324":"\n  not really, no. i'm just on my laptop answering questions and listening to music. i wouldn't consider that multi-tasking.\n  ","399325":"\n  yes, i would absolutely relocate for love. i'm not exactly the biggest fan of the area i live in anyway, i would for sure move out of new york or perhaps even out of the country with my boyfriend if the opportunity presented itself.\n  ","399326":"\n  people's opinions on me, particular the opinions of my friends. i'm always paranoid that my friends secretly hate me or feel bad for me, and then feel obligated to stay friends with me because they're afraid of what i would do to myself if they left.\n  ","399327":"\n  i don't think you're understanding the fact that i've said that i stopped questioning \"why\" a very, very long time ago.\n  \n  it isn't productive to question why it happened. what happened has happened, and questioning why has only made me more hateful, angry, and self-destructive. they're not positive emotions, and there's nothing i can do about it now. the only thing i can do is move forward.\n  ","399328":"\n  i can't imagine myself one year from now, let alone 15 years from now.\n  ","399329":"\n  it wasn't really a good school, but we had the capabilities to take out a loan for me to briefly attend the school i had wanted to go to at the time. after some events went down during my second semester, however, i returned home and attended a local college for the remaining 3.5 years.\n  ","399330":"\n  i suppose a combination of both? i've been privileged to have had a good education growing up and the loans to attend college to obtain a degree, but a lot of my studies were independently done. even when i was home from school, i did a lot of reading and researching online about random things.\n  ","399331":"\n  i had a few friends, but i felt disconnected from them for the most part. i dated my best friend when we were in middle school, but after we broke up, i felt like i had no one for quite a while until we made amends and became friends again. everything else felt meaningless and superficial.\n  ","399332":"\n  nobody knew about the ab*se, and the only people who know now are my best friend and my boyfriend (aside from my former therapist & psychiatrist, obviously).\n  ","399333":"\n  i seldom talk to my grandparents to begin with except to thank them for gifts on holidays (texts that they never respond to, lol). i've never been close to them at all.\n  ","399334":"\n  my grandparents on my father's side, yes.\n  ","399335":"\n  no. i said earlier that i have no intentions of discussing it with my family. it isn't something that i have a desire to do, and i'm focused more on my healing as opposed to dwelling on the past.\n  ","399336":"\n  who knows, to be honest. like i said earlier, i stopped questioning \"why\" a very long time ago.\n  ","399337":"\n  abandonment by my loved ones.\n  ","399338":"\n  i've never discussed it with him because he's also been an inflicter of ab*se in the past, and i really have no desire to talk about it to any of my family members at all.\n  \n  this is my chance to heal. i can't keep dwelling on it because then i won't get the opportunity to heal, grow, and overcome it.\n  ","399339":"\n  no, i actually don't think i'm friends with anyone who also has the same name as any of my family members, haha.\n  ","399340":"\n  they would never confess to it -- there's too much arrogance, pride, narcissism there. they would continue to gaslight me and claim that i made everything up for one reason or another, and it isn't a conversation worth having at this point. my parents are the type of people who don't believe they've ever done anything wrong, even when presented with evidence, and they don't know where all of my mental health issues came from because apparently i had a \"perfectly normal\" upbringing.\n  ","399341":"\n  i'm not entirely sure, because he's significantly older than me and wasn't really around when most of the ab*se happened.\n  ","399342":"\n  i never thought you were being mean, just a bit naive to be perfectly honest. i hope i don't give off the impression that i somehow think i've had a much worse life than other people, because obviously there are a plethora of people who are in worse positions than i've been in. however, i'm also not going to discredit what i've been through because my voice deserves to be heard too.\n  ","399343":"\n  yes, i have one brother.\n  ","399344":"\n  my parents judged me a lot, and honestly they still do even though i don't live with them anymore. the lack of control they have over me now has only caused them to try to control me more even though i'm out of their reach, and now i have the freedom to ignore it instead of being caged inside with it 24\/7.\n  ","399345":"\n  yes. i've been thriving ever since i started living on my own, especially considering my past history with living at my parents' house. i finally feel free and able to do as i please without judgment, anger, or fear.\n  ","399346":"\n  it's constantly changing -- it's a symptom of BPD, having general crises and disturbances in identity understanding. most people who live with BPD don't have a defined understanding of who they are because their personalities themselves are disordered.\n  ","399347":"\n  i've only been able to move out in the final quarter of 2019 because of a pay increase, thus enabling me to make enough money to pay towards rent.\n  \n  i wasn't able to afford that prior to my pay raise when i was promoted months ago, and i definitely was not able to afford that going back three years ago, lol.\n  ","399348":"\n  at this stage in my life, yeah. we're all in our late 20s leading up to mid-40s, so in general my friends have a significant understanding of their own personalities and traits.\n  ","399349":"\n  yeah, i've been working hard at bettering myself and my life ever since i first pursued mental health treatment a little over three years ago. my life has significantly improved since that time, especially now that i'm living independently and living my life according to my own terms.\n  ","399350":"\n  there isn't really much else i rely upon besides scientific, unbiased evidence. i have no spiritual or religious beliefs, and my understanding of the world and society is based upon the studies i've done personally and read in my own free time.\n  ","399351":"\n  to my knowledge, no. they're simply things that have happened to me, and i stopped questioning \"why\" a very long time ago because it leads you nowhere. the only thing you can do when you've been dealt a bad set of cards is learn how to deal with them appropriately, adapt to changes, and work towards bettering yourself and your life.\n  ","399352":"\n  the correct answer is that humans have negatively contributed to climate change. that's scientific and not up for debate.\n  ","399353":"\n  sometimes, yeah. there are certain instances where people's mistakes catch up to them and they have to pay the penalties, but life is mostly a game of chance and unfairness.\n  ","399354":"\n  it doesn't exist for them, no. it may exist for others if those people believe in them, but if you don't personally believe in something, then it is false. these concepts usually happen when people are discussing spiritual or religious beliefs. everyone has their own idea of what or how life is, and everyone is entitled to their opinion.\n  ","399355":"\n  cheating, lying, manipulation, ab*se, etc etc. in addition, having bigoted viewpoints or oppressive opinions towards other groups of people is a clear turn-off and i would have no qualms with breaking up with someone if they were racist, for example.\n  ","399356":"\n  someone's personality and intelligence is much more attractive to me than how someone physically looks. obviously physical attraction matters to a degree, but if you don't have emotional chemistry with a person, then the relationship won't last.\n  ","399357":"\n  they're not true to me, no. i don't believe they exist.\n  ","399358":"\n  everyone is dealt a different set of cards when it comes to life events, obstacles, personal matters, responsibilities, job prospects, etc etc. some people are happy with their lives, while other people aren't. it's simply a fact that we must come to accept.\n  ","399359":"\n  i seldom ask for advice, and i prefer to navigate myself through various obstacles and difficulties because it gives me a better chance of learning from the experience, even if i make a mistake.\n  ","399360":"\n  you evidently don't understand the fact that i don't believe in the concept of past lives, lol.\n  \n  it's fine that you do -- i have no qualms with people having their own opinions on life and whatnot. but you should understand that i don't believe past lives exist.\n  ","399361":"\n  i don't know who i am, so no. we've gone through this already.\n  ","399362":"\n  that isn't what a past life is, lol. a past life suggests the possibility that you have lived a life prior to the life you're currently living now, prior to your birth. for example, if you were a different individual living in a different era earlier than this current existence. it generally goes hand-in-hand with reincarnation.\n  ","399363":"\n  a very common double standard relates to s*xual activities surrounding the men and women population. when a woman sleeps with more than one or two people, she's considered \"promiscuous\" or a wh*re. however, if a man sleeps with multiple partners, then he's generally praised.\n  ","399364":"\n  i don't believe in past lives ... therefore, there would be no existence of trauma associated with past lives.\n  ","399365":"\n  create and append a certain spreadsheet with various information at my job, which i had to obtain from a variety of other spreadsheets and compile into one \"master\" spreadsheet, haha. it spanned over the course of the past year or two, so there was a lot of information and it took me a bit of time to grasp the concept and make it.\n  ","399366":"\n  \"if you're going through hell, keep going.\"\n  ","399367":"\n  i don't believe in past lives, so i don't believe in the whole notion of having \"past life trauma\" or whatever the term for it is these days.\n  ","399368":"\n  i already explained how my day was a few answers ago.\n  ","399369":"\n  cope with the prospect that after training my coworker next week, i'll have less job security if my job ever decides they want to fire me. :\/\n  \n  i like the idea of knowing the ins and outs of my particular project with no one else having the same knowledge because there's job security there. but once i train my coworker on how to do the project, my bosses can decide they want to get rid of me whenever they want.\n  ","399370":"\n  quite poorly, lmaoo. i have a tendency to suppress my rage until something small sends me over the edge, and then i horribly cope with my anger in self-destructive means.\n  \n  it's something that has always happened to me, and although it's lessened in severity since going to therapy, it still happens on occasion. i'm definitely not as angry and intense as i used to be compared to when i was in my early 20s.\n  ","399371":"\n  when i was in high school, i scored in the 99th percentile for the writing\/english language section of the SATs.\n  ","399372":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","399373":"\n  i don't watch much youtube except for rooster teeth & achievement hunter videos, so i don't know of any \"youtube couples.\"\n  ","399374":"\n  i'm doing fine today -- much better than i have been compared to the rest of the week, haha. it's friday and i have the weekend to rest and prepare for next week's activities, and i'm looking forward to getting some small chores done tomorrow morning while my roommates are asleep and at work.\n  ","399375":"\n  eh, it's a very thin line. i believe that one of the few ways it's appropriate to advise someone on how to lose weight if they approach you with the issue first. to outright tell someone they need to lose weight, *especially* if you don't know them very well, is very rude and uncalled for.\n  ","399376":"\n  i haven't had a milkshake in literally years, mainly because too much milk upsets my stomach and they're way too heavy for me. i don't remember what kind it would have been, but i'm assuming oreo.\n  ","399377":"\n  i value my sleep too much to wait for the sunrise, lmaoo. i personally find sunsets to be more beautiful anyway.\n  ","399378":"\n  we met through a mutual friend when we were 16 years old. our mutual friend was someone i went to middle school with, but then she attended high school with him and they became friends. one evening, we all went out together and him and i became acquainted for the very first time.\n  ","399379":"\n  the alarmingly high levels of bigotry and intolerance that exists in our society.\n  ","399380":"\n  waking up semi-early and brewing a big pot of coffee while everyone else is asleep, browsing the internet\/social media on my laptop while drinking coffee and listening to music for a few hours, going out and getting brunch with a few friends or my boyfriend, and taking a nap in the afternoon. when dusk arrives, i would have a nutritious, fulfilling dinner and then spend the rest of the night at home, drinking a glass of wine while catching up on my favorite shows.\n  ","399381":"\n  happiness isn't something that's automatic for the most part, unless you're one of those rare individuals who are always happy for whatever reason. i believe that people should try to find their own happiness in the little things that bring them joy, whether it's through work, relationships, family, hobbies, religion, etc etc.\n  ","399382":"\n  my biggest passion is expressing myself and relating to others through writing. it's been the greatest strength, and i find fulfillment in writing things that other people can relate to and find comfort in.\n  ","399383":"\n  no, i'm actually very stubborn unless someone who opposes my views gives me concrete, unbiased evidence that contradicts my views and makes me think twice about my opinions.\n  ","399384":"\n  i don't believe i would want to be born in a different era. sure, things are terrible in current times but they're much more tolerable than in previous eras. considering who i am (female, non-binary, mentally ill, bisexual, etc etc), there would be a lot more discrimination that i would face.\n  ","399385":"\n  i would purchase a new house in full, pay off my remaining debt, go on an extended vacation, purchase a new wardrobe, and then probably donate the rest to charities and other organizations that i support.\n  ","399386":"\n  no, i've never been in a confrontation like that before. i never had visitors when i was living at my parents' house anyway, and so far only close friends have visited me\/my roommates at the new house.\n  ","399387":"\n  my bedroom tapestry behind my bed & string lights. \u2661\n  ","399388":"\n  any sort of haunted house, haha. i'm terrified of being scared in general, and haunted houses are a big no-no for me.\n  ","399389":"\n  thankfully, no !! it was a relatively quiet day at work. i treated myself to breakfast this morning, i had a quiet and productive work day, and now i'm relaxing with some coffee in front of my laptop.\n  ","399390":"\n  eh, both -- depending entirely on my mood and the mindset i'm in at that current moment. i either react badly or overreact to situations, or i'm extremely methodical and rational towards whatever situation is before me.\n  ","399391":"\n  i dislike most drivers when i'm driving, especially if they cut others off, switch back and forth between lanes (especially if they're not passing on the left), brake abruptly for no reason, don't use blinkers, don't acknowledge right of way rules, and drive slowly in the left lane.\n  ","399392":"\n  freedom of speech and\/or self-expression.\n  ","399393":"\n

as a victim.\n  ","399395":"\n  sushi, most definitely. i always say yes to sushi.\n  ","399396":"\n  no, i actually enjoy the winter season -- the cold, the snow, etc etc. i feel more like \"myself\" during the fall and winter seasons, and i've never been a big fan of the spring or summer.\n  ","399397":"\n  no, i've never been arrested before.\n  ","399398":"\n  the only reward i take advantage of is amazon prime's reward system -- if i use one of my credit cards on amazon purchases, it racks up points and i can trade them in for money to reduce the cost of amazon purchases.\n  ","399399":"\n  yeah, it's the perfect size. i also (obviously) like the message.\n  ","399400":"\n  make a giant pot of coffee and drink it while perusing the internet\/social media in the morning. maybe watching television or playing video games. doing some easy household chores to feel productive, then taking a nap in the mid-afternoon. end off the night with a glass of wine. :'))\n  ","399401":"\n  it went well !! it was a lot of fun.\n  ","399402":"\n  i prefer to answer questions. my inbox is usually filled and i like lowering the numbers in my inbox, as well as provide good answers to whichever questions pop out at me.\n  ","399403":"\n  writing, reading, drawing, painting, playing video games, watching television, sleeping, and hanging out with friends.\n  ","399404":"\n  i'm honestly not doing so well, but it will eventually come to pass. i've been an anxious wreck the past few days. :\/\n  ","399405":"\n  i like pen and ink drawings, watercolor painting, and charcoal drawings.\n  ","399406":"\n  mystic fire topaz and opal are my favorites.\n  ","399407":"\n  i don't remember if i got sunburn last summer or not, but definitely the summer prior to that. i've never gotten horrible sunburn though, even though i use tanning oil instead of sunscreen, lmaoo.\n  ","399408":"\n  i'm going to my parents' house to clean on saturday, then i'm coming home to do laundry. on sunday, i'm planning on going grocery shopping.\n  ","399409":"\n  i go grocery shopping every week or two weeks, but if you're talking about other types of shopping, then not regularly at all. i only ever really shop when i need to buy something for someone as a birthday or holiday gift. sometimes i'll splurge on myself with some clothing, but it's rare.\n  ","399410":"\n  i don't like pineapples, so i probably wouldn't like it on pizza. i don't care about what other people do, though.\n  ","399411":"\n  port wine cheese spread will always be my favorite.\n  ","399412":"\n  how to adequately train my coworker on how to manage the magazine program while i'm on vacation next month. there are so many different components to it, and i made a 20-page training guide to accompany the actual training, so at least she has something to reference to if she forgets or has a question when i'm gone.\n  ","399413":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","399414":"\n  depends on your tolerance and how sensitive you are to horrifying stimuli right before bed. some people can play horror games with no issue, while for others, it can be detrimental to their sleep\/heath.\n  ","399415":"\n  pepperoni, meatballs, and spinach (not all on the same pie, though).\n  ","399416":"\n  i think cancel culture can be justified in some cases, but also unjustified in other cases. people have the capabilities of realizing their wrongdoings, apologizing, and working to improve themselves. if that person is working to improve themselves based on being called out for something they did wrong, i don't really think that warrants them being \"canceled.\"\n  \n  in other cases, i do believe it's right to stop supporting a person, especially in cases of ab*se or discriminatory\/oppressive behavior that is repeated with no apology whatsoever.\n  ","399417":"\n  \"all i need is coffee & wine.\"\n  ","399418":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","399419":"\n  my first weekend in the house alone. \u2661\n  ","399420":"\n  no, i haven't been paying attention to gaming news. i haven't really paid much attention in quite a number of months\/over a year.\n  ","399421":"\n  one of my coworkers, lmaoo. he gave me sorta a back-handed compliment the other day regarding my writing, and it put me off in a certain way.\n  ","399422":"\n  apparently the human body can go three weeks without food.\n  ","399423":"\n  put them on a healthier diet, get rid of the junk food in the house, and suggest that they take up a sport or some other sort of extracurricular activity that will help them remain active.\n  ","399424":"\n  they're all from within the past few months. some of them have snapchat filters on them, other ones i'm wearing makeup, others i'm not wearing makeup at all, etc etc.\n  ","399425":"\n  right now, i'm particularly stressed out and my mood swings have been coming back somewhat (even though i've been taking my medication regularly). my life could be better, but it also could be a hell of a lot worse. i'm thankful for the opportunities and support system that i have. but i have to admit -- 2020 sucks so far.\n  ","399426":"\n  i don't generally tell lies because it's more productive and less worrisome to be honest, but i suppose the biggest ones were the ones i told my parents about where i was when i was much, much younger.\n  ","399427":"\n  i just googled it, and apparently the answer is yes. lmaoo.\n  ","399428":"\n  i suppose halo, considering those are the games i die the most in, lmaoo. i don't really play challenging games, though. i prefer open world, singer player RPGs and a few first person shooters.\n  ","399429":"\n  i don't know very much about him because i'm only about halfway through the first season. however, it's entirely common for people to have \"two lives,\" meaning they live one life as a certain individual with particular meaning and then another life where they're totally different from who they appear as in public.\n  ","399430":"\n  i only like posts that i genuinely enjoy, whether it's something i agree with, something i respect, or something that i find to be interesting or creative.\n  ","399431":"\n  away from askfm, obviously. lol.\n  \n  i've just been dealing with some personal things, and then i had a few friends over last night.\n

","399435":"\n  you'd have to ask\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n  . i went to her shop, added the items to my cart, and paid, lol. i'm not sure how the internal process is.\n  ","399436":"\n  yeah, i waited until the one of the site's 20% off deals.\n  ","399437":"\n  it's really cozy -- i bought both him and myself the lightweight hoodies, and i got mine a size larger than what i normally would have ordered because i like hoodies a bit bigger on me.\n  \n  it's pretty soft, but you have to wash it before wearing because redbubble seems like one of those companies that has that weird smell to their clothing when they send it to you.\n  ","399438":"\n  that's pretty racist, but mmkay.\n  ","399439":"\n  LOL, honestly things have been so busy and ridiculous that the time flew by and i completely forgot about christmas.\n  \n  i don't remember everything, but i got him a journal that says \"memento mori\" on it (he has a tattoo of that saying), a mug, a tee shirt with a bunch of reptiles on it, and a hoodie from\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n  's store. :'))\n  ","399440":"\n  aw, thank you !!\n  ","399441":"\n  no, i've never surgically altered any parts of my body.\n  ","399442":"\n  no, haha. his came in the mail late and we figured it would be easier to just exchange with all of our friends, like a joyous celebration.\n  ","399443":"\n  yeah, i used overtone. it's a color-depositing conditioner.\n  ","399444":"\n  i'm normally the passenger during long car rides because i have driving anxiety, and i keep myself entertained through listening to music and simply talking to the other person\/people in the car.\n  ","399445":"\n  made my hair a tad bit darker. i'm beginning to hate any sort of blonde on myself these days.\n  ","399446":"\n  music, writing, art, literature, nature, my relationships, and being self-sufficient.\n  ","399447":"\n  i never understood the obsession with the show \"friends.\" i've watched all of it over the years, but i never got the hype.\n  ","399448":"\n  yeah, athletes in general get paid way too much money for what they do.\n  ","399449":"\n  the games i play usually have large, expansive maps so it's very easy to get lost, haha.\n  ","399450":"\n  just sexual nonsense that i always delete. it's despicable how often people inquire about my sex life (or strangers' sex lives in general).\n  ","399451":"\n  as long as the couple isn't being weird about public displays of affection with their friend there, i don't see the big deal with being a \"third wheel.\" i've been the third wheel with a few of my friends and i've had friends be the third wheel around myself and my boyfriend, so as long as you respect boundaries, it isn't really a big deal.\n  ","399452":"\n  my supervisor complimented the training manual i created because i'll be training my coworker on how to take care of the magazine program for when i go on vacation next month. i ended up writing a 20-page guide, lmaoo.\n  ","399453":"\n  my eyes, i suppose.\n  ","399454":"\n  freshly cleaned after a shower, fuzzy socks, sweatpants and a hoodie, a candle lit, and a good television show on (or relaxing music playing in the background).\n  ","399455":"\n  depends on the night. some nights, i've gone to bed as early as 9:30pm while other nights it isn't until 1-2am.\n  ","399456":"\n  my boyfriend and some friends are coming over tomorrow for our (very late) christmas celebration !! we'll be ordering pizza and exchanging gifts.\n  ","399457":"\n  i'm doing well -- exhausted, but well. i'm currently waiting for the color to set into my hair (it needs another 15-20 minutes) so i'm going through my inbox in the meantime.\n  ","399458":"\n  spinach, egg whites, red peppers, and cheese.\n  ","399459":"\n  i'm not quite sure what you mean by orientation in a gaming context.\n  ","399460":"\n  i'm sure some people try to be, but it doesn't go very far.\n  ","399461":"\n  what does dignity have anything to do with being sick?\n  ","399462":"\n  the sun set around 5:00pm.\n  ","399463":"\n  not usually, no. sometimes, i do but most of the time the pain is in my back.\n  ","399464":"\n  if they're demanding respect, then that makes me respect them less. lol.\n  ","399465":"\n  i've been trying by drinking flavored seltzer every night, haha.\n  ","399466":"\n  nope. i don't drink enough water period.\n  ","399467":"\n  if you're talking about new york city, then i would recommend all of the various museums there -- museum of modern art, museum of natural history, etc etc. i also really want to see the museum of sex since it looks hella interesting, and the comedy cellar is a great place to go for comedy shows.\n  ","399468":"\n  i'd cash out my bank account and travel cross country with my boyfriend.\n  ","399469":"\n  i don't think they're harmful in theory, but i understand why people are so apt to use filters (like myself) because it presents them in a way that they perceive to be more beautiful by conventional standards.\n  ","399470":"\n  I wouldn't be able to put a number to it because i'm intelligent in some areas, while extremely lacking in other areas.\n  ","399471":"\n  there's one bar that i go to regularly (well used to, i haven't been there in over a month). i also frequent the same starbucks and bagel shop every so often in the morning.\n  ","399472":"\n  i haven't, but i heard good things about that movie !!\n  ","399473":"\n  LOL, yes. i used to alter the coding\/html for myspace and tumblr layouts when i actively used those websites.\n  ","399474":"\n  my day was good & productive. i got home from work about an hour ago, and i just finished wrapping some christmas gifts for \"friends-mas\" and sorted through more of my belongings -- mainly art supplies that i accidentally left at my parents' house.\n  ","399475":"\n  no, there isn't anything interesting where i live so there would be no reason for tourists to visit.\n  \n  unless you mean new york city, the hamptons, or montauk -- then yeah, there are plenty of tourists there.\n  ","399476":"\n  yeah, i've texted and talked on the phone while driving before.\n  ","399477":"\n  i did already this morning.\n  ","399478":"\n  i'm not comfortable discussing finances like that on askfm.\n  ","399479":"\n  it was 19 degrees fahrenheit this morning, lol.\n  ","399480":"\n  hey everyone, go buy some merch from\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n  !! the lightweight hoodies are super comfy & her art is fantastic.\n  ","399481":"\n  there was no way they would sell the car again, haha. if anything, they would have broken it down for parts.\n  ","399482":"\n  i'd rather not discuss it.\n  ","399483":"\n  \"don't stop believing\" by journey or \"living on a prayer\" by bon jovi.\n  ","399484":"\n  yes, which is why i'm so cautious about what i post online and why most of my accounts are private.\n  ","399485":"\n  i'm not the biggest fan of his, but the actor owen wilson shares a birthday with me.\n  ","399486":"\n  yes, tomorrow is a regular work day.\n  ","399487":"\n  no, i have no interest in the oscars.\n  ","399488":"\n  no, i didn't dress up for halloween last year.\n  ","399489":"\n  i've never been interested in world of warcraft.\n  ","399490":"\n  i read up on wikipedia about various criminal cases, but that's pretty much it these days. i used to use wikipedia a lot more often when i worked in the law office to gain a better understanding of some medical disabilities.\n  ","399491":"\n  whenever someone has asked why or how i'm non-binary, i simply explain to them that i don't identify as either of the binaries of gender (which are man and woman). my gender is largely undefined and fluid, but i've never identified solely as a man or solely as a woman.\n  ","399492":"\n  i would much rather have one best friend as opposed to several good friends who may not know me as well or relate to me as well as that single best friend. quality over quantity, that's what is important.\n  ","399493":"\n  i wouldn't know, i'm not around children ever and i have no idea what's trending in terms of children's toys.\n  ","399494":"\n  male and female are sexes. they aren't genders.\n  \n  man and woman, however, are genders. most people who are trans don't feel right with their assigned gender from an early age, and over time, they come to realize that they're simply in the wrong type of body.\n  ","399495":"\n  everyone defines their gender in their own way, and gender exists in a spectrum in my eyes. you can 100% identify as a man or a woman, or you can be genderfluid or non-binary or anywhere in between.\n  ","399496":"\n  the best phase of my life is quite possibly my present reality. i have a strong support system, my depression and anxiety are mostly managed, i have a stable job and a house of my own, and i'm away from the toxic environment that plagued me as a child. i finally feel free.\n  ","399497":"\n  my teenage years were the worst phases of my life. i was extremely depressed, anxious, s*icidal, and paranoid. i didn't see the purpose of living and had no support system. my only solace was in writing and in my schoolwork in the hopes that i could escape from where i was and start life over.\n  ","399498":"\n  i'd like to be remembered for my writing, as well as for my advocacy for mental health awareness and rights for those who are disabled (both physically and mentally).\n  ","399499":"\n  i'm most thankful for the love and support i've been given throughout recent years of my life when i've been struggling. without the encouragement of my close friends and boyfriend, i wouldn't have had the strength to continue seeking mental health treatment and i probably would have entered into a much, much darker place and possibly died.\n  ","399500":"\n  financial stability, emotional stability, and for my loved ones not to experience hardship anymore.\n  ","399501":"\n  staying inside, sharing a good meal together, getting tipsy and\/or high, and spending the night watching a silly movie or videos on youtube and talking about anything that comes to mind.\n  ","399502":"\n  honestly, my home or my boyfriend's home. they're both sources of comfort for me, and i feel most \"at home\" and relaxed there.\n  ","399503":"\n  drinking alcohol on work nights with the knowledge that i'm going to inevitably wake up feeling absolutely terrible.\n  ","399504":"\n  i haven't gotten a manicure done in at least two years.\n  ","399505":"\n  i believe the truth is more important. it's no use lying to someone to save their feelings because they're ultimately going to find out the truth eventually, and then it will land on you for being not truthful towards them from the very beginning.\n  \n  i would much rather be told the truth and be hurt by it than to live in a lie because someone was afraid to hurt my feelings.\n  ","399506":"\n  last year (well, i guess two years ago considering it's 2020 now), my boyfriend surprised me with tickets to a wine and beer tasting event after hours at a local aquarium. we drove out there earlier in the day and stopped at a restaurant and a new brewery that had opened, and then we went to the event afterwards.\n  \n  it was a lot of fun, and a complete surprise because he never spoke a word of it -- which is unusual because he can never keep things like that a secret, LOL. we spent the night in a hotel in the same area and got high and watched ancient aliens for the rest of the night. :'))\n  ","399507":"\n  if they're important to my friend, then it's important to me that i come off as a good friend. so in a way, yes. not so much pleasing them personally as much as it is looking out for my own friend (and also me gauging the other person to make sure they're a good person too).\n  ","399508":"\n  perhaps that i'm a better, funnier, wittier, more attractive person than i actually am.\n  ","399509":"\n  i've seen, lol. that's why i said it wasn't funny that they've been sending it to multiple people. they're obviously looking for some sort of attention or validation.\n  ","399510":"\n  no, i've learned to accept my mistakes and misguided thoughts. to be stubborn in the face of your own faults isn't healthy, and there's no excuse in defending yourself and digging yourself a deeper hole when others point out that you're wrong. it's easier to accept your wrongdoings, learn from them, and move on.\n  ","399511":"\n  i get very scared and anxious. i don't like meeting new people, i feel like there's some sort of expectation there that i won't be able to live up to.\n  ","399512":"\n  i'd like to live as passionately as possible, with no regrets or qualms about my actions and also accepting my mistakes. i'd like to live more in the moment while simultaneously acknowledging the past and future, whatever that may be.\n  \n  as for death, i think about it often and i believe it's more suitable for me to die in a blaze of glory as opposed to passing silently.\n  ","399513":"\n  not really, no. i'm just pointing out your own behavior and telling you it's wrong (in case you didn't know already).\n  ","399514":"\n  this actually made me laugh out loud today.\n  ","399515":"\n  towards my own sentiment, yeah. it's stupid for you to be sending out the same comment to several people in an attempt to be \"funny\" but just coming off as rude. it's very immature.\n  ","399516":"\n  ???\n  \n  you've sent this to multiple people & obviously it isn't funny, lol.\n  ","399517":"\n  anxiety-ridden thoughts filled with nonsensical scenarios and irrationality.\n  ","399518":"\n  my roommate and i were discussing what to get our friends for our very late christmas party, lmaoo.\n  ","399519":"\n  i've only ever gone to one gym in my area, and it was semi-crowded but nothing overwhelming. there are gyms everywhere around here, though, so i never thought over-crowding would be an issue.\n  \n  it ultimately depends on where you live and the access people have to specific gyms. in areas where there aren't many gyms, then yeah they'll be more crowded.\n  ","399520":"\n  yes, i get both good and bad vibes from various people upon meeting them for a first few times.\n  ","399521":"\n  i've replied to certain people on social media, like the members from rooster teeth or achievement hunter. i never expect a reply, but it happens on occasion.\n  ","399522":"\n  there are gas stations all over the place, lol. i just go to the closest gas station to wherever i am.\n  ","399523":"\n  thank you ~~\n  ","399524":"\n  i like multigrain.\n  ","399525":"\n  a loaf of bread, depending on what kind you buy, is around $2-4 or so. i buy bread every week because i make sandwiches for lunch at work.\n  ","399526":"\n  my week was stressful, but overall fine. i was a nervous wreck due to my car but now that everything is fixed, i feel much better.\n  \n  i'm going to the mall with my roommate today to pick up some last minute gifts for a very late \"friends-mas\" that we're hosting later this week.\n  ","399527":"\n  \"thank you\" by led zeppelin is perhaps my favorite.\n  ","399528":"\n  why did you censor the word fat? lmaoo.\n  \n  i'm fat due to a combination of my medication as well as living a sedentary lifestyle.\n  ","399529":"\n  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  ","399530":"\n  not very well, haha. i have a tendency to drink alcohol when i'm stressed, which works in the moment but then i feel terrible the next day.\n  ","399531":"\n  i only use uber if i'm going out drinking, which is rare these days. i use my car to drive to work every day, to go to the grocery store, to go to the pharmacy, etc etc. it's integral to drive where i live.\n  ","399532":"\n  i've never lived on my own before, so idk. the setup i have now works out well (living with my good friend and his brother).\n  ","399533":"\n  i don't give out coins, especially upon request from total strangers.\n  ","399534":"\n  the car i had prior to my current car was just worn down, it had a lot of miles on it, and it wasn't worth it to fix it based on the value on the car. i traded it in to buy my current car.\n  ","399535":"\n  fixing my car would be the utmost priority. it's my livelihood, i can't do much without my car.\n  ","399536":"\n  i got two new tires.\n  ","399537":"\n  of course. if i wasn't then i would change them, haha. it took me about a year to find the right cocktail of meds.\n  ","399538":"\n  yeah, i got it fixed yesterday. it set me back a few hundred dollars.\n  ","399539":"\n  not anymore, no. i've been taking them for almost three years.\n  ","399540":"\n  well, i only woke up 45 minutes ago -- so it's been fine thus far. the only things i've done are make breakfast, have a cup of coffee, and take my medication.\n  ","399541":"\n  i've never lived in a big city before (but then again, the closest big city to me is new york city, lol). i've always lived in smaller towns, but they're also never been rural towns. they're simply suburban areas.\n  \n  i would hate to live in a big city, due to the congestion and population and noise and busy-ness of everyday life. i prefer a quieter, simpler existence.\n  ","399542":"\n  apparently compression shorts are made for workout sessions, so it's appropriate and normal for people to wear them to the gym. it doesn't matter to me what other people wear while they work out, though.\n  ","399543":"\n  i don't really understand what you mean by this? could you elaborate?\n  ","399544":"\n  beer or wine. lately, i've been drinking cabernet sauvignon (wine) or various forms of IPAs (beer).\n  ","399545":"\n  i'm not a fan of sports, so neither.\n  ","399546":"\n  whether or not they're wanted or loved in the household, haha. it's easy to tell when people have pet rats because they have their own living space within the house.\n  ","399547":"\n  no, definitely not. i have social anxiety and prefer to be unknown to most people, and fame would not suit me. i would absolutely hate to be recognized on the streets by random passerbys and be interrupted all the time.\n  ","399548":"\n  according to google, this is a county in england. i've never left the united states before.\n  ","399549":"\n  i don't really go shopping anywhere, except to the grocery store and the pharmacy, lmaoo. when i buy clothing and whatnot, i normally buy them online. the last places i bought clothing from were torrid and blackcraft cult.\n  ","399550":"\n  if i'm looking for a good time, i usually text a friend or two and they'll either come over my house or we'll go out to the bar and drink together.\n  ","399551":"\n  milk, flavored seltzer, coffee creamer, cold cuts, cheese, eggs, butter, chicken, leftover alfredo noodles from dinner the other night, a variety of salad dressings and condiments, beer, and iced tea.\n  ","399552":"\n  thank you ~~\n  ","399553":"\n  no, i was indifferent to most of my teachers and professors.\n  ","399554":"\n  -- use ketchup on fries (i used to hate ketchup with a burning passion).\n  \n  -- quit smoking.\n  \n  -- exist in a long term relationship.\n  ","399555":"\n  not really, i don't know how to cook many things besides the basics.\n  ","399556":"\n  of course not. name-calling and insults are not to be tolerated in an argument.\n  ","399557":"\n  unfortunately, it *has* become normalized in society -- which is bad because it only increases the stigma around mental illness, making people out to be \"crazy\" if they display any sort of different personality traits than what's considered normal. mentally ill people have been chastised for being \"crazy\" for so long, and in the long term, it's damaging.\n  \n  just for some context, fyi. i'm not personally bothered if someone uses the word crazy or calls me crazy, but i do understand the implications of such a word and some people do consider it an ableist slur.\n  ","399558":"\n  askfm is for asking questions, not necessarily for conversations.\n  ","399559":"\n  common sense would be to see a picture on the internet, shrug it off, and move on with your day. evidently, you cannot do that because you're so bothered by unconventional standards of beauty and will resort to personal attacks simply because you disagree with something.\n  \n  cc:\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n","399560":"\n  no, you're totally justified in being upset if your boyfriend is calling you crazy. that isn't a word to be taken lightly, and it's completely wrong of him to accuse you of that regardless of the rationality of your behavior. he's acting extremely toxic and unhealthy.\n  ","399561":"\n  no, i seldom experience mania. i just have the house to myself tonight, so i enjoy the silence and lack of company.\n  ","399562":"\n  show them love and compassionate whenever possible, especially if you know they're going through a difficult time but are too afraid to speak up about it. be there for them if they do reach out, don't disregard or invalidate their concerns, and make time for them whenever possible.\n  ","399563":"\n  depends on how i'm feeling that day. tonight, i'm content with staying in, watching television or playing video games, lighting a candle, and drinking some wine.\n  ","399564":"\n  i'm not vegan, but i try to have plant-based alternatives whenever possible. i ate a veggie burger for dinner tonight.\n  ","399565":"\n  just try to remain cognizant of how you're behaving towards them, and fix yourself accordingly.\n  ","399566":"\n  no. i don't vote on polls (or follow people) upon request. i understand your need for recognition and validation, but you won't find it here.\n  ","399567":"\n  if they haven't given you a reason to not trust their authority or judgment, but you're being cautious and questioning them anyway, then i do find that to be a bit disrespectful. i understand having bad experiences from past jobs, but you simply have to learn how to compartmentalize and start fresh with each new job. every job has different staff and a different atmosphere.\n  ","399568":"\n  ... dipping pizza in hummus ... ? what the hell.\n  \n  i was talking to my coworker about the \"purple\" mattress (it's a brand, supposed to give quality sleep) and then i started seeing ads for it all over facebook and instagram.\n  ","399569":"\n  if it was in self defense, then i wouldn't really consider that to be bad. you were sticking up for yourself, i'm assuming.\n  ","399570":"\n  i want to have a cheeseburger for dinner, but we have no buns. we have hot dog buns, so i'm debating on just cutting the burgers in half and putting them on the hot dog buns, lmaoo.\n  ","399571":"\n  i don't have children. i would want them to be compassionate towards others, though, and treat others how they would like to be treated in return. you simply don't know what someone could be going through, so it's best to treat everyone with caution and kindness unless shown otherwise.\n  ","399572":"\n  LOL. i figured that's what they meant, but i wanted to make a joke out of it.\n  \n  in all seriousness -- who the f*ck cares. i don't shave my armpits, i have friends who don't shave their armpits, and it's literally no one's business what someone else does with their own body hair. it's just hair.\n

because my shoe caught the edge of something. i was almost embarrassed, but the woman walking behind me said something along the lines of, \"don't worry about that, that happens to me all the time! these damn streets.\" it made me feel instantly better, haha.\n  ","399575":"\n  eh, i agree with it in some cases, but disagree in other cases. in a work-related context, i believe that you shouldn't fake anything or pretend to know something that you don't know because that gives greater chance of mistakes happening.\n  ","399576":"\n  i just woke up from a 3-hour nap, and i couldn't believe that i slept for that long.\n  ","399577":"\n  definitely keanu reeves -- and that's not a bad thing at all.\n  ","399578":"\n  i can't imagine any scenario where someone would not have armpits unless

on different skies. i will send my rocket ship to find you.\"\n  \n  \"die for you\" by starset.\n  ","399580":"\n  life simply isn't fair -- it's as easy as that. i don't believe in karma, and i don't believe that bad people eventually get what's coming to them. i also don't believe that if a person is a good person, then they're bound to stumble upon great news or events.\n  ","399581":"\n  these days, not very often. i used to judge others harshly when i was much younger, more stubborn, and more naive. but as an adult now, i'm much more contemplative of people's backgrounds and motives and compassionate towards what a person has gone through in order for them to behave in the way they're behaving.\n  ","399582":"\n  you can simultaneously love a person freely and also have personal boundaries -- they're not mutually exclusive. it's healthy to have some personal boundaries, and what matters most is whether or not your friend and\/or partner respects them.\n  ","399583":"\n  essentially everything -- i dwell on the past, present, and future, i rehearse events in my mind and contemplate things i could have done differently, and sometimes my thoughts turn dark and lead down a destructive path.\n  ","399584":"\n  i don't usually hide things from people, and i'm very transparent in my thoughts and feelings.\n  ","399585":"\n  unconditional love and support.\n  ","399586":"\n  i don't know if i've ever taught anyone lessons about anything. if i have, i'm certainly unaware of them.\n  ","399587":"\n  sometimes, life is meaningless to me. other times, life is full of meaning and passion and adventure. it all depends on how i'm feeling that day.\n  ","399588":"\n  most of my friends have different personalities from me, and they're usually extremely bold, outspoken, unique individuals who have no qualms or social anxieties when it comes to speaking their mind.\n  \n  i speak my mind when it's appropriate, but certainly not to the extent that they do.\n  ","399589":"\n  in 10 years, my life will be completely different from how it is today. i'll be 38 years old, and approaching life from a different perspective compared to me in my late 20s. i'll be older, wiser, and probably more responsible.\n  ","399590":"\n  i don't believe i've ever cried over a character before, but i've certainly been shocked and upset.\n  ","399591":"\n  personally, being ignored is a worse feeling for me because it shows me that those people truly do not care. if i go to someone and they flat out ignore me or my feelings, then it taints the friendship and i won't be able to trust them.\n  ","399592":"\n  no, i don't agree with that at all. jealousy is a toxic emotion and if you're jealous of your partner, you have to look within yourself and realize *why* you're feeling that emotion in the first place. it usually comes from a place of insecurity.\n  ","399593":"\n  i wouldn't be able to put a percentage on it because it likely changes all the time. people also have the capability of change and can go from being an untrustworthy person to being a better person based on self-improvement.\n  ","399594":"\n  in a healthy relationship, some pros would be having someone to talk to about your issues and struggles with no judgment, being comfortable enough to be silly with your partner, having fun with your partner, considering your partner your best friend as well as your lover, and being motivated by your partner to be the best version of yourself you can possibly be.\n  \n  there really shouldn't be any cons to being in a relationship. sure, arguments do happen occasionally but you both should be working towards the same goals. if your partner is making you feel bad, if they're controlling you, or downright being ab*sive and manipulative, then that isn't healthy.\n  ","399595":"\n  self-motivation is essential for people who want to be somewhere else, whether in a physical or metaphorical sense. you need to truly want it for yourself and be motivated enough to pursue whatever it is you want, which also includes creating the resources you need.\n  \n  it does happen to people, quite often actually. if you have a goal that you're seeking and have the strength and capability to pursue and accomplish it, then nothing can stand in your way.\n  ","399596":"\n  in order to properly answer this question, i would require an understanding of what life was like when i was growing up. i don't remember my own childhood, so it's difficult to really say how growing up in the 1990s would compare to children who are growing up now.\n  ","399597":"\n  arrogance. nothing turns me off more from a person than if they're displaying signs of being arrogant, or believing that they're superior to others in some form or another.\n  ","399598":"\n  we are not composed of \"things\" -- on the contrary, our personas are entirely unique in that these things become relevant to us based upon our own interpretation of the world and society. our \"things,\" such as our belongings or our interests or our passions, are only a small fragment of who we are as a whole, and we should treat them as such in order to preserve our own integrity and realize our true positions in the world.\n  ","399599":"\n  -- progress further with mental health treatment.\n  \n  -- take more time out for self care.\n  \n  -- travel more often.\n

even from a young age, and it's been my most productive and healthy means of self-expression. i also enjoy it greatly -- putting into words my own experiences and feelings, mostly using metaphors.\n  ","399601":"\n  i've never had an issue with throwing away old belongings. items aren't very sentimental to me, and when i moved out of my parents' house, i got rid of basically 75% of my own belongings because i didn't really use or need them.\n  ","399602":"\n  no, i don't care for them very much. i haven't watched an award show in general in many years.\n  ","399603":"\n  open-minded, patient, compassionate, selfless, helpful, pragmatic, and responsible.\n  ","399604":"\n  i suppose it depends on the sibling dynamic and how much older the older sibling is compared to the younger sibling. i agree with you, though. parents should be the ones enforcing discipline.\n  ","399605":"\n  i'm not entirely sure, tbh. certainly not in new york, that's for certain !!\n  ","399606":"\n

inspiration.\n  ","399607":"\n  the internet is a conglomeration of happy, devastating, intriguing, and downright frustrating people and events, but combined together, has revolutionized how we see technology as a whole.\n  ","399608":"\n  creative writing, probably. that's my strong suit.\n  ","399609":"\n  raspberries, blueberries, peaches, apples, and bananas. we also buy spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and corn.\n  ","399610":"\n  well, i just spent a pretty penny on getting my tires replaced, an oil change, and my brake pads and rotors replaced. :\/ it was necessary, but super expensive.\n  \n  then it started snowing super hard, and i passed by two accidents on the way home. people are ridiculous when it comes to driving in the snow, even though it happens all the time.\n

","399614":"\n  my boyfriend and close friends are the biggest influences on me.\n  ","399615":"\n  personally, i have a tendency to obsess over the things i like -- but it's normal for people to be fans of things without becoming obsessed.\n  ","399616":"\n  i have a book or two of poetry from lang leav, so yeah.\n  ","399617":"\n  i've been on boats before, just not a cruise line.\n  ","399618":"\n  i haven't been to the mall in years, haha. i don't remember if i bought anything or not.\n  ","399619":"\n  i would certainly hope that it would help solve heinous crimes, but there's always the chance that it would be used to frame the innocent.\n  ","399620":"\n  most of my tattoos are hidden, so obviously yeah.\n  ","399621":"\n  dogs are more apt to eat their owners if they pass away in the house rather than cats, and hamsters have been known to use the deceased's body as a home.\n  ","399622":"\n  yes, definitely. i have plans for two more at the moment, and i eventually want to cover most of my body.\n  ","399623":"\n  i don't really pay attention to trends, so i'm not sure what's trending these days. i have my own sense of style, but even that changes, lol.\n  ","399624":"\n  it depends on my mood. sometimes, i prefer the silence while other times i like having music play in the background.\n  ","399625":"\n  is garlic an herb? haha. i like ranch

we sometimes get in my region, haha. i like the cold weather.\n  ","399639":"\n  i would rather drive a more practical vehicle that works well and isn't just for show. functionality is much more reliable than aesthetic appearance.\n  ","399640":"\n  honestly, i can't even remember the last time i went to the movie theater. i really want to see \"underwater\" with kristin stewart, though. it looks intense.\n  ","399641":"\n  does my portion of money towards the cruise count? haha. it was around $1000.\n  \n  i don't regret buying it whatsoever. i know it's going to be a really fun time.\n

dream job is to be a freelance\/stay-at-home writer who publishes books and poetry for a living.\n  ","399644":"\n  indifferent. it's just something that occurs when sunlight hits droplets of water,

deal to me.\n  ","399740":"\n  they're a few years old, so i'm not sure if that's \"new\" or \"old\" at this point. i buy new jeans every now and again based on weight fluctuations, but that's all.\n  \n  i also bought two hoodies off of redbubble a few weeks ago & received them today !! :'))\n  ","399741":"\n  sometimes i think people are joking when they're being serious, lmaoo.\n  ","399742":"\n  i like listening to the soundtracks from the halo video games.\n  ","399743":"\n  no, i feel quite the opposite at times. sometimes all i want to do is sleep because it makes me forget about my problems for a little while, and then i develop a fresh perspective in the morning.\n  ","399744":"\n  i had pretzels and guacamole as a snack at work today.\n  ","399745":"\n  my coworker told me that a certain gas station\/convenience store has free air for my tires, so i stopped there after work to fill up my tire to hold me over until friday night.\n  \n  i tried going last night, but the machine at the other gas station i went to cost money (spare change), and i had nothing on me so i couldn't fill my tire up. :\/\n  ","399746":"\n  i've never been afraid to ask someone something based on their gender.\n  ","399747":"\n  yeah, it only lasted for about two hours until i drank some ginger tea.\n  ","399748":"\n  eventually, sure. it isn't a priority at the moment, though.\n

 when i was in high school, my favorite subjects were english literature and forensics.\n  ","399752":"\n  earlier this morning. i drank my coffee too fast, lol.\n  ","399753":"\n  that was the first and only time amazon has screwed up my order, thankfully. i've heard it happening to other people, though.\n  ","399754":"\n  it's unfortunate that i give off that impression, but i suppose it's based on my syntax and verbiage. i mostly get serious questions, so i answer in a serious manner.\n  ","399755":"\n  i mean on askfm. i've discussed it in depth with my boyfriend, close friends, and therapist.\n  ","399756":"\n  she's my roommate's cat.\n  ","399757":"\n  i like them soft, not harder. the rice i usually buy are flavored, like cheddar & broccoli, jambalaya, seasoned garden veggies, etc etc.\n  ","399758":"\n  if it's from someone i care about, perhaps my intelligence. i don't usually agree with people when i get complimented on my appearance or personality.\n

remember the last time something on askfm upset me, lol.\n  ","399761":"\n  i'd rather not. we discussed a lot of various things, and it was more of a compilation of my progress since i first started seeing her until the present day.\n  ","399762":"\n  compliments don't bother or sway me one way or another, they only really mean something when it's coming from someone i care about.\n  ","399763":"\n  i use microwavable rice. lmaoo.\n  ","399764":"\n  the cat isn't one of the most precious things to me. i value the importance of my bed, laptop, and television.\n  ","399765":"\n  there aren't many people that i dislike, so i'm not sure.\n  ","399766":"\n  no, that wouldn't be appropriate to discuss.\n  ","399767":"\n  nah, i disagree with that. i don't get upset very easily actually, unless something significant happens in my life.\n  ","399768":"\n  no, they just send me a new one for free. it was a phone charger.\n  ","399769":"\n  it was amazon, haha.\n

yes, i wholeheartedly believe in love and the value of marriage. i believe marriage is mostly a celebration of two people's love for each other, and weddings bring me a lot of joy.\n  \n  i wouldn't be able to put a percentage on how many marriages are truly happy or not, considering i only know a handful of married couples.\n  ","399776":"\n  i spend, but i also save more than i spend (or at least i try to). i only buy what's necessary, and i'll sometimes splurge on things like coffee most of the time.\n  ","399777":"\n  yes, this happens to me all of the time. i'm constantly afraid that my car is going to blow on me, or my tires are going to pop, or i'm going to get into an accident when i least expect it. i'm afraid when i leave the house that i didn't lock the doors, or if i left the coffee machine or stove on, and it even gives me anxiety sometimes when i don't make my bed before leaving the house in the morning.\n  ","399778":"\n  watch a mindless television show, drink a glass or two of wine, and listen to music (not all necessarily at the same time, haha).\n  ","399779":"\n  it's been warmer lately than usual these days (although sunday was such a tease, LOL). it's supposed to get really cold and snowy\/rainy over the next few days, though.\n  ","399780":"\n  i believe my best trait is my compassion for others.\n  ","399781":"\n  my current surroundings.\n

no, i would feel uncomfortable with speaking to people like that every day. i have social anxiety and it prevents me from going out to see my friends sometimes, let alone go to a job where i talk to strangers every day.\n  ","399788":"\n  because it was my final appointment with my therapist. :\/ she got a new job offer, so she's quitting the practice where i see her.\n  ","399789":"\n  watch something else that makes you laugh.\n  ","399790":"\n  i was internally screaming because i assumed it was much later than it actually was, up until i checked my phone and realized i only fell back asleep for 15 more minutes, lmaoo.\n  ","399791":"\n  my day has been all right. i woke up with my tire pressure light on again, so i'm going to have to find some change and fill it up with air until i get my tires changed on saturday.\n  \n  work was extremely busy, but it kept my mind off of things, which was good. when i got home, i had dinner and hung out with my roommate and his girlfriend. now i'm watching television.\n  ","399792":"\n  diligence, patience, tolerance, open-mindedness, and a willingness to admit when you're wrong.\n  ","399793":"\n  leftover general tso's chicken from the chinese food place. it tastes so much better leftover and re-heated than it does fresh, lmaoo.\n  ","399794":"\n  i've never had a delivery stolen before, no. i've received empty, sealed packages though, lmaoo.\n  ","399795":"\n  thanks, i appreciate it ~~\n  ","399796":"\n  my best friend's wedding day. it was so much fun, it was a celebration of their love, and i was surrounded by a bunch of people who make me feel comfortable.\n  ","399797":"\n  arrogance makes me dislike people immediately. if someone talks in a way that's condescending or makes me believe that they think they're better than someone else, then i'm automatically turned off from them.\n  ","399798":"\n  i believe that having a fear of death is very rational, especially considering no one truly knows what happens after death. a lot of people have learned to accept death, but certainly not everyone.\n  ","399799":"\n  i have the tendency to be funny, but i find that often i use humor to mask whatever pain i'm in.\n  ","399800":"\n  yeah, definitely. i've loved music for a very long time.\n  ","399801":"\n  i know absolutely nothing about fashion trends, lmaoo.\n  ","399802":"\n  yeah, one of my ex-friends told me once about how she was only dating someone because he bought her really nice gifts. i thought it was so disrespectful and insincere of her. she wanted to break up with him, but decided to do so after her birthday so that she could receive the gifts he got her.\n  ","399803":"\n  my day has been all right. work was a little busy, but it kept my mind preoccupied, so it wasn't terrible. i also had my final appointment with my therapist. :\/ it was bittersweet.\n  ","399804":"\n  ???\n  \n  not everything has a deep meaning. i put extra letters on acronyms because it emphasizes the point more, and i like it better than just writing \"lmao.\"\n  ","399805":"\n  it doesn't stand for anything. i just like putting an extra o there, haha.\n  ","399806":"\n  it definitely has not been 100 questions,

still considered an alcoholic because of the addictive nature of your personality and the fact that you're in remission. you're just considered a recovered alcoholic.\n  ","399810":"\n  i don't remember what sort of headspace i was in a few days ago. i'm stressed at the moment, but i'm not in a terrible mood because i had a fun video game session with my boyfriend & roommate earlier.\n

","399813":"\n  i'm self destructive when i'm angry. i turn my anger towards myself and wind up getting high or drunk in order to deal with my anger.\n  ","399814":"\n  no. the only other way i can find that same type of euphoria is by doing drugs, and i'd rather not go down that route again.\n  ","399815":"\n  lol, no. death makes everything else seem mundane at times, while other times it gives life purpose.\n  ","399816":"\n  eight hours from now.\n  ","399817":"\n  no, i don't like the taste of chamomile tea.\n  ","399818":"\n  nah, it seems to happen pretty randomly. if there are triggers behind them, i'm not aware of what they are.\n  \n  i just have some periods of time where i'm totally euphoric, feel like i'm on top of the world and can accomplish anything, cannot sleep, and am just very active (and usually angry).\n  ","399819":"\n  depends on the sort of mood i'm in. sometimes death seems more peaceful than life itself, while other times it's more of a feeling of

invalidating to those in disadvantaged groups who do experience oppression.\n  ","399838":"\n  uh, what does mental health have to do with my writing abilities? lmaoo. you don't need to be mentally healthy in order to articulate yourself well. that's ableist.\n  ","399839":"\n  this past weekend (particularly on saturday). i spent the day indoors, slept in super late, played video games, and went out with a few friends at night.\n  ","399840":"\n  there are a lot of variables that would factor into this, so i don't have a concrete answer. my entire persona would be different, so who knows what sort of person i would be if i was male.\n  ","399841":"\n  based solely on their sex, no. people who are male experience male privilege.\n  ","399842":"\n  no, the work-related things i do at home (my freelance work) are paid work assignments.\n  ","399843":"\n  no, although i know that i should.\n  ","399844":"\n  well, i have unhealthy attachments for the most part. i become overly attached to certain people in my life, and they're obviously the most important things in my life to me.\n  ","399845":"\n  i don't know many people to that extent, but the people with whom i'm close to where i would know that information do have attachments.\n  ","399846":"\n  i don't do any work that isn't paid. if i'm contributing to my job in some way, then i'm getting paid for it.\n  ","399847":"\n  no. it only takes me 10-15 minutes to get ready for work in the morning. the only things i do are use the bathroom, brush my teeth and hair, get dressed, pack my lunch bag, and leave the house.\n  ","399848":"\n  i've never had connections before with anything else in my life, so it wouldn't be much different. as long as i have substantial cash on me to at least get me by prior to finding a job, i would be okay.\n  ","399849":"\n  yes, it's quite common unfortunately. some people who follow askfm's guidelines often get banned, while there are other accounts that consistently go against guidelines that never get banned.\n  ","399850":"\n  we usually see each other 1-2 times per week.\n  ","399851":"\n  sorta in the middle? i'm not necessarily living paycheck-to-paycheck these

","399852":"\n  i just know it's derived from the stevia plant.\n  ","399853":"\n  i'm not entirely sure, tbh. i've always been motivated to a certain extent, whether it's to improve a relationship with someone to whom i'm attached, to better myself, or to prove myself at my job and\/or school.\n  ","399854":"\n  well yeah, i've never spoken about the title of my company, what colleges i attended, or where i live.\n  ","399855":"\n  i didn't have any old blankets to get rid of, so i didn't do anything in this scenario. but if i'm buying new clothing, sometimes i'll get rid of old clothing just to make my closet less cluttered.\n  ","399856":"\n  i think a large regular coffee from starbucks is $3.\n  ","399857":"\n  sometimes, yes. i mostly use stevia (artificial sugar) but sometimes i'll order a coffee from starbucks with some real sugar in it.\n  ","399858":"\n  it's my job's magazine. i'm not comfortable releasing the name of the magazine, it's just one of the products my job offers alongside various other editorial content.\n  ","399859":"\n  i have generalized anxiety disorder, so pretty much everything makes me anxious to some extent.\n  ","399860":"\n  lately i've been using peppermint mocha creamer. :'))\n  ","399861":"\n  mental illness, lmaoo.\n  ","399862":"\n  i'm a bit anxious at the moment, but otherwise fine. i'm worried about my car, i'm worried about finances, and i'm worried about what my supervisor will think of my \"letter from the editor\" that i wrote today for the newest edition of my job's magazine that's currently in production.\n  ","399863":"\n  yes, i've experience apathy to various degrees -- especially at the height of my depression. nothing brought me joy, and everything was meaningless.\n  ","399864":"\n  no, i'm not afraid of death. i'm obsessively intrigued by death and it's often the subject of my creative writing.\n  ","399865":"\n  how to tell if a tire needs to be changed based on the degree of tread left on the tire. it won't pass inspection if it's too eroded, and if you use a penny and place it in the tread, if it doesn't reach a certain height, then you need a new tire.\n  ","399866":"\n  i only like receiving attention from certain people, and elevated degrees of attention from others (i.e. strangers) makes me uncomfortable.\n  ","399867":"\n  i've only been open about my life for the past few years, and prior to that, i was extremely closed off and private. my paranoia was at its all-time high during those times and i was afraid that people would know *too* much about me to the point where it would hurt me.\n  \n  seeking help for mental illness and understanding that there is such a stigma against the mentally ill changed that, and it made me become passionate about speaking about my experiences in order to help others.\n  ","399868":"\n  i think it's worse when people abruptly disappear. there's no sense of understanding or closure when that happens, and it makes you wonder if you did anything significantly wrong in order to warrant someone cutting you off to that degree.\n  ","399869":"\n  i've been coloring my hair consistently since i was 11 years old. i've been bright red, dark red, orange, blonde, bright blue, bright purple, dark purple, black, and various shades of brown.\n  \n  my favorite color changes depending on my mood, which is why my hair is constantly changing. right now, it's brown and i'm going to be making it slightly darker with some overtone later this week.\n  ","399870":"\n  i don't follow people upon request, sorry. i seldom follow new people.\n  \n  i'm all right, though. i got home from work a little less than an hour ago, and i'm already changed into pajamas, lmaoo. my roommate and i decided that we're going to cook breakfast for dinner. :'))\n  ","399871":"\n  no, i don't experience road rage. driving is a major source of anxiety for me, so i'm a very cautious driver and if someone else does something stupid, then i'll be a bit annoyed but that's all. my main concern is safety.\n  ","399872":"\n  i check my personal email maybe once per week. as for my work email, my outlook application is active the entire day because i send and receive emails all day long. i monitor three different inboxes.\n  ","399873":"\n  we have a doorbell, yeah. i'm always confused whenever it rings because no one ever comes to the house unexpected, but it's happened a few times with delivery people (whether food delivery or UPS, or something).\n  \n  it doesn't bother me if my phone rings because 99% of the time, it's spam and i don't answer it. i only answer phone calls to numbers i recognize.\n  ","399874":"\n  i'm an organized person because it's much better for my mental health. i'm less anxious when everything is in its rightful place, and i notice that if i do allow things to get cluttered, it's an indication that my depression might be slipping back in.\n  ","399875":"\n  i like cleaning routinely, and i prefer clean and organized living spaces. too much mess or clutter makes me really anxious and claustrophobic, so i always pick up after myself whenever possible.\n  \n  when it comes to household chores, my roommates and i take turns with the cleaning, but i do have a tendency to do a little extra around the house even after they're done with their part, lmaoo.\n  ","399876":"\n  i prefer to handle things on my own whenever possible. i never ask for help with anything because i don't want to appear needy or dependent on anyone, with the obvious exceptions of when i'm too sick to move.\n  \n  i even felt bad asking my roommate to bring me a glass of water when i had the stomach virus two weeks ago, lmaoo.\n  ","399877":"\n  i don't trust people to do things, unless it's something that i'm not skilled in, like people who are mechanics, construction workers, etc etc. when it comes to personal projects, i prefer to take on the projects solo because i don't trust that others won't make mistakes.\n  \n  it's why i had a huge problem with group projects when i was in school, and i would usually take control of most of the project myself because i didn't want my grade on the line.\n  ","399878":"\n  one of my coworkers has never let me down, although i've only known her for less than two years. she's one of the sweetest, most genuine, and selfless people i've ever met and she gives the world to everyone in her life.\n  ","399879":"\n  the last mistake i made was vaping when i was sick with a stomach virus, lmaoo. it isn't a huge mistake by any means, but it definitely made me feel sicker because i wasn't ready to begin with nicotine again yet.\n  \n  i try not to dwell on past mistakes, especially those that cannot be changed or fixed. it's negative energy, and i'm trying to rid my life of negative energy.\n  ","399880":"\n  i'm definitely not as anxious now as i used to be in the past, but i still experience *some* degree of anxiety. this is the least anxious i've ever been in my entire life -- throughout the rest of my life, i was anxious to the point where it was debilitating.\n  ","399881":"\n  i've been on psychiatric medication for three years now. if i stopped taking them (or my antidepressant, at the very least), i feel as if i would fall into a severe depressive episode and begin having panic attacks again. my medication soothes and quells most of my symptoms, ranging from depressive episodes to severe mood swings to anxiety to panic attacks, etc etc.\n  \n  i wouldn't want to risk it, tbh. i've been doing so well on medication that i know it would have a bad, detrimental effect on my well being if i abruptly stopped taking them.\n  ","399882":"\n  i don't have any cool plans within the month of january, no. the most \"exciting\" plan i have is this saturday -- i have to bring my car to the mechanic, get new tired installed and rotated, and get an oil change. haha.\n  ","399883":"\n  i'm not entirely sure, lmaoo. i'm sure it's because they enjoy my answers, but i don't really find my answers to be anything spectacular.\n  ","399884":"\n  we all do. we take turns doing the cleaning, or we'll have certain people do certain rooms and rotate accordingly week-by-week.\n  ","399885":"\n  i drink 1-2 times per week these days. normally i'll have a few glasses of wine, but i also drink IPAs (beer) and hard seltzers.\n  ","399886":"\n  i can understand why those people feel the need to do so, but i also respect people more if they're outspoken about what they believe (regarding if there are more efficient ways to do things, etc). if you're solely placating a superior in order to get on their good side for your own personal gain, even if you don't agree with them, then i don't really find much respect in that.\n  ","399887":"\n  i don't normally eat chocolate, but i used to like the hershey's cookies and cream bars.\n  ","399888":"\n  i'm not religious, so i have no religion.\n

breakfast and drinking lots of coffee, and casually doing some easy household chores (like cleaning my bedroom) to make myself feel productive.\n  \n  i don't like leaving the house on the weekends, so a weekend where i didn't have to run any errands would be most ideal.\n  ","399894":"\n  idk, probably purchase a new blanket and pillowcase set off of amazon last week. it wasn't something i set out to do, but i was browsing amazon and saw it and the blanket looked so cozy, and i've also been wanting a new blanket to snuggle up in. so i bought it on a whim.\n  ","399895":"\n  i would much rather stay home, watch television, and eat snacks, lmaoo. music shows are fun and everything, but i've never been to a festival before and the idea of one freaks me out because of my social anxiety.
