pretty colors","153815":"didn t notice tbh . . . maybe i just haven t updated lol . what s different ?","153816":"beastiality is so disgusting for so so many more reasons , but specific to my point about it being rape is that animals cannot consent or dissent to sexual relations including fellatio . i cannot believe i have to explain that forcing yourself on anyone , including an animal , without verbal consent is rape . since animals are incapable of ever providing verbal consent to any kind of sexual act , your ask implying that i suck a horse s dick is therefore also considered an act of rape . im not into beastiality , not into rape , and not into this conversation . so tired of people thinking it s somehow hilarious to ask or imply that there s anything sexual about equestrian sports . so exhausting to listen to","153817":"i don t think you did my dude . there was nothing that suggested any sort of metaphor . in case you were confused , a metaphor is a figure of speech where a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable . harassing me out of the blue by implying that i rape animals is not metaphorical nor is it

start doing things for you again and invest your time in activities that make you happy . it s gonna suck for real and it s okay to feel upset . being sad is part of the healing process and bottling it up acting like it doesn t bother you is unhealthy and won t help . get outside and get some sunshine , do physical activities , push yourself to get out there and try new things . don t look for another partner , just live your life and learn to love yourself and make your own self happy again without relying on anyone else","153838":"eggnog is alright but not my fav . i don t like oranges

of vegetables , fruits , and meats without too too many carbs lol . but yeah i guess i have a good genetic setup as a baseline . no one in my parent s families are really overweight","153861":"keeping busy helps you not be depressed because it s a distraction . if you re feeling uncontrollably low and unhappy with yourself , uninterested in activities and people that used to make you happy , you find yourself not wanting to do basic self care like shower or eat , you d rather lay or sit down a lot and do nothing , you find yourself spacing out and having a hard time paying attention , ou often forget things when that never used to be a problem for you , and you feed sad and want to cry a lot but can t put your finger on the reason why , you may be depressed . if you have a few or more of these symptoms that s depression and you need to find the root cause and eliminate it . dig deep and do some self reflecting . if you re just sad sometimes as a result of negative stigma in your life that s normal and isn t depression .","153862":"why are you so interested lol","153863":"not really . i stop eating when i m full and then move on with my life lol . i like small snacks every

things bc it s gay etc . its all just toxic bs that society crams down people s throats in an effort to adhere to some imaginary social norm . it s fear of being ostracized for not being good enough .

boy","154076":"live and let live , forgive and forget , and don t make a mountain out of a molehill . it wasn t until college that i fully realized all of those , but the second one has always been my mantra","154077":"love yourself and find outdoor activities you can do while socially distanced","154078":"haha uuuh a little boy ? ?","154079":"yeah a few now","154080":"no and i m not making one in the future either","154081":"bi lol but actually i don t think a lot of my female friends know since i ve never actually dated any women . i don t want any of them to feel uncomfortable lol . some of them are sort of conservative in their views , like not against lgbtq rights or anything , but they probs would be uncomfy and think i was hitting on them all the time if i told them and i just know it d make things weird lol . i don t think of any of them that way so i figure it doesn t really matter if they know or not","154082":"i like to watch videos in the background to help me sleep most times . also i like horse and art videos for inspiration i think i like making youtube vids more than i like watching them","154083":"eh i ve never been into starting stuff like that haha . i mean , i ve always been friends with my s o s before i started dating them but not long time friends or anything . we were always just casual friends who d just met before we started dating . that s how it was

has a crush on you and you don t feel the same way lol . def a good decision to decline","154092":"yeah i mean i m sure some people might find it nice but i don t really think it d be fun to look at my friends naked haha just a bit too weird","154093":"i feel like i d be too cold or too sweaty to feel comfy in either season . plus i kinda don t want to look at other peoples naked bodies all the time lol so still probs not","154094":"doesn t really matter to me . santa can be whoever you want him to be","154095":"does hot cheetos count ?","154096":"oh haha then nah","154097":"i don t think so . i d put it in a safe place where nothing bad could happen to it until i could figure out a safe way to destroy it without hurting the person so nobody bad could get a hold of it","154098":"a naturalist is the same thing lol that s what i just said . if you mean nudist then probs not lol","154099":"yo simon","154100":"hi again ask people","154101":"like a wildlife biologist naturalist as a

able to ride bc the ground is frozen and breaking ice in water buckets and having to scrape the car windows in the morning . also hate freezing rain , black ice on the roads , and when people drive poorly in the snow","154110":"i most like spring cause summer is too hot and sweaty and winter can be a pain with the ground freezing and ice on the roads and stuff but if i had to choose just between summer and winter i d choose winter","154111":"fall i really just like the autumn season","154112":"oh nice ! i used to show a lot too but now i don t have the time or money sadly . still like to ride

live with my family rn so roommates technically p","154127":"bc i m good at self regulating things like finances , diet , exercise plans , and using self control , but not so overboard that i never let myself have any fun at all and only work and save and be miserable lol","154128":"horses walk on tiptoe all the time ! the bones that make up their leg and the inside of their hoof are actually the human equivalent of the middle finger so they re actually walking on the tips of their middle fingers all the time and are always flipping everyone off","154129":"not directly in my neighborhood but there s a ice skating ring like or so minutes from me i think ! it s open year round for ice hockey games but i usually only go during winter time to skate around","154130":"i am it s about am

something we shred it by and and put it in the recycle","154138":"another reason to just ignore him . he s obviously cuckoo","154139":"idc man good for you , stop telling me lol","154140":"because they wanted a reaction from you . they have some sort of instability or insecurity and making fun of others for things that are different to them somehow makes them feel superior or good . just ignoring them makes them feel and look foolish","154141":"observed an open heart surgery once . that was pretty impressive","154142":"we used to every year when i was little with those build your own gingerbread house kits . they usually turned out cute","154143":"doesn t seem impossible but at this point it would be improbable that that technology would be available on the public scale","154144":"sandy","154145":"depends on what occasion i m wearing boots for lol","154146":"about the same amount of active as i am in the summer . horses don t feed themselves grain and put on

feel any sort of way about any kind of skin color . i m not interested in anyone but sandy anyways","154158":"haha it s short compared to before i cut it but thanks . i cut it from being down past my waist to a bob cut that i could barely tuck behind my ears","154159":"you should read mine then","154160":"he never did dude dump his flakey ass . he likes your convenience and stability . not you","154161":"what . . . ?","154162":"bio","154163":"ignore him . he wanted a reaction out of you . it burns people up when you don t react the way they want you to","154164":"everybody is kind to eachother and genuinely invested in their communities unlike in america where nobody give af about anybody else","154165":"used to a lot when i was a little kid but not that much anymore lol . i like

year probably","154199":"not really","154200":"i like this one lol","154201":"not telling","154202":"doing things for someone and touching like holding hands and snuggling","154203":"not sure how turning my life around in a way that suits me is sad lol . not denying medicine can help some but it just didn t help me . also yeah it is sad that medicine in the us is so expensive and big drug companies are only in it for the profit","154204":"aw happy birthday month ! !","154205":"he s such a friendly guy i m glad he has a good loving home where he has lots of room to run and play and he has i always friends and people to hang out with","154206":"haha i mean i guess maybe for some people but not for mine . i swore off prescription drugs a long while ago except like advil and stuff . it just wasn t working for me . wasnt my thing . now i manage my mental health by talking it through , keeping healthy habits , going outside , staying active , and surrounding myself with positive and supportive people big pharma in the us doesn t care about helping people or curing diseases or getting people healthy enough to stop needing to take pills . they just like money","154207":"hell no lol december is christmas month ! we already have our tree decorated and everything merry christmas and happy holidays to all !","154208":"staying out of others personal business is considered polite . calling people a bitch is considered rude . . .","154209":"not my business , don t care","154210":"if i knew russian probably forever or until someone asked where i was from . russians are overwhelmingly caucasian and either brunette or blonde so i wouldn t really stick out in a crowd or anything","154211":"haha tru p","154212":"it has nothing to do with being more or less masculine , it s just a silly name like from that song by metallica haha . sometimes i also call him sand o , sanderson , or sandra as a joke . he doesn t really care . he s pretty used to people asking is that your real name ? and giggling when he says yes . i love his name though","154213":"yea . what about it ? why d you just send the word pharmo lol","154214":"eh just drink some water you ll be fine","154215":"yes ! merry christmas and happy new year to you too !","154216":"haha okay what about it ?","154217":"welp . hope you feel better soon sorry bout that","154218":"think you just had a stroke . you alright there bud ?","154219":"lol sorry for the long answer but that s actually very dangerous and should not be done for riding . in the event of an emergency the rider wouldn t be able to bail . for example if the horse were to somehow trip and fall down you d be crushed to death under their weight with no escape cause you couldn t get off . if they bolted off and started bucking like a bronco the rider wouldn t be able to sit up and prevent them from doing that by using their body as a counter balance . if one of the ties holding you to the saddle broke off and you partially fell down while the horse was in motion , you d be halfway tied to the saddle and dragged by the leg connected to the saddle with your body on the ground next to the horse s feet risking being trampled , kicked , knocked on the head , breaking your leg , ankle , etc by having it twisted while stuck to the saddle . i ve actually seen this happen to someone before and they had multiple injuries from it . broken ankle , torn knee tendon , broken ribs , concussion , and a whole bunch of cuts and bruising everywhere . overall it s just a super horrible idea . plus a lot of riding involves a form of basically standing up in the stirrups to properly balance and move with the horse . if you were tied to the saddle it would be super hard to do that and you d be flopping around really uncomfortably . i ve seen people with disabilities be strapped in the the saddle for hippotherapy sessions with people walking with the horse on both sides of them and with a person leading the horse with a rope in front because the rider is incapable of sitting up on their own , but never really seen someone strap a young child into a saddle actually . it s important for a beginner level person just learning to ride to hold their own selves up so they can be able to build up their muscles and be better balanced later in their riding journey","154220":"hi","154221":"what is that","154222":"yeah learning exactly how and when to fall off is important ! wearing a helmet and learning to tuck and roll properly is very helpful","154223":"in a relationship","154224":"quite a few lol . i haven t really been counting but definitely at least once a year so probably like or so times in my whole life","154225":"tbh my life hasn t changed that much with covid other than not going to the movies or out to eat but i didn t do that very much to start with lol . now i just order doordash and uber eats instead so there s basically no change with that p i ve always been kinda a shut in who only goes outside to see the horses lmao","154226":"read my bio","154227":"who ?","154228":"nope not me","154229":"sandy","154230":"yeah","154231":"it s more dramatic to watch i guess idk","154232":"usually answer more than i ask","154233":"not interested in discussing that","154234":"never riding a horse again","154235":"camping !","154236":"oh how was your dentist visit ? i hate going to the dentist","154237":"you re only ever as old as you feel lol in my case i m like p","154238":"hi there javi happy friday ! hope you re doing well","154239":"neither . i usually feel pretty neutral about most things going on in my life atm","154240":"thx lol","154241":"ya","154242":"no . there was no need to bully someone you don t even know for no reason . nobody asked you your opinion and it was uncalled for to say that . keep mean comments to yourself","154243":"haha okay i don t know that person in any capacity tho so i stand by my answer","154244":"there never was one lol what are you talking about ?","154245":". . . ? no i literally don t know how tall all of my family members are","154246":"i don t know anything about dolphin training and people shouldn t ride them so i don t think i d want to do that","154247":"thank you wow i feel so enlightened reckon that s why they named him that as well","154248":". . . my boyfriend ? that s a fairly normal response i fail to see the humor in that but okay ?","154249":"that s what his parents named him . why did you feel the need to ask such an obvious and dumb question ?","154250":"i dunno","154251":"idk who that is and i don t care","154252":"you do you ! p","154253":"ignoring the fact that you most definitely made it sound like you were doing those things , you also insinuated that someone who was sticking up for lgbtq rights had mental problems for doing so . that is hateful in itself .","154254":"or maybe you re just fangirling lol sorry my dude","154255":"no , actually nobody asked you and nobody wants to hear you spew hateful ideas . . . if you don t have anything nice to add don t add anything","154256":"who ?","154257":"if you judge and treat people differently based on assumptions you make their sexuality you have mental problems . butt out .","154258":"anything classic disney lol","154259":"yeah a big portion of the population here is latinx , asian , and black","154260":"i don t really have an opinion on that","154261":"finished all my assignments ahead of time , published my youtube video on time , and decorated the christmas tree","154262":"i already found mine","154263":"thank you ! louder for the anons in the back","154264":"this","154265":"no sometimes i wait and sometimes i forget i opened the message and i forget to reply even though i meant to so i can t really be that mad about people not responding to me lol . i m not afraid to double text after a while either haha","154266":"what does this even mean ?","154267":"eventful as in full of family drama . it exhausts me","154268":"goodnight !","154269":"uneventful thank god lol . it was peaceful and i got to hang out with my man and look at lake views","154270":"sometimes , but sometimes i think they also just come out of curiosity and a want for different explanations of things","154271":"i don t need to float lol . propelling yourself through the water can be done above or below the surface . just need to get my head up to breathe for a sec but actually i can swim pretty easily in the surface and not ever let my head dip underwater","154272":"yeah i love to swim . all mammals are capable of swimming haha it s not that hard","154273":"oh jeez lol yeah i bet he has a lot of people who aren t very happy with him for that","154274":"idk what that is","154275":"apple pie , baseball , white picket fences , chewing gun , corn , and systemic racism","154276":"a good friend to lean on can be equally beneficial for me","154277":"it s always just telemarketers it s so annoying","154278":"not really","154279":"no i don t think that s very kind to them at all","154280":"i ve cream","154281":"fork","154282":"no idea . i m too old to know what kids these days want lol","154283":"haha uh okay . . not that much other than he s the conspiracy guy","154284":"not really . they re all pretty unique and well maintained","154285":"started off as a fraternal org that was originally for stonemasons in th century who regulated who could qualifiy to be an official tradesman stonemason but it turned into a secret society that did rituals and basically became an influential , prestigious , fancy cult","154286":"nope","154287":"i m not in the illuminati and if i were i couldn t tell you anyways","154288":"illuminati maybe but the freemasons are def real . there are lots of freemasons only cemeteries where i m from","154289":"usually none but if i have an event to go to i ll coordinate the color with my outfit","154290":"read my bio","154291":"uuuh idk . i never really watched the ben affleck batman movies","154292":"in the same way the chicken pox , measles , mumps , the black plague , and polio have gone away , yes . they don t just cease to exist but modern medicine and preventative vaccines and treatments have made it so a large portion of the population is immune to those diseases making them a much less widespread problem","154293":"meh not really","154294":"his name is chance ! he belongs to my boyfriend s family","154295":"it means she s happy or she s being friendly . it s not some secret language lol . it s the same as when a guy smiles at a guy or a girl smiles at a girl","154296":"original apple earbuds with the wire and headphone jack lol","154297":"sorry but rhat didn t really help lol . . . do you mean the best way to take care of someone or did you possibly mean what s your favorite place ? my best place for taking more care doesn t make sense either","154298":"sorry can you rephrase this maybe ? i don t really know what you mean best place for more caring","154299":"nah i don t want to fight any animal for any amount of money","154300":"lolol","154301":"depends on the weather . hot coffee in the cold and cold coffee in the heat","154302":"no","154303":"chips","154304":"pisces here , sorry","154305":"money","154306":"nope . i was born in the s","154307":"my fam lol","154308":"i don t like babies and don t really interact with them much so idk","154309":"i kinda don t like the holidays tbh . it s stressful and money draining and with corona this year it s even worse with everyone in my family freaking out and arguing about who is and isn t allowed to come and where i am and aren t allowed to go . i have even less money this year too bc the budgets been tightened even further by the virus conditions . i guess one positive is the sweets ban in our house is temporarily lifted and i can eat a few shortbread cookies without my mom screaming at me for being unhealthy","154310":"i d definitely give myself advice about self esteem and tell myself that i d turn out okay . i d have to also intervene in the fashion department and give myself some actual makeup tips instead of listening to my mom s s makeup advice","154311":"stop sending this it s annoying . this is the th time i ve received this video","154312":"probs wendy s or mcddonalds","154313":"i live with them now so a lot","154314":"mixed chicken poncho with rice and beans and chips queso","154315":"the same ageish . i d probably think i was about which is right on the money for my actual age","154316":"yeah it s pretty good . it all depends on the frosting though tbh but i haven t ever tried a frosting that i hated soooo just gotta have the right ratio of frosting to cake","154317":"there s nothing to explain ? you either are dating someone or you aren t lol . not sure exactly what you mean with this q","154318":"no idc about celeb drama","154319":"you just have to listen to them . you have to pay attention to their breathing , their pace , how sweaty they are , how hot their skin is feeling to the touch , just like , their overall look and feel . it s not hard to tell when a horse is feeling tired and needs a break or when they need to be done for the day . they tell you in their own silent way through their body language . i think the longest i ve ever rode was like a or hour trail ride or so but we were walking the whole time which made it pretty easy on the horse and it didn t make him very tired . we also took several breaks where i got off and his back got to rest and he got to chill and eat grass","154320":"no . pushing an animal so hard that it lays or falls down is cruel","154321":"horse riding","154322":"disagree","154323":"https m . youtube . com user

you completely ignoring my declination of your proposals . not taking no for an answer is to me , pretty rude in this situation . . not replaying to this thread anymore after this lol","154339":"weirdos are everywhere man , idk . i feel like ladies gotta watch each others backs and watch their own backs cause some people are just indecent with no self control . it is what it is unfortunately . thanks lol","154340":"yes . being rude isn t exclusive to any specific gender .","154341":"i do not want friendship from you , as you ve ignored my questions in this thread and

and plants . here s a page spread from my sketchbook","154357":"ya when i was in late middle school i was in a bad place but i decided pretty quickly that i didn t want to do that anymore and i found other ways to cope with my feelings like art , equestrian , and just being in nature or with my pets","154358":"leave her alone . she doesn t want you , clearly . take this time to do things that make you happy . learn to live and be nice to yourself again without relying on anyone else for your happiness . it sucks but you gotta move on my dude . getting back with an ex never works out","154359":"no not anymore . i had to move home after college bc of corona so now i live with my family","154360":"easily . i know how to care for myself , how to grow fruits and vegetables , how to build or find shelter , and there s practically limitless canned food available that won t go bad just sitting in abandoned grocery store shelves so i ll have a lifetime supply . i ll have my dog with me for protection and companionship plus any other domestic animal i choose to adopt bc there are now millions of homeless pets wandering around . plus i d also have unlimited access to automobiles , gasoline , health products . . . you name it . there d be so much stuff sitting around in abandoned stores and houses i wouldn t need anyone for anything","154361":". . . use you ? ? i d probably try to stay as far away from you as possible lol","154362":"using words like can i come too or want some company or i want to be included . it s not that hard lol","154363":". . . ? are you implying you d kill me or something ?","154364":"idk what this even means","154365":"nah , usually it s just a bunch of screaming squealing at eachother and stomping around and pawing and prancing around","154366":"hahaha","154367":"yeah a gelding is the term used to describe a male horse that s neutered . a male horse that s not neutered is a stallion .","154368":"after being around horses for more than like , a day , you just get used to it . they re animals so they don t really know what constitutes a bad time haha . i can t really think of a situation where the horse has farted and it was considered inappropriate or anything . funny maybe , but not embarrassing or bad lol","154369":"not if you re sitting correctly . it s only after a few hours of riding that you ll feel sore but i think that s mostly just being stiff from sitting in the same position for so long . like how you re a bit sore after a long car trip , ya know ?","154370":"unlike dogs who are mostly concerned about pleasing their owner in order to receive food and love and therefore a place in the pack , horses are only concerned with feeling like you can provide safety from predators and that you ll protect them as a good friend . food is pretty much everywhere for them , so your relationship has to be based more on trust and friendship rather than being the food and pets person . it s that fact that gives people the opportunity to learn about themselves in ways that lots of other animals can t help you with . in order to work with horses effectively , get them to do what you want , and be a good horseman , you need to be able to center yourself and control your emotions . horses can only react to stimulus that we give them . they don t understand anything else other than what we show them through our subtle body language and tone of voice . they re really really good at picking up the vibe somebody gives off and picking up on their mood . horses can help us realize what sort of vibes were putting out and how our actions , thoughts , and words affect others around us . they can help us learn to be more calm , confident , compassionate , and centered .","154371":"nope . i ve never owned my own horses , only leased or worked with other people s . also most of the animals i ve worked with happened to have been geldings lol","154372":"fine china like dishes , plates , and little spoons , all with animals on them . like literally covering every wall and filling every flat surface","154373":"they help us learn about ourselves","154374":"no but my bf has had to times cause of his work","154375":"nope they just gotta do it when they have to","154376":"will do","154377":"usually they just do it haha . they don t even need to stop moving to poo . they can literally gallop and poo at the same time , no problem going pee is different though . they have to stand still to do that . the way you tell if they need to go pee is male horses will take a wide stance with all legs and drop if you know what i mean before they go . female horses will lift their tail to the side and take a slightly wider stance with only their back legs before they go","154378":"lol ja das braune pony ist max und die graue nase ist chance . die person ist sandy","154379":"yep about the same amount you d bathe a dog . too much is bad for their skin and coat but it s nice every once in a while when the weather is warm enough . when i used to compete a lot i d bathe the horse the day before so they could be super clean and shiny for the show !","154380":"nature , photography , equestrian , art , making youtube videos , animals , food , and friends !","154381":"posted about this already the other day but the most unique problem in my life atm is silly horsies who somehow get themselves stuck in tight spots he was unharmed and un phased","154382":"one time i dreamed i was a crayon being colored with","154383":"i don t exactly live on a farm lol but it s going well ! finally figured out a saddle pad configuration that provides the extra padding max needs for his saddle to fit him better with his swayback issue ! old man can be much more comfy on our walks now","154384":"yeah , it was a very happy day","154385":"yeah , but i don t want to date anyone else in general rn cause i m already dating someone lol","154386":"no , about average height . winter is actually shorter than me but i was bending down to be in frame","154387":"hi i m doing well thanks hope you are too . as far as wrestling goes tho i don t really watch it or follow anything to do with it so idek any wrestlers in general . not really a fan lol sorry !","154388":"yeah i m sure if he s been started in a good home where he was loved he wouldn t be so unsure of new stuff","154389":"convocation day at college with my friend winter . i made her cap for her !","154390":"my toenails are painted red rn lol","154391":"yeah totally . they re very doug from up in their personalities haha . just dopey , happy , and ready for attention haha . nugget is very much like that , but cezar is much more reserved . he s not as dopey or as friendly as nugget is . especially with new people and dogs . he gets nervous and growls at other dogs a lot and shys away from new people if they re too in his face","154392":"nope . chugging along in the process of changing that tho ! corona kinda put a damper on my whole plan lol but it s all good","154393":"used to be much worse when i was younger but now o have to get up so damn early that i m tired at the end of the day","154394":"most definitely","154395":"he s obsessed with pets haha he s super friendly with people and animals alike . the kitty in the background of that last vid is his bestest friend it s adorable . he ll lick her head and they sleep together in the heated dog house on the porch snuggled up in all the blankies","154396":"the arctic monkeys","154397":"his dog is also a lab but he s for sure a purebred yellow lab . i think the people they got him from had papers on him and everything","154398":"he s pretty mindful of them and tends to keep his distance from them . i assume he s been kicked or accidentally stepped on before bc he won t get too close . sandy s family dog nugget loves to try to get the horses to play though . he ll bark at them and run around and jump up on his two back feet and try to paw them . it s super cute but we always have to tell him to cut it out cause we don t want the horses to get annoyed an kick his face in haha that would be an expensive vet bill","154399":"he s def taken over this particular spot as his own . if you ask him to move he gives you the saddest puppy eyes and sometimes he even groans like he s annoyed or sad with you if you want to sit there instead","154400":"used to be my hair for sure . it was down past my waist for a long time ! now i cut it a bit shorter to let it grow out healthier without so many split ends so idk what most people see first about me . glasses maybe ?","154401":"toothbrush !","154402":"probably","154403":"i have a real soft spot for animals , that s for sure . i m so glad that he doesn t have to be forced to live outside on a chain anymore . he s the king of the couch now","154404":"nope . i ve never had a big enough problem to require talking to a manager . i ve worked a lot of retail , so i know the manager will usually just tell you the exact same thing the store employee tells you . imo it s just rude and annoying to make a big fuss and ask for the manager at a store unless the store employee said or did something extremely inappropriate , which like , never happens anyways cause they know they d be fired","154405":"yeah , long story short he belonged to some crackheads who never fed him and kept him tied up on a short rope out front of their trailer in a junkyard and he kept escaping so animal control got called on them and the very last time he escaped their house to run around on the streets in the middle of winter and eat roadkill i decided it was too cruel to keep giving him back to those people who abused him so i just took him home and he became my dog . there s a bit more to the story but that s the basic premise . those people were pretty messed up","154406":"i think i read bits and pieces of through the looking glass in school but never read the whole book . i ve watched the disney movie a lot of times so i m more familiar with that retelling . in the disney movie i feel like alice was always kind of dumb and she cried a lot for no reason lol . i think i probably would have try to stay calm and i would have realized a lot earlier on that nothing in wonderland made any sense . i feel like she spent half of the movie being confused because nothing made sense in the world she created not to make sense","154407":"clearwater , florida","154408":"right on the cutoff for pisces lol born on the very first day of","154409":"he s licensed and registered in my county under my name so he better be my dog lol . i assume his fave color is probably black , white , yellow , brown , or blue , since those are the only colors he s capable of seeing . probs black since he looks so handsome in his black fur coat all the time p","154410":"i think so . either that or a lab mix . i don t really know too much about him tbh . i don t even know exactly how old he is","154411":"plodding and tedious with occasional little pockets of joy , thanks for asking","154412":"that s dumb . learn to swim . all mammals are capable of swimming , even elephants and they re heavy as shit","154413":"no it wouldn t be worth it to get the shit knocked out of me . i m not fast or tall or heavy or strong . it would only take tackle by some big heavy dude to seriously injure me","154414":"no idea . he s kinda a nervous little dude so idk how he d react in a life threatening situation","154415":"that sucks","154416":"haha nah we re not really that close . never have been . she used to annoy the living shit out of me when we were kids lol . we re cool now but we still don t really hang out or anything . we mostly just ignore eachother other than occasional acknowledgment and passing remarks tbh","154417":"she s","154418":"as i ve come to understand his lawyers are floundering rn . they re losing every case he brings up . i think he s still going to have to concede","154419":"not particularly lol","154420":"some people are just too upset that their candidate lost that they must be blinded i think but it s impossible to deny that america has officially voted trump out","154421":"everyone already knows that lol","154422":"coral bleaching is bad for the ocean ecosystem","154423":"the who s what ?","154424":"the claymation ones , the original animated grinch , and the nightmare before christmas","154425":"a horse lol","154426":"what . . ?","154427":"i d rather be within the healthy weight range for my age , gender , and height","154428":"nope","154429":"yeah haha i don t think he d been standing there very long . he s such a funny little dude","154430":"me lol also covid , racism , and sexism","154431":"what is ?","154432":"as in been to a protest , no","154433":"aaaaah haha clever . i kept thinking ballot box instead of post lol","154434":"walked out into the pasture the other day to fetch the boys for a nice trail ride and found max chilling in one of the horse s favorite spots , under the bushes in the brush next to the fence . i walked up to him front on , petted his face , clipped on his lead rope and started to walk away thinking he d follow like usual but he didn t . i tried tempting him with treats , baby talk , and giving the rope a few good wiggles and nudges hoping he d get the idea and follow but he didn t . i was kinda confused cause he loves treats and is usually very cooperative and likes being petted and brushed and fussed over . i walked back over to him , this time to his side checking to see if he didn t want to come with me yet because he was busy using the bathroom . . . but then i saw this ! he had gotten his whole leg stuck in the brush somehow ! this has literally never happened before i was so puzzled on how the heck he managed to do this ! this pic was taken while i was waiting with him when sandy went to get the yard clippers to cut him free . he was perfectly unharmed and totally relaxed the whole time , just a bit stuck , poor old man ! we went for a nice walk after this","154435":"friday by rebecca black , all i want for christmas is you by mariah carey , and baby by justin bieber","154436":"no i don t think so","154437":"i love social interaction and hanging out with a bunch of people all the time but tbh my social interaction meter goes down pretty quickly , like i get tired and emotionally drained if i m around too many people for too long . sometimes i just need to be alone for a second and recharge ! some people have been hurt insulted by that fact before . it s nothing to do with them specifically , i just need to have some me time every so often otherwise i get overwhelmed lol","154438":"nature , horses , my experiences in europe maybe ? i m not particularly fond of writing though so i m not sure exactly what it would be about","154439":"alright , pull up the youtube video ! let s figure out how to do this !","154440":"not taking anyone s shit . some people think i m being a bitch when i don t allow them to walk all over me or when i don t accept their rude comments and i politely stand up for myself . happens more online than in person , but people really really hate to be told no , i m not interested , and they seem to especially dislike that makes me uncomfortable .","154441":"no idea lol . who is it ?","154442":"i d spend it on building an equestrian business service . that way i d make money while spending money","154443":"horse racing is , overall , a cruel activity in my opinion . i do not support it . whipping a horse the way i ve seen many jockeys do while racing is unnecessary and mean .","154444":"oh gee honestly idk . i don t have regular tv so everything that i watch is old news lol","154445":"any wild animal , especially an exotic one .","154446":"daddy s girls stereotypically get more of the things they want than mommas boys","154447":"it s low key dead","154448":"equestrian youtube videos , hanging with my quaran team , and art","154449":"talking gibberish to sandy . it s our little inside joke lol","154450":"yeah i guess lol","154451":"ya","154452":"uh nope , can t say i do . i m sure they re very nice though","154453":"if we re talking about animals that fall on the extreme end of the normal curve then , maybe they d be evenly matched . my previous assessment was based on average sized animals though , not abnormally large ones . also , as far as your claim about tigers preying on bears on the indian subcontinent , yea that is true but those bears they re killing are sloth bears , not anything near the size or strength of a polar bear . sloth bears are feet shorter and , lbs lighter than a polar bear . like maybe they d see the bear and know it was a bear but i don t think it would be anything like they were used to so going into a fight as a tiger expecting the bear to react like a sloth bear would might be the tiger s downfall . i m still thinking east tko for the world s largest and strongest bear species","154454":"as well as being physically larger , stronger , and heavier than a liger , a polar bear also has a stronger bite force than a liger . that s why i think the pb would win","154455":"mountain lion is heavier , larger , and has stronger bitte force","154456":"polar bear is bigger and stronger","154457":"a wide variety lol","154458":"nothing ?","154459":"spam again . . . you just said hi a minute ago in this same thread and i replied","154460":"what ?","154461":"i don t know you tho . . . ?","154462":"being a nurse is a crazy difficult job , especially right now ! idk how you do it ! wait so you had covid last year before the pandemic ? ?","154463":"spam","154464":"dude what ? . . . no because we re family and don t sexualize eachother . a bra is just a bra , same for underwear . it s not uncommon for laundry to just be chillin on the living room couch waiting to be folded sorted so it s not like we haven t seen each others undergarments lol","154465":"she s good with kids and sports","154466":"blaine","154467":"most definitely ! not sure if he s full lab but it s definitely in there ! he s got webbed feet , a thick otter tail , and he loves to swim and play fetch lol . very labrador ish personality","154468":"i can do that . . . watch this bro !","154469":"yes ! i have a beautiful pupper named cezar","154470":"hi ? why do you always butt in on random threads just to say hi x when you could just ask me directly . . ? ?","154471":"haha weirdly enough , my parent s neighborhood s actual official name is the woods cause it s surrounded by a bunch of patches of forest haha . it s where i grew up for a good portion of my teen years lol","154472":"probably like but i only wear about half all the time . the rest are fancy special occasion shoes like my high heels lol","154473":"i m sure i would but am still confused what this now has to do with the original topic","154474":"ok then don
