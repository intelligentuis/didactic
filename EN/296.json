i think once the bars and restaurants opened up , people kinda took that as a sign meaning it s over when it s far from over . schools opened up for the fall semester , but most of them are closing

disorder .","274003":"i played it for the first time with four of my friends last night , it was so intense . lmaoo .","274004":"well , my weekend just started it s only am on saturday , lol . last night , i played video games with some friends until around midnight . this morning , i ran some errands , made some breakfast , and now i m looking through social media and clearing out my askfm inbox . i also just made the french vanilla coffee flavor of gfuel and mixed it with soy milk omg , it tastes so good .","274005":"the game among us is fun af , omg .","274006":"no , thankfully i never have .","274007":"error page not found .","274008":"i didn t really think you were personally , so i apologize if my response came off as if i thought you were . it just reminded me of those instances where people do romanticize it or think any good comes from having mental illness . even certain things that aren t necessarily romanticizing can leave a bad taste in my mouth , tbh . like when people say yeah my x disorder makes me feel more deeply for people and the things i love , which is . . . fine on a surface level , i suppose . but it s also just as damaging because that s very much a symptom too , and a lot of harm can come of it due to personal attachments and whatnot .","274009":"i usually hang out with the same people , haha . i don t have a large inner circle , but i m content with the friends i have .","274010":"for me personally , i would it consider it extreme if someone is using their religion to enforce harm onto someone else , i . e . someone s who s christian and is protesting saying that gay or trans people should d e , and other things of that nature .","274011":"i never said i disagreed with you regarding islam . i was offering christianity as an example of another flawed religion . perhaps it s just where i live who knows ? , but there are a lot of christians catholics etc etc . who are extreme in their thinking , and leverage their religious beliefs to put forth their own close minded views .","274012":"the answer depends entirely on the individual . some people find meaning in their careers , others in their friends and families , and others in their spiritual and or religious beliefs . a lot of the time , it s a combination of some or all of those factors .","274013":"don t believe everything you read online , triple check your sources to see that you re obtaining the most unbiased information , and don t take social media very seriously .","274014":"happiness is having a warm campfire in the middle of a cold night with friends around you , while you all drink and listen to music and swap stories .","274015":"i agree with you . i don t know the specifics of christianity because i haven t studied it in a very long time , but it is also a very flawed religion whose followers often take to extremes .","274016":"i think it depends on the individual circumstance . personally , i d much rather know things than be ignorant or na ve towards them , even if it might hurt me .","274017":"i wouldn t say that my day was necessarily good , but it wasn t bad either . i feel much more stable today than i did yesterday , for which i m thankful . yesterday , i had a meltdown and couldn t stop crying while trying to work in the morning , and i ended up clocking out around noon . i laid in bed for an hour before finally taking a hour nap , and i woke up feeling even worse than before . i haven t been that down in a very long time , but i m feeling a bit better today .","274018":"? ? ? this is exactly what i m talking about , rofl .","274019":"i don t think it s wrong to say that , no . all major religions are extremely problematic because of their historical roots and context , and islam is no different . i m not saying i m an expert on religion or anything , i haven t studied religion in over a decade , but i just want to point out that i m not targeting just islam when it comes to things like this . there are also major issues with christianity too , as an example .","274020":"i don t have any thoughts on the matter . people have the freedom to be spiritual and or religious , and it isn t my business what someone else believes in .","274021":"oh , okay . you weren t patronizing , i just read the message wrong and it sounded like you wanted me to cut my medication and therapy out of my life , lmaoo . eating healthy food and exercising can temporarily help to some degree , but it isn t a cure all . the mental illness will still be there and most of the time , the most effective means of combatting it is through psychiatric medication and talk therapy .","274022":"as much as it frustrates me that the stigma exists , i still try to talk about mental health and mental illness often because that stigma is still there . i want people to understand that while everyone has mental health , not everyone struggles with mental illness , and you can t compare a small bout of sadness to chronic depression .","274023":"when i first started working , i was a minimum wage cashier at a drug store . i worked in that position for a while before being promoted a few times , but i stayed with the drug store for years .","274024":"no , i m not a religious person .","274025":"i m not really concerned with having romantic relationships at the moment , so it isn t something that s in the forefront of my mind .","274026":"i haven t watched it and i m definitely not planning on watching it . i stumbled upon a small clip of one of the scenes on twitter that auto played while i was scrolling , and it was so wrong and disgusting . i can t imagine actually sitting through an entire movie of that .","274027":"i really hope you re not suggesting that i stop taking medication or going to therapy in favor of eating well and exercising .","274028":"if my medication and therapy sessions weren t effective , then i wouldn t have been taking them for nearly four years , lol . if i didn t have these things in my life and if i didn t seek professional treatment when i was , then i would be dead .","274029":"i wrote an essay a few years ago regarding my experiences with depression and people who have romanticized it over the years because i was so frustrated with how quick others are to be like , yeah at least you learned x out of it ! no i didn t learn anything from being depressed , s icidal , and hurting myself for nearly a decade . i was in pain and wanted to d e , and there s nothing redeeming or beautiful about that .","274030":"i think it s appalling for so many different reasons , i wouldn t be able to even list them all . not only is the actual filming and production of the movie problematic because they re children and tbh , those parents should be condemned too for subjecting those children to this , but the actual movie will only teach children that these types of behaviors are okay , that they ll continue to be s xualized , and and will gain positive responses from being s xualized . the idea of consent is lost , and that s very troubling .","274031":"no , i ve been taking medication and going to weekly therapy sessions to handle my mental illnesses . they work for the most part , it s just environmental things around me that trigger my more extreme responses .","274032":"at this point , i just want to live independently by myself most likely in an apartment , i don t need anything grand , adopt a lot of animals , progress forward in my career , get a better handle on my mental health , and write a book .","274033":"no , lol . my life would be x easier if i wasn t mentally ill . there are no redeeming qualities to having a mental illness , the symptoms are ever present and have absolutely wrecked havoc on me and my life .","274034":"my psychiatrist sees patients on sundays .","274035":"when everything first started happening , i was coping very poorly with covid . i was terrified that i was going to catch it , or my family or friends were going to catch it , so i took the protocol very seriously and it also affected my mental health in light of my paranoia and anxiety . i started working from home mid march , and i m still working from home now in september . now that it s been several months and things seem to be getting better covid wise , my worry about the virus has lessened , but my mental health is still on the decline .","274036":"tomorrow , i m planning on running a few errands during the day before relaxing in the afternoon evening . then on sunday , i have a doctor s appointment .","274037":"i don t like swimming pools in general , they sorta freak me out because i can t imagine how much bacteria is circulating in them . dozens upon dozens of people use swimming pools every day public ones , at least , the idea makes me uncomfortable .","274038":"yes , i absolutely adore the cold weather ! ! i prefer it over warm or hot weather .","274039":"i haven t been to many places at all , even within the united states . therefore , i don t have a basis upon which i can make a decision . i would have to visit more places to come to a real conclusion .","274040":"idk , i m pretty desensitized to most things . i suppose one of the more common things that can make me cringe is the thought of having your fingernails ripped off .","274041":"i ve never tried a fruit that i absolutely hated , but i don t really like pineapple very much .","274042":"i believe that s a pretty cynical way to look at it , but nevertheless , we have been taught things from a very young age that does skew the truth united states history , for example . that doesn t really mean your entire existence is a lie , but i can see where the perspective comes from .","274043":"i don t believe i have , actually ! ! i just typically order food from a restaurant specializing in whichever cuisine i want , i ve never been to a fusion restaurant before .","274044":"of course evolution is scientifically accurate , and students should know the science behind evolution even if they attend a religious school , because i believe the science should also be taught alongside the religious belief .","274045":"i m not picky with my pizza , so just cheese and sometimes pepperoni is fine by me . i just actually ate a slice of cold pizza for dinner , rofl .","274046":"i left the house a few nights ago to pick up some things at i wanted drinks and munchie food . i m going out again tomorrow to grab some toilet paper and other household necessities . my area is still following quarantine guidelines , i . e . wearing a mask in stores , restaurants are only allowing a certain percentage of patrons in at a time , schools are beginning to open but are closing abruptly because of cases , etc etc .","274047":"i have zero idea what this is supposed to mean .","274048":"no , none of my social media accounts are kept in secret .","274049":", that s depression baby .","274050":"thank you , i appreciate this message ! ! aw .","274051":"fake things on a day to day basis .","274052":"no . they can go into remission , but that doesn t mean it s cured .","274053":"i m maintaining them as well as i can at the moment . i have depression , anxiety , and borderline personality disorder which might actually be bipolar disorder , idk yet .","274054":"yes , i m on four different medications and i also see a therapist .","274055":"girl interrupted .","274056":"? ? ? so some legitimate questions would be nice .","274057":"no , i welcome the idea of death .","274058":"the misspelled version of fuck .","274059":"my mental health .","274060":"i have a doctor s appointment on monday , but other than that , nothing .","274061":"winona ryder .","274062":"my roommate made me laugh earlier , but i don t remember the exact situation .","274063":"lately my forms of self care have been playing video games , journaling , sleeping , smoking weed , and drinking alcohol granted the last two aren t healthy , but whatever .","274064":"i m open about it to close friends and i ve talked about it on my social media accounts , but i never brought it up at work before . some of my coworkers know including my supervisor , but i never felt the need to bring it up to management or anything .","274065":"eh , not really . i knew i wanted to go into writing , but there are several different industries where writing is prevalent . i took a lot of psychology and sociology courses , so for a split second , i debated on going into research . however , i graduated college with a bachelor s degree in communications , so i could apply my skills in virtually any industry . i just happened to find a job first in the legal field , and then now , in the publishing field .","274066":"yes , i consider that one of my greatest assets . even though my mental health sometimes gets in the way of my ability to work , i do have a strong work ethic and have always established myself as a top person regardless of which job i ve had .","274067":"i usually play as women characters , i . e . i made my skyrim character a woman and then i also loved playing as evie in assassin s creed syndicate .","274068":"left leaning , for the most part .","274069":"hi friends , my inbox is nearly empty so i d appreciate some questions . it ll also help distract me from my negative feelings","274070":"i believe in souls to a certain extent , yes . i ve seen lifelessness where the object doesn t appear to have a soul anymore , and it s crushing to realize . i also believe that when we die , our body may perish but our souls carry on , as our souls are created from energy and energy cannot be destroyed .","274071":"i m not really sure how to answer this questions besides to state the obvious you should be good to most people , as long as they didn t warrant something bad happening to them which i admit is subjective , but it is what it is .","274072":"this has been asked to me so many times that i m beginning to think it s a fetish .","274073":"i don t tend to screw up royally , but i do make mistakes here and there that i try to amend immediately so that other people don t notice especially regarding work , lol .","274074":"honestly , terrible . i feel horrible right now , and it s been like this since around am so around hours . i was crying the entire morning and couldn t focus on my work , so i clocked out at noon and cried in bed for an hour before finally being able to fall asleep . i slept for three hours and had a nostalgic dream about my ex , which made me feel even worse when i woke up . my roommate came home shortly thereafter , and we talked for a bit and he told me that our friend who admitted themselves to the hospital is getting out tomorrow , and they re coming over tomorrow afternoon . so i m looking forward to talking to them and seeing how they feel . i m drinking disaronno right now , and i m debating on either trying to write something creatively or play video games .","274075":"cont . . . in conclusion , bpd sucks lmao . i m religious so the only thing i ve been able to rly do is pray to god to let his will be done allow me to feel at peace with the outcome , but the situation still makes me incredibly anxious bc i can t cope with the thought of us never speaking again . i understand , and no need to thank me i m here if you or anyone else needs to talk , and i m happy to provide my support and opinion . you re in a difficult situation no doubt , and i understand the bpd part of it although honestly , i think my therapist is leaning more towards bipolar disorder at this point , idk what s going on . i m also attached to my ex to the point where idk what i would do if he wasn t in my life at all , i can t imagine a life without him even in a friend context .","274076":"ugh , i feel this hardcore . i m attached to my close friend , and surprisingly enough , my supervisor . and i m still somewhat attached to my ex , but i guess my feelings are a lot stronger than i initially thought because i keep having dreams about him . ugh . you shouldn t let your loneliness lead you into an uncomfortable place , though . i know it s difficult , but try to compartmentalize your feelings and understand that this friendship relationship shouldn t supplement your loneliness , especially if you don t think your feelings other than the attachment will go anywhere . you need to preserve your own happiness first and foremost .","274077":"you re not dumb for feeling the way that you re feeling . i understand the confusion and your worry that you re going to get hurt . i suppose my advice would be to take each day as it comes and try not to focus heavily on the future , because like he said , the future is unpredictable and that can go both ways .","274078":"i mean , technically it s legal but i think it s a bit odd considering both people are in very different stages of their lives . i can t imagine there being any common factors involved besides surface level interests and whatnot .","274079":"cont . . . in common . in my heart , i feel we won t end up together . still , i m extremely attached due to bpd when we didn t talk before , i was miserable obsessing over him . what do you think i should do ? i feel like this is torture lol . i m sorry you re going through this . i mean . . . personally , if i thought something was going nowhere with someone , i would cut them out . but i understand the feeling of attachment because i m currently very much attached to a close friend of mine not the same thing , but still , and i could never imagine them not being in my life . is there any way you can be honest with them about these feelings you re having , both the negative and positive ones ? it might provide you with a sense of direction and some closure .","274080":"it s not at the top of my list , but it would be nice to visit the coliseum and other typical tourist y attractions .","274081":"i ve never been to italy before , so i honestly wouldn t know .","274082":"my own fear of failure and disappointment in myself .","274083":"i d probably choose britain out of those three options . i ve always wanted to visit london .","274084":"teleportation , to be able to cast a spell on myself and transport myself to a different place without needing to drive anywhere .","274085":"i m depressed , mildly s icidal , and i want to hurt myself .","274086":"i don t tend to eat anything after pm , tbh . the only times i tend to have snacks after dinner are when i ve been drinking , and i usually go for some carb filled snacks , like chips or cheetos .","274087":"anywhere between pm and am , haha . it ranges depending on how i m feeling .","274088":"today , i woke up around am .","274089":"i m not in love .","274090":"i had a mental breakdown in the middle of working earlier this morning because of some texts i received from my parents , and then i clocked out of work early , laid in bed and cried for an hour , then fell asleep for three hours . i feel worse now than i did before . i m so distraught and defeated and depressed , and i just want to drink smoke myself into oblivion .","274091":"just tell them straight out and don t try to beat around the bush or sugarcoat it . people appreciate honesty when it comes to those types of things , and it s easier on your part to just say it rather than make a grand spectacle of it .","274092":"wap by cardi b and megan thee stallion . death bed coffee for your head by powfu . someone you loved by lewis capaldi . how do you sleep ? by sam smith . daisy by ashnikko .","274093":"you should have sought mental health treatment earlier . there s nothing wrong with how you feel . it s only going to get worse as you get older .","274094":"i want to try authentic ramen .","274095":"unfortunately , i don t read historical non fiction novels .","274096":"within your mind .","274097":"hearing that my friend checked herself into the hospital for s icidal ideation , into a hospital known for making people feel worse coming out than coming in . also my own thoughts that i m so sick and done with everything that i wonder if i should go to the hospital myself .","274098":"yeah , i m impulsive and spontaneous and i tend to make plans last night depending on my mood . i m also quick to cancel plans last minute too .","274099":"video games aren t exactly a good source of information .","274100":"gotta love having a meltdown in the middle of work , causing you to clock out early and lay in bed crying for nearly an hour .","274101":"sushi .","274102":"? ? ? i m not sure what you re getting at here .","274103":"most of the time , no .","274104":"i seldom wear makeup .","274105":"i like personalized questions about my life , my interests , my hobbies , music , mental health , etc etc .","274106":"most of the time , my highest expectation is to excel at my job without my mental health getting in the way of me achieving my goals and results . sometimes it can be a bit unrealistic , as when i m stressed my symptoms come out more , and often times i need to leave early or call out just so i can get my mental health in line .","274107":"tamriel .","274108":"i m not a huge fan of the beatles anymore , so no . i used to like them a lot when i was a teenager , and across the universe was actually one of my favorite movies .","274109":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","274110":"spotify ! ! i just recently got spotify premium , and i honestly have no idea why i didn t do this sooner considering i listen to music every day .","274111":"i d go so far as to say that most people don t require makeup . however , it s a very fun art form and there s nothing wrong with people wearing makeup .","274112":"i don t really do either , tbh . i don t borrow money from others , and other people don t ask to borrow money from me either .","274113":"i dislike making people wait for me , so i usually end up being the one waiting for other people to get ready , haha .","274114":"my own . hence why i said my own expectations and not other people s expectations .","274115":"my own expectations .","274116":"i don t have an iphone .","274117":"sharing knowledge , support , and positive thoughts to others on whichever platform you re using , instead of being a troll and spreading misinformation and hatred .","274118":"work hard , play hard .","274119":"both , depending on how you use it . you can own a pistol and keep it in your home for self defense should anyone break in , and you d be protecting yourself and your family . however , people most often times use guns for nefarious reasons , and use them to kill people with ill intent .","274120":"last month , i sought out a new therapist even though i was terrified to do so . i had been with my former therapist for more than two years , so the idea of seeing someone new was daunting .","274121":"i m excited to drink my gfuel in the morning to get my daily dose of caffeine .","274122":"no , i haven t . my supervisor is extremely nice and understanding , and she s honestly the best boss i ve ever had . even though my bosses in my other jobs were terrible , i never told them off because i needed those jobs and was afraid to lose them .","274123":"inadequate home lives and the desire to inflict pain upon others that they are feeling themselves .","274124":"ask a physician .","274125":"i experience these feelings on a weekly basis , haha . i get so caught up in work , in my interpersonal relationships , in politics , etc etc . , that i always feel the need to escape from everything . that s why i like video games so much i m escaping into the game .","274126":"i don t really know of many , but hansel and gretal always appealed to me because of its dark subject matter .","274127":"video games , true crime , conspiracy theories , medieval torture devices , music , alcohol , writing and literature , psychology and sociology , politics , art , and photography .","274128":"nah , i don t think any of my goals are unusual . they re pretty typical .","274129":"i get headaches when i stare at my computer screen for too many hours .","274130":"i like playing poker and cards against humanity , ahah . i also like parcheesi when it comes to board games .","274131":"i mean . . . it s a weird circumstance , but i m sure plenty of people have done it before with no issue . i can imagine that as long as the ex is okay and on good terms with both people , there wouldn t be much wrong with it .","274132":"i m watching the new season of ancient aliens that just came out on netflix , i m drinking a delicious beer , my window is open and the cold air is flowing in , and i m overall in a content mood despite all of the chaos going on rn .","274133":"i m pretty sure there aren t any restaurants in my town that can give a romantic dinner , rofl .","274134":"i usually just cut those people out of my life , tbh .","274135":"i watch netflix pretty often , and i haven t had poptarts in about a year or so .","274136":"i can t decide between my vape pen or my weed pen . . . lmao .","274137":"yeah , i was lucky in that i had the money to pay for it at the time , but it really hurt my bank account . rofl .","274138":"i ve honestly just been working a lot , and in my spare time , i ve been playing video games and trying to do some art photography and drawing . i also started smoking weed at night to quell my anxiety , decrease my drinking habits , and aid in my sleep . it s been working pretty well so far .","274139":"i went to the courts and talked to a judge , and she knocked it down to zero points on my license . however , i had to pay a fine .","274140":"i had a really frustrating emotional day . my work computer was having technical difficulties this morning , which caused me to not work for over an hour because the it department was trying to figure out the problem . the problem wasn t even fixed , and the hard drive might have to be replaced . sigh . i also found out that a close friend of mine admitted themselves to the hospital for s icidal ideation , and i feel so helpless . i just hope the hospital helps them , because i ve heard a lot of stories of people going to that particular hospital here and leaving worse off than they started .","274141":"i enjoy reading . however , i haven t really had the attention span to actually finish a book lately . i ve tried reading three books over the past few months , and i haven t finished any of them .","274142":"i m sure i did , but i can t remember for the life of me what it was about .","274143":"i worked from am to pm , and then i was talking to my roommate for a little while . i just took my meds , turned on the television , and grabbed a beer .","274144":"i would personally confront the problem with a manager supervisor , but that s just me . however , if it s a very hostile work environment which is deterring you from enjoying your job , perhaps it s time to find a new job .","274145":"yeah , it was a hefty one because i was going mph over the speed limit . lmao .","274146":"no , i m exhausted and i look horrible today . i m probably not going to post any more videos for the rest of the day either .","274147":"relationships aren t useless . i m just not interested in entering a new relationship right now .","274148":"you re allowed to keep working here as long as it s under a certain amount salary wise . a lot of people retire and act as a consultant for whatever industry they re in for extra money while still getting their retirement benefits .","274149":"from my understanding , people who choose to retire can obtain social security benefits for retirement depending on how long they worked and the credits they ve accrued over the years it also depends on how much money you ve made throughout your career . the average age of retirement for people in the united states is around years old , but people can choose to retire earlier or later than that .","274150":"not at all .","274151":"oh goodness . lmao .","274152":"i ve already been in love and i m still getting over that relationship . i have no intentions on dating at the moment .","274153":"no , i m not interested in anyone .","274154":"you evidently have no idea how retirement works , lmao . why are you so mad about this .","274155":"i mean , i m not interested in anyone at the moment so evidently not .","274156":"i wouldn t be able to put a number to it , haha .","274157":"i like black and pinto beans , yes .","274158":"i believe so , back when i was in middle school high school .","274159":"no , i don t like nuts . i m also not a big fan of chocolate either .","274160":"how is that ageist ? it s the most commonly agreed upon age in most places , which is why people usually retire between years old .","274161":"no , elderly is usually reserved for people and older .","274162":"no , i m not .","274163":"it s just after am , haha . but i m extremely frustrated . there was an issue with my work computer , so now the it company is trying to fix the problem and i ve just been sitting here waiting for over minutes . sigh .","274164":"i ve never played gears of war , so halo it is . i was playing halo last night , actually .","274165":"i ve always used xbox consoles .","274166":"play video games and do art .","274167":"i have no idea what i m doing .","274168":"for most people , yeah .","274169":"that all depends on the parent . some parents would forgive that and still love their child .","274170":"yeah , i do . i believe a parent s love for their child can be unconditional .","274171":"i m starting to get over him and i ve realized that he needs to mature a bit before entering another serious relationship . i don t feel jealous of her because i m learning a lot from the breakup , and i think we both needed this .","274172":"i have one brother , but we re not close .","274173":"not anymore , no .","274174":"my own prom and then my ex s prom .","274175":"yeah , i actually went to two senior proms , lol .","274176":"ask me questions , friends","274177":"lately i ve been watching and re watching the movies heathers , sweeney todd , and les miserables .","274178":"i m just perusing social media and listening to music at the moment .","274179":"done heroin .","274180":"i think it would be interesting to shadow a forensic anthropologist .","274181":"there is definitely stigma surrounding toxic masculinity and men s mental health , meaning that men are conditioned to not express or feel emotion , be more violent , etc etc . , and in turn that makes underlying mental illnesses go unnoticed which is why more men die from s icide .","274182":"one single quality in a person isn t enough for me to love them . it has to be a combination of qualities , how well our chemistry is , if i m comfortable enough around them to talk to them about sensitive topics , how accepting open minded they are , etc etc .","274183":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","274184":"in most circumstances , yes . i just get vibes about certain people that tells me not to trust them , and then eventually my feelings are verified .","274185":"honestly , in most cases i support vigilante justice . the justice system in the united states is absolutely horrid and doesn t protect victims and survivors , and sometimes people do take matters into their own hands to serve justice for themselves and the ones they love . i see nothing wrong with that .","274186":"drinking wine when i m sad , expecting it to make me feel better , but it only leads to mental breakdowns and crying fits . lmaoo .","274187":"no , i ve never been interested in the final fantasy series . i have a lot of friends and coworkers who love it , though .","274188":"hell is empty and all the devils are here .","274189":"no , i don t believe enough is being done to not only combat against global warming but also to even raise awareness of how dire the situations are . look at the widespread fires in the united states , south america , and africa these are all culprits of global warming to a certain extent , and it s absolutely horrifying . weather patterns are getting more and more severe throughout the year as well .","274190":"i never have before , but i m very interested in trying it ! !","274191":"thank you ! ! i appreciate it .","274192":"i don t believe it s being taken seriously enough in the united states , which is why cases are constantly rising fluctuating depending on where you live . once some restaurants and bars started opening , people flocked to them and pretended like everything was back to normal again , when that is far from the truth . i do my due diligence by wearing a mask , social distancing , washing my hands often , staying home and isolating , etc etc .","274193":"well yeah , otherwise i would go into more detail about the problems , lol . i ve always been open about the ab se but i keep most of the details to myself .","274194":"most of has been a blur to me , honestly . the only good things really to come out of the year thus far is starting therapy again and being able to work from home . other than that , my mental health has been on the decline since the year started probably due to covid and all of the chaos going on the world , plus problems in my own life . my moods are sporadic and spontaneous , and i recently came down from a week long manic episode . now i m fairly sad most nights unless i m high .","274195":"yes , there are plenty of issues within my family .","274196":"my weekend wasn t bad at all . i didn t do much on saturday at all from what i can remember besides getting very drunk and high lmao , but sunday i went out to eat brunch with my roommate which was fun .","274197":"i like both of them , it all depends on where you re trying to order from .","274198":"i d probably watch the movie first and then attempt at reading the book . i haven t had the attention span to really read an entire book lately , though .","274199":"i ve only ever seen the movie the parasite , but i enjoyed it a lot .","274200":"i try to keep my bedroom as clean as possible . it s beneficial for my mental health when everything is organized and there s space for me to move around and breathe .","274201":"most of the time , yes . i usually try to get hours of sleep per night .","274202":"yeah , i ve dealt with a lot of harassment on askfm i just delete the messages at this point , i barely entertain them anymore . askfm is honestly terrible at their reporting blocking system , despite multiple complaints from users who are being harassed on this site . i don t think they ll improve their security measures anytime soon .","274203":"i m not quite sure what you mean by this .","274204":"i oppose the death penalty . i think it s archaic and inhumane , and sorta an easy way out of a crime . it would be much more effective to throw someone in solitary confinement for the rest of their life , make them suffer .","274205":"yes , i wholeheartedly agree with you . i know several people whose computers phones should be ip blocked because they constantly make new pages even after being banned solely to harass other users . however , ip bans can only do so much , and there are easy ways to get around them unfortunately .","274206":"i like the aspect of being asked questions and answering them in the hopes that i ll either bring something to light for someone or educate them depending on the question , obviously . i also like reading my friends answers and learning more about them .","274207":"mental health , writing , video games , music , movies television , and the arts .","274208":"my family and i aren t on the best of terms . which doesn t bother me at all tbh , i would much rather them be out of my life completely at this point .","274209":"this is going to sound weird , but my next therapy appointment . she and i have been making a lot of progress lately , and our session last night was very eye opening and validating to me . she brought up the fact that i dissociate a lot without me even mentioning it first , just based on what i ve told her about my memory lapses and memory loss of when i was a child .","274210":"no , i m single .","274211":"definitely not , lol . i ve never had a good relationship with my family .","274212":"i don t have the disposable income to donate to charities .","274213":"no , i ve never been interested in the social work profession . i m not exactly a people person .","274214":"linkin park is probably my overall favorite band . these days , i ve also been listening to two feet , grandson , nf , mike shinoda , juice wrld , ashnikko , watsky , starset , and korn .","274215":"i wouldn t necessarily say that i m a workaholic , but i take my job very seriously . i don t usually work extra hours outside of my hours per week , though .","274216":"there are plenty of fake people all over the place . if i figure out that someone is not being genuine , then i m not interested in talking to them and i wind up ignoring them .","274217":"no , i have no desire to have someone else pay for things i purchase online . i have my own income .","274218":"i love doing the dishes and doing laundry , haha . i don t mind vacuuming , it s just that my household has this super heavy duty vacuum that s hard for me to navigate and it hurts my back . the chore i hate the most is cleaning the bathroom . especially the bathtub , it hurts my knees so much .","274219":"i tell them directly , i do things for them i . e . buying them things randomly , sending them memes that remind me of them , etc etc , and i try my best to be a good friend and talk on a regular basis .","274220":"both , haha . i like setting tasks and deadlines for myself , but obviously money is extremely important in my life and i need a paycheck to survive .","274221":"i miss the aspect of learning and going to lectures , but i don t miss school itself if that makes sense . i like continuous learning , and sometimes i get the desire to enroll in a few classes at the local community college just for the hell of it .","274222":"no , i don t believe in destiny .","274223":"criminal minds ! ! i haven t even seen the entire show yet , but i always love restarting it from the beginning for nostalgic purposes and watching it season to season .","274224":"hello i m doing well . i finished up with work , ate a delicious dinner , went to to buy some drinks , and now i m drinking a mike s harder lemonade .","274225":"i m not quite sure i understand the question .","274226":"in most cases , yes . there are certain circumstances where honesty may not work out well , though at least in the time being . it really depends on the individual situation .","274227":"both simultaneously , in a sense . i look inward into the present moment more often than ever these days , but i m also moving towards the future . at the same time , however , i do live somewhat in my past because of my therapy sessions and working through unresolved trauma .","274228":"anons just use it as an excuse to try to ask people sexual questions .","274229":"no , i don t .","274230":"work , especially when assignments projects pile up on top of each other .","274231":"yes ! ! it s currently degrees fahrenheit outside i m living for it . i love the cooler weather sm . i don t do anything different during the autumn months , but i try to spend more time outside .","274232":"i have a lot old old friends , so you ll have to be more specific .","274233":"yeah , i ve used doordash and grubhub .","274234":"nah , i d just be a bat .","274235":"do i look like a historian to you .","274236":"you can like someone romantically , but the actual word crush is a bit juvenile .","274237":"i wouldn t say most likely . there are a lot of factors that are involved in the diagnosis of a personality disorder . what you said could even be just a natural personality trait for someone .","274238":"for the most part , yeah .","274239":"no , i don t .","274240":"the . com","274241":"yes , i do prefer the quiet over loud , crowded places .","274242":"i haven t had a crush on someone since i was in high school , lmao .","274243":"it was with a friend of mine .","274244":"nope . it was fun .","274245":"yeah , haha .","274246":"i m pretty content , yet contemplative .","274247":"yeah , i m pretty obsessed with true crime stories , lol .","274248":"briefly in college , yes .","274249":"violence is encouraged and instilled in men from a young age , when that isn t the case for most women .","274250":"yeah , i just like regular cheese or pepperoni pizza .","274251":"i have memory loss . not even just from childhood , but also from a day to day basis . i have to write things down constantly . and my therapist brought up the point that i m likely experiencing a lot of dissociation which i already kinda knew , but could never put the words to it . either way , she s the first professional to ever bring that to light with me . no one else has acknowledged it before . and it feels nice to be heard in that respect , because i feel like dissociation isn t really talked about enough in mental health circles .","274252":"i prefer working in the mornings so that i have the afternoons evenings to myself to relax .","274253":"it was good very productive . i had work and then my therapy session , which raised a lot of questions and answers . my therapist brought up some interesting perspectives and actually validated one of the concerns i ve experienced for years , which is the first time a professional has ever addressed this concern in the years i ve been in mental health treatment . i just finished writing in my journal , and now i m going to open a beer and watch some television .","274254":"yeah , if i order a cheeseburger then i ask for no pickles , onions , ketchup , or mustard . i only like it with the cheese , lettuce , and tomato .","274255":"mental health , video games , music , and art .","274256":"i like the salt bae brand my favorites from them are iced blueberry lemonade and iced red mango .","274257":"i m most content when i m playing video games .","274258":"yeah , i know a few people like that unfortunately .","274259":"years .","274260":"i m running low on toilet paper , so that . lmao .","274261":"definitely not . i have zero hand eye coordination .","274262":"not really , no . restaurants and gyms can only seat capacity i think and we still have to wear masks everywhere . most places are open now , though .","274263":"the .","274264":"i don t remember .","274265":"early age ? i m nearly , lol .","274266":"this big baby has been laying across my lap legs for the past minutes . sorry , can t come back to work . there s a giant kitty preventing me from getting up .","274267":"thank you ! ! so far , my monday has been filled with technical difficulties , fixing spreadsheets , and correcting mistakes in other people s work . so i have a slight headache , but at least i ve kept busy .","274268":"true ! ! i was afraid to play after a while because i d constantly get hit in the fingers with the puck , lmfao .","274269":"the only arcade game i really played was pinball . i also liked air hockey , but idk if that s classified as an arcade game .","274270":"if i didn t have work or anything to do throughout the day , it d probably be difficult for me not to check my phone because of the abundance of free time i d have . i could probably do it if i wanted to , but i d need other activities to occupy myself with for the entire day , lol .","274271":"i ll be one to admit that i know pretty much nothing about politics in other countries .","274272":"depends on which ex , haha . there s only one ex who i d refuse to meet up with . my other two exes are good friends of mine .","274273":"honestly , i feel the same way , lol . i was expecting something like alcohol or drugs . . . not meditation . i m not really going to entertain this anymore . people are always trying to make problems out of nothing and call it something more serious than it actually is .","274274":"i already told you . you can also google it .","274275":"i m not sure if meditation can be classified as an addiction .","274276":"yes , i wholeheartedly agree . it definitely calms me down when i m stressed at work , ahah .","274277":"me too ! ! i have spotify playlists for everything from skyrim and oblivion to the halo franchise and destiny , to the lotr and harry potter , and i also have a game of thrones playlist .","274278":"depends on my mood . lately i ve been listening to a lot of instrumental music i . e . video game , movie , and television soundtracks , alternative rock , nu metal , pop , and rap .","274279":"i just told you how .","274280":"addictions can kill you . if you re not ready to seek help , then that s perfectly okay . but any kind of addiction is harmful for you both mentally and physically , and it also harms your relationships with friends , family , partners , etc etc . it can make you happy in the short term , but in the long term , it s extremely harmful and it s only an instant gratification .","274281":"my roommate picked me up a vape pen the last time he traveled out of state , haha . idk if that counts though , i didn t ask for it or anything so he surprised me with it .","274282":"stopping an addiction is difficult , and usually it s easier if you have a support system and medical intervention , such as a therapist or a psychiatrist who can help you ease off of whatever you re addicted to .","274283":"addiction is a mental illness characterized by a compulsive use of substances or things such as sex or gambling , for example to obtain a level of satisfaction despite the consequences associated with the addiction . people who are addicted to things feel as if they can t live without the substance , and often people go through withdrawals if they stop .","274284":"stop caring about what other people think about you and just put yourself out there . it usually comes easier with time and age .","274285":"i don t think askfm implements shadow bans . it s normal to not receive likes on all of your answers . i wouldn t think too much into it .","274286":"there isn t really a measurement involved because everyone s mental health is different and subjective . that s why there are doctors such as psychiatrists , psychologists , and therapists who help those who struggle with their mental health .","274287":"your health and wellness as it relates to your emotions , personality , and feelings .","274288":"i m seeing likes on your answers . perhaps you re just not getting the notifications .","274289":"yeah , compliments on my appearance in general make me uncomfortable , especially sexually driven statements . i d rather be complimented on my personality and my writing although i don t post my writing on askfm .","274290":"a culmination of both .","274291":"i ve purchased the vip program , as well as a promotion of one or two of my answers .","274292":"out of those examples , i prefer psychological and political questions . however , i don t have much of a larger preference as a whole because i enjoy most of the questions i receive regardless of their theme subject matter . i do like personalized questions the most , things that relate to my own life and interests , and for some reason i like the how are you ? questions because it gives me an opportunity to express my feelings and how my day has been going .","274293":"i had a really weird dream the other night that still sticks out in my mind . it wasn t necessarily a bad dream , but it was very jarring and unexpected .","274294":"i m content with the questions people ask me , but sometimes i wish they were more personalized to my life and interests .","274295":"mostly racing thoughts related to how i feel about myself , my fears and triggers , constant reminders of what i m going to do throughout my day , things i ve done and or need to get done , and a constant loop of music .","274296":"no , i ve only traveled out of the united states once to visit the bahamas .","274297":"yes , although i m not sure if she was my first or not . the memories are a bit hazy , and she didn t reciprocate my feelings , so idk if that would classify as a first love or not .","274298":"i m thankfully very good at saying no , i have no issues with turning people down if i m uncomfortable with something or just simply don t want to do something .","274299":"i can t do it , lol . my mind goes into overdrive and i end up remaining very paranoid for the rest of the night into the next day .","274300":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","274301":"you re asking the totally wrong person this question , rofl . i overthink all the time , even in professional settings which is both a blessing and a curse . the only times my mind slows down are when i m under the influence .","274302":"yes , i most definitely trust my friends more than i trust my family . my relationship with my family is dysfunctional at best , and they ve always been a source of trauma and distress for me .","274303":"hello i m doing fine . like i mentioned in a previous answer a few minutes ago , i m just perusing askfm and going through my inbox before i have to clock into work .","274304":"my longest relationship lasted for around years .","274305":"i ve probably spilled a beer on someone by accident , but i don t recall any particular instances , lol .","274306":"not really , no . i have my own weird reservations about food i . e . most of the time , i don t eat past like or pm , but i m not very picky at all .","274307":"thank you ! ! i hope you are too i woke up super early this morning despite not falling asleep until nearly am , but i strangely feel well rested . i don t have to clock into work for another minutes , so i m perusing my askfm inbox in the meantime .","274308":"i don t really have a fear of germs , thankfully . it was definitely heightened when covid was first happening , like around march to april , but i ve calmed down a bit since then .","274309":"simple . i don t care for glamorous or fancy things .","274310":"i can sleep pretty much anywhere .","274311":"this question makes me sick to my stomach , ugh .","274312":"i guess i would rather be able to see my own future , considering i shouldn t really be interested in other people s lives futures . however , the idea of seeing anyone s future , including my own , is a bit daunting to me .","274313":"the feeling of happiness , much like any other emotion , is a chemical reaction from a scientific standpoint . however , that can be triggered as a result of the presence of positive emotions , if there is an absence of negative emotions , and a person s satisfaction with their life . happiness is much more complex than people realize , as it ranges in intensity and everyone s experiences with happiness are subjective .","274314":"this is askfm . you can ask me questions if you d like , but that s pretty much it . not to mention the fact that you re anonymous .","274315":"i have no interest in making new friends .","274316":"definitely not , i think it s absolutely disgusting .","274317":"this may or may not answer this question , but it s the only thing i can think of i started smoking weed when i was years old , and i did it pretty much all the time until i was years old . although i graduated high school with honors , my habit became too much during my first year of college , and i ended up failing two classes . fast forward to today up until last week , i only smoked maybe once every months because i was cautious about how i would be able to handle it . i finally decided to buy a pen for myself last week , and i ve been smoking every night before about two hours before i go to bed , and i get the most restful sleep ever . it s definitely helped me a lot , and it s also helped decrease my alcohol intake as well .","274318":"yes , i saw a therapist for three years before she quit her job last february . i recently started seeing a new therapist last month .","274319":"my day has been fine i haven t done much besides sleep , go out to brunch , and check up on social media , lol .","274320":"that doesn t mean that you re not as deserving of respect or communication or loyalty in a friendship as you are in a relationship . your friends shouldn t make you feel like sh t about yourself .","274321":"if your friends are making you feel like a bad friend when you haven t done anything wrong , and they make you feel as if you re annoying them when you haven t done anything to warrant those feelings then those friends obviously are bad friends . friendship is supposed to be mutual and you re supposed to life each other up and be each other s support system . they re not supposed to be a source of distress .","274322":"perhaps you simply don t have the right friends .","274323":"i would tell them to do what makes them comfortable and to never be afraid to ask questions as to how to be a better friend . communication is key .","274324":"i m not great , but i m not terrible either . i also haven t swam in years .","274325":"no , i just said i wasn t interested in dating .","274326":"no , i ve never desired to be in a long distance relationship . i d rather have someone with whom i can spend time on a regular basis .","274327":"i m not interested in dating at the moment , especially not long distance .","274328":"ask me questions , friends","274329":"from what i remember , my week was filled with ups and downs . i have everything written in my journal so that i can talk about it with my therapist tomorrow .","274330":"people who talk over others when they re in the middle of speaking . i find it very rude and disrespectful .","274331":"unhealthy coping mechanisms .","274332":"it s been good so far ! ! my roommate i went to grab brunch this afternoon , which was really yummy .","274333":"yeah , i like the neighborhood that i live in . my neighbors are all extremely nice .","274334":"quietly with close friends .","274335":"yeah , this has happened to me on more occasions than i can count .","274336":"it ll always have meaning to me . regardless , a tattoo doesn t have to have meaning in order for it to be a great tattoo .","274337":"? ? ? it says death before decaf . i m still drinking caffeine every day , rofl .","274338":"they ll delete innocent questions answers but will refuse to ip block certain people from making accounts , it makes no f cking sense .","274339":"i usually put small amounts of sugar in my coffee , but i haven t regularly drank coffee in about weeks .","274340":"yeah , you would technically be neuroatypical then . i wouldn t involve yourself in all of the terms and catchphrases related to all of this though , there are so many micro divisions of the neuroatypical community that it becomes somewhat weird , and people often ascribe themselves to terms and identities that don t necessarily relate to them as a result . i just stick with neuroatypical because it s an umbrella term that s fairly understood in most circles .","274341":"i believe so , yes . typically , someone who is described as neuroatypical is a person who has a developmental , intellectual , or cognitive disorder , or mental illness es . it s mostly used by people who have autism or are mentally ill .","274342":"hopefully neurotypical with their life and emotions held together , haha .","274343":"i d consider what they say , but approach it with caution . most people who are oppressive in that fashion can also easily hide it , so i would watch them cautiously and wait to see if anything slips out . on the contrary , depending on my mood , i might flat out just ask them , lmaoo .","274344":"singing , most definitely . i ve always loved music with a passion and i would have become a vocalist if i had a good voice .","274345":"through the terrors that the earth unleashes upon us through climate change .","274346":"the idea sounds scary and daunting to me , lol . i can only imagine that something could go wrong .","274347":"no , i don t believe in love at first sight . i believe you can t truly love a person unless you know them on a deeper level , and that doesn t exist with people you ve met for only one time . you can have an infatuation with them , for sure , but whatever feelings of love you might have are actually lust and your expectations of what that person might be instead of who they actually are .","274348":"i used to be a party person until the past few years when i ve calmed down on the constant partying and settled down . now i m totally a homebody , haha . covid has really brought out the agoraphobia in me albeit it s rather mild and i seldom leave the house these days .","274349":"thank you , i appreciate it","274350":"not really , no . i get pretty restless when i have to stay in one spot for too long .","274351":"i ve been having a bagel with cream cheese every morning for the past three days because my roommate bought a dozen bagels the other day , lol .","274352":"thank you my day yesterday was rather terrible , tbh . i feel a bit better today , but then again i also slept most of yesterday afternoon night so i m well rested right now .","274353":"i thought i had lost my vape the other day , but it appeared under the folds of my comforter on my bed , haha . i must have put it there without realizing it when i woke up and then only found it once i made my bed .","274354":"i don t believe i m going to have children , so this is a hypothetical question for me . i d probably find out the sex of the child prior to its birth , however , just so i can plan accordingly and prepare myself .","274355":"i wouldn t know , i haven t tried doing that in years .","274356":"i mean , that doesn t much matter when i only send a question out every few weeks or so and you ll be clogging my feed with answers that i can t understand everyday , lol .","274357":"i like following people whose answers are mostly interesting and thoughtful , they put the time into answering questions depending on the subject matter . i also follow people who are my friends , as well as people who also receive interesting questions because i m curious as to what their answers are .","274358":"chocolate chip cookie dough and or green tea ice cream .","274359":"good morning thank you , i ll try . i m supposed to go out to brunch with my roommate later today it s only am where i live , so we ll see what happens .","274360":"i think they re just about the same at the moment , i ve been getting a lot more public questions because the public accounts who follow me have been asking a lot more questions lately .","274361":"my best friend , my ex , and my roommate .","274362":"okay . i still don t want to send questions to you , though . that would require me to follow you and i don t follow accounts whose answers aren t in english considering i can t understand a language other than english .","274363":"courtneyuwu manicmartyrdom kittiemeowsie celinem thebeeskneesgirl","274364":"probably too much time , smh . i like my morning routine of logging into askfm on my laptop and answering questions well , on the weekends at least , which sometimes lasts a few hours if i have nothing else to do .","274365":"no , i only ask questions to a few people whom i follow here on askfm , it s not as if i deliberately go out and send spam to everyone or anything .","274366":"yeah , that s very sh tty . if they re fully aware of the things your ex did to you that were ab sive and they still remain friends with your ex , then that s kinda a slap in the face to you . nobody should remain friends with ab sers .","274367":"i don t really have any guilty pleasure foods that are a go to . if i m hungry , then i ll just look to see what s small around the house and go from there . not enough to fill me , but enough to take that edge off .","274368":"i ask questions on a very rare occasion , usually once every few weeks or so .","274369":"don t think too much into it , and just ask them . if you dwell on the what ifs then you ll terrify yourself even more . people aren t as scary and unapproachable as you may think , and sometimes it s easier to just take the leap .","274370":"i wonder why in the hell someone would want to copy me , considering i m not an ideal person to look up to . i also wonder why they feel so poorly about themselves that they feel the need to adopt a new identity .","274371":"the past hours have been pretty sh tty , ngl . i m hoping today is better .","274372":"i didn t , ask actually sent the questions back to my inbox . which is weird but i guess it s because we used the word virgin ? smh .","274373":"that s why i ve always been attracted to the arts in general , tbh . sometimes when i can t feel anything , i ll look at art or music or a film . and i ll feel alive again . and even when i feel too much , doing the same thing kinda channels those emotions into a straight line .","274374":"thank you , and the same for you as well . i known you ve been going through a rough patch so if you need to chat , you have my insta .","274375":"thank you . i m having a bad day , so i m currently high drunk and watching the movie . hopefully i ll feel better .","274376":"yesss ! ! it s so morbid , it s wonderful .","274377":"i thought you d appreciate it , lol .","274378":"i m currently watching the movie adaptation of les miserables that makes me happy .","274379":"salvador dali , when it comes to well known artists . i also follow this artist named dusty ray , who posts his art on instagram . i m obsessed , i want prints of his work so badly .","274380":"evidently i don t care .","274381":"you clearly didn t read what i said . i m also not looking for new friends .","274382":"no .","274383":"i m really upset and finally stopped crying because my friend is checking themselves into the hospital for s icidal thoughts and i felt like i should have been there but i wasn t . i just feel like an as hole and wasn t available when they probably needed it even though they never said anything . idk . i m just upset and trying to cheer myself up with my favorite movies .","274384":"quick travel ! ! lmao .","274385":"all the time .","274386":"someone ask me questions to distract me from sh t going on in my life , i need something to do","274387":"thank you","274388":"thanks ! ! i m actually going to go out and have brunch tomorrow with my roommate and a friend , so i am looking forward to that . nothing better than some avocado toast and eggs with endless mimosas .","274389":"i prefer fish over meat , although sometimes i ll have steak .","274390":"i ve been helping my supervisor out with her programs at work because i ve caught up on all of my work for my own programs thus far , so she s been very grateful for my help .","274391":"i ve been craving lobster raviolis in vodka sauce for ages now , lmaoo .","274392":"i can be both , depending on my mood .","274393":"meh , honestly i just feel like staying home today and soaking in the nice weather out in the backyard while drinking a few beers . because it s the weekend after and it s gorgeous outside , everyone is going to be driving around , and traffic makes me nervous even as a passenger .","274394":"aw , thank you ! !","274395":"evidently my healthy coping mechanisms don t help very much considering i usually resort to unhealthy mechanisms , rofl . although , it does depend on how terrible i m feeling . sometimes talking to my friends helps , but other times it doesn t . my medication has made me stable for the most part , but there will always be things here and there that will set me off . therapy helps as well , but it s only for minutes per week and i ve only been seeing this one particular therapist for a month .","274396":"we just renewed the lease on the house we re renting , so we re still going to be living here until next autumn . after that , however , i don t know where i ll be . i know my roommate wants to eventually move in with his partner , so i ll have to start looking for options of my own .","274397":"eh , somewhat ? lmao . if i get another raise within the next year , i could probably afford an apartment on my own instead of living with roommates . so that may happen next year after this current lease is up . at that point , i can hopefully adopt a few pets .","274398":"life isn t meant to be easy , and if you take the easy route , then you may not be satisfied with your life because you were never proactive enough to take risks and chances .","274399":"yes , my area is very prone to blizzards actually . we usually get one per year , at the very least although this past winter was very mild .","274400":"i wear glasses every day , lol .","274401":"no , i don t have a criminal record . i probably should , though .","274402":"i managed to sleep in until am today , which was amazing .","274403":"tbh , i don t even know where i ll be living in a year from now , let alone five years from now .","274404":"i m not interested in meeting new people , haha .","274405":"yeah , i can be a very sentimental person . often , i also take things to heart a bit too deeply and i m very much controlled by my emotions .","274406":"i was in school .","274407":"normally something flavorful and crunchy , like cheez its or chips .","274408":"well i just woke up about an hour ago , so today hasn t been very productive . yesterday , however , was a fairly productive day . i worked my regular shift , then i hung out with my roommate and his girlfriend for a few hours before having dinner and watching a hockey game with my roommate s family . after they left , i watched a movie for a little bit and then went to bed .","274409":"i haven t dated in over years , so i honestly don t know . lmaoo .","274410":"i feel ugly on a basis , so i ve just learned to continue on with my life despite those feelings .","274411":"i m doing fine , although i m a bit sad and disoriented . my friend invited me to take a road trip with her to connecticut today , but i m not sure if i m feeling up to it .","274412":"playing video games is probably my favorite hobby rn . it s nice to just escape into a game for a while , complete objectives , and have a sense of satisfaction with what you re doing .","274413":"no , i don t answer numbers that are unfamiliar to me .","274414":"all of my scars are self inflicted , so .","274415":"i wish it could be converted into real money , rofl . the purpose is that you can spend the coins on various perks in the askfm marketplace , such as getting vip status or promoting a post or seeing your stats .","274416":"it s been fine , thanks for asking .","274417":"no , i try not to engage in conversation with random strangers irl .","274418":"i totally forgot that this band existed . https www . youtube . com watch ? v kntceprts e","274419":"no , the only j rock band i ve ever listened to has been dir en grey .","274420":"cheers ! ! i m currently drinking wine , but i ll probably switch over to beer later .","274421":"my supervisor said that the people in the shipping department of my job can mail me copies of the publication i ve worked on over the past year , so i don t have to physically go to the office to grab my copies ! !","274422":"the feeling of being drunk , at the moment at least .","274423":"it was in the s today where i live , lmaoo . i usually just drink hot coffee on cold days .","274424":"i m five feet tall .","274425":"wishing well by juice wrld . https www . youtube . com watch ? v c i unuukui","274426":"duck hunt on the nes .","274427":"no , i don t like peanut butter .","274428":"i don t wear makeup of the time .","274429":"that s nice and all , but that won t happen , lmaoo .","274430":"it can be complicated at times , but if you re with the right person , then things will be easier to deal with .","274431":"the pouring rain outside of my window .","274432":"no , i have no intentions of meeting anyone else from askfm besides maybe or other people whom i ve followed for years , which doesn t include you . i m not busting your chops . i m being serious .","274433":"? ? ? if you re referring to yourself , then you re poorly mistaken .","274434":"i don t go out of my way to cross the street , but i ll distance myself from them by walking a few feet over to the left or right wherever the grass is .","274435":"i hear an inner voice within my head saying the thoughts out loud to myself , sometimes it s louder or quieter than others . my innermost thoughts are quiet , while my conscious thoughts are louder .","274436":"yes ! ! i met courtneyuwu in real life after talking to her for a few years . we met here on askfm .","274437":"yeah , but i always paid it back as soon as possible .","274438":"i m doing all right at the moment . i m listening to music drinking a glass of wine , and basically waiting for my roommate and his girlfriend to come home so we can start up a campfire in the backyard hopefully the skies stay clear .","274439":"aw , thank you ! ! i m off on the weekends , so i m looking forward to simply relaxing . i m possibly having a campfire in the backyard tonight with my roommate and his girlfriend , which should be a lot of fun .","274440":"lol , thank you ! ! perhaps i will try it one day , but lately i ve been leaning more towards red and purple .","274441":"the only color i ve never tried is green .","274442":"no , i don t . i m terrible at keeping plants alive .","274443":"i can dance , but that doesn t mean i can dance well .","274444":"yeah , it brings back so many memories . the tony hawk games were the first major games i played on a console , so it was incredibly nostalgic to play them again . i never lost the talent either , lol . the buttons are still the same as they were years ago , so it all came flooding back to me .","274445":"no , you can easily get it in any grocery store .","274446":"both , which is why it s both rn . lmaoo .","274447":"chocolate chip cookie dough and or green tea ice cream .","274448":"i prefer just plain raspberries .","274449":"no , i don t . i don t like her music .","274450":"i ve been playing the new tony hawk almost every night , lol .","274451":"hang gliding sounds like a lot of fun , as well as ziplining ! !","274452":"what is your passion in life ? what would your perfect day look like ?","274453":"crossword puzzles ? lmao .","274454":"i don t have a lucky number .","274455":"i normally set goals in my life and work to achieve them , mainly in professional settings . i believe that life achievements don t come to you just by waiting for them , and you need to put the work in for something of value to come to you .","274456":"honestly , i think cancel culture is silly in most circumstances . a person can be cancelled for something they said or did years ago , even if that person has addressed the issue and rectified their action or perspective of thinking .","274457":"i don t believe in the concept of one soul mate or anything . i believe a person can have several soul mates , in both a platonic and romantic context . just because you haven t had a relationship yet doesn t mean you never will .","274458":"in the next five years , i ll be turning years old . i don t really know where i would be at that point . i try not to think too deeply about the future .","274459":"travel to europe , russia , australia , and new zealand . publish a book . live in an apartment or house independently . adopt lots of pets .","274460":"it doesn t really bother me that i don t know who follows me or not . i wouldn t pay much attention to it anyhow .","274461":"sonnet xvii by pablo neruda .","274462":"no , most people are automatically taller than me to begin with , lol .","274463":"yeah , i am . i need to make a dentist appointment , but i m absolutely terrified .","274464":"every damn day of my life .","274465":"people in general don t confuse me very much .","274466":"cuddle sessions with the kitty .","274467":"a closet , maybe ? i also cracked the screen of an ipad when i first received it several years ago .","274468":"i believe everyone is judgmental to an extent , it s just a matter of being cognizant of that judgment and doing what you can to reverse or rectify that judgment . i ve been judgmental in the past , both for good and bad reasons .","274469":"askfm isn t for everyone , and i know plenty of people who have deactivated for various reasons . do what s best for yourself .","274470":"it was pm three hoursago , i was home working .","274471":"lately i ve been listening to linkin park , ashnikko , two feet , grandson , nf , childish gambino , juice wrld , starset , korn , missio , watsky , and grey daze .","274472":"i don t own any designer clothing , lol .","274473":", coins .","274474":"yeah , that was a pretty popular phone when i was growing up .","274475":"i don t post full body photos on askfm .","274476":"i had three glasses of wine , which made me tipsy . lol . i ve been smoking more instead of drinking alcohol this past week which has been helping ! so now my tolerance is decreasing .","274477":"thanks , i m not sober .","274478":"i disagree . it also isn t anyone else s business what someone s sex life is or isn t .","274479":"strawberries ! !","274480":"am i losing my mind or does this make absolutely zero sense .","274481":"my wardrobe is mainly black , gray , red , and green i think . honestly , i ve been wearing the same , like . . . tank tops and tee shirts for the past six months . i haven t worn any nice looking clothing in a very long time , lmaoo . i prefer solid colors most of the time , but i also have some hoodies and tee shirts with graphics or sayings on them .","274482":"don t you know that if you have a single happy childhood experience , then that resolves all of the trauma you ve endured ? ! lmfao . sorry , i m tipsy and feeling a fit sassy . it s totally true though , i m sure there are some psychiatrists who will try to invalidate past experiences just because you happen to have one or two good memories .","274483":"no , i m a human bean .","274484":"i have zero idea what that word even means .","274485":"i only have one best friend , and she doesn t use askfm .","274486":"yes , i m extremely organized both in my personal and professional lives . i don t like clutter or when things are out of place , it drives my anxiety wild .","274487":"absolutely terrible , tbh .","274488":"tbh , i have a hard time recollecting memories like that too but that s because i have a really poor memory . i know that i have fun when i m with friends , but there has never been any standout moments .","274489":"i m courteous to my coworkers , but i m also precise in what needs to be done . i m not afraid to tell someone that there s a mistake , but i portray it in an encouraging way . i m not afraid to ask my supervisor questions when i m unsure of something because i would rather ask and do it right than be in the dark and screw something up .","274490":"i m not in school , so i don t study .","274491":"i don t like bright rooms , but i don t like them completely dark either . i usually have a lamp or my string lights on not the overhead light . it provides ambient lighting without it being too hard on the eyes .","274492":"ask me some questions , friends . i m trying to stay up until midnight so i can say hi to my roommate s girlfriend when she comes over","274493":"anger is an underlying symptom of a medical condition , or it could simply just be part of someone s personality . anger alone is not a disability , it s just an emotion . if someone s anger is so bad , they likely have underlying mental health conditions that may qualify them for disability benefits if it prevents them from holding a job . but it obviously goes on a case by case basis .","274494":"i use that word sparingly in times when situations really deserve it , but i agree . disabled people are constantly sh t on by society , and it s incredibly horrific , dehumanizing , and sad . it took my roommate s father five years to finally get approved for disability benefits . and that isn t even the longest case i ve seen .","274495":"if i don t like talking about it , why would i bring light to it ? lmao .","274496":"go camping ! ! i ve always wanted to go camping like legit camping , not glamping or whatever , but i haven t had the opportunity to go yet .","274497":"just a small , quaint house that has all of the necessities without being overly glamorous . i like rustic looking decor and things like ambient lights , paintings , tapestries , plants , etc etc .","274498":"the entire disability process and social security administration as a whole is difficult to navigate , and there were so many claimants who were clearly disabled and kept getting denied , especially because judges place too much significance on independent medical examinations imes and vocational experts who have only seen the claimant on one single occasion . even if someone meets a listing basically it s a set of qualifications that a claimant meets to automatically be deemed disabled based on their different symptoms and doctor documentation , judges will still ignore it and deny the claim . some judges are harsher than others , and it s very subjective .","274499":"i don t believe i have one single best day of my life . i have great days and great moments , but none are distinguishable among the others .","274500":"understand that you re not always right and own up to your mistakes as they happen . appreciate small gestures of kindness and things that make you happy , even if temporarily . tell your friends and or family their value to you , it feels nice to show your appreciation for others and for those people to receive that appreciation . do everything in moderation , whether those things are self indulgent in nature or even selfless . there needs to be a balance . listen to your body and mind when it needs to rest .","274501":"i usually have no choice but to face my fears because there s nothing i can do to stop them from approaching . i can be terrified of something , but i ll have no choice but to go through with it anyway , and that s how i ve always dealt with fear .","274502":"i understand the concern of inmates being allowed to use electronics like phones and computers , since it s sometimes used to smuggle drugs into the prison if someone has an outside source . however , i also believe that there are so many people wrongfully imprisoned and they shouldn t even be there in the first place .","274503":"this is going off of what i remember from when i worked for the law firm , it s been three years since i ve worked there which is wild to me , wow . basically , it starts off at the initial application stage , where a claimant can either get approved or denied . if they get denied , then can appeal the decision and choose to go to the hearing stage and appear before a judge . this is when people tend to hire a lawyer or a disability advocate , who builds their case by obtaining medical records and doctor opinions , etc etc . the claimant appears before the judge at the hearing , and the judge issues either an approval or denial . if the claim is denied again , the claimant can appeal the decision again , which will place the case in the appellate circuit depending upon where they live . most approvals come from the appeals courts , actually , because law firms write legal arguments and other documents stating why the judge was wrong and the court of appeals will either approve or deny the claim . at that point , the claimant can either go back to the hearing stage or submit another initial application . it s a very long winded process .","274504":"sex trafficking sites and other things associated with the dark web and the black market .","274505":"i ve held pythons and other snakes before i think they re cute .","274506":"at the moment , probably covid . it s gotten a lot better compared to how things were months ago , but it s still a very real and scary threat .","274507":"yes , i believe it s a bit ignorant to believe that earth is the only planet that can host living things . we don t know much about our universe at all .","274508":"i m not really sure what the first part of this message is asking , but i do have a keen sense of time management and professional organization , so my job comes very easily to me . i m also strong in communication and i m not afraid to ask questions . however , i should improve upon admitting when i m wrong instead of trying to frantically fix what i did wrong in the hopes that no one will notice , haha .","274509":"a fear of abandonment .","274510":"i don t know how i feel about the whole ageism thing , but regardless , i do agree with you that the idea that someone is too old to do things such as play video games or have plushies as examples is ridiculous . let people enjoy things .","274511":"uh , my worst habits are self destructive things . lmaoo .","274512":"i don t really have one ? marriage is for some people , but not for others . people who are dating shouldn t feel pressured to get married if they don t want to .","274513":"not very well , considering it s recently been revealed that trump knew about how bad covid was going to be in the country but pretty much did nothing about it .","274514":"i think it was around hours straight , from what i can remember . i was having a manic episode as a teenager , and i stayed up all night writing and listening to music before going straight into school the following morning .","274515":"i don t exactly have a fashion sense , lol . i just wear what s comfortable leggings , hoodies , tee shirts although usually v neck ones . and during the winter , i love wearing sweaters with boots and my faux leather jacket .","274516":"i don t plan on being a parent , so a non existent one evidently .","274517":"i think it s selfish to date someone purely for their money instead of who they are personality wise . it s manipulative and you re only using them for your own profit .","274518":"lol , definitely not . i m a neurotic mess most of the time , tbh .","274519":"waking up to the sound of rain , listening to an amazing song for the very first time , re watching

with hilarious meanings including goose operations attack team , which made me laugh .","274619":"considering i struggle with mental illness myself , i m always much more receptive to supportive
