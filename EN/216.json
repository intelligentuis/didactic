Americans haven\u2019t \u201cgone soft\u201d or whatever, this is now the age of information! We know so much now and info can be disseminated to so many people a million times quicker than it used to. That can get out of control of course and be used to push extremist ideology but it also means we don\u2019t have to stick to rigid social norms and structure anymore. A shift from traditional (sometimes racist and sexist) ideals has been bubbling up for hundreds of years and it\u2019s finally surfacing now in the 2000\u2019s.\n  \n  Should we kick out Asian-American citizens because they \u201cstarted\u201d coronavirus? Fuck no dude what is this the playground in elementary school?\n  \n  Plus we already tried stuff like that SEVERAL times in the past and it turned out horribly and nothing was accomplished except people\u2019s lives were ruined or they died.\n  \n  For example that\u2019s literally exactly what we did during WWII to Japanese Americans and it\u2019s now considered a national tragedy to be embarrassed of. That\u2019s exactly what happened to disabled, Jewish, Gypsy, and black people across Europe during WWI and look at the way the world now views Germany. That\u2019s also exactly what Stalin did during The Great Purge (and several other smaller genocides) in Russia and we now view them as damn dirty commies.\n  \n  All that because of some ideal that leaders thought was \u201cright\u201d and would \u201ccleanse\u201d the nation of someone who was impure, dirty, sick, or immoral.\n  \n  Long story short everything is a balance. Subjugating and separating a group of people because of their ancestry and country of origin is beyond ridiculous. It won\u2019t solve anything.  I could go on about the further detriments of randomly deporting people of Asian descent from the US but this reply would turn into more of an essay tbh so I\u2019ll stop here.\n  \n  I just wanna say that this issue has nothing to do with being politically correct or not or being a \u201clib\u201d or whatever and everything to do with knowledge, open-mindedness, compassion, and understanding of each other and the human condition. Why can\u2019t we all use our brains and think together instead of squabbling prettily over whodunnit? All seems a bit silly to me.\n  ","232501":"\n  Some words come out more southern sounding than others, some words come out pretty neutrally, and some I end up saying with more of a Canadian accent.  I didn\u2019t grow up in one place, we moved a lot so I heard a lot of different pronunciations of things when I was a little kid so now I feel like I speak kind of weirdly. I feel like the way I talk was influenced by that a lot\n  ","232502":"\n  We don\u2019t. That\u2019s pointless and racist. It\u2019s only fuel for the fire that\u2019s growing in the US with all these Nazi \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d groups and bigoted world views that have been surfacing. We need to test all our citizens and adhere to coronavirus social distancing guidelines because they\u2019ve proven to work in reducing the spread.

I think the longest one I\u2019ve ever read was All Creatures Great and Small by James Harriet but I\u2019m not sure\n  ","232513":"\n  Yeah definitely. Growing up, I saw that girls were always taught to talk about and process emotions with others, that crying was okay, and that it\u2019s okay to make mistakes; but when I saw boys cry or mess up or get frustrated it was always \u201ctoughen up\u201d, \u201cman-up\u201d, \u201cboys don\u2019t cry\u201d, \u201cit\u2019ll build character\u201d, or \u201cdon\u2019t be a sissy\u201d.\n  \n  And now after spending a bunch of time casually hanging out with my boyfriend\u2019s friends over the past year or so it\u2019s even more apparent. Now we\u2019re all in our mid 20\u2019s  and I still hear them say that normal things like expressing any emotion like love, sadness, fear...anything other than anger... is somehow \u201cgay\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d. I\u2019ve heard them call each other little bitches and gayboys and faggots etc. for liking to do activities like art or singing, for liking animals, flowers, certain colors, or certain music. Some of them I can honestly reallyyy tell that they\u2019re putting up a front. Like they\u2019re stifling their own personalities so they can conform to some made-up social norm that they think is the \u201cright\u201d way to be.\n  \n  My experience with toxic masculinity has been much worse in the Southern US than up north. I guess it\u2019s because the people in the south like to teach and embrace more conservative values than people up north tend to\n  ","232514":"\n  There are a lot more up-front costs if you\u2019re going right into buying a horse since you could stand to spend a few thousand for an animal that\u2019s well trained and safe to ride. Then there\u2019s vet, farrier, feed, and boarding bills (only if you don\u2019t have your own place to keep them which I don\u2019t)...not to mention if you don\u2019t have equipment for riding and taking care of them you\u2019ll have to get that stuff too so that\u2019s a few more thousand right there. If you already have the stuff then it\u2019s not too bad. Probably a few hundred a month in upkeep and care just lots of money to get everything you need in the first place\n  ","232515":"\n  Definitely my boyfriend and my family \ud83e\udd70\n  ","232516":"\n  Kinda a rant but long story short I\u2019d have to say \u201cgirly\u201d...but the whole thing is fucking stupid imo. Here\u2019s why:\n  \n  The notion of \u201cTough\u201d guys grosses me out.  Most \u201ctough guys\u201d are absolutely consumed in trying to live up to some toxic standard of masculinity that\u2019s been forced down on them. Dudes get told that they have to appear, act, and speak a certain way in order to be a \u201creal\u201d man but that\u2019s just dumb. People get so caught up in doing what a man \u201cshould\u201d do that they become an absolute shell of a person who\u2019s too afraid of looking \u201c gay\u201d or girly that they don\u2019t let themselves actually BE THEMSELVES. I see people around me end up trying so hard to look and act \u201ctough\u201d and to \u201cman up\u201d and \u201cbe a man\u201d that they lose themselves. And guys who are considered \u201cgirly\u201d are usually people who don\u2019t care about that ideal of what a man \u201cshould\u201d be and then they just be themselves and therefore that\u2019s \u201cgirly\u201d. It really sucks to see men out there who\u2019ve never been complimented, or payed attention to, or expressed their feelings instead of bottling it up, for their whole lives so they have to act like nothing bothers them and they\u2019re some sort of robot with no feelings...that shits a literal tragedy\n  ","232517":"\n  Own my own horse.

It\u2019s very hard for me to become angry tbh.\n  \n  Imo people who get angry or violent while drinking it\u2019s because they have issues within themselves that they need to solve, not issues with alcohol. Alcohol itself doesn\u2019t \u201cmake\u201d them act that way, it\u2019s their conscious choice to act badly and then blame it on the liquor and say it\u2019s all because of drinking. That\u2019s true evil in my eyes. When people behave like violent, loud, wild animals it\u2019s disgraceful...humans are so much smarter than that! Everyone knows that the only person who can control your actions is yourself! People who act out that way have little self control and self discipline...in a way it seems to me like it\u2019s a cry for help. Nobody who is a happy, kind, caring, person would act that way unless something was wrong or bothering them.\n  \n  If a person can\u2019t stay calm and rational while drinking then it seems to me that they\u2019re just using alcohol to vent their frustrations instead of dealing with them in a healthy way like talking about it, writing it down, or redirecting the negative energy the feel into something constructive or creative.\n  ","232560":"\n  Mein lieblingspony \u2728\ud83d\ude0d\n  ","232561":"\n  Only if I could guarantee there\u2019d be food, breathable air, and water on their planet.
