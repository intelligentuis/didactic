shows the artists and writers are more equal , or the writers are under the artist producer . i ve always contributed story ideas since teen titans . glen murakami gets frustrated too because people

horse dog ! so he could be pretty funny . he showed us some of his more personal comics that were really really good ! !","200094":"because ben fans are desperately craving the original continuity ,

of those in between rip offs","200146":"let me tell you something about that guy . he contacted me on insta to ask about unblocking him on twitter . at first he was super arrogant , he told me all his fans like his art more than mine . i just thought , yeah , that s why they re your fans . called me sensitive . but he doesn t understand the basic information needed for a model sheet pose . so he had too big of an ego to realize his criticism was just uneducated commentary . when i told him i was going to block him on instagram too , he started freaking out and begging me not to . then he said everything i did was perfect , as if that is what i wanted to hear . it disgusted me . listen to me , seriously now . no jokes . i m telling you as a person who has lived a long time . you do not want a person like that in your life . i do not unblock people , that is a hard and fast rule , because i have learned the hard way that people do not change even when you give them second chances . i do social media for my own enjoyment . i like interacting with of fans . that s why i answer your questions and show you art ! but i m not here to tolerate rudeness and disrespect . ignorant rudeness is the worst","200147":"i don t think so ! i think i just drew him like that . the artist who did the final model probably added detail","200148":"maybe i ll get around to it at some

it","200152":"i think rath if he doesn t time out","200153":"yeah he needed a more interesting story . how many power absorbing stories can you do in one show ?","200154":"i couldn t get into it . the ua crew was never super fond of him either , none of them ever once suggested bringing him back . and the design crew wasn t fond of the shirtless guy with a trench coat look","200155":"it might be the same . it s not human like hair , it s more like a thin sheet . kind of like tini s hair","200156":"civilian versions . the other ones i only do because you guys like them","200157":"why s he such a snooze fest then ?","200158":"buzzshock","200159":"the orange one ?","200160":"yes . and listen to a lot of audibles","200161":"ha ! i ll have to look it up , so many spelling mistakes on ben .

smoothie vendor !","200164":"no , he s just the same as ben","200165":"it s his choice i suppose","200166":"man sometimes it is shocking to hear what people think of the process of animation . yuri

that , i d love to read it again . but the real question here is , how did darkseid feel about his mom ?","200172":"alright","200173":"because that is not how the watch works . the omnitrix is the storage device , that is one of its functions . there is no backup , the omnitrix is the backup","200174":"how would i know ?","200175":"i d love a stab at it","200176":"sure ! someone suggested him

that stuff lying around after a battle . it has no monetary value","200199":"i ve never heard of it","200200":"no i don t think so","200201":"i don t think entities like that consider individuals . they may not even look at masses of beings and not feel threatened","200202":"lol ! well i guess it depends on if you want gory action or raunchy comedy or whatever","200203":"i m not sure if that

might be a result of military training and not a natural species trait","200224":"i m not sure . i don t know his history or motivation","200225":"maybe it would manifest as a mask covering ben s

sublimino for me","200306":"they are like the droids in star wars , they go around without clothes partly because they are artificial life and also because mechamorphs are considered rare and very

one right ?","200320":"um , you should be able to look at those and tell the worsts have nothing to do them . all the worsts are based on jae kim s storyboards because that s the way he would draw

believe those were written by tramm or under his supervision . there is literally no one who has been more involved with ben on every series . if he wrote it , it is canon full stop","200344":"ha ! okay cool . some places probably don t have that flavor .","200345":"reboots r us","200346":"no sarcasm is like ooooooh that s such a goood argument , i m sure","200347":"https youtu . be nq pb e j

reboot","200384":"you guys always seem to imagine the worst versions of these characters","200385":"yeah !","200386":"i don t know what that means . is chadzmuth a chad ?","200387":"his name is rr fff or something","200388":"ha !","200389":"i ve told this many times . there came a point on omniverse where they felt we had too many aliens and had us stop adding any more","200390":"it s been a really long time since i ve seen it","200391":"mr fantastic , rocket raccoon , the high evolutionary . guy gardner , cain abel , john constantine , bat mite , bizarro and mr

tales","200400":"no . it s supposed to look like a transformer and not like a pile of indistinguishable shit .","200401":"i m not interested in anything to do with the codon stream or dubious wiki articles","200402":"yes ! it s going so fast i don t think i ll quite have jetray fished when we hit k . hopefully soon after","200403":"i would not make shellhead turtle like","200404":"i don t know yet","200405":"yeah i guess if you didn t really think about it you might come up with that","200406":"i m not sure how any of those things are related . also the arcee body has been proposed for sunstreaker several times","200407":"dadzmuth","200408":"i believe those are matt wayne joke names","200409":"out house party ? ? gross","200410":"probably better to ask people who worked on the shows","200411":"i don t know what you re talking about","200412":"i m not sure , i ll have to see when we get closer .","200413":"so many good ones . like when he brings the meat smoker inside the house to help fred","200414":"like it s a g g g ghost ! !","200415":"i m still working on jetray but i probably won t have him done in time to hit k on gofundme . but i m working away on him and will have him up as soon as possible !","200416":"he would get the mayor on the phone and tell him there s a free roaming , vaporous , full torso apparition in town to promote !","200417":"no","200418":"thanks . like i said before in my mind it s for jetray and for fasttrack . i added the tiers so hopefully people feel they re getting more out of it","200419":"no

from my show","200424":"no","200425":"i don t really understand why , but in the beginning they were just drawing random monsters instead of thinking about who s predator they were . so they don t have counterparts .","200426":"cool !","200427":"no , i m not doing the ultimate alien version first","200428":"that s good ! you dot want a dead one","200429":"i ve seen that one . there s one where

nonsense . no one is perfectly alien , and no one is precisely . that s a ridiculous idea . you cannot calculate what percentage of dna is being used , it s just doesn t make sense . they are either part alien or not . plus it s not like the intact alien dna is just floating around inside with the hosts dna the genetic material combines together to form something new","200458":"i told you i m

just know people like those tiered stretch goals as something to work to","200552":"the first one will be the omniverse version , with some type of uniform , the other would be like an omniverse
