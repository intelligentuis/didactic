And now ONE of the best birthday presents I\u2019ve ever gotten. Lauren is truly an amazing human being. I can honestly say that a large majority of what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish with the band and what I\u2019ve been able to do on my own is because of Lauren\u2019s support and encouragement. Even though she was so young when we started things, her constant enthusiasm and support drove me to take risks and put myself out there for us when I was terrified and we would NOT be where we are today without her! She is one of THE MOST creative people I\u2019ve ever known. She contributes SO MUCH not only with artistic ideas but also strategy. Her ideas for music and aesthetics are INSANE and I\u2019m constantly in awe and impressed by everything she does.\n  \n  I\u2019ll always be so beyond proud of her and wish I could pick out outfits the way she can haha. She\u2019s SO wise, caring and empathetic and her friends are the luckiest people in the world! And how could I not mention how HILARIOUS she is. Her sense of humor and LAUGH are spectacular haha.\n  \n  Happy birthday to one of the best people on the planet LAUREN CIMORELLI! Our bond will NEVER be broken! Haha\n  \n  And wow, I\u2019m thirty years old and I have a child! Here\u2019s to a brand new decade and the biggest life change ever!! Make sure to say happy birthday to Lauren!

For those of you who don\u2019t know, me and Christina have the same birthday! I think we always had kind of a special bond because of that and I always looked up to her soooo much. We have some natural similarities such as we both like to plan ahead and know what\u2019s going on at all times, same kinda taste in food, and we\u2019re interested in a lot of the same topics, but I would be a completely different person today if it weren\u2019t for Christina. She taught me how to think, how to keep asking why until you get to the truth. She showed me what strength looks like as she constantly carries the weight of the world on her shoulders and never complains about it, but also as she\u2019s always willing to take a long hard look at herself, acknowledge her flaws, and put in the always difficult and sometimes terrifying effort to change. She taught me resilience as I watched her get kicked down by life over and over and she never stopped getting back up. She showed me that being fearless doesn\u2019t mean you never get scared, it just means you have the courage to do it anyway. She showed me how to stand up for myself and also to ALWAYS stand up for others who aren\u2019t standing up for themselves. The amount of faith and trust she has in God is something I aspire to have. She is selfless, generous, extremely empathetic, and has an exceptional amount of moral character and integrity. She\u2019s the kind of person everyone would want in their life. On the outside, I don\u2019t think people see how giving and kindhearted she is because she doesn\u2019t try to put it out there and let everyone know that she is because she actually has real humility !!!

He then took a second test not even 30 mins to an hour later and it came back negative? Although they were both different styles of testing they should still give the same results like a drug would tbh. How is that possible? Major red flag thrown there. Also the fact they continue to count one person as each new case each time that one person gets tested? How many people do you actually know that is sick bc of covid?
