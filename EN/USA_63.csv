  Try working on separating the spokes of the wheel. Take one item at a time. Otherwise life is like a multitasking nightmare.

  Some people are looking for perfection, which doesn't exist. Some don't have their own lives outside of the relationship & look for life & validation thru others. Some are only committed when its easy. Some are stuck in their ways & refuse to grow. Others marry becoz they're scared to be alone or desire instant gratification. Some are narcissistic and only believe what they want matters. Others just dont have good examples of marriage to model or the skills from counseling.. Approaching marriage as a united front takes work, and the balance of pairing strengths & weaknesses. This is probably why I'm not married. Most don't share my old school sentiments.

  ","
  I know this all too well. Staying centered and girded on your knowing or faith (whatever your thing is) must be practiced each day. If you have to go into the bathroom, step outside, put headphones...start with your armor already on. Recognize your triggers. Don't expect to change people's minds. Give them space to share but when it bothers your spirit...end the dialogue. Humans need positivity to combat negativity. Sometimes that's a quiet practice.

  The time varies per person. I donr fall in love easily or often. So I guess it happened becoz I consciously wanted to. Some people don't want to get over their ex, they want them back. For me it was mainly about growth. Pray/meditate if your emotions get out of whack. Do some self-love practices like spending time with friends. Have some experiences. Don't be hard on yourself. It'll pass.

  The bare minimum and excuses don't work for those who want more. And to want more we have to believe we are worth more. When we just exist we let life happen to us & tend to blame others for mishaps. Can we control everything? No. But we can control our drive & reactions to stimuli. Sometimes living is simply appreciating the simplest of things. And appreciating moments & people who share them.

Not all veggies and fruits are available organic. Check out the Dirty Dozen to see a list of the produce with the most  pesticides that if possible should always be purchased organic. Or the Clean 15 that are safe to buy regular mostly due to their composition. So far I haven't had allergies or illnesses that I know of becoz of food items.
  
  DIRTY DOZEN: Strawberries, Spinach, Kale, Nectarines, Apples, Grapes, Peaches, Cherries, Pears, Tomatoes, Celery & Potatoes.
  
  CLEAN FIFTEEN: Avocados, Sweet Corn, Pineapple, Onions, Papaya, Sweet Peas (Frozen), Eggplant, Asparagus, Cauliflower, Cantaloupes, Broccoli, Mushrooms, Cabbage, Honeydew Melon & Kiwi.

  It's going to be very awkward and hurtful if you ignore the signs. Unfortunately you'll have to make it clear. The longer you wait, the worse it is.

  Hee hee. Opposite answer. Why a man would hate being a woman...
  
  I believe us women MULTI-TASK in our heads 24/7. Good mothers see the whole game board like the Game Maker. If Child A / B eats a good breakfast, he or she can do good in school & become President / Prime Minister.
  
  Also, EVERYTHING IS INTERCONNECTED for us women. While many men have a skill to compartmentalize (which can make some appear to be calculating/cold/selfish/disconnected in relationships). On the flip side: If we women are mad...we may not be hungry. If we are dissapointed...we may not be affectionate. Everything spills over. The life of a woman can be exhausting without faith & self-care.

That exists in every race, culture, etc.

  I think honesty is key. If the understanding is monogamy then cheating is betrayal. I rather someone tell me they don't want a relationship than be the only dedicated person. Cheating starts in the mind. So I don't dig emotional cheating either. It's a persons choice to forgive & accept a cheater back into their sanctum.

I want the issues that impact the community like specific health issues, politics, outstanding community work, etc to be mentioned. Talks about financial literacy & business, etc. Weve got 1 channel ""up north"" so it must encompass a lot. Even history  spotlights 12 months in a year are necessary.
  
  However, TVOne is the only fully black-owned TV network! Others in the running are OWN & Bounce tv, etc...

  In order to feel love you have to be vulnerable. Oftentimes we don't know the happy medium of using our hearts & minds to make decisions.

   What is your opinion of love? Is it permissible for them to do what they want, or are there red lines that they shouldnt skip?
  ","
  There is freedom in love. Being able to be authentically you. But theres also accountability. Everyone shouldn't know what's going on in your relationship. Lines that shouldn't be crossed are emotional & physical cheating. If u have to hide it or can't share it...don't do it. Otherwise love is constantly evolving. I don't think love with one person is a love that is the same as with others. Honesty is hard, but to avoid jealously & confusion...lay it out. Speak what ails u & what sails you. Ha!

Sometimes we can be stressed when people reveal truths about us that we haven't dealt with or show us something we're unaware of. I'm a life learner.

  It depends. Mainly if any of the two still have love feelings for each other, it's no bueno. The type that goes beyond just care like a friend. This could lead to a cycle. A co-dependent situation where neither are fully invested in the relationships they're in. Instead the what-ifs linger btwn the past loves. This leads to comparisons of current woman/man interests & trying to rewrite history. Sometimes u have to love yourself enough to care with distance. Wish them well & live on.

Be present - really showing up & being in every moment. I used to really tap & & go into my own world as a teen at gatherings when shenanigans occurred or I didn't vibe with folks . For ex. I would have to be dragged back from my daydreams or higher plane thinking by friends. I should've done that during my quiet time. (Mommas only child mistakes) 3. Live & speak with integrity (even when its uncomfortable or people won't like it or it will hurt their feelings). Bottling stuff up is dangerous & can be deceitful.

  Good Question: I believe dogs have historically thrived from meat diets. I have a friend was vegetarian but still fed his dog raw meat only. I think with vegans it depends on why? If its for health, the environment or animal rights...may decide what u feed ur dog. Not trusting a meat eater to take care of ur dog may be like not trusting ur sister to slip your toddler a slice of turkey bacon if y'all are vegan. My family gave pork to my lil cousin knowing she was on a strict family diet of no meat.

Hear me out. I went to a Christian conf trip. A prophetic word was given over me. He called me out of the crowd & walked up to me, asked why I keep my words to myself? Why do Inworry about everyone else but me? Self-worth was suffering. He said it was harmful. I was literally on my knees on the floor in front of strangers screaming...like in a movie. No lie. Fast forward to a Reiki session at a work event yrs later. The lady put her hands over my throat and said ur throat chakra is closed. U have to talk. They were all right. I chose to be quiet. I didnt like confrontation. I wanted Interaction to be perfect, but that's not real life. Shied away from speaking my truth. Ever since, I've tried my darndest to speak my truth even when uncomfortable for me and the listener. My health is much better now. It's a daily commitment to myself to speak/write, even when painful.

   What is the appropriate age for marriage?
  ","
  I think it's pretty dope to hear about folks married by age 21 & 50 yr Anniversaries. However, I also think societal/Christian norms & economic opportunity for people of color & women were diff & this influenced marriage age heavily.
  
  Me the Unmarried and no kids gal says...when 2 people genuinely love  each other, are ready for the blessing & challenge of marriage & genuinely believe life as one is better than as two & when God's signs are pointing u in that direction...just LEAP. You'll neva be 100% ready. Just don't do it becoz of desperation, hormonal clock or to please family.

   Do you think money can buy happiness? ?
  ","
  No. But it affords a certain peace of mind in one area. Although money is something people want to keep accumulating no matter how much they have. Eliminating the stress of bills & saving does stop some arguments. Many marriages have soured over lack of money & its underlying issues. However, Big money has it's own issues. Favors & Users.

   What do you think of cheaters (in romantic relationships)?
  ","
  Hmmm...what do I think of the person who cheats? 1. the person shouldn't be in the relationship he/she is in. 2. Usually they are not committed to the partner perhaps they are there out of obligation or comfort zone. Sometimes needs aren't being met & it wasn't communicated early on & worked out together. So a disconnect or compartmentalization occurs. Soul searching needs to happen asap. Something is missing & attempts to fill it are happening with out instead of within.

  Welp! I've been attending functions without a date for years. I actually love going to weddings single or with girlfriends. People are usually very nice. Just don't rush into anything. You have plenty of mistakes of your own & others to learn from. And remember couples need their time too so your friends might seem a bit busy.

  I think people fall in love in small glorious moments or for some...in an instant. It's a feeling of kindredness. A need to share & make memories. Once it begins, you can't deny it, the heart wants more of the person & the sensation in the spirit he/she brings. Love is a feeling of belonging & symmetry like no other. We do it becoz humans need each other & God said be fruitful & multiply. Lol

  It depends. Some people flirt for the sake of flirting. For example, some women who have kids may not get out a lot so around men they let the sexy out! Maybe they want a husband..maybe girls just wanna have fun. Some men, even in relationships wanna see if ""they still got it""...if they have inner stuff to work on & their woman doesn't fill that void...that combo could be disastrous. Otherwise let the flirts have their time. At my age, I'd say flirt with a purpose. Lol!

  I've seen people do it. I've never experienced this phenomenon. As a ""traditional aries woman"" (loosely used), I'm all or nothing. If I love honestly, I don't put eggs in another basket or gave a side situation in my heart. But I understand a person could fall in love with certain aspects of a more than one person & feel deep feelings for 2 people. However, for me...everything is connected. So it's hard for me to remove someone from my head & focus on the person in front of me. I know men who compartmentalize all day at work or had childhood trauma, so it's easy to do with women. *shrug

   Is education free at universities in your country? For example in my country you need to pay for all years.

  U.S. Universities give scholarships of various amounts to people for academics & athletics. However, it's in different amounts. Our universities & colleges have high tuition & fees. There are state schools which are more affordable. Also, community/county colleges (2 yr. programs), which give a valued education. NY has started a program for people who live in NYC for a few yrs with a certain GPA that will give high achieving students free education at NY state schools. Many (North) ""Americans"" want a system similar to Canada where if you have decent grades, school is free. Many university graduates work 25 yrs & still have school loan debt.

  Hmmm... Tween/Teen love. Cared about him so much that everything he said affected me. I wasnt able to let my wall down so I was often protective & sensitive instead of trusting & loving. We had waaaay diff love languages.
  
  Then came my 1st adult love at age 18. His smile & warmth shifted something in my spirit. I just wanted to be in his presence all the time. But I was young & had an undeveloped mind when it came to relationships. I didnt voice my needs becoz I expected him to know them, when I didnt know what they were. So I acquiesced to a lot & hid inside myself without even being asked to & stayed extra busy while trying to figure out who I was becoming. We were best friends, yet became strangers in the same bed.

If u post too many photos of urself for likes, & we're cool offline...I hit the IG mute button. Ur doing way too much to showcase urself...get a life or start a modeling career.

The folks who don't give into temptation just becoz it's easy. The selfless, inspirational, wise & funny folks.

He knew how to love me tho. Bless his heart. And my 12 yr high school sweetheart relationship had to endure all of my growth that I kept hidden. I never gave him what he needed. I acquiesced to be what everyone in my life thought I should be. I didnt know how to love myself or him & ignored all my intuition for comfort/sanity. And I didnt consider marriage. I knew we weren't matched the way a permanent thriving couple should be. We were too immature to give what the other needed. Blinders on. Different outlooks on life. Poor guys. O & D thanks for pushing me to grow eventhough it wasnt on purpose. I'm not enemies with any exes. No matter what men have put me thru & vice versa. I'll never hate them/ya'll. But what's in the past is in the past for a reason. I'm not the same person. I'm fully me.

  Yes & No. I had a professor who was also the newspaper editor, my advisor & dean of school. She hated my beauty, entertainment & self help style of writing. I was really into Honey Mag at the time. She was a devout feminist. She found it fluffy & lacking substance. I wrote for the college paper only when she was on hiatus. Instead of proving her wrong, I did internships in TV, then Movie Studio, and ultimately music. I left my love of writing behind, except for gov't writing & a few published human services pieces. I blog & blogged for forharriet.com for a while (inconsistently). Yeats later, I now have a writing/consultation company. The journey was long & hard. I had to accept who I was & embrace my gifts. I let 1 person in various capacities delay me. Hindsight: God's timing.

   Do you agree that love lasts for the first few years, then it turns into a habit?

  No. I think what can be habitual is the things we do to show people that we love them. Learn their love language & spice it up a bit. However, I do think if a relationship doesn't grow with the people things can become stagnant & love wanes from the strain of lack of honesty & communication. Also, Finances, Emotional stress along with lies can ruin love if you don't decide to love daily. Love is a choice. We choose to give ourselves to others & connect with purpose & compromise.

  My favorite candy is gourmet/imported dark chocolate. However, I would eat GODIVA Milk Chocolate covered strawberries for lunch or dinner during shopping mall trips instead of food court food when I was in high school & college. Blame it on my dear friend Elisita/Erinezer (Erin Stripling) it was 1 of her high school jobs & she ruined me for life. Even in college I kept up the practice. Additionally, I love Reece's cups, Kit Kats, &Welch's Gummies.

   What is the most money you have ever held in your hand?
  ","
  Thousands I cashed out after layoffs from my 457B (deferred comp
  
  like 401K, but for gov't jobs). I used it to live & pay bills when I was laid off yrs ago. It was a good chunk.
  "
341616,"
   What is your temper?
  ","
  I'm most sad when someone I trust or love has disappointed me thru deception or lies. The first Aries in me wants to be heard so love to reiterate or re-explain to be understood (some would say to prove im right) - working on that, but at the end of the day it doesn't always bring understanding, so... BUT I deplore raised voices/fights. Never want that in my household.
  "
341617,"
   So what is your favorite movie genre?
  ","
  I'm a sucker for all things 80's movies/music.
  
  I digress.
  
  1. Superhero/Fantasy movies are my escape from reality.
  
  2. Action Movies for the cars & hot bods.
  
  3. Dramatic Comedy / Chic Flicks. (I swear I was Dara (mtv) in high school.
  
  4. Black Life films becoz I relate to them.
  
  Bonus: Docs only when I'm in the mood.

   Who's the best athlete ever?
  ","
  Wow too many faves! I fangirled Michael Jordan dang near my whole life until I learned of his political/social views & actions.
  
  Muhammad Ali I visited in training camp as a youngster. I owned a Dr. J doll which I used as a Ken doll. Love him!
  
  HOWEVER I'm a Lebronsexual. I adore him on & off the court. Serena Wiliams is a beast. I love her like I loved Flo Jo (Florence Griffith Joyner).
  "
341619,"
   What's your favorite smell?
  ","
  I enjoy the fresh smell of citrus. Right now the incense I have are coconut mango. For sleep a good spritz of lavendar on my pillow. Cologne on men...it varies. I was obsessed with Issay Miyake cologne in college. Blame it in my 1st boyfriend from 8th grade lol.
  "
341620,"
   Have you ever thought about going somewhere where nobody knows you and starting a new life?
  ","
  Yes. Yes I have. It's pretty common to think about escaping a situation when you feel overwhelmed with reality. That's why it's important to have people in your life to contact to give you a picture of the future.
  "
341621,"
   What song do you listen to when you're sad?
  ","
  If I'm melancholy I listen to Daniel Caesar. I feel love at it's pure form listening to him pour out his heart. He hits me like early Musiqsoulchild. I can zone out in a cocoon of love flaws & all. It's like a fairytale.
  "
341622,"
   Who do you trust most in your life?
  ","
  Whooooo! Trust is a strong word. Honestly, I trust my aces. They've stood the test of time, nurturing, keeping secrets & accepting me fully. Quirks & all. To them (my chosen family), I give my devotion.

   The latest photo from the gallery ?
  ","
  Haven't taken a picture of myself in weeks. Except for the snap I posted here. Not a fan of my pics. Latest photo in my gallery is from yesterday. Here it is.

   What is day so special for you? What happened that day?
  ","
  Are you referring to today? Finally done moving into a new house. Sometimes the overwhelming feeling of love & appreciation hits me. Especially after a transition or obstacle. I am so grateful to be surrounded by a loving network of folks...who are my chosen family.
  "
341625,"
   Do you believe in past lives? If so, what kind of person do you think you were?
  ","
  Although religiously I do not believe in past lives, I do believe in unexplained connection & experiences. I cannot explain d√©j√† vu or the feeling of home that presents itself with certain people at certain moments. We all come from the same source. Sometimes we feel each others souls or a moment (i.e. at the ocean) as if it were the only thing in the galaxy.

   Is the world getting better or worse?
  ","
  Hey there. I believe this question I answered a while back, might be the answer you're looking for. If not, feel free to clarify. (See attached photo).
  "
341627,"
   What's your most recent favourite photo that you have taken?
  ","
  Ha ha ha. 1. I don't like pictures of myself. The curves become the focal point. I only smile and show dimples & teeth if others are in the photo with me becoz I got tired of people complaining as a teen. 2. I only post captures of moments/feelings or events. Semi Answer: I love my skin tanned, so I guess summer bronzing pics are my fave type. 2nd fave type me in heels. Bonus: Here's a snap of me at this moment.
  "
341628,"
   According to you, who are real heroes? ?
  ","
  Real heroes are the every day people who take time to connect with others thru help, smiles/hugs (at the perfect moment), listening w/ out judgement or sharing resources no matter how small. It's those lasting examples of selflessness that I remember most. I just posted on my personal FB pg about 1 of my heroes who recently passed. She saw deep within me & offered tough love.

   The grocery shelves will soon be stocked with seasonal specialty items. What is your favorite pumpkin spice food-item?
  ","
  I actually use pumpkin spice on top of my fall foods like apple pies, sweet potato pie b4 I add whipped cream or almond milk whipped cream or even on sweet potatoes. It's cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves & allspice. However, fall season is over. Spring is fresh fruit season. Yum!
  "
341630,"
   What do you like to do in your free time?
  ","
  I love to attend concerts (even intimate venues), visit exhibits, reading & writing, trying out unique restaurants, night walking w/ skyline views & watching  ASMR videos that give me tingles or relaxation on YouTube.
  "

   What do you dream about?
  ","
  Hi there. See picture. I answered this a few days ago.
  "
341632,"
   Do you think people who are over-confident, interactive with many acquaintances are shallow?
  ","
  Confidence is fly. Cockiness is usually a repellant for me. Being mixy just to be mixy or dying to be seen...isn't my scene. However, interactive folks make a party! They are the people others gravitate to. A balance of talkers & listeners, doers & watchers makes it exciting! Too many acquaintances isn't my issue. It's the folks who give close friend access to acquaintances & wonder why they're always getting dissapointed.

  Hey Babygirl,
  
  Trust your intuition. Love yourself as much as you love humanity. Life will throw you curve balls...connevt anyway.
  
  You have unique spiritual gifts, stop denying your uniqueness. Blossom flower.
  
  Don't be afraid to wait on God's timing. He has the worldview. Trust Him eventhough ur on the ground level.

  Not with my health, safety, or reputation.

341639,"
   Who was the last person you gave a kiss?
  ","
  Yikes! Kiss & tell? Not I. Kissing is pretty darn intimate. If u kiss me once & it's wack...you will NOT get the 2nd opportunity. Chemistry...take me somewhere with the connection. Holla if u hear me.
  "
341640,"
   Have u gotten ur period? (this is coming from a girl and I'm just asking because I have not gotten it yet and mostly everyone did and I'm scared!!)
  ","
  Um...yes got it earlier than most of my friends...and it's still kicking...for now. Ha!
  "
341641,"
   What is your mood:?
  ","
  Current Mood: Thankful. Letting go of the past and its unnecessary weight. Aromatherapy, lights & newness. Being in the moment as I unpack these boxes.
  "
341642,"
   Jeans or sweatpants?
  ","
  Do jeggings count? Ha ha! They're the happy medium.
  "
341643,"
   Are you in a relationship?
  ","
  No, I'm single (not dating). Good News: I'm finally whole & I put in the healing/clarity work I need - to be in a healthy relationship. I have no suitors at this time. Although, I do fancy a particular guy.
  "
341644,"
   How do you usually start a conversation?
  ","
  I can start convos with women fairly easily. Although I'm not one for networking. Not into stranger's s.all talk. Soon come.
  
  And it's an absolute fail w/ guys. I'm a mute. Or pretty much business 1st & maybe I'll warm up to u.
  "
341645,"
   What's the craziest thing you've done?
  ","
  Experimenting w/ naturism/nudism. When in Hawaii on 2 diff trips I encouraged the ladies group I was with to go partially nude with me at water sources. Note: Clothing optional places only. *shrug
  "
341646,"
   What are you dreaming about?
  ","
  I rarely dream. Like literally I might have a dream 5x a year when I wake up & know that I've dreamed. Sometimes it's deceased family members, old friends, a guy I spiritually connected with. BUT I'm mos def a future life daydreamer.
  "
341647,"
   So what turns you on kjay?
  ","
  I'm sapiosexual, so intelligence (1) or wisdom peaks my interest (as long as it's not in a haughty manner).
  
  Scent (2)...I can lose seconds in mid convo in the company of a good smelling man. I also love to laugh. Bonus points for witty/funny (3) guys. And a good stride/walk (4)...yum confident presence is sexy!
  "
341648,"
   How can you change the World?
  ","
  It's in everyday interaction. I can honestly say I feel like a World -Changer, when I make a touch, look, words, moments count. I want people to feel me & I want to feel something from them. BUT I'm cognizant that I choose when to open up. Work in Progress.
  "
341649,"
   What is the most important thing u have to do daily?
  ","
  The most important thing I do every day is breathe. Feeling alive doesn't always feel good. Sometimes there's pain, sometimes pleasure. I welcome the lessons. I'm working on being more present. After a hard days work I sit in silence for s few minutes and essentially ""take my coat off"" & let the day wash away. Spiritually I need to connect with others when I get home in loving & positive ways.
  "
341650,"
   Is humanity progressing or deteriorating?
  ","
  It depends on how u look at it. The short answer is deteriorating. Humans need each other and the connection that exists across lines. We lose a bit of ourselves with too much division yet we don't gain much being separatists. Today people dont know how to deal with conflict or how to communicate effectively. And let's not get into killing our planet...
  "
341651,"
   What teacher in school made the most impact on you and why?
  ","
  Mrs. Washingron at Bryant School I think it was Pre-K. She encouraged my writing and remained in touch yrs later.
  "
341652,"
   What does your bedroom smell like?
  ","
  Currently it smells like citrus w/ a dash of woodsy pine.
  "
341653,"
   If you had one word to describe yourself, what word would it be?
  ","
  ""KALEIDOSCOPE"" So many facets to me, which can be confusing at times when people act impatiently, close-minded or scurrrrrred. I'm a complex picture made by simple things in harmony with each other. Together it's magic. So many colorful nuances. Bold.
  "
341654,"
   How good are you at saying ‚Äúno‚Äù?
  ","
  I began practicing the power of NO a few yrs ago. It freed me from unnecessary illness, stress & pain. It doesn't mean I don't care if I say no...it means I care about my wellbeing.
  "
341655,"
   How do you express your emotions?
  ","
  I can be downright silly. I love to laugh! I release my innermost emotions writing & other artsy creative pathways. I don't believe in arguing...but the Aries in me wants my words to be understood. I used to walk away to avoid hurting others with my words. I swallowed my words. Now I believe it is equally painful to NOT express one's feelings. I have a disdain for raised angry voices. No time for that in my household.
  "
341656,"
   What gift would you like to receive? From who?
  ","
  I like gifts that involve doing something with the person who gifted it, like a class, museum, trip, spa treatment, or something special that shows they've paid attn to the things I like. I'm not into gifts in a romantic relationship as a must-have, (I prefer quality time), but I like lil ""just becauses"".

  There's a certain euphoria when time seems to stop & all you know is the here & now. Could be when I'm in my element, could be in the company of another. A sense of no worries & Ultimate freedom.
  "
341659,"
   Do you want to be famous?
  ","
  Fame isn't something I seek. In fact I'm shy most of the time around strangers. I happen to love the performing arts, writing & speaking to crowds...but I've never pushed any artform to the forefront. My main reason is my love of privacy. I want a family some day. And big celebrities can hardly go anywhere without being harassed, stalked or photographed.
  "
341660,"
   What is the meaning of happiness!!????
  ","
  Happiness is subjective right? For me it's an innate satisfaction. Whether it's a project that I gave my all to that makes me feel accomplished, a hug from a loved one that gives comfort, head on my pillow with clear mind, or smelling mama or grandma's cooking. You just know it when u feel it...and u long for it again & again.

   Oye Day una pregunta mira e notado que tienes la piel muy bonita y no tienes nada de granitos como le haces es que yo sufro de barritos y as√≠ pero no me gusta las cremas con qu√≠micos y prefiero lo natural me puedes decir o dar algo par mi carita je je je je üò∑üò≠
  ","
  Hola anoni. ..lo que yo hago es aplicar una mascarilla de caf√© con leche o clara de huevo con medio lim√≥n ....
  
  la de lim√≥n se aplica en la noche y no la expongas al sol ya que te manchara tu pielesita o te irritara ..la dejas de 20 a 30 minutos, no mas. ...
  
  la otra igual la aplicas en la noche y la dejas igual de 20 a 30 minutos ....
  
  obvio la tienes que aplicar en la carita ,limpia y libre de maquillaje y  enjuagar con agua fr√≠a ....
  
  te ayudar√° mucho si tienes piel grasa ...

  HolaüòÉ
  
  la verdad es algo un poco complicado,supongo que es algo subjetivo,para cada persona
  
  creo que hay mentiras "" piadosas""por as√≠ decirlo , pero al final son mentiras,muchas veces mienten para no hacer sentir mal a la persona,por ejemplo en una enfermedad o algo as√≠, pero si vemos las mentiras son aquellas que se dicen a menudo en las relaciones,trabajos e incluso en la sociedadüòä
  
  ¬øy qu√© ganan ?
  
  pues creo que es dependiendo a la situaci√≥n en la cual se piense decir la o las mentiras ...
