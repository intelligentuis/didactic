One day at a time.\n  \n  Drinking water helps loads.\n  \n  There's a formula that tells you how many calories you should consume. I don't remember it off of my head. That is nice to know and to see if you are eating more or less  than that *limit*\n  \n  Limit carb intake. I'm not saying join keto or anything. Maybe track what you eat for a full week and see how you feel then try limiting  the number a tiny bit. Keto can make people sick since they lower it too low etc Focus more on eating protien and healthy fats. Look into  tracking macros (fat, protein, carbs) if you  don't feel like looking at calories.\n  \n  Meal prepping is pretty great to do. You don't really have to think about food, just grab and go. Especially good if you have an office job and access to a microwave instead of spending a bunch of money on office food.\n  \n  Take a walk, run, swim, bike, use your body weight if you don't have access to weights or a gym. Little things will add up.\n  \n  Join a class. Do something new.\n  \n  Limit alcohol or soda. Or even find a lower calorie one if that's the problem.
