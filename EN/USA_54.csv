  So there's this one particular boy. Who's watched me be a fool he watched  me love hard watched me be broken watch me just be dumb. And I'm always chasing the fact that he never follows me on Twitter, or Instagram. Like I was so immature the things I used to let upset me. Like oh he's no longer on alot of my accounts. But we have each other on FB. And the reason why it's so hurtful was because I actually neglected our relationship. I know I should of been more mindful of who he was. I was so rude and disrespectful now he treats me like shit and he knows I'm fucking other guys. He watched me fuck another guy. And that was hurtful because I never wanted him to see that part of me. But he did. He watched me. I tried to make him feel like after all he WATCHED me do I made him feel like it was his fault. When really I started it. And it isn't just his fault.

   Я знаю, о чём ты говоришь, только это не называется инстинктом. Да и сбои можно вызывать искуственно. Человек имеет несколько доминант, и если через окно Овертона навязать то, что животное влечение - зло, то гипотетический, можно превратить сбой в норму.

290809,"
   Вот есть на свете любовь. Как знаю, процесс запускает половое влечение, а сохраняется отношение с помощью привязанности.
Но если посмотреть со стороны того, кто не способен испытывать эти чувства, то есть ли для него какие-то причины входить в такой близкий союз с иным?А то это ответственность.
  ","
  Животная любовь есть у всех людей без исключения. Если мы говорим чисто об инстинктах. Нет ни одного мужчины или женщины, которых нельзя было бы пробить на инстинкт полового влечения. Это заложено в нашей биологической программе. Но если мы говорим о духовной любви, на которую способны очень маленький процент людей, как правило духовно развитых, то такие отношения весьма крепки и долговечны. Касательно вопроса, если человек не способен испытывать чувства любви к кому-то, то тогда вариант животной любви это его вариант и ему не стоит входить в союз с кем-то. Большинство людей так и живет, только они делают одну ошибку - оформляют брак и потом гуляют друг от друга. И заканчивается это всё разводом. Глупые люди, ибо сами не знают, чего они хотят, какая у них натура и т.п. Надо знать самого себя, кто ты есть и исходя из этого делать свой выбор.

   Существуют такие понятия, как победитель и неудачник.
Какой по вашему мнению человек победитель,  а какой неудачник?
Или это пустые ярлыки?
  ","
  Нет, это не пустые ярлыки. Начнем с того, что победителей в этой жизни нет, ибо мы все обречены в конечном итоге всё проиграть. Таковы правила игры, в которой мы живем. Но есть люди, у которых имеется сильный характер, воля, наличие интеллекта и чуйка. Именно такие люди имеют больше шансов на успех в жизни. Но надо так же понимать, что стартовые позиции у всех людей разные. Это очень важно, когда у человека хорошая стартовая позиция в жизни. А так же нельзя забывать про обстоятельства, они порой сильнее всего остального в этой жизни.

290848,"
   есть ли смысл общаться с теми с кем ты расстался?
  ","
  Если у меня были чувства к этому человеку когда-то, то я не общаюсь с ним больше после расставания. Зачастую этот человек становится для меня более чужим, чем прохожий на улице. Это побочный эффект чувств и самой любви. У всех это происходит по-разному. Каждый сам решает. У меня свои взгляды на это. Есть даже такие люди, которые спят со своими бывшими, находясь уже в новых отношениях. И всё это происходит потому, что любви никакой там не было никогда, а была лишь похоть и животная страсть. Поэтому им легко возвращаться к своим бывшим. Но если была настоящая любовь, которая была поругана твоим бывшим, то ты никогда не вернешься к нему. Выше я описал почему.

  Я думал, что людей будет меньше. Вернее я предполагал, что никто не выйдет, но люди вышли и это здорово. Но этого количества людей ещё недостаточно, чтобы поменять власть в России. Большинству людей всё также наплевать на своё будущее и будущее своих детей. Эти люди думают отсидеться, но не получится, ибо они живут в преступном государстве, где у них нет никаких прав, там любого человека могут посадить ни за что и убить. А самое главное, что в таком государстве, при такой власти, у них нет никакого будущего, кроме нищеты, деградации и вымирания. Если уже Путин строит себе дворцы за 1 млрд долларов и сажает Навального в тюрьму, когда не получилось его убить, то на что можно надеяться нормальным, адекватным людям живя в России? По хорошему, таким людям надо уезжать, спасать себя и будущее своих детей. Потому что совершенно очевидно, что в России ничего хорошего ждать не стоит. Если большинство хочет жить в рабстве и в нищете, без прав, то пусть живут. Это их выбор. Но нормальным людям надо спасаться.

Безусловно, внутренний голос говорит со мной и делает он это непрерывно. Внутри себя я человек достаточно свободный, поэтому мне легче принимать те неприятные доводы моего внутреннего голоса, которые я слышу от него. С самим собой я предельно откровенный человек. Чувствую я себя по разному от осознания тех или иных фактов. И это нормально. Я доверяю своему внутреннему голосу. Касательно того, судит ли меня справедливо этот внутренний голос, он же критик? Конечно, ибо человек не может обманывать самого себя. Он может обманывать других людей, но только не себя. О себе мы знаем если не всё, то почти всё.

  Скорее всего, ваш воздыхатель, вас не любит, у него просто банально проснулись инстинкты. Он хочет женщину, с которой он сможет утолить свой сексуальный голод. Из 100% признаний в любви, около 90% это лишь инстинкты. Там нет никакой любви. Лишь 10% являются действительно признанием в любви к женщине. Вы, как женщина, должны это знать, распознавать, чувствовать, где действительно признание в любви, а где вы просто являетесь сексуальным объектом для мужчин. Если вы не можете эти вещи понимать и чувствовать в силу своей неопытности, тогда вам лучше быть подальше от мужчин. Это мой вам совет.

  Женская харизма, утонченность, хрупкость, женственность, чувствительность, эмоциональность, красота, ум. Всё это есть далеко не у всех женщин. Чаще всего, это примитивные, не интересные, высокомерные, надменные, не блещущие интеллектом дамы.

   Когда вам последний раз снился сон и что там было?
  ","
  Это было на днях. Я был в пути, куда-то ехал на машине. Со мной была какая-то девушка, мы останавливались на протяжении нашего пути в разных придорожных магазинах, кафе, потом снова отправлялись в путь.
  "
291093,"
   Вы женаты?
  ","
  Нет, я не вижу смысла жениться в наше упадочное время. Если я был бы аморален по жизни, то мне было бы плевать и я бы взял себе в жены женщину, у которой было уйму партнеров до меня, ибо сейчас, к сожалению, в основном, именно такие. Я не собираюсь обеспечивать такую женщину и создавать с ней семью. Пусть это делают все те, кто у неё был до меня. Мне кажется это справедливо. Я не осуждаю таких женщин, ибо сейчас время такое - всё можно, нет больше морали никакой. Но это явно не мой выбор. У каждого свой путь. У меня он такой.

  "
291097,"
   Не скажу, что я согласна, но мне интересны чужие точки зрения. Вы верите в загробную жизнь или в какое-то перерождение души?
  ","
  Мне хотелось бы в это верить лишь по одной и весьма весомой причине: много лет назад я потерял свою мать. Она умерла от рака. Я был тогда мальчишкой. И мне хочется верить, что когда-нибудь я увижу её снова. Сложно мириться с тем фактом, что если человек умер, то ты его никогда больше не увидишь.
  "
291098,"
   Ну а если допустить, что есть бог, или есть жизнь после смерти, то какой тогда по-вашему смысл у жизни?

   Как вы относитесь к пошлости?
Как вы думаете, почему она существует?
  ","
  Я отношусь к пошлости нейтрально, ибо я понимаю, что основа человека - животная составляющая. Чем более развитый человек в духовном, интеллектуальном плане, тем меньше остается в нём от животного. Но полностью искоренить сущность животного в человеке невозможно. Я считаю, что пошлость допустима в отношениях между мужчиной и женщиной, когда они любят друг друга. Любая женщина жаждет в глубине души, чтобы  её любимый мужчина, любил её страстно, потому что только так она может по-настоящему почувствовать себя женщиной, а мужчина мужчиной.

  Потому что тот, кто создал человека, не хотел, чтобы он был совершенен. Ему было бы не интересно создать человека совершенным существом. Ему интереснее наблюдать, сможет ли человек сам эволюционировать до уровня своего совершенства. Богам нужен процесс, зрелище, поэтому они не создали человека идеальным.

Высокомерные ищут себе бабников, которые готовы унижаться перед кем угодно в мечтах о женском половом органе.

  Этими вопросами задавались люди издревле, сколько существует человек, столько и задается этими вопросами он. Найти ответы на эти вопросы однозначно никому не дано, ибо ответы на эти вопросы лежат вне этого мира и жизни. Это великая тайна. Безусловно, существует мистическая составляющая нашего пребывания в этом мире. У меня нет в этом никаких сомнений. И я могу доказать это легко. Всё что нас окружает, сам этот мир, вселенная - всё это слишком продумано до мелочей и работает как часы, чтобы быть некой случайностью. Для случайности слишком всё сложно и грандиозно. Эта продуманность видна во всём, начиная с самых мелочей. Поэтому меня всегда смешат те люди, которые говорят, что всё есть порождение случайности. Эти люди слепы, они не видят этот мир в его деталях, в его мелочах. Как говорится - ""дьявол кроется в деталях"". Так оно и есть.

Они не знают другой жизни уже давно. В России нет законов, они не работают и с тобой на этой территории могут сделать всё что угодно, не понеся за это никакого наказания. Кто что-то понимает и ответственно относится к своей жизни, тот спасает себя - уезжает из России, пока это возможно, ибо неизвестно что будет дальше. Осознавая, что его там ничего хорошего не ждет. Остаться в такой России это значит обрекать себя на жалкое существование. Адекватному, перспективному человеку в нынешней России делать нечего. Россия разрушается, а люди в ней деградируют и теряют связь с реальностью. В России ничего хорошего не будет в ближайшие лет 10 это совершенно точно, а жизнь одна, другой не будет.

   Какой персонаж из мультика детства вам запомнился до сих пор и чем?
  ","
  Были такие замечательные мультики, которые я любил смотреть, спеша домой после школы. Иногда я опаздывал и расстраивался из-за этого. Тогда в начале 2000-х годов интернета толком ещё не было. Мультики эти показывали по ТВ на канале ""Foxkids"" и сетка их вещания была неудобной для просмотра по времени. Мне нравились разные мультики, но особенно это ""Вуншпунш"". А нравился этот мультик мне потому, что там шла борьба за справедливость в этом мире, против всего зла. В ""Вуншпунш"" мне нравились персонажи Якоб - (ворон) и Мяурицио -(кот). Они умели разговаривать на языке людей и всегда пытались помешать своим хозяевам совершать зло, которые были колдунами и занимались черной магией.

Это законы вселенной, она так устроена. Наш мир является частью вселенной, а значит законы вселенной распространяются и на него. Это всё огромная, неведомая нам игра.

  Абсолютно не удивлен. Это особи мужского пола, у которых нет никаких интересов в жизни, кроме женского полового органа. Именно в этом они видят свой смысл жизни. Касательно шкур, да, таких полно сейчас, они продают себя. Спрос на таких дешевок очень большой и поэтому эти шкуры пытаются заработать денег. Там очень сильная конкуренция между ними, ибо шкур много. Но эти дамы на самом деле несчастные, потому что настанет день, когда они будут не нужны даже для грязного, заразного секса. Почему грязного и заразного? Потому что многие из них заражаются ВИЧ и другими опасными половыми заболеваниями. В России эпидемия ВИЧ. Посмотрите официальную статистику, а неофициальная будет ещё страшнее. У этих шкур незавидная судьба, они будут брошены с нагулянными детьми от разных кобелей и будут кричать: -""мужчины все козлы"". А их детей ждет ещё худшая учесть. Это страшно на самом деле. Но в жизни нужно за всё платить и расплата наступит обязательно. На смену постаревшим и брошенным шкурам придут молодые и свежие.

  Много чего. Но кто я такой, чтобы критиковать эту жизнь, это бытие, которое создал создатель? Через 50 лет меня не будет в живых уже совершенно точно. И никто меня не вспомнит... Всё уйдет в небытие, будто ничего и не было. Всё очень жестоко в этом мире. Это утопия для нас, но игра для Богов. У меня вызывает негодование только одно - обстоятельства, они чертовски портят жизнь.

  Зачем девушкам, женщинам это делать? Когда вокруг полно бабников, которые готовы целовать им ноги и не только, но и другие места. Вы на Западе были? Там считается нормой, когда женщина является инициатором знакомства с мужчиной. А в странах СНГ мужчина находится на правах подкаблучника у женщин. И это считается нормой в СНГ.

  ","
  Тут не всё так однозначно. Когда общаешься с некоторыми девушками, спрашиваешь про критерии отбора, то складывается впечатление, что большинство выбирает парней не пойми как, нет каких-то определенных стандартов. Одни говорят, что им нравятся образованные, воспитанные парни, а сами выбирают себе какое-то быдло, хамье, агрессивных, блатных ублюдков. В итоге, я склоняюсь к тому, что некоторая часть девушек выбирает себе тех парней, которые пробили их на инстинкт. Потому что рационально понять выбор парня у девушек - часто невозможно. Зачастую этот выбор иррационален. Это мои наблюдения.

  В большинстве своём, всё таки, наверно, да. Такие мужчины, как правило, не имеют каких-то интересов в жизни. Все их интересы сводятся на женщине. Для таких мужчин женщина это смысл жизни.

  Касательно меня, я выбираю достойного человека, мне не нужна дама, которая нагулялась вовсю, а теперь захотела стабильности, захотела найти себе ""порядочного дурака"" - это в её понимании, которого она раскрутит. Нет дорогая, вот пусть на тебе женятся все те, с кем ты гуляла и развлекалась все эти долгие годы и пусть они тебе покупают квартиры, машины, и т.п.

И самое ужасное то, что многим людям на всё наплевать, они живут и готовы жить в дерьме, в нищете и ещё рожать детей. Россия сошла с ума.

Популярные аски или страницы в соц-сетях - это зачастую девицы-бытовые проститутки с накаченными грудями, губами, сфотканные в одних трусах с татуировками на теле. Это девицы, у которых незавидная судьба. А знаете почему? Потому что после 30 лет они нахрен никому будут не нужны. Они будут сидеть и держать на руках нагулянных детей от разного быдла и говорить: ""мужики все козлы"". Хотя сами никогда не искали и не хотели иметь возле себя нормальных мужчин, поскольку хотелось гулять, кайфовать и зарабатывать деньги своим телом. Но за всё в этой жизни надо платить и придет время расплаты. Жизнь никому не удалось ещё обмануть. А вот кого жалко, так это детей этих блядей.

   Каким ты видишь будущее России?
  ","
  Сложный и неприятный вопрос, ибо Россия мне не чужда, это моя страна. Вернее я бы хотел, чтобы она была моей, но по факту, увы, это не так. Потому что большинство людей, которые проживают в России, не имеют ничего, им ничего не принадлежит, они бесправные, люди проживающие в России живут на правах раба. Россия за последние 103 года очень сильно пострадала, она ранена и боюсь, возможно, смертельно. Нынешняя Россия сильно ослаблена, она разворована, а население за последние 20 лет очень сильно деградировало и к тому же катастрофически вымирает. У России в нынешнем её состоянии нет хороших сценариев. Все сценарии плохи, потому что те разрушительные процессы, что шли десятилетиями и идут по сей день в России, безусловно оставили мало шансов на положительные изменения в стране. Система сгнила полностью. И если начать что-то трогать, менять, то может всё просто рухнуть окончательно. И оставлять всё так тоже нельзя, ибо это текущее состояние увеличивает отставание России от всего мира. Что приведет в конечном итоге к печальным последствиям. Я вижу тупик. Россия находится в тупике, на краю обрыва и падения в штопор.

   На твой взгляд, какие парни нравятся девушкам?
  ","
  В наше время всё обстоит примерно так: по моим наблюдениям, я сделал далеко идущие выводы, что большинство девушек, женщин не приемлют сильных, независимых мужчин, которые знают себе цену, которые состоялись в финансовом и интеллектуальном плане. А почему спросите вы? Потому что многим современным женщинам нужен не сильный, независимый мужчина, а нужен раб, тряпка, который будет во всём ей подчиняться; который не скажет ничего против её слов и действий; который будет делать всё так, как хочется ей и никак иначе. Рабом, тряпкой можно легко манипулировать, а с сильным, состоявшимся мужчиной - такое не пройдет. Таким мужчиной невозможно манипулировать и тем более сделать из него своего личного раба. Поэтому, в конечном итоге, такой тип женщин выбирают себе бабника, который готов на всё, но лишь до определенного момента. Поскольку бабник он на то и бабник: сегодня он улыбается и говорит своей женщине, что он её любит и жить без неё не может, а завтра тоже самое скажет уже другой женщине и легко пойдет на измену и так до бесконечности. Есть женщины, которые выбирают сильных, уверенных в себе мужчин, но таких женщин мало.

   Росберг взял чемпионство не благодаря, а вопреки. Там нехилая борьба была с Хэмом, причем противостояние было настолько жёсткое, что Росберг поныне-это табу для Льюиса, и на официальных церемониях Нико не появляется после своего чемпионства, и ты это прекрасно знаешь. А Боттас-вторикелла, и всё.
  ","
  Но тем не менее Росберг взял титул, он побил Хэмилтона, ему это удалось. Можно вспомнить дебютный год Хэмилтона 2007, когда Хэмилтон боролся на равных с Алонсо, который на тот момент был действующим двухкратным чемпионом. Тогда Хэмилтон по глупой ошибке в Бразилии не взял титул. Алонсо конфликтовал с Хэмилтоном и ушел из Макларена.

  Спорное мнение. Боттос неплохой пилот, но не может стать чемпионом. В своё время только Нико Росберг смог взять титул у Хемилтона в одной команде, это было в Мерседесе, после чего Росберг завершил карьеру досрочно. Взял этот титул Росберг с трудом у Хемилтона.

Это люди, на которых когда-то обратила своё внимание некая сила не от мира сего, либо это род человека, от которого передается эта сила уже по крови. Как правило, сила, которая передается по крови, оставляет некий знак на новом уже носителе - родимое пятно, она же метка на теле носителя силы (не путать с родинкой). Пятно это необычное, имеет некую своеобразную форму. Затем на носителя силы выходит сущность - покровитель и даёт права ему на магию, а также гарантирует защиту своего носителя. Взамен носитель силы обязуется служить своему покровителю до-конца своей жизни.

Зачем вообще нужно менять власть регулярно? Думаете это просто так придумали? Да чтобы не было узурпации власти одним человеком, с последующей диктатурой! Но это всё не про Россию. Россия - отсталая страна, тут еще недавно были гулаги, лагеря, где были уничтожены миллионы людей, своих людей. Был уничтожен интеллектуальный цвет нации. И никто за это не понес ответственности! Не было раскаяния и осуждения этих событий на уровне государства и общества уже в наше время. Да и народ в России невежествен, он не знает своей истории, кроме победы 1945 года и деды воевали.

Всегда это происходит именно так, а не иначе, потому что всё, что не возьми - имеет свой цикл. В этом мире всё циклично и отношения людей не исключение. Нет такого поступка, кроме измены, который был бы поводом для расставания. Но надо понимать и другое, что долгие отношения со временем превращаются в бытовые отношения, тоже самое происходит и с браком. С годами романтика уходит, страсть ослабевает и брак превращается в инструмент, механизм, где у каждого человека свои обязанности и места для любви остается всё меньше и меньше. Потому что появляется куча забот, проблем, которые нужно решать постоянно. Многие недалекие люди этого не понимают и думают, что брак - долгие отношения должны быть романтичны, как это было в самом начале, когда люди только начинали знакомиться. Глупцы и дурачки, не знают ничего, не знают, как устроена эта жизнь. Потом начинают изменять, искать что-то на стороне, мол хочу те же чувства, чтобы были когда-то у меня с этим человеком. Так и распадаются семьи.

  Facebook лучше, чем Вконтакте, если ты живешь в России, потому что сервера Facebook находятся за границей, не в России, а это значит, что читать переписку российским спецслужбам, таким как ФСБ-(федеральная служба безопасности) будет гораздо сложнее. Соц-сеть Вконтакте находится под полным контролем российских спецслужб и поэтому людей в России сажают за лайки и посты именно Вконтакте.

Тогда я был мальчишкой и слова эти не воспринял в серьез.

  1) Это самый главный пункт в жизни - моё здоровье и здоровье дорогих мне людей. Я знаю это не по наслышке, ибо много лет назад у меня умерла мать. Я тяжело перенес её смерть. Это был сильный удар для меня, от которого я отходил пару лет.
  
  2) Это достаток дорогих мне людей, чтобы они жили по-человечески, пусть не обязательно сказачно богато, но достойно.
  
  3) Это успех, удача, везение. Без всего этого никуда в жизни.

  Да, такие люди есть. Зачастую это чернокнижники. Сила либо приобретенная, когда на контакт выходит сама сущность и ищет того, кто готов ей служить в этом мире, ибо ей нужны руки в нашем физическом мире, потому что самой сущности сложно влиять на этот мир на прямую, тут другие физические законы, либо эта сила передается по роду от мамы, бабушки по крови. Они проводят обряд посвящения своей дочери или сына, затем приходит сущность, которая стоит за их родом и дочь или сын уже начинает служить этой сущности.

  Верю тебе. Это мир не так прост, как нам кажется. За гранью этого мира есть что-то неведомое. В 2014 году я познакомился с девушкой и она оказалась ведьмой, понял я это чуть позже, она скрывала свой дар. Познал я силу её магии только тогда, когда она меня приворожила, пыталась вернуть меня обратно. Она оказалась потомственной черной ведьмой и весьма сильной. Я слышал про таких людей, но не верил до-конца в их существование. Лично у меня сомнений больше нет. Магия реальна и одаренные люди силой - тоже реальны.

Счастье - потому что я могу избежать множество ошибок, которые я мог бы совершить, будучи другим человеком. Проклятье - потому что так тяжело жить, когда видишь всё так, как оно есть на самом деле. Я не могу себя обманывать и не буду. Нужно быть достаточно сильным человеком, чтобы не бояться этой правды, которая тебя окружает вокруг. Я не боюсь её, ибо я лишь гость в этом мире. Я не могу изменить этот мир, потому что это не в моих силах. Таким этот мир  задуман и я вынужден играть по его правилам.

С этой женщиной ты можешь говорить обо всём, можешь быть таким, какой ты есть и не думать что тебя не поймут. А если эта женщина родила тебе желанного ребенка, то тогда она становится ещё роднее. Но проблема в том, что в наше упадочное время встретить такую женщину - крайне сложно, которая будет тебя любить за то, что ты человек, за то, какой ты есть вообще, со своими минусами и плюсами. Сейчас многими движет корысть, люди разучились любить и ценить то, что имеют. Им это просто не нужно. Всё обесценилось. Это ужасно. Людьми движет холодный расчет и банальная человеческая глупость. Люди в массе своей глупы, не понимают что они делают, а когда понимают, то уже слишком поздно.

  Добрый вечер! Это формулировка относительная. Если человек правильно, трезво смотрит на жизнь, на разные её аспекты, без замыленного глаза, то он увидит мир таким, какой он был всегда: жестоким, несправедливым и трагичным. Трагичным и жестоким, потому что в мире, где все друг друга едят заживо, где сильный убивает слабого - по другому этот мир назвать язык не повернется, ибо это истина. В природе царят именно такие законы - жестокие. В этой жизни нет места жалости, а про справедливость я вообще молчу. Жизнь не знает пощады ни для кого, она перемалывает всех. Рано или поздно мы все проиграем, как бы мы не боролись - мы просто умрем, а кто-то умрет даже в муках (большинство). Такова истина жизни. Многие боятся посмотреть ей в лицо, а кто-то не способен, ибо слеп и глуп.

   Как жить дальше,если мысль то,что лучше уже не будет,а будет как обычно плохо?
  ","
  Это сложный вопрос. И я не буду говорить банально - ""надо надеяться на лучшее"". Я скажу вам так: создайте себе свой маленький мир, в котором вам более или менее будет комфортно. Делайте то, что вам нравится, читайте книги, их столько написано, что всё прочитать - не хватит жизни. Попытайтесь заниматься тем, что вам нравится, подпускайте к себе людей, которые вам интересны. Всё это немного поможет вам психологически справиться с тяжелой жизнью.

   Если бы тебе предложили вечную молодость и кучу денег с условием, что у тебя никогда не будет любви и семьи, ты бы согласился?
  ","
  Спасибо за интересный вопрос! Нет, никогда, даже если бы у меня было всё в жизни о чем я только пожелаю. Я не хочу жить в этом мире вечно. Жить в этом мире вечно - это вечная трагедия. Я устану от себя самого, я устану от этого безумия вокруг, от этой жестокости. Этот мир не заслуживает того, чтобы жить в нем долго, вечно и вообще как угодно. Придет время, когда я захочу вечного покоя, устав от всего в этом мире.

   Можно разлюбить если есть чувства???

291633,"
   Согласен, но слово любовь очень громкое
  ","
  Конечно, ведь настоящая любовь - это божественное чувство. Очень мало людей в жизни, которые способны генерировать в себе энергетику настоящей любви. Я уже сказал ранее, какие должны быть это люди.
  "
291634,"
   Есть вероятность что любви нет, этим красивым словом обобщили привязанность , комфорт, взаимопонимание и прочие положительные моменты в отношениях
  ","
  Я считаю, что любовь есть. Её способны дать только люди духовно развитые, утонченные, чувствительные, эмоциональные, а таких людей очень мало, потому что большинство людей застряло на животном уровне своего развития. Любовь подразумевает жертвенность, эгоизму там не место, а большинство людей - эгоисты.

Если вам и той стороне это нужно, тогда попробуйте просто поговорить с человеком. Попробуйте разобраться в причинах вашего разлада. Тут важен диалог и инициатива обоюдная. Если нет первого и второго, тогда лучше вам забыть друг друга. Иногда это лучший вариант, как это не печально.

  Доброе утро! Лично для меня это Матрица. Именно первая её часть, где переплетается сама философия Матрицы и нашего мира. Там проводятся прямые параллели. Бесподобный фильм. Ничего такого больше не снимут. Я уверен, ибо первая Матрица была снята в 1999 году и до сих ничего похожего не сняли. Этот фильм заставляет о многом задуматься, подкидывает много интересных мыслей о нашем мире и жизни в целом.

  У всех своё понимание дружбы с противоположным полом. Сейчас все понятия дружбы, отношений извратили. Для кого-то дружба - классическая дружба, товарищество. А у кого-то дружба - это секс на стороне, любовник/любовница. Сколько хочешь сейчас такой ""дружбы"". У меня друзей женщин нет, есть знакомые, коллеги. Настоящей дружбы между мужчиной и женщиной не бывает. Рано или поздно эта дружба закончится сексом. Это природа, физиология человека такая. Ничего не поделаешь с этим. Настоящая дружба бывает только между мужчинами.

  В целом ты прав. Но все таки в прошлом году хотя бы была хоть какая-то конкуренция со стороны Феррари в адрес Мерседеса. В этом году вообще никто не может конкурировать с Мерседесом. Игра в одни ворота. Редбулл тоже упал.

  Я уже отвечал на этот вопрос. Отвечу снова. Мое мнение, что татуировку, зачастую, делают для того, чтобы выделиться в толпе себе подобных. Человек, который её себе сделал, хочет получать больше к себе внимания, хочет казаться другим, типа крутым, потому что этот человек больше ничем не может завлечь к себе окружающих. Внутри, как правило, у таких людей пустота. Бывают исключения, которые лишь подтверждают само правило. Не более того.

А по факту, за этим смазливым личиком ничего нет: пустота, примитивщина, высокомерие с позицией - ""мне все должны в этой жизни"". Таких дурачек я игнорирую, как только вижу, что это такая особа. И как правило, такие девушки, это бытовые проститутки. Есть такой термин - бытовая проституция. Она немного отличается от классической проституции, но принцип тот же. Такие девушки это пустая трата времени. Я умею ценить время.

   Представьте себе такую ситуацию. Вы познакомились в интернете с девушкой/парнем он/она вам понравился/понравилась, вы захотели отношения строить с этим человеком, но вам человек говорит, что не против отношений, но без интима до свадьбы. Как бы вы поступили, стали бы вы терпеть?
  ","
  Такое возможно при условии, когда девушка чистая, непорочная, тогда да, в этом есть смысл. Она себя берегла, это её честь. Это заслуживает уважения и имеет свою цену. Каждый человек имеет свою цену, у кого-то это цена выше, а у кого-то не очень.(речь не о деньгах) Мне нравятся люди с принципами, даже если эти принципы плохи. Хуже всего, когда человек беспринципен. От такого жди беды 100%

  Сложно, но можно. Нужна сила воли. Если человек волевой, то всё получится. Нужно просто время и воля. А так же убеждение, что в распаде отношений виноват не ты. Надо чтобы правда была на твоей стороне и чтобы ты знал это сам, не обманывая себя. Это поможет психологически в разрыве отношений.

Я считаю, что этот сезон скучнее предыдущего, потому что в прошлом году хотя бы Феррари боролась с Мерседесом. В этом году Феррари на дне и никто не может навязать борьбу Мерседесу, в том числе и Редбулл.
  "
291777,"
   Привет. Как тебе вчерашнее заявление Хонды? Как думаешь, к кому пойдут Ред Булл и Альфа Таури-возврат к Рено после скандала, или вовсе уход из чемпионата (если вовсе Матешиц на это решится)?
  ","
  Да, я был очень удивлен, что Хонда уходит. Вроде они довели наконец-то свои двигатели до ума, и тут бац и уходят. Видимо был скандал с Редбуллом. У Редбулла нету вариантов, кроме как купить опять двигатели Рено. Хотя и с ними они разошлись со скандалом, забыв, что эти двигатели дали им 4 титула. Всё хорошее быстро забывается. Мерседес не даст им свои двигатели, это уж точно. Вообще, скажу честно, сам чемпионат Формула-1 сильно потерял в зрелищности. Этот сезон самый скучный за последние 10 лет. Смотрю я Формулу-1 с 2005 года.

  На мой взгляд будущее людей весьма нерадужное. Сейчас уже на наших глазах идет вырождение. Мы живем в эпоху информационных технологий и никогда за всю историю человечества не было такого беспрецедентного контроля над человеческим сознанием, какое мы видим сейчас. Идет жесточайшая манипуляция сознанием людей, подгонка сознания под определенные стандарты системы, уничтожение личности, внедрение новых псевдоценностей в головы людям. Итог всего этого: отказ людей от духовного развития, деградация, люмпенизация, отказ от традиционных ценностей, уничтожение семьи как института, пропаганда однополых браков и погружение в разврат, ликвидация культуры и обычаев, превращение людей в безликую, пустую биомассу. Я уже не говорю а том, что люди уничтожают планету катастрофическими темпами и всё это ради наживы и погони за красивой жизнью. Люди пилят сук, на котором сидят и кончится всё это плохо.

  Как минимум, это тревожный звонок. Вы должны сразу сделать вывод: измена либо уже была, либо скоро будет в ближайшее будущее. Возможно девушка еще не готова, не решилась вам изменить или просто тот парень ещё не решился на такие действия.  Если какие-то парни крутятся вокруг вашей девушки и она это позволяет, а она это позволяет, раз они крутятся возле неё, то это уже о многом говорит, что это за человек и т.д. Нужно поговорить с девушкой, спокойно, без истерик, объяснить свою позицию, если она считает это всё нормой для себя. Тогда уходите, зачем вам нужен общественный туалет. Честь и достоинство превыше всего. Многие позабыли, что это такое.

   Просто после того наказания и от него, и от Мерседеса было очень нытья в адрес стюардов, в частности, в адрес Маси. Но штрафные очки, что удивительно, сняли (любого другого с таким нытьем сразу бы послали, а Квята вовсе бы не стали слушать).
  ","
  Да, согласен. Это вопрос чистоты спорта. С этим беда во многих видах спорта. У Хемилтона есть определенное лобби в Формуле-1. Мы живем в грязном мире людей. Тут вообще справедливость найти сложно, почти невозможно. Почему? Это уже другой большой вопрос, который связан с порочной природой человека.
  "
291807,"
   Вижу Формулу 1 в интересах, и подписываюсь.
А теперь вопрос: как считаешь (извини, что сразу на ""ты""), Хэмилтон гений сам по себе, или только на самовозе? Много ли ему позволяется? И справедливо ли его наказали в Сочи?
  ","
  Хемилтон безусловно талантлив, он это доказал еще в 2007 году, когда только дебютировал в Формулу 1, в Макларен, куда пришел и Алонсо из Рено, будучи действующим двухкратным чемпионом. Хэмилтон конкурировал с Алонсо на равных и чуть не взял титул в первый свой сезон. Да и последующие годы Хемилтон показал себя блестяще. Касательно наказания Хемилтона на гран-при Сочи, я считаю, что наказание имело место быть. Он остановился там, где нельзя было останавливаться.
  
  P. S. Я подписался на тебя тоже.

  ","
  Абсолютно сильных людей не бывает. Сломать можно любого. Разница только в одном - уровне стойкости. Этот уровень у всех разный. Касательно меня лично, да, я считаю себя сильным человеком. После смерти близкого, дорогого мне человека много лет назад, а так же последующие тяжелые периоды в жизни, сделали меня разительно сильнее, чем когда-либо. Такие периоды человек либо проходит и становится сильнее, начинает лучше понимать жизнь и мир, в котором он живет, либо ломается. Третьего не дано.

  ","
  Ты никому ничего должен в этой жизни, кроме своих родителей. И уж тем более человеку, с которым только начинаешь знакомиться. Не нужны никакие рестораны на первом свидании, подарки и т.п. Ты знакомишься не для того, чтобы быть для кого-то кошельком или лакеем. Первое свидание - познание друг друга. Общение, разговоры, прогулки в парке и т.п. И запомни, что девушка должна тебя ценить не за подарки и рестораны, а за твои человеческие качества, твоё отношение к ней. Если ты чувствуешь, что этого нет, тогда уходи от неё. Значит ты для неё ничего не значишь, а нужен лишь как спонсор. Если ты не сумеешь понять это, то потом будешь очень сильно страдать в жизни от разных женщин. Удачи тебе в знакомствах!

  ","
  Я считаю, что рассказывать свои тайны можно только в двух случаях, когда тот человек, которому ты расскажешь свою тайну, тебе известен уже очень много лет, проверен временем и поступками. И второй случай - родители. Если с родителями доверительные отношения, то рискнуть рассказать тайну можно, если ситуация требует этого. А в идеале, лучше никому не рассказывать свои тайны, ибо это может в будущем сыграть против тебя, при определенных обстоятельствах.

  Когда мне кто-то нравится из женщин, то я проявляю заинтересованность к той или иной даме. Пытаюсь узнать о ней больше, завожу беседы с ней на различные темы, чтобы хоть немного понять, что это за человек. Стремлюсь узнать, какие у неё интересы, если они у неё вообще. Когда какая-то женщина нравится мужчине, то это видно практически сразу. Есть заинтересованность, есть активное, регулярное продолжительное общение, встречи.

  Боюсь, что мы все обречены быть одинокими в душе. Мы приходим в этот мир одни и уходим из него одни. Да, хорошо, когда есть близкий человек, который тебя любит, семья, дети. Это замечательно! Но, это огромное везение в жизни, когда есть такой любящий человек, что проверен временем и поступками, потому что на словах многие готовы любить, а при первых же проблемах - люди уходят. Тем более в наше развращенное, аморальное время. Где на черное говорят белое, а на белое черное. Институт семьи разрушен, масса разводов вокруг. Даже если друзья, допустим пара друзей очень хороших, проверенных временем, все равно в душе мы все одиноки. Отвечая на вопрос: Да, я чувствую себя временами очень одиноким. Такова жизнь, таков мир, в котором мы живем. Многие это не понимают.

Но сейчас мы живем в другом мире и без интернета жить практически невозможно. Хотя человек - это такое существо, что он ко многому привыкает и таким образом выживает. Лично мне интернет нужен не столько для общения, сколько для получения нужной мне информации. Интернет очень сильно изменил некогда привычный уклад жизни людей.

   Как можно измену простить?
  ","
  Измена - это и есть предательство. А предательство - это один из тягчайших человеческих пороков. Прощать такие вещи нельзя, ибо это вопрос чести, самоуважения и вообще морали. Когда человек идет на измену, он всегда идет на это осознанно. И никакие отговорки тут не работают. Единственный правильный вариант - изгнать предателя из своей жизни навсегда. Только таким образом можно спасти свою честь. И не важно, насколько был близок и дорог этот человек. Прощения таким вещам нет и быть не может.

Сейчас всё рассчитано на большинство, а большинство людей, как правило, глупые. Возвращаясь к вопросу. Для меня фильм номер один, это Матрица. Именно первая её часть.

  Have Asked Themselves
