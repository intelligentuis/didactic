  I enjoy your questions and I like you and your posts. My intent wasn't to make you upset but to let you know that a disagreement thread is going to bite my ass. It's the reason I was not really trying to discuss the movie. Also, I just don't care that much about the movie.

  My original answer:
  
  ""I mean, that's why I was hesitant in the very first question of this thread to even show irritation, like it's a subtle thing that just gets under my skin not something I care deeply about.""
  
  Re-answering to add-
  
  I don't mean to come off as defensive or whatever but while I like you fine and I enjoy your questions, I'm definitely pretty wary of you considering 75% of my online harassment is done by anons who mention you in some form or another and really, I just don't care to be put on the spot about anything. Debate is a manipulation tool. So while I get that this was just a friendly convo about differing opinions on a movie, I feel like somehow, this is just going to lead to more hate from your followers later or whatever so.... I don't know what I want you to do with that information. Just know that there's a clear reason why I'm resistant to being questioned by you.

139544,"
   to me it doesn’t seem like mental illness as a vehicle for horror, but movies about very specific themes involving family. Midsommar and The Strange Thing About the Johnsons both have pretty similar themes and messages
  ","
  I've never seen any of his other movies.
  "
139545,"
   generational trauma and mental illness can be very scary things. and clearly Ari Aster knows this, he has made three movies about family trauma. I had a very... intense childhood and when I watch them I feel like I’m watching the work of someone who did too.
  ","
  I mean, I'm glad you feel so strongly about this movie, I certainly didn't wake up this morning prepared to defend my mild irritation of a thing I watched several years ago tho
  "
139546,"
   I don’t think the cultishnes is necessarily a twist that is trying to undo other themes. I think it’s furthering the theme of generational trauma, and those weird (honestly disturbing) things that run in families.
  ","
  like I said, I barely remember the movie at this point, all I remember is the feeling of being gut punched by another horror movie
  "
139547,"
   but I don’t think any of us saw it as a direct allegory for a specific mental illness, which I’m sure influences our watching of it. I would be curious to know more abt ur viewing experience!
  ","
  yeah really, it's no deep thing it's just my general disgust with mental illness factoring in at all in almost every single horror movie I watch. People were SO ABOUT that movie when it came out and really hyped it up as something different and original but I still felt like mental illness was villainized.
  "
139548,"
   nobody in my family is schizophrenic, but mental illness runs in my family. part of me and my sibling’s enjoyment of Hereditary I definitely think came from the silence/shame/trauma of generational mental illness. those unsaid things that run in the family and feel inescapable.
  ","
  I just get so tired of mental illness being a vehicle in horror movies.
  "
139549,"
   interesting! would u be willing to talk more abt why?
  ","
  SPOILERS
  
  I don't remember the movie very well at this point, but I guess what bugs me is like- the movie sets it up to blame the mother for delusional and trauma-induced behavior as the culprit for strange happenings but then like, nevermind it's a weird cult afterall So it's ALMOST going to be a ""blame the mentally ill"" horror like everyone else does but then they pretend they're above that with the twist ending but they still tried it

   In The X-Files Dr. Scully tells a diabetic that he needs insulin because he drank sugary soda & it's put him into hypoglycemia. This is incorrect. Realistically he'd be in HYPERglycemia, not hypo. Insulin would kill him if he was in HYPOglycemia. What's a tv inaccuracy you've noticed before?

  all that comes to mind is those crime shows that have a computer lab and they ""enhance"" teeny little photos to huge sizes without any pixelation or anything
  "
139552,"
   how do u feel abt Ari Aster, the director ?
  ","
  I don't know anything about him but there's something I can't put my finger on about Hereditary that makes me angry as a person with schizophrenia LIKE it's not the most ableist horror movie ever created or anything but it still gets under my skin (I didn't see Midsommer)

  just realizing I was physically dependent on alcohol and deciding to fix that I guess.
  
  Starting back in March, with stress over coronavirus and all, I just got in the habit of drinking every night until I was a little tipsy. However, tolerance levels change and what took 2 drinks became 6-7 drinks a night over time.
  
  By October, my sober daytimes were rife with terrible withdrawal symptoms (I only drink after 5pm so all day long, I craved alcohol). I would wake up sick and stay feeling extremely sick all day until my first drink of the night. I don't have an emotional attachment to drinking, btw, just physical.
  
  ANYWAY I called my doc and she wants to meet with me to make a better plan- and I'm scheduled to do that on the 24th- but for now she has me weaning very slowly so as not to mess up my meds. I drink a cocktail in the afternoon now, just the one, and then I'm down to 4 ciders at night (from 7)

  ","
  I have fainted many times actually. The first time I remember fainting was so so embarassing, I had a very heavy period and cramps and was in so much pain and had lost so much blood- but we had an English test on Romeo and Juliet that counted for a third of our grade that semester so I went to school anyway, and sitting there I finished the whole exam, stood up to turn it in, walked three steps, then felt like I had goosebumps, chills, sweating, and was weightless and I crumbled to the ground. Fellow students had to carry me to the nurses office.
  
  The most recent time happened at the hospital ER where a shitty tech flushed my IV too fast and it made me faint

   Is classism a thing?
  ","
  yes definitely. I've been sneered at and treated poorly in the past because of my family's financial position.
  "
140150,"
   How do you define class? Someone who has a job and can afford the basic would be considered middle class and someone without a job who barely can afford anything is lowclass?
  ","
  I don't think very much about it so I don't have a personal definition. I grew up what was considered lower middle class, or what some people call blue collar class. My parents worked but we were still very tight on money and often went without. As an adult, I am more comfortable and financially stable than that, so I consider myself more ""comfortably middle class""
  
  The idea of class is silly but you asked me a question about where I fit into it and I answered. It would be better to have a socialized class of people who work (or not) and are still able to provide for families and get health care and be comfortable.

  because you're supporting someone who literally oppresses minorities so therefore you agree with his policies. We're talking about literal children literally separated from their parents at the border and kept in horrific conditions.
  
  But honestly? I believe every white person and white passing person benefits from racism and white supremacy, so if you're white, you are by default racist. Yes including me. The thing is- if you're actively aware of your privilege and being anti-racist, then you're doing the right thing. Racist or benefitting from racism or not.

  well first off I decided to push a bottle brush down the stem of my b0ng and it broke so I was pissed off and had to smoke a joint to wakeup instead which tasted like old paper. I moped around and drank coffee for a while, and then got showered and ready to run errands. I bought yarn for a new project (arm warmers) (pictured) a new b0ng, the piece to replace in my old one in case I can repair it, some suet for the woodpeckers, frozen cheeseburgers, lighters, and cider then came home and ate some Japanese style curry my husband cooked and now here we are

  I think she said that because she's ignorant and has no filter.

  it's a genetic disease. I also do have childhood trauma but that contributed to panic disorder and ptsd, and has nothing to do with schizophrenia really other than the fact that it's all part of my mental illness profile. Schizophrenia is a rare genetic disorder that affects up to 1% of the population but less than half of those cases go treated. There is no cure and it almost always leads to early onset dementia

   Yeah true. the anon is also trying to guilt trip people into replying to him. He's basically doing what those who believe in ""friendzone"" do. Put the person in a bad light, claiming she has no 'decency' for not giving him time, as if he was entitled to her time.

  it's creepy. He's been sending me shit about this girl for like, at least 3 months. being left on read, texting her every day, texting her good morning every morning, freaking out when she doesn't reply,

   It's so clear that these anons - the ones who are bothered by a friend leaving them on read - are either teens, really immature or have no job. when u are a full grown adult with responsibilities, u understand that everyone has their own to deal with, their priorities. stop being so self centered
  ","
  like, I can only say ""maybe they're busy"" nicely about a dozen times before I just think you're harassing the poor girl like can you imagine someone texting you every day and then complaining to strangers when you're left on read

   How was he bothering her? He merely expressed he was upset. No-one likes being ignored by a friend, it’s “normal” to feel hurt before you might consider the reasons she might not have responded. Your answer seemed mean spirited tbh

  once again, this is a repeat thing. If you don't bother to follow me and read my previous answers, then don't bother to run your mouth about what I am and am not.
  
  grown ups don't need constant reassurance from their ""friends"". If someone doesn't respond RIGHT AWAY, it's not the fucking end of the world.

  this kid sends me this same ""situational question"" over and over and over- This girl obviously has better things to worry about than him. it's ""decency"" that HE stop pestering.

  ","
  when I was 16 I worked in a small gallery in the mall that didn't have a bathroom attached so if I wanted to use the bathroom, I had to close the gates and walk all the way across the mall to the public bathroom. One day I did this wearing a long velvet skirt and tights, and managed to tuck the skirt into my tights when I was done so that my whole backside was showing. I walked through the whole mall like that and didn't realize until I bent down to open the gallery gate

  today we woke up early and drove the hour and a half to the ocean before it got crowded and spent a little time hiking through the dunes and enjoying the sea air.

I have ideas for two new art pieces I'll probably start tomorrow or the next day.

   What’s one of your idiosyncrasies? A behaviour or quirk that’s peculiar to just you? 
I just realised that one of mine is that I’ve always casually watched Instagram videos (“reels” as they now call them) with the sound off. So I’ve rarely heard whatever ppl are saying or the backing music  😂! 🤔
  ","
  I flat out refuse to watch videos if I can at all help it, including music videos, preferring instead to just listen to the music on spotify or look up the information in a format I can read. I'm not opposed to the sound necessarily because I am listening to music constantly all day long but rather I just feel this weird aversion to having to sit through 2 minutes of watching something. Also, I won't watch ""live"" videos of my friends on facebook and instagram because I feel like I""m intruding, even though they clearly are hoping for viewers

   Do you mind if you explain to me how it feels to be schizophrenic?  This is not a judgmental question, but to understand how you may feel.
  ","
  I don't mind, thanks for asking. It's hard to describe what it's like in a lot of ways, because some symptoms are so subtle or start off subtle and then intensify so gradually that you accept them as part of your life without thought. In the past, I've had visual hallucinations that I just wrote off as ""omens"" for instance because they just became a part of my every day. I've at times had delusional lines of thinking, such as ""the government wants to experiment on my brain"" or ""there's a plot to plant a bomb in my home"" but that's been pretty rare and during times of extreme stress. I was active with symptoms such as these starting at around age 19, and then went into remission for a little while, then active again, then in remission for years and years, and now I'm active again but only to a very small degree. For me now, schizophrenia means my brain fills in silent spaces with it's own noise. I hear radio talk shows or newscasts or weather channel - type droning voices. Sometimes, my lines of thinking get a little muddled- like I'll be thinking about preparing kale for the bird then suddenly be certain she's going to die and it doesn't matter.
  
  That's a lot of words I just typed hope that helps explain some. I'm a little distracted today so I don't really know what else to say but feel free to ask clarification questions

  two nights ago I woke up at 4:30 am and looked at the clock. Jon was asleep on the sofa, which he does normally when his back is bothering him. The cats were with me- Mimi in my face and Rin on my feet. Before I fell back asleep, I distinctly heard the sound of a cat food can opening- the cats heard it too and Mimi busted ass so hard to get in the kitchen that she scratched my chest and left a bloody mark. I fell asleep.
  
  The next day I asked Jon why he fed the cats so early, and he said he didn't! That in fact, he overslept and forgot to feed them in the rush to go to work that morning (they still have dry food, wet food is just extra)

  to clarify- I was very drunk last night- I don't think that everyone who shaves their body is a pedo but I do think that the idea that it's necessary is deeply rooted in pedophila

  I'm SUGGESTING That you, harassing me, right now, like you are actually fucking doing, is furthering the pedo agenda by defending the anons harassing me about my own personal choice to not shave. You are fucking playing ""devil's advocate"" for the wrong side asshole
  "
143088,"
   I’m not disagreeing with the main thrust of your argument.
  ","
  and I think you're being awfully particular about defending pedophilioac tendencies. I mean, go off I guess but the fact of the matter is that hairlessness was meant to emulate young people
  "
143089,"
   No, its not. It’s a preference, and some which women make of their own accord.
  ","
  I mean okay whatever but it's natural for a woman to grow hair and it's despicable for anyone to demand otherwise- like the patriarchy does- because let's be real it's 100% because of pedophilia. You can shave every last hair but know that it wasn't even a trend until mid century 1900s and it was 100% because of the patriarchy
  "
143090,"
   Of course women shouldn’t get harassed for their choices, but throwing the word “paedo” around to gain points is seriously awful.
  ","
  you know what's seriously awful? Preferring your partner be shaved down hairless as a child
  "
143091,"
   There are many reasons, social conditioning for one. As a woman, and a feminist, I have been questioned about my own preferences and its annoying.
  ","
  look y'all. I don't shave. I stopped when I broke both elbows and literally couldn't. I've seen since then that it literally makes no difference, and for some reason I've been getting nothing but harassment for my own decision about my own body. It's honestly wild.
  "
143092,"
   Accusing any man who prefers their female partners to shave of being a paedo is really disgusting. Sure, this anon is an idiot but to inflate it to him being a paedo is beneath contempt.

   If oppression is a necessary component of racism it would mean that people who did not have power could not be racist?
  ","
  being a beneficiary of white supremacy and not trying to change the system is an act of oppression. Any white person who is not actively anti-racist is racist. It's really not complicated.
  
  I'm getting the feeling that you're going to keep needling me until you find a loophole in my judgement but there isn't one. I""m not sure why you are continuing this over and over at this point. I'm not a teacher, I don't write books about racism I don't do lectures. I have given my time freely because it was in good faith but I don't see how this could POSSIBLY continue without more of the same picky picky needly questions pulling us around in circles.
  
  White people- you benefit directly from racism in every breath you take. that makes you culpable and if you're not actively anti-racist, then you are racist.
  
  If y'all want more on this topic, than maybe ACTUALLY read the book I've recommended over and over again, ""So You Want To Talk About Race"" by Ijeoma Oluo. It's a bestseller for a good reason. I'm not your teacher, and if you think I am, then fucking pay me.

  absolutely not. All white people benefit from white supremacy whether they think they do or not. All white people have been beneficiaries to institutionalized racism. Some white people might be actively anti-racist, but every white person is inherently racist. That's not oppressive to say that. It doesn't make the privilege go away. It's the truth.

In college, when people wouldn't leave my apartment, I'd just straight up walk into my bedroom and go to sleep and leave them sitting there.

  I like the idea of dating who you please and having multiple connections. I like the idea of a community that meets your needs so that one person doesn't have a burden at any point. Polyamory is attractive to me because of these things. But some people just can't hang.
  "
143944,"
   What would you do if you’re in a monogamous relationship with a person the relationship is just BOMB, but you figure out that polyamory is more what you’re looking for, but your partner finds the thought of you being with others uncomfortable? Communication already happens. Asking for a friend.
  ","
  I mean, we've been through that in my marriage. I tried to open us up so my partner could date while I remained uninterested in sex, but he just couldn't get comfortable with the idea. So we're just mono and he understands that I don't really care about physical intimacy.

  the word I would personally choose is revolution, because in more places than not peaceful protest and demonstrations are the norm- for instance, Portland, where our curfew was lifted after 4 days of protesting without ""riot"". The history books will probably call this a race riot. Regardless, some of our voices are finally being heard, slowly and little by little the protests and the rebellion are making a change across the country with police reform. Hopefully we can make a serious difference.

  parakeets have a body part called a ceres. It's the membrane above their beak. For female parakeets, it looks reddish brown and for males it looks blue. the deeper the color the more hormonal the bird.

   How do you know she's hormonal?
  ","
  she is an egg layer. She's been over-producing eggs since she became an adult. It's all part of a pattern- right now she's in nesting mode and she wants to destroy everything to make nesting materials. In a few days she'll calm down and then lay an egg.

   What does confidence mean to you? I guess to some it might be down to looks, but others it's down to what's going on inside etc

  confidence is just being positive about what you're presenting to the world whether that's appearance or actions
