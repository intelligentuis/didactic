   What someone said tonight got me thinking.. maybe I should explain myself to Lyndsey. regarding that recent ""shemale"" comment. Of course I expected no one at all to believe me.

   Well I just got in bed after eating my snack and I'm tired and mad at myself for staying up so late. Tomorrow I need to go to bed by 7pm. 9pm is too late because of the kitty I'm taking care of. It wakes me up early. And no one will adopt her. She's such a lap cat. My kitty is guarding the door. 😔

  Maybe they will become friends over time?
  "
514972,"
   Chicken tikka masala gas is probably really potent. When you sleep tonight make sure you are on your side and don't cover your behind so the gas can escape or else it will get trapped under your blanket and will make it hot there and you'll have weird dreams because of the warmth/ mugginess.

  Made with cauliflower rice.

   Who do you think caused JonBonet Ramsey's death and why?
(I will be following up some of your answers with more questions too)
  ","
  I'd guess the brother and maybe a friend or intruder. He's opening up about the case 20 years later. He doesn't seem reliable. Seems very vague and not really there? Also the parents sent him to a friends house o.o seems like he knew more than let on, dodging the coos like he always has
  
  Officer Rick French seems a bit alarming too. Maybe he found her down there and had his way, accidentally killed her. Just seems odd a cop not opening the door. There's no time limit on how long he was down there either.
  
  The mom seems weird since checking up on her kid at 5am? Going into Burkes room and saying ""oh my god"" before even knowing that she was dead? A note shouldn't really make you that panicked yet? Seems more remorseful.

  No. It seems pretty sexist and just because you liked someone's body more over others doesn't mean they will be any good for you. You must be very confident to do that as well. I wouldn't want all the viewers watching seeing my body and I'm sure some comment mean things as well.

  ","
  What's really stopping them from going younger? I don't think they'd really care about what is morally right for age gaps.. hopefully it's a consensual relationship and actually love there, not some sick games...

  ""The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children.""
  
  Yet they kept going back and forth on which way they entered that night. That doesn't seem like a good idea to leave young kids when there's been sightings of people breaking in. The ugly blonde guy seems likely.
  
  Matthew Oldfield volunteered to check the kids. Yet she went a few minutes later herself.
  
  Murat family seems strange. Also said how the son was home that evening and then later on the mother mentions how she took a drive past the area. Strange. Did they ever check to see if his daughter in England was really Madeline?
  
  ""the second week of June they sent him hair and eyelashes from Madeleine collected from the family home"" how do you collect eyelashes though? 😂
  
  idk the parents do seem money hungry. I don't know if I feel like they did something though. The dog going to the sofa was strange but no real evidence anywhere. If she is alive she probably looks way different from the picture they made. Surely in that time she would have visited doctors or dentists? If she is alive, hopefully a happy child and doesn't remember bad things? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

   Inspired by the Joe Rogan Podcast; What would your opinion be on a ban on advertisements with ""unattainable body types"" in it. So if a Photoshopped man is/has tall, broad shoulders, big muscles. If a Photoshopped woman is/has tall, slim, big breasts. They might not be allowed in advertisements.
  ","
  I think it's a shame. It's 2019, advertisers should show off all the body types. All they want is a 00 with no butt, boobs or even hips.. it can get worrisome.

  Crying is totally fine in situations like that. Like any relationship ending you need to give yourself time. Do the things you want to do.

  I'm not sure what the first one is up to. I ended up deleting him off FB a few years later. Like we just didn't talk anymore. It was basically just leaving birthday wishes when we did talk.

  I don't believe so. We haven't talked in a while. Anything is possible, I guess. I just know that he's dated a few people since. When we do talk it's not really about other people in our lives ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

   It sounds like a trick question to me, but let's make the math for the fun of it: 7 wives, each with 7 sacks (49 total), each sack with 7 cats (343 total) and each cat with 7 kittens (2401 total). So 2401 + 343 + 49 + 7 = 2800 (2801 if the husband counts, 2802 if the original guy counts).

  ❄ Be patient with yourself; you are doing the best you can! This month, let go of urgency and fear. Relax and transform striving into thriving. Trust in yourself, work hard, and you will see results.
  
  ❄ Close your eyes and think about a moment for which you are deeply grateful. Feel the joy of that moment and the privilege it is to carry it in your heart always.
  
  ❄Live in appreciation. Train Your mind to be grateful. Appreciate your talents, beauty, and brilliance. Love your imperfectly perfect self.

  ","
  Angry at someone? I could be an adult about it and have a conversation on what bothered me. I could give silent treatment or i could yell back.
  
  I don't really get angry much. Walking away is a good option if it's too much to take in at once.. walking outside can be a nice way to get out the aggression. listen to angry music, talk about it, I bite my lip when angry...
  
  know your feelings are valid and try calming down

   what are your thoughts on women who feel that other women owe their bodies to their partner for just being in a relationship with them and it’s necessary for them to meet their partners needs no matter what they’re going through in order to keep them faithful? 
-(if this makes sense)-
  ","
  I hate the whole owning thing. It's still your body.
  
  I think it comes down to communication more than demands because you are in a relationship. They should know if you aren't comfortable with something. Not in the mood or whatever else.

  2018 started out bad since my dog, Domino, died. She was 14/15.
  
  Going to Arizona. We had a lot of snow over the winter. Good to get the sun, tan, swimming, the gym. Just being more active in general. Seeing family more. My uncle and his wife even came out for a week.
  
  Meeting new people from here 😉
  
  Halloween was nice and they actually won 3rd in the contest.
  
  not getting snow, more sunny days has been nice since I can get a bit of seasonal depression / summer time sadness XD
  
  Christmas was good.

  The steps to finding out about pcos were hard, especially since I don't like doctors. I was stressing out for no reason since it seemed like it took forever, kept reading stuff on it. I definitely learned to just chill and not stress as much afterwards.
  
  I was pretty bad at the end of November and during December about my body. Need to find the right mindset again. Plus I wasn't going to the gym so probably more of a subconscious kind of thing with my body than actually really hating it. I definitely feel way better when I do go to the gym. Mentally, less stressed, and psychically.
  
  Besides those, I don't think I've learned much about myself.

  In Elementary school I had to do an essay on Benjamin Franklin. I had my original paper, a bunch of information on him. Throughout my schooling, I always picked him to do. I would essentially just add more information onto the original paper. Make the wording more sophisticated. I always got good grades on it and nobody ever caught on 😂😂😂
  
  In 5th grade i had one of those pencils with the multiplication table on it. So I'd cheat sometimes at math if I didn't know certain ones.
  
  ~
  
  uni - Sparknotes was very helpful if had to read books and didn't feel like it. I had to read A Scarlet Letter. It was easy getting information on it. We read it in class but it didn't hold my attention. I did read it in my own time though and it was ok.
  
  I had teachers have open book quizzes or we could have a huge list of notes. Even had take home quizzes at times. It was easy to look in the book or online for the answers. Besides that, I don't really feel like you could cheat on a test. Maybe unless you and a friend had the same teacher at different times? I feel like most teachers would change up the test though..

  Growing up we always did it on the day. We'd go to everyone's house. It would have been my dad's aunts house, my mom's parents and then end it with my dad's dads house.

   tbh kids shouldnt be allowed into fancy restaurants or babies into theaters
  ","
  I can agree more with fancy ones but I was thinking more casual dining. Chances are the kids would barely eat their food, want something less fancy, probably not behave. Would be a hassle in the end. That should be more of a date night away from the kids. Nothing wrong with a family dinner elsewhere though.
  
  Babies, maybe not. They should be more on a schedule instead of at the movies? I was thinking more of kids like Hayley's age or older.

  I guess if the kid is really young and still has contact with the dad.
  
  If the kid is older they should decide what to do.
  
  I wouldn't buy anything really pricy. Also why not just have the kid make him something instead? I don't think you need to lie about it though. Think it would be obvious on who got the gift depending on the child's age.

  *full length mirror
  
  because it would be good for the gym and seeing results. The bathroom mirror only goes to my shoulders. I only really see my body at the gym or other places with mirrors. I think it's one of the big reasons why I feel like my body is weird at times, especially when other people tag me in stuff.. it makes me look 3x bigger than I feel like/see and other stuff. Its also been annoying sneaking into my sister's room to use their mirror for the 1stphorm challenge to take transformation pictures.
  
  It will make me take pictures more. know if outfit looks ok.
  
  its hard for me to take pictures when I can't see what I'm really doing. I hate the front facing camera too. also its too close up when I try taking selfies and just isn't cute or accurate like a mirror pic would be?

  - Just continue with weight loss. I might need to go to the doctor again to get checked out and more medication for my pcos. Last time they gave me two refills without going to the doctor. Hopefully will be that way again instead since I don't like doctors. Would be nice to have my weight be recorded since the last time I went in June though.
  
  - I also really need to be better at communication with friends. My best friend gave me a birthday greeting and said how she missed me. Another one commented how she hasn't seen me in years on it. (We reconnected on FB) I've just been in Maine or Arizona so obviously been harder to see them but ya.. opened my eyes to that more. It obviously works both ways though!!!
  
  - I need a better job

  It was good overall. Very chill Sunday. Got the Italian food delivered. Talked with my dad and brother over the phone. Watched some of The Sound of Music with my mom. Had some nice chats with some people on here/elsewhere.
  
  Did the cake. Had those trick sparkler candles. Yes, it was. Was from a box but she made it more professional like. Also added mayo instead of the oil and it was more moist. Can't taste the mayo in it, luckily.
  
  orgasm..

   How many times a day do you eat food and are you disciplined when it comes to food consumption?
  ","
  Either 3 meals or 2 meals and some snacks. I eat under the 2000 calorie amount. I aim for 1740. Sometimes I eat under that. Sometimes I don't have a lunch so the snacking occurs. Usually healthy stuff anyways. Eating junk makes me feel bad overall.
  
  I believe in moderation. Good with the bad. Obviously limit certain items too or smaller portion sizes.
  
  I'm fat because of pcos, not really from what I eat. Insulin resistance. My weight is still high even if i look and feel way smaller. I've lost 21.5 pounds since June.
  
  you and that anon from earlier can go b!tch somewhere else.

   If you dream that you’re about to die, your brain releases adrenaline so it usually wakes you up. I’ve also heard that it’s because your brain doesn’t know the experience of death so that’s why you wake up before actually dying lol

   In my opinion the worst thing a woman can do is cheat on a man, I’ve been cheated on in the past and I felt so angry and betrayed, I especially hate it when they’re smug about it, that’s why I won’t get into a relationship again is because if a woman cheats on me again it will be the final straw.

  I remember part of last night's dream. This kid said he liked me in front of two other boys. I don't think he noticed i was there since seemed more like a private conversation. Then I woke up. I didn't know any of the people and we all seemed pretty young in it. was at a school. I also had to swim across to the table we were at... was odd.

   I may have been off on the hips thing. Most of them actually have nice shaped hips. I was  going off of a Victoria's Secret special from a couple years ago where most of them had Angelina Jolie hips. But still they're under weight and most of them have eightish out of 10 faces
  ","
  Halsey was the best part
  "
519882,"
   It's funny how Halsey is better looking than all of the models. she is very good looking but still. When it comes to models it's like they look for beautiful yet boring looking faces, manly hips that don't stick out, and 20 pounds under ideal weight I don't get it

  It's been ok. Ended up putting a gift card into amazon and buying a present for my sister and husband. Their tea cabinet is a disaster so got one of those clear containers with the dividers to put the tea in for Christmas.

  Was it in front of the other people or later on??
  
  A. make the scene worse by calling names back. It can be quite childish. A grown adult should know better. Also to call their child ugly is a reflection on themselves. Most likely drunk??
  
  B. walk away. pick your battles.
  
  C. move out asap if it's been really bad and could afford to. You seem pretty young if you actually care what he says..

  6th- my sister's birthday. Went to the hibachi restaurant

  Kind of. Like the house is all decorated, I've listened to Christmas music. Gone to a Christmas event. I guess the feeling comes and goes. I only really care about snow on Christmas day so I'm fine in that aspect.
  
  I'm excited for tonight! This guy went full out with the decorations. Got tons of hot chocolate.  Used cvp pipe to make candycanes with.  Made a cactus with led lights and a snowman one. It's basically going to be like Christmas Story with the whole light celebration.

  it wouldn't be then. That's more of a one night stand kind of thing.

  to be healthier, actually like what I see, buy more clothing at any store i want. Not be the fat friend or family member. because I've been skinny and then had allergic reaction and had to get steroid shot, gained weight very quickly which most likely has to do with the pcos too. Why would I go to the gym, exercise, eat better and all that to get fatter??? Been there, done that.. don't want to be big my whole life.
  
  I still want boobs, butt, thighs but the stomach and arms can go away. I have insulin resistance so its not cute.
  
  118-130 would be ideal. They are healthy bmi's for my height and age. it all depends how i feel and look like. muscle weighs more than fat too.

  4 pancakes because you can stab them up there with the pencils.

   the friendzone one i seen it since yesterday

  I answered it earlier
  "
520299,"
   I promise i will try to do that .. really thank you so much , in a simple way you made me feel little better .. No it's not seasonal depression , it's accumulation of negative feelings , thoughts and  attitudes I did not express . I hope that no one passes this
  ","
  no problem. it can be hell. only really went through once and it wasn't good :( I basically just isolated myself and didn't care about anything or myself. I'm glad I helped a little bit  <3
  
  I can get seasonal depression in the winter so figured I'd ask. luckily its not too bad.

   What do you think of companies who only hire the “ideal beauty” tall blonde etc?

  It can be annoying. I don't really keep track of that though, not healthy mindset. They would get so much money if more size inclusive. Is it really harder to add a little more fabric or show off relatable bodies?

  I feel like everyone handles depression differently. Talking about it, pushing yourself to get out and do something can help. Listen to music. Cuddle up and have a hot drink. Even being with friends. Maybe cbd oil or essential oils like peppermint can have calming effects. Light a candle. Watch a film. Know you can get out of the funk eventually. How bad is it? Seasonal depression?

520306,"
   Idk just persistently asking dumb questions or body questions
  ","
  The only bothersome one has been the person asking ""what"" to a lot of the questions that don't need further explanation.
