i also read that egotistical traits get stronger as you get older based on certain experiences . such as disliking other people who are succeeding , not be the center of attention , or constantly comparing themselves to others . my biggest thing is an ego sounds like textbook narcism . so , is narcism created from our egos or does narcism have a part in peoples egos ?","486549":"i really dont know lol maybe they will read this and let us both know lol"}}
