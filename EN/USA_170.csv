  Whole city is on lock down still, most restaurants are closed, main chains and popular local restaurants have changed hours so they close early, health department has came in and ordered no one is to open for the day unless they check their employees temperature before they clock in, stores are running out of stock or raising prices, had to go to nine different stores last week just to find toilet paper, playgrounds are being taped off with caution tape or having equipment purposely removed like the bridges kids run across, all bars and alcohol retailers are closed, restaurants are having u stay outside and bringing your food to you now or the tape on the floor stand 6 ft apart rule, no one is allowed to be driving unless its going to the store or somewhere essentially, cops are issuing tickets, my plans are being destroyed for holidays now... And not sure how christina is going to plan her gender announcement since we can't be all together in the family house for the party .... And since we are on lockdown it seems more people are getting stressed out with each other and acting out... A 23 year old got shot two night ago and someone committed suicide last night, (in cities outside of where I live). And then someone was walking at 2am and got shot... Walked to the hospital and a cool tried to get him for disobeying the governors laws

Like people who brag about buying a new house, some people cant afford to even have a suitable house and you're a terrible person to sit there and talk about it knowing they work hard or whatever

  Olivia has a son now I believe in the new season he's like 9 now. But in previous seasons she found him in a hotel room with these other kids that were kidnapped and none of them reacted back to the couples  or had any idea of who he belong to so he was placed in adoption. She had to continhe going to the hearings to see if a guardian stepped up but never did. So she was granted fostering to him and was going to adopt him but he had something wrong with him were he was hospitalized while the babysitter was taking care of him and she was going for Sargent at the time and the judge said that it was to much ... Then I believe they found his mother but she was like am escort who they put in a safe house away from her pimp but they somehow found her and dragged her down to the train yard and set her on fire ...

   I told you guys
   
    @NineGDxFour
   
   gave up her daughter. Selfish much.
  ","
  Its not selfish, you need to stop to think she probably considered this and that was the best thing to do. While many may be angry at her choice think about what she has to process? Especially if you started having a bond with the child. Giving away a child for adoption or whatever is hard for the birth parents, but deep down they also know that they're giving their child a chance at having/living a better life with someone who can provide those things that they couldnt for them. And im sure she will still get to see her from time to time. Maybe the money situation isn't the best right now? , maybe certain situations in relationships with others or themselves are not the best. We don't know what others are currently going through in life and we immediately judge based on one little detail we see. Maybe be kind and understand why she chose to do that and understand her situations before calling her selfish

  Well me and her are the only introverted girls in our family for starters. And we are so alike but so different and get along so well.

We always share a room when at hotels  bc we understand and know how to deal with eachother perfectly. I always know I can keep things real or honest with her and she won't be offended ahah.

  Its not just the elderly at risk. Its infants who are in the womb or few days old even months that can be infected, children who have illnesses like cancer. Young adults or anyone with health issues are also high risk, this goes for people with asthma and so on. It may be just a ""cold"" to you but its something ""deadly"" to them.

   In your own opinion, can the Covid-19 be cured with lockdowns and hand sanitizers or will we have to live with it - like the common flu?

  I feel there's nothing that's just going to make it vanish even with medication, isolation, lock downs. Its still out there amd exist and like most things like the chicken pox etc. One person can get it and boom another outbreak or just that one person gets it.

  I always miss dani, I shared a room with her since the moment she was born up to 16. Then it was only me and her in the family house as the only girls up to 18. We did everything together, she's my baby sister and my best friend and it absolutely sucks not having her here to share new milestones and memories with in the band anymore. But I know she's trying to figure out who she's meant to be and what she loves. And we have invited her over or asked her to tag along but she just has other things to do ... And right now its hard to see or hang out with people with this corona virus going around and things being closed and shut down and people social distancing etc.
  "
912760,"
   Some of the stuff he says or does it shouldn't bother anybody I see him do it and I'm not losing sleep over it my everybody's making such a big deal especially about them being married oh well get used to it or get over it.
  ","
  The only fuss I seen is the fact that he knows he has younger audiences following him and that's not something kids should be seeing especially fans of dani bc of the image she has which is drastically seeming to change quickly. Also fans are worried about her safety BC emmyn can come off cocky and like he's controlling.  But it is Dani's life and she can handle herself, like I said previously the door never closed on her and still remains open. She's just trying to figure out who she is and seems lost. Maybe she thinks she somehow disappointed the family I don't really know what's going on in her mind and all I can say is if you need someone to talk to, as her sister and best friend I'm here to listen

  Here's a tip don't be a cocky dude just BC you think the whole pandemic is a joke knowing you're best mate and band member is at a high risk BC he has asthma and you want to play around and go out in large gatherimgs and being a total douche. I do not blame him for packing up his belongings and going home at least he's safe. While you continue to think its a joke, you need to stop and figure you're not the leader, you did not build the band. Blair and your mate did, you can be replaced and learn a tough lesson as well

   You say that you feel that God knows what is right and wrong. Could I ask you to clarify what you mean by ""feel""?

   I had this stuffed animal who I would bring everywhere, even to the bathroom (lmao I know, but I was 6), and then I lost her when I was 9 and I was so upset, like, I would cry for days on end, but then sometime when I was 14, my mom found her but I feel no emotional attachment towards her. Normal?
  ","
  Its a comfort thing or the thing that makes you feel safe and soothes you. Normal in everyone, some people its their blanket others a person or object that helps them feel relaxed and calmed. For me I have to sleep with my favorite blanket weather its hot or cold. But once you loose those things your brain adjusts to it and finds something else to fill the void that you rely on.

  "
913285,"
   Why do some people think this is a fake account
  ","
  Because they expect people to post proof every time they disagree with someone, or because I'm always active on here. Let me clear this up I'm not a ""CeLeBRitY"" like justin bieber or whatever. Im well known, I'm a band member, a singer, a songwriter, and a popular youtube sensation who got my start to ""fame"" ten years ago when our cover of ""party in the usa"" went viral. But since we went independent and broke away from the toxic la music industry and record label we haven't been that important to those big music producers etc. And we have to run our buisness ourselves which gives us time to be active on social media and other things

   Do you think ex-spouses have their say in who the other former spouse is living with/dating when children are concerned?
  ","
  The only time they should be concerned is if the children are staying over or with that person. However if youre dating someone and have kids maybe introduce your partner and the ex to each other and let them talk about their priority when it comes to the children and all those things to ensure the children will be safe and take care of and get what they need from the  mom/dad as well not just the partners
  "
913442,"
   How much do your parents meddle in your friendships and relationships?
  ","
  Not much. My dad is kinda strict but once he meets you and actually knows you he's pretty good, my mom is just kind overall. I say my sisters are probably the most protective and my older brothers Michael and alex.

  (Switch the meaning around for like a guy ) Soft girl is a fashion style, popular among some young women on social media, based on a deliberately cutesy, feminine look. It often features pink and yellow colors, floral and heart patterns, oversized sweaters and plaid skirts, and heavy blush makeup. Being a soft girl also may involve a tender, sweet, vulnerable personality.

  To all my followers who actually support and love me,
  
  I may end up deactivating this account for a bit as I have been receiving many threats from people about killing me and my sisters, or people just stirring up drama and talkkng poorly about me because they have nothing better to do in life then worry about what others are doing with their lives or something on. Calling people fake when they never actually had a conversation with that person, never had any interaction what so ever and sending people's usernames around is very childish in my opinion. I'm trying my best not to let these things get to me but at times there comes a point when you had enough and you're just tired of dealing with it. I always try my best to be honest and open to all my followers and anyone who contacts me and remain kind.. I appreciate each and everyone of you who have supported me throughout the years and genuinely care for me. However if you actually want to continuing being in contavt with me please reply to this thread and ill gladly reply with socials 💖

  I really don't want to post this message but this week has been totally chaos and I wish I understood why or could stop this. I know the world is sick right now and annoyed, but that doesnt give anyone the right to attack me for no reason when I never even associated with you to begin with. Threatening someone that you're going to kill them is wrong?, sending false information around about someone is one, and spamming people with nonsense and calling them out is wrong. You guys are adults act like one and maybe learn to mind your own buisness and go about your day. Its okay to have an opinion about things but regardless if you don't agree with something or someone instead of attacking someone maybe just talk to the person before hand or choose to ignore it. I know the truth and I know who I am just like many others who have been brought into the hate do as well. .. And I don't always need to show ""proof"" just for one person to accept me when there is already so many.

  According to an article I read, in the main place of the outbreak Wuhan, they were celebrating because they finally got the cases down from 15,000 to 15. I just feel the media and the governors etc. Are being a bit over dramatic because so far there's only been a few who have tested positive. Just continue to wash your hands and wipe down anything before touching, cover your mouth and into ur arm when sneezing. If you feel ill dont go anywhere and stay home and quarantine.

Like I would have to pay 30% of my monthly income in child support not cost of living (health insurance included). as well as lose my home if I was married and I get no tax benefits and reduced time to see my child. And if I do not pay I go to jail.
  ","
  The mother has more rights to the children because they carried the child for 9 months etc. And most fathers only pay $20 a month which is not even enough to support a child

  "
914061,"
   ❤❤
  ","
  Alright let me confirm something:
  
  I was NEVER ENGAGED to christian!! Dont know where that rumor is coming from. I always saved photos of rings and even had like a future idea of a wedding olanned out since I was 12. Also yes it sucks feeling really comfortable with someone enough to release a music video with them in it, and even go public but its not the worst of things to worry about. Yes I un followed christian on instagram as did amy, dani and rachael. Sisters support sisters and rachael was one of the first who knew and has helped me get through that period as well as my therapist.  Also pleaseeeeee stop calling me lauren suray that is not a thing I enjoy at all. Yes beb has a stronger meanjng behind it because if you listen to the lyrics ""Suddenly I'm destroyed all BC of these brown eyed boys"", ""out ta sight, out ta mind"" ""crash & burn everytime"". Its not just about falling in love !!!  I waited to post it for a long time... I don't think I'm going to just delete a music video I worked hard on lol. DONT COMPARE ""running""  to  my actual relationships. Also acid rain connects with atom bomb but acid rain is not about christian ._. BEB also states "" masochism"" look at the definition, that relationship was NOT HEALTHY. The weekly posts I did were a deeper meaning and why I just stopped doing it all together. Anyway you guys have no idea what I been doing through and I'm done speaking about c.s now can we all just move on and let me heal and be happy with who I truly love ??

  Look I get it l, you miss her in the band or being active with the family. We miss having her around for the band related stuff and sometimes miss having her around for family outside.

But Im not going to beg her to come back or anything, lessons have to be learned the hard way.

  Thats why I'm careful what I post or whom I choose to go public with in relationships. Because I want to be a positive role model to the younger generation who look up to me 💖 dani & emmyn seem to have forgot that she spent 10 years in the band with us, those fans she has made through out the years have stuck with her even breaking away from the band because they want to see her continue on in life. And by posting your bare a.. On social media that doesn't set a positive influence to those young children. You want to be a grown up and have children right? Set the expectations of what you would your future children to see and read

   How to tell the difference between fake news and real news?
  ","
  Fake news is just rumors or lies that someone started where real news is real, backed up with evidence and facts and multiple people can prove it
  "
914411,"
   People need to learn respect. They don't need to know a woman's breast size. That should be private.

  I dont think so? Maybe food one time

914414,"
   Beard or moustache?
  ","
  On a guy I prefer beard but keep it like maintained and taken care of where its like a clean shave
  "
914415,"
   It was about that one girl talking bad about you.
  ","
  Oh !! I'm alright but its super annoying when an anon creates multiple accounts under different names to harass you over you and your sisters and gets mad because you won't release details about what size your breast are to them, and they somehow know you're addressed and tell you they're going to kill u...
  "
914416,"
   Would you rather live forever or live 10 times for 100 years?
  ","
  I feel like living forever would get boring because you would constantly have to make friends because all the ones you knew would be gone, you would have no family etc. But if I'm reborn every 10 years then I'll get to experience multiple decades and life styles

  "
914504,"
   Growing up the girls got the metal end of a belt and the boys had to pick their own switches. And then when my dad got real mad, he’d grab us up by our fore arms and scream in our faces.

But the whole house was just chaos and never a dull moment, someone got locked out onto the roof for over an hour, lots of arguing over whose team would win and meanwhile me, jordan and a few other friends were acting like little kid's chasing eachother outside and around the house with nerf guns. And we ran into the kitchen and my friend yelled duck and then jordan just gently wrapped his arms around me and held me ... Later that night it was just us up and we watched sponge Bob because we couldnt fall asleep and I just kissed him ...

  This is my boyfriend, Jordan. For some odd reason, some of you think I'm still with Tristen or have feelings for him still when I only care for him as a friend. I'm not with anyone else besides Jordan whom some of you know him. He makes me incredibly happy and always reminds me how beautiful I am, even when I feel I'm not looking so attractive that day or feeling like I am. He knows how to make me smile with one stupid word. I feel comfortable being my true self around him because even if its the most cringe worthy thing he still laughs it off. So here's to more cringy moments, watching spongebob for hours while the house is a total chaos and screaming 😂, to the random dance parties at night in the kitchen while cleaning and so much more. 😌

  I started this this about a year or so ago where it was just a segment I posted on my personal instagram page every week where I just updated about my life and things I did for that week. But I have started to become bored of doing it every week although I understand many people love hearing about my week. I started to also become inconsistant with it and wouldn't post for a few weeks so it was more like a monthly recap. I get bored of things pretty quickly and always need something new to interest me and right now I feel I just need to take a step back and find something that interests me and I enjoy doing  for the time that I stop doing that.

   You discover your wonderful one year old child you love is, because of a mixup at the hospital, not yours. Would you want to exchange the child to try to correct the mistake or keep them regardless?
  ","
  Blood doesn't always make family, in life you tend to surround yourself with people who are like family and eventually become family. And depending on the child who I had for a year or more they already are used to me, my voice, the way I hold them, the scent I have etc. And they're familiar with that. And not sure one year olds knkw love but they know you. I would keep the child that isnt mine because its my child, and my child that they raised is used to them and that's their parents. And I feel it would just cause more heartbreak and conflict trying to get them switched back for both families

  I'm not sure if they actually run in the family bc I'm not like familiar with ancestors etc. But I do know my mom was once pregnant with twins and sadly lost them BC of a bloodcotting disorder. But its strange because all of us girls have this connection where we know what eachother is thinking or certain looks. And then when dani was born they said me and her were most like the actual twins, however she's you get and doesn't look like me. I do have a birthday twin which is the oldest sister : christina, only being 8 years apart we celebrate our birthday on august 12th. And her baby is due in august so eveeyone is rooting for our birthday to make it like a triple birthday lol. But which is how I got my middle name christine.

  Hi baddies my name is Lauren!
  
  Definitely an introvert. I speak with my facial expressions more than I do with my words. I love art in every form; Music, painting, drawing, interior design, everything. I’m kind of like an onion. I got a lot of layers to me, but once you peel them all back, you got yourself some great flavor. I move very slowly and my biggest pet peeve is feeling like I have to rush anything. Some people call me a savage but I just tell it like it is. Check out my pics and vids and you’ll catch a vibe.

  I feel being the introvert I am it would be better to whisper because I'm quiet as is and wouldn't want to be known for being a loud introvert? I feel that would match more with an extrovert personality

   If you could eliminate any word from the dictionary, meaning no one can ever use it again, what word would you choose?
  ","
  I would eliminate the word ""perfect"" because there's no such thing as perfect but something that is good enough and worth it. Perfect to use is just a word we use when something is just as well want it. But just because we see something that is. Doesnt mean someone else may think the same. Their definition might be the perfect car they have stored in the garage, where yours is the children and wife you have. Which I feel the word ""perfect"" should just be eliminated because people feel they have to compete for something they already are

  Hi baddies my name is Lauren!
  
  Definitely an introvert. I speak with my facial expressions more than I do with my words. I love art in every form; Music, painting, drawing, interior design, everything. I’m kind of like an onion. I got a lot of layers to me, but once you peel them all back, you got yourself some great flavor. I move very slowly and my biggest pet peeve is feeling like I have to rush anything. Some people call me a savage but I just tell it like it is. Check out my pics and vids and you’ll catch a vibe.

  You’re worth it means so much to all of us❤️
  
  We are five individuals with very different personalities. Being sisters, we share a lot but we still fight our own battles. One struggle we all have in common is the journey of finding true self-love, compassion and self-worth. All five of us have struggled to find this. It’s not something you easily gain, but just like any other relationship, your relationship with you is built in small actions on a daily basis. How would you treat a friend or a person you loved? How would you talk to them? What would you do for them to show your love? Love is about the little things: choosing to speak with compassion instead of criticism. Giving yourself the time you need to rest and recover. Choosing to see the good in yourself and believe you deserve to be loved. These are the small, daily actions that create self-love. #youreworthit

  Just because the baby came out looking like his father more than you doesnt mean tje father cheated. Obviously because youre the one who carried the child in your stomach 😐 that's not how things work. You're the mother and he's the father.

   If I may ask, how are you able to open up to people? What have you done to help yourself to trust people to get to that point?
  ","
  I'll admit it was really hard for me to trust people and actually express how I felt for a while, but with great friends who been there through good and bad and a supportive family works a lot to be able to get those emotions out and trust them because they stayed by your side the whole time. Also going to therapy and having someone who listens and understands has been working great and helping me through a lot of things I just kept bottled up.

  It used to be difficult like really difficult. And at the time my doctor thought I had insomnia or wasn't eating enough of like iron or protein and had a vitamin issue or not a correct routine. So told me to just start eating more healthier, exercising have a decent routine every day and take vitamins as well as melatonin as needed for the nights I had trouble sleeping and if it didn't work try to read and drink tea etc. .. But I would hallucinate and hear things mostly when I was sleeping and would wake up started, and have like a congested feeling in my chest.. Which came to four months ago I finally figured what was wrong and have been on medication to help that.

  Make sure you have other things going on in your life and focus on your goals and dreams for yourself. You can't make someone like you and you shouldn't try to. You have to accept that this is how it is. If it's to much to handle talking to/ being around this person then you should stop talking to them, but if it's not like devastating to you, then just make sure you're focused on other things and don't get to caught up!! There's so much more to life than who you have a crush on!!!!! You deserve to spend your time on being your best self, not on beating yourself up for not being ""good enough"" for someone else. Girl you are more than good enough no matter who does or doesn't give you their attention!!!

   How often do you buy new clothes ? Do you wear clothes to their limit (i.e. until their colours start to fade or they're torn) ?
  ","
  I think everything few months I got and buy new clothes unless I see something that I really like at the time and I know I'll never find something similar to it, or its something I don't have and need at the time like for a music video or an event. Other wise I tend to wear it until it doesnt fit anymore, my style changes, or it begins to rip and that

   Andy Warhol is one of my favorites along with Monet. And I love abstract. I have done three pop arts. One of Dolly, Gaga, and just finished one of you. And I love to oil paint! And I agree with the emotions being shown through the art work. If you’d like I will show you my latest oil painting.
  ","
  I wouldnt mind looking at it and the artist I was thinking was bansky 😂
  "
916805,"
   Does it bother you if I put the , “ If I may ask?” ? I know this is an app where I am supposed to ask questions. But it’s more of a respect thing. Like when we talk to our elders ya know? Yes/no ma’am; Sir.
  ","
  No it doesnt really bother me, I feel its just a way of you being curious but respectful at the same time. Which many people now a days just don't even bother to consider how their curiosity can affect someone at the time. Like for example: I recently been dealing with things and would rather go through it in private with only myself, family, therapist and friends knowing and you have those people that are like I wonder what this meant, omg I haven't seen ____ in her posts are they still together, did they break up and people that are like I'm glad ____ is not there they make her sad and always hurt her etc.
  "
916806,"
   Who is your favorite artist? Like a painter. And what is your favorite piece of art work?
  ","
  I dont think I really have a favorite to be honest. I loved more of like the graffiti and abstract pieces of art which was like andy warhol and I forgot his name but I think it was like bas___ something his work was interesting to me. I feel like anything with a story behind it that expressed what they were feeling at the time they were creating is what interests me. I love art in like every form, whether its poetry, stories, drawings, paintings, songs  or just a piece of old history.
  "
916807,"
   Just from like on here, are you able to somewhat gather the type of person I am? I remember when I watched one of yours and your sisters videos for the first time I was able to pick out each of your guys personality. I think I was a little off on Amy and Kath.
  ","
  I feel a lot of people tend to get me and christina mixed up or Lisa's lol. And I can somewhat pick up on what type of person you are but not fully.
  "
916808,"
   Are you good at reading people? Usually for the most part I am. I come from a big family myself, there’s 13 of us, but it’s kinda of hers, his, mine and ours. But all blood related. And I always know when one of my sisters are sick, hurt, or pregnant.
  ","
  I come from a family of 13 as well (it continues to grow because my sisters are married, engaged and only myself and amy are single. We also have brothers lol). And like my parents can tell when something is not right with us but were their children whom they raised so... But like with my brothers I feel the older ones michael & and alex can read us a lot where the younger : christian,nick and joey really can't. But between us girls we knowww when something is off because we have like a really special bond that a lot of people don't have or understand. Like all we have to do is give a certain look and we all know what it meant. And we kinda knew something was up with christina before she announced she was pregnant (before loosing). Because she was like not feeling well and its rare for christina to ask for time off
  "
916809,"
   Oh, sorry. It basically means that even after death life continues. So depending on like your perspective it can mean a few different things.  But you’ve mentioned you’re Catholic and I was just curious. My family don’t really have a religion. But we believe in God and Heaven and all that.
  ","
  In a way I feel that after you pass your get like re birthed or recarnated so basically like our birth marks if we have one are how we died in our previous life and we tend to forget it because our new life takes over and fills the darkness of those void memories

   never dated
  ","
  Gonna get a lot of backlash on here for stating the truth. But you think if someone dated there would be at least one photo of them together considering they're both in the public eye and there isn't even one?? There's not even an article stating they were hanging out or spotted together. Y'all can lie all you want but as soon as one of their ""people that they claim they are"" come forward and expose their relationship suddenly that person they're ""dating"" disappears and their focus is on who the person been talking to the entire time. Kian let's pull all the receipts up k... Because I know kian Personally unlike you guys. Back in 2011, Kian Lawley was rumored dating Jenn McAllister. The rumors swirled around when he tweeted I Love You to her in his Twitter account in August 2011. The two went out for a couple of years and then broke up.
  
  According to rumors, Jenn’s friend, Andrea Russett was responsible for their breakup. Andrea Russett is also an actor and YouTuber like her. After Kian met Andrea, they started hanging out. They also did a lot of collaborative videos on their channel. The duo began dating each other back in 2013 and decided to go separate ways in June 2014. Fans came to know about their break up through her social media. She made a public announcement on Twitter that the pair were no longer together. The fans were devastated to hear the news, but they were happy to know that they were still friends. Following the break up with Andrea, Kian started hooking up with Alexandria Schneck. She posted a screenshot of her messages with him in which he complimented her tattoos. After that, she posted a picture of them together lying in bed on her snapchat.
  
  It wasn’t confirmed what happened between Kian and Alexandria, but the two suddenly stopped seeing each other. In late 2016, Kian started dating model, Meredith Mickelson. Their relationship with each other wasn’t confirmed until her sister went on social media to talk about how her sister was a better girlfriend to him than Andrea.
  
  Before Kian, Meredith was in a relationship with Ethan Dolan. Kian and Meredith started dating in 2016. Their relationship was criticized as she was underage. In October, she posted a photo of them kissing in New York City. In April 2017, the couple decided to call it quits and went their separate ways. The two hasn’t been in touch since then.
  
  Kian Lawley is currently in a relationship with his girlfriend, Ayla Woodruff. They have been together since early 2019 and are still blissfully in a relationship!! Kian was single for those time periods and olivia o brien and him never dated the end
