trail almost miles at least . there was a tobacco field , a small cemetery , this big empty spot then this old barn at the very end of the trail . there was thankfully workers in the tobacco field so we knew once we reached safety . so me and a friend was walking this trail talking , we stopped at the cemetery , detoured to the nearby river on one side of the trail kind of a little wooded area and just kept walking . we loved adventure and exploring so we was just gonna go to the end of the trail and turn and go back . well at the end as i said there was a barn . we stopped before we got there about feet or so and we just got this awful feeling all around us , just dread and fear . we started looking around like what are we so scared of . suddenly we look at the barn and there s a body just hanging from the barn that wasn t there before , but it was see through . me and my friend just counted to three and ran the whole way back . we didn t stop until we hit the middle of the tobacco field and the workers just looked at us like whats wrong with you ? ? ? when we hit the field we stopped running and just kept walking and we got through the fence gate and just stopped like we re safe now ! we stopped and got our breath and took a minute to think about what the hell we just saw . once we had collected our thoughts enough to be calm we just walked to the house and found my friends mom . thankfully neither of us have been back to that house again in years though . i heard its hauntings finally took over and the family that lived there had to move out and it was placed as not for sale by the nearby realty companies .","196158":"not the best but its ok","196159":"oh always","196160":"november","196161":"hi","196162":"nope not at all , couldn t pay me to get on one that

happens","196270":"frizzy , dry wavy , there is no in between , its either straightened or matted","196271":"i lose my phone on a daily basis because my couch likes to eat it","196272":"thank you","196273":"no but ive had several uti s , birthed kids and explored my body s causes and have gotten to know quite a lot of information","196274":"no not unless there is an std or infection going on","196275":"i recommend seeing an obgyn and being checked for any issues involving the vagina","196276":"not always unless they share the same toy","196277":"after we collided","196278":"that is very very important for women s health","196279":"well only if they cross contaminate their vaginal bacteria without being checked for anything unnatural in the vagina","196280":"symptoms of an unbalanced vagina is common infections , like uti , bacterial vaginosis , and a few other common infections , symptoms can be anything from vaginal itching , discoloration of underwear and pee , odd smell coming from the pee , vaginal burning and a lot more","196281":"not all bacteria is bad , the only time to be worried about going down is when the woman has a infection or std","196282":"i dont have a partner but unless a woman has an infection that can be spread through sex it is highly unlikely that a man can get an infection from her , the reason women can get infections from one another so easily is because we have different systems like for me i have birth control , am common to uti s and most likely have a unbalanced ph balance if i was to use someone else s underwear i could easily get a uti and if i dont already have an unbalanced ph then using someone else s underwear could cause my balance to get messed up","196283":"there s a difference between going down on a woman and sharing panties with one , going down is not as much of a risk as sharing panties because panties can cause you to go from normal vagina to unbalanced vagina , going down isn t a risk unless the other woman has an infection or something going on down there","196284":"that is the best idea","196285":"i have done research on it because i used to not discolor underwear but when i became of age to use birth control and started taking it it started discoloration , its not that anything bad is going on just a sign that something different is happening within our bodies","196286":"i recommend if you are stuck at a place with no change of underwear and have to use someone else s always put a sanitary pad in the underwear or if possible buy a new pack of underwear even if they aren t the prettiest","196287":"men are less likely to discolor because they dont have visible bacteria like moisture","196288":"yeah if you turn it off of anonymous","196289":"discoloration is due to the bacteria that a woman releases yes","196290":"some women are lucky and dont have strong bacteria and some women do , it can also be signs that women have something going through their system like birth control or an infection , sometimes it can mean an off ph balance or that the woman doesn t have a healthy diet , women s vaginas have a lot to say honestly , its just watching for the signs","196291":"no i dont go that place with women , and because have you ever looked at old underware , washed and seen discoloration around the vaginal area , that is signs of remaining bacteria , and yeah some women dont have underwear like that but i know several that do have discoloration due to remaining bacteria","196292":"for me , panties just hold more bacteria and cross contaminating vaginal bacteria can be a bad thing","196293":"i could see doing a bra but idk about panties but only if its someone im close to","196294":"my baby lacey . this baby absolutely loves kisses and snuggles and cuddles , just over all a very lovey baby . she loves being loved on and held .","196295":"nothing , it was just the same as any other day really really stupid .","196296":"i dont really have anything","196297":"i can name several but my favorite is after we collided","196298":"not sure honestly","196299":"i only follow like legit people , i dont have to unfollow anyone","196300":"i

brand","196302":"someone solid . i want trust , commitment . i want someone who loves me and spends a bit of time with me . i want someone loyal . i don t ask for much in a relationship","196303":"some do but i personally dont like that , i like being with someone and it being just him , just me and him and no one else , it gives you the best feeling being loved by someone that you love as well","196304":"i dont honestly know","196305":"no","196306":"no i dont","196307":"hello","196308":"definitely supernatural","196309":"geez , this one isn t easy honestly , so much negative right now . i m gonna say be positive with me . not compliments but just positive talking . at least for now until i get to a better mental state . then im gonna have to discover what makes me truly smile at that point","196310":"i cry it out and break down then pick myself up and move forward","196311":"yeah","196312":"cook , it s what i do best above other styles of art or anything but my passion is photography","196313":"never leave someone for someone else , its truly sad and heart breaking . coming from someone who s been left for someone better looking it truly

school was parents of pep club sending us off , all the football parents was in the train behind us , i remember me and my friends was on the second to last bus . the whole ride to caverna was mostly calm but once we seen the school appearing in the windows it got loud , and i mean loud . screaming at the top of our lungs the hart county motto , there was nothing left to be heard . as we entered the rival teams gates all hell broke lose and all you could hear was go home you re gonna lose leave while you can and so much more . i remember we unloaded the bus and painted up , we had red white and blue all over us and my favorite thing to do was paint my jeans with hart county going down my legs . beginning of the game comes and they set off smoke in america s colors . that night was so loud i can remember mocking the cheer leaders and also following their cheers and dancing all night till the game was over . when our team won that field was crowded with all of hart county s team members and even some prayers were said . on the way out the gate so many profanities were thrown at us but it felt good , i still have some pictures from that night , it was amazing . the photo below

turning out nicely","196560":"she s finally gotten over them , but yeah i understand why she got them with some of the things that it shows , that s enough to scare any young child","196561":"my father never has really been one on advice but he has taught me many things like the best way to cut wood with a axe , how to live like my heart wasn t shattered , he s shown me what a true man is , i can only hope to one day find someone like him , always kind and never lets people disrespect his family while also remaining calm and not causing a fight , he s taught me how to rotate my tires and change my oil , he s still working on teaching me how to change my breaks but only because i m slow at vehicles . he s taught me when it comes to vehicles check for quality , not the best price tag , it may be expensive and new but not of good quality always do research and find quality , he s taught me a lot over the years . advice may be somewhere in that but i look at those as lessons not preachings , things that will help me in life instead of something ill probably ignore or forget","196562":"work for myself incredibly hard , i want to make it in my life","196563":"kid friendly","196564":"that they were proud of me , all i ever saw in their eyes was disappointment , brought home trophies and medals and still i cold never do it in what they wanted me to

said alright but start on proving yourself only for months later to be cheated on again then blocked before i could fully discover , but lucky me the bastard forgot to block my mom so while he thinks he s left me clueless i know it all and have full closure , so thank you to jordan q . of illinois for being a freaking wimp , you have helped me to push myself to start my own graphic design company

kids uncle introduced it to me around season maybe and i loved it but got so curious about what happened to make sam and dean chase these awful creatures everywhere , so i went back to the first episode and so far i have made it up to season but had to stop watching it , my daughter started getting bad nightmares from the monsters now i only get to see it when the kids are away which is very rare . i get her fear though i was scared at first myself but dakota made me sit through it with him in order for help with house chores , its funny to think back to it now .

until i get into the kitchen to fix it , then its whatever i feel like making","196591":"hi","196592":"yes , i have forgiven him , but at the same time i don t want him back in my life , and if i was to see him id probably slap him , but only if he tried talking to me like he didn t do anything .","196593":"rallys or cheddars","196594":"what do you have in common with her , talk about shared interest , find something that makes her really happy to talk about let her just talk and express her feelings but also show interest and try to find a way to communicate that you re listening to her as she talks","196595":"no , i m not gonna let my kids see me cry over it , they dont understand something is wrong right now do they dont need to worry about me , i can save my sadness until they go to bed","196596":"no one knows yet but i actually did my design bear claw based on the legend mama bear , so fierce , strong , and majestic . a momma bear will never back down when trying to protect her cubs , i did that design for me and all moms who do the best they can for their kids , those who truly feel like the battle is getting the best of them but they still fight just for their cubs .","196597":"its not from today , but i m too upset to do a new one tonight sorry","196598":"not huge on them but they are good for southern professionalism , shows a sign of rank depending on the business down here","196599":"i want some so bad","196600":"no cyber bullying , no explicit language like cussing , no explicit images like nudes or something that shows violence towards another , not entirely sure but i know thats the main focus point","196601":"sometimes yes , other times no , depends on the situation , who it is im with .","196602":"i dont know yet maybe just one maybe up to three","196603":"thanks for doing this free space shout out , its really appreciated in times like this","196604":"sorry i saved this ask for a few days but i m glad i did because i want to raise awareness on this issue , even if you trust them , sometimes they still can t be trusted with your kids , sad part is i know she knows how to , shes in her late s and raised maybe of her own , i just hope her kids got better treatment than she did mine today , i could never do that to someone else s kids","196605":"in my future yes but not yet , i want to enjoy the two i have , and i want to make sure that the next ones will be with someone who will love them and my oldest kids , someone who won t try to drop out when things get hard","196606":"so i saved this ask since i felt i didn t have anything but now i do . i want to talk about how truly bad babysitters have become today , used to a mom could easily leave her kid at a friends house and not have a single worry , now its terrifying to think about someone watching your kids . will they feed them , will they cuddle them , will they tend them . i came home today to something horrible and im upset , my mom and i ran errands today , didnt want to take the kids because the car has no heat , no big deal my uncles girlfriend can watch them , no it was a huge deal . my mom and i were gone for hours , came home the kids hadn t been feed , but damn sure that she had ate cause a big bowl was in the sink with a fork , baby had only had two sips of milk because the woman didn t want to heat it , the oldest had only one cup today and by time we got home and went to refill it the empty cup smelled sour , but yet there was still perfectly good cups in the fridge untouched , for both kids , when i left there was cups per girl left in that fridge to span through the day , only one was gone from each and as stated previously one cup was bad and the other was full but untouched because the baby doesn t take her cups cold , not only that but she let the fire go out in the wood stove , this house was easily as cold as that car , and she didn t dress them when they woke up so here was diaper underwear clad kids in a cold house their body s cold , i felt like crying and still do , i could scream my head off until i had no voice left and still have anger and sadness left in me .","196607":"thanks","196608":"my girls are a sense of protection , kept me out of trouble when opportunity after opportunity arose , instead i turned that down to be here for my girls because they needed me","196609":"honestly not sure , i know that absence of beauty makes people upset sometimes and jealous . not having beauty gets people picked on sadly , or makes them idolize these picture perfect women , which isnt entirely a bad thing but sometimes its unrealistic , makes people think ill never be like them so im ugly , when truly no ones ugly .","196610":"hi there","196611":"honestly it was good until an hour after i got home now im extremely pissed and could scream my head off and still have anger left , i hate babysitters but sadly i have to have them sometimes","196612":"single mom life","196613":"yeah i know , they weren t planned but they are my greatest blessing , they kept me safe , if not for them i d probably be in a worse situation than i am now . my situation isn t due to them currently its due to some mistakes i made along the way but my girls give me hope for my future","196614":"yes actually","196615":"anything chicken","196616":"id say hardin scott from the book after not the movie , the book gives him

your hopes your dreams , but trust is also hiding certain things , parts of you that would make anyone run out on you until you build confidence in that trust , yes you can trust someone with your life but if you dont have confidence in that trust then you could be trusting the wrong person , learned that a few years back , but also trust has another form i call it reverse trust , where while you trust someone sometimes you have to trust yourself to not say too much , while intentions may seem for the good , sometimes those pure intentions can lead you down a path that wasn t meant to be taken so sometimes its better to not say something than to say too much and stir more problems , that s always been a problem with me , i say too much then it comes back to hit me in the face

showed him an unwatermarked copy , so he is still my design to upgrade and work with , sniper skull has other versions but this is the only one thats worth showing because the snipers aren t in odd

more and revising his name to match his future upgrades","196985":"thank you","196986":"yes black is my calming color , it soothes me it brings me peace , thats why when i was a teen i painted my

was with my ex and he had the idea of starting a youtube channel and needed the profile pic and logos and everything , and even though i knew it wasn t happening i said well let me see what i can do , downloaded a few apps that looked good for graphic design then went to bed bc this was at at night , well then wake up and he says well is going to be doing our design now i said no she isn t because you haven t even seen what i can do , just give me a bit and ill have you a selection so i took from the design i knew he wanted for a tattoo and it was a skull , so i got to work , had different skulls drawn out , said here pick one we ll go from there , picked the easiest one of course bc he s a simpleton , so copied it onto other blank pages , then came gamer skull i drew headphones on it then added a mic in , well he didn t like that , then came skull and pistols , classic design that a lot of artist do , well that was too normal for him , then did ar nope not good enough so during all this i kept asking what do you want , what do you want to see in these , he wasn t telling me so i got on his facebook because the dumbass gave it to me and read through his and conversation he wanted freaking snipers , of course a sniper so then was born sniper skull still wasn t good , took different styles of snipers and although this took a month its still beautiful for me because if it wasn t for all that i wouldn t be doing graphic design and making it my work","197023":"yes my aunt barbra , my aunt martha , my brother earl and my papaw","197024":"chinese its amazing"}}
