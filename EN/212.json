She THOUGHT he was anyways...\n  \n  Well, one day when her kids were upstairs playing while she was doing laundry, she heard a scream from the attic where her kids had been playing pretend in front of their huge bay windows. She rushed upstairs to find that even though she\u2019d thought she\u2019d locked it, the giant windows were flung open, but both kids were safe and sound sitting on the floor as usual. She asked them what had happened and her daughter replied that she was playing by the window and pressed up against the old glass to look out on the yard but it opened and she fell out and screamed! My aunt was confused because her daughter was obviously right there, and was unhurt, so she asked how she\u2019d gotten back inside and why she wasn\u2019t injured and her daughter told her she was okay because the \u201cnice man\u201d had saved her.\n  \n  My aunt thought she was just exaggerating or just playing pretend again so she locked the window and went downstairs to keep doing laundry. My dad then told me that she said she needed to put another load of dirty laundry into the machine, so she opened the basement door where it was located and turned on the light to go down the stairs and put it in but stopped dead in her tracks when she saw a strange, tall, man dressed in blue whom she\u2019d never met standing at the base of the stairs and smiling up at her. It scared her to death and she dropped the dirty laundry and slammed the door shut! When she reopened it a minute later he was gone.

For clarification, again, ingesting livestock steroids is TERRIBLE for your health and an EXTREMELY DUMB idea.\n  \n  It has been clinically tested and will give you heart problems and chest pain, makes your testicles smaller and causes your body to produces less testosterone, causes erectile dysfunction, drops sperm count, can cause you to break a hip at random due to a condition called \u201caseptic necrosis of the femoral head\u201d, may increase your chances of going bald, and can possibly cause crazy mood swings (also dubbed roid rage).\n  \n\n  All in all, avoid steroids or \u201cjuicing\u201d or whatever people call it.

Just like mules, zorses are also born sterile and are unable to reproduce due to the mismatch in number, shape, and size of chromosomes present in their bodies resulting from having two different species as parents.\n  \n  As far as surviving in the wild, I\u2019m not sure. Since there are no wild zorses to study, horses and wild zebras don\u2019t share the same natural habitat, and matings between the two species do not occur naturally, I\u2019m most inclined to say a zorse wouldn\u2019t fare well on its own in the wild and would most likely fall victim to predation pretty quickly.\n  ","228541":"\n  Anything healthy.
