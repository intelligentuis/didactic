tendency to abandon my personal goals because i lose the motivation to complete them , haha .","267343":"i don t usually make new year resolutions . if i want to start a goal and stick it through , then i can make that at any point during the year .","267344":"i try not to think about work when i m not working , and i also try not to allow my personal life affect my professional life

brutality , etc etc .","267347":"a partner for life , because in ideal scenarios , they do end up becoming your best friend as well .","267348":"facebook , twitter , instagram , askfm , and snapchat .","267349":"yeah , but my skills have gotten rusty over the years .","267350":"ugh yeah they capped the line maybe people behind me because that s all they could take for the day , which is so wild . i got a buttered bagel and an iced coffee , lol .","267351":"yeah , the cases where i live jumped up to like positive rate , which is terrifying . at least i don t have to wait in the cold for the next hour or so , rofl . i was also able to pick up my meds and get breakfast , so that was good .","267352":"uh , all of it ? lmfaoo .","267353":"back when i used to commute , i would listen to music

ll see , i m taking a covid test today .","267362":"i was asleep at am , haha .","267363":"home i was at the covid testing site all morning just waiting , and my prospective appointment time isn t for another . hours , so i returned home in the meantime . sigh .","267364":"i got to the testing site at am , and i just got to the front of the line to give them my name and number it s am . they said i probably won t get a call until noon , so i m heading home in the meantime .","267365":"he did once very early on in our relationship , but i forgave him then . he didn t cheat on me towards the end , and the breakup was amicable . his feelings towards me just dwindled , unfortunately , and it took me a long time to accept that and learn not to blame myself for it .","267366":"that thought definitely crossed my mind , tbh . we did drift apart a lot in the last few months to a year we were dating , and honestly , our connection has been a lot stronger ever since we broke up .","267367":"cont . . . symptoms ? ? unless ofc you have underlying conditions or something u don t rly talk about . i only got a sore throat and lost my voice . i hope the best for u i don t have any underlying conditions , besides the fact that i drink and vape . as of tonight , i feel okay but also my roommate who s positive felt fine up until last night when he lost his sense of smell and taste . i m not overly concerned about myself , but depending on when i was exposed if i am positive , it could possibly mean i exposed it to my family on christmas eve . but idk , that was last week and if anything , something would have probably happened by now .","267368":"she s my other roommate s cousin . i had only met her previously a few times prior to her moving in , but she s a very open and friendly person .","267369":"idk , i m more leaning towards no at this particular moment again , because i think he still needs to grow and not be afraid of commitment . but the future is uncertain , so who knows how i ll feel in months or years from now . he s always had a special place in my heart obviously , but right now , we re much better off as friends .","267370":"him and i never fought really in the first place , lol . we both had our mood swings angry moments , but we normally didn t direct them towards each other . as for why he s better as a friend right now , i don t think he was fully ready for commitment while we were dating which is why we never moved in together or got engaged .","267371":"it s difficult to say , because i guess it depends really on the timeline . at the moment , we re better off as close friends as opposed to being in a relationship , mainly because i think he s still in the process of figuring himself out what he wants and needs , his perspectives on love , etc etc . he s been dating someone else now for a while although they ve had their fights and disagreements , this relationship seems to be teaching him a lot at least from my outside perspective .","267372":"one of my roommates . she s young , but she s already one of the strongest people i know . her and i are extremely similar personality wise and mental illness wise , rofl and we ve gotten along brilliantly ever since she moved in . she s also endured significant trauma in her life starting from a very young age , and was absolute hell for her . i m glad she s living with us now , it s pretty much offered her a fresh start and she seems a lot more content now compared to before she moved in with us .","267373":"seeing my friends get harassed by anons . obviously my friends can hold their own , but some of the things said to them that i ve seen are downright cruel ridiculous .","267374":"i d rather be cremated , or perhaps composted because it s more environmentally friendly .","267375":"i admire him for pretty much the same things he s endured a lot of trauma and mental physical health conditions , but despite all of that , he s a very motivated and driven person . he always puts into his work . additionally , he s probably one of the most intelligent people i know .","267376":"i d definitely say something it s wrong and hurtful for people who actually do have those conditions , and that person is basically trying to profit off of sympathy when they shouldn t be sympathized with at all . it s manipulative af .","267377":"yes , that sounds delightful .","267378":"her inner strength even after enduring trauma and losing loved ones year after year . despite everything she s been through , she s been so successful in her personal and professional life , and i m so proud of her for moving forward with her life getting married , moving out of new york , and soon trying to conceive with her husband .","267379":"years ago , i d say so . but after living with two and then four cats for over a year , i ve learned to love cats as well . they all have such unique personalities and they re the sweetest animals i ve ever met .","267380":"watching my friends persevere through struggles and come out better on the other side it gives me hope for myself , knowing that some things aren t impossible .","267381":"i think so many people have said this already , but the parent trap remake with lindsey lohan was such a good movie .","267382":"both ! ! i love animals and have experience with a few different types of pets , like cats , dogs , fish , and reptiles .","267383":"better coping mechanisms and a stronger grip on my mental health .","267384":"spending time with my friends around a campfire , listening to music , and drinking .","267385":"thank you , this is really reassuring . i don t think i have covid , unless i m completely asymptomatic , but better safe than sorry . i need to know because i have to pick my meds up from the pharmacy tomorrow too .","267386":"yeah , they don t accept appointments and when my two roommates went this morning , they waited for like hours . thankfully , after an hour or so , they were able to sign in and returned to the car until the could go into the facility . but they left the house around am and didn t get home until am . i m not too worried about the swab my roommate told me it wasn t the ridiculously long one , it s a shorter one thankfully . i was under the impression that my brain was gonna get probed , lmao .","267387":"i have a special spoon that i use to stir my coffee a favorite spatula , haha .","267388":"thank you . i m nervous to go to the testing site alone , and waiting in line for hours , but it is what it is .","267389":"yeah , that s why they re not in my life anymore .","267390":"you should probably ask someone who s happy . lmao .","267391":"new zealand ! !","267392":"moana or tangled .","267393":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","267394":"justteenagethings","267395":"the cats weren t interested in playing with their toys , so my roommate and i just spent the past minutes playing volleyball with a cat toy across the living room . lmao .","267396":"no , although i used to get high off of the fumes , haha .","267397":"it s more than just happiness it s a sense of intense euphoria , like i have x the amount of energy than usual , i feel i m unstoppable , i m hyperfixated on things , i make very rash and impulsive decisions like binge drinking and dropping on random sh t online , and i also get irritable quickly when things don t go as planned . usually over the moon does mean happy , but i meant it in a manic sense .","267398":"not when it s mania , lol .","267399":"lately , i ve either been really sh tty or over the moon , and it angers me so much that i can t find a sense of stability despite taking medication to stabilize my moods . i had a major depressive episode for about three weeks in december , then was hypomanic for around days , and now my anxiety is through the roof .","267400":"that seems quite uncomfortable .","267401":"haha , no .","267402":"no , i haven t .","267403":"i understand your fear . perhaps talk to the police or even a lawyer about your options , if you have those resources available to you ?","267404":"i have good time management skills .","267405":"i don t really care .","267406":"about to crack open a beer continue binge watching supernatural .","267407":"talk about video games , mental health , and or music .","267408":"you really think i d put that on askfm ? lmaoo .","267409":"long island .","267410":"it was either one on long island or one in new jersey , i don t remember anything about the event at all besides what i ve been told about it .","267411":"i honestly have no idea .","267412":"yes , when i was very young .","267413":"thank you","267414":"definitely not . i have social anxiety performing in front of even very small groups of people freaks me out .","267415":"as okay as they can be , i suppose . i m nervous about taking the covid test tomorrow for some reason , because there s a chance i could be positive even though i don t feel any symptoms right now . otherwise , things are fine .","267416":"i don t really consider it a huge milestone considering most of the people i talk to are over .","267417":"i m indifferent to it . i don t really care about relationships rn .","267418":"no , there s nothing to be embarrassed about .","267419":"yeah , she loved the scenery and everything . unfortunately , some stuff happened in her life she had to move back to new york , but now she s living in new england loves her new home .","267420":"i ve always wanted to visit alaska . my best friend lived there for two years

.","267426":"i m nervous , yeah . thankfully , my roommate isn t showing severe symptoms he just has a loss of his sense of taste and smell . no fever , chest congestion , or anything else . even still , everyone in the house has to quarantine for days starting today .","267427":"eh , it s been all right , i suppose . my roommate tested positive for covid so he s been isolated in his bedroom all day . i woke up around am and then took a nap later in the afternoon , took a shower , and now i m drinking an iced matcha latte and watching netflix . as for the whole covid situation , i feel fine but i m getting tested early tomorrow morning just to be sure .","267428":"i prefer showers .","267429":"no , i don t use any heat or products in my hair .","267430":"it isn t , haha . the areas of shaved hair are about inches long now .","267431":"of course everyone makes mistakes from time to time .","267432":"among everything else , patience is probably something i ve learned the most .","267433":"i don t like cake .","267434":"i have well , had i guess half of my head shaved , as well as an undercut on the other side . i haven t shaved it since july , though .","267435":"my hair is naturally straight , it just looks wavy in this photo because i had it wrapped in a towel after washing my hair earlier .","267436":"haha , thank you ! ! i wish my hair was naturally that wavy .","267437":"my was progressive , i suppose you can say in one word . amid all of the turmoil and chaos in the world , i was afforded the opportunity to work remotely from home for the first time ever , which brought me a lot of peace and stability . at the same time , however , my mental health somewhat declined and i ve been steadily trying to work myself up to a stable point again

are just on netflix , i ve been binge watching supernatural lately .","267442":"most of the songs off of linkin park s albums hybrid theory and meteora .","267443":"i m so sorry you re going through this . i ve never been in this situation before , but you definitely should contact authorities about this man so you have some protection . restraining orders may expire , but i believe you can ask the court to extend the order or file a new one . however , i m not entirely sure . whatever happens , please stay safe .","267444":"i tolerate the cold better .","267445":"first selfie of

lecture in one .","267454":"i don t think i would be able to eat them every day . at that point , they probably wouldn t be my favorite food anymore because i d get tired of them easily .","267455":"i

where i need to go with the exception of frequently visited places , like my parents house or the store or pharmacy .","267458":"unstable , creative , addictive .","267459":"lestat de lioncourt .","267460":"handsome boy .","267461":"thank you , i hope the same for you .","267462":"going on a cruise in february . i was off from work for a little over a week , and it was one of the very few times i felt truly at peace and relaxed with no responsibilities whatsoever . going camping with a few friends back in october . it was the first time i had ever gone camping , and it s something i definitely want to do again in the future . having the opportunity to work remotely from home . i haven t been this productive in terms of working in years , and it feels good to clock out every day and feel as if i ve accomplished something .","267463":"i didn t accomplish any goals in besides basically surviving the year . my mental health suffered a bit , and i started experiencing symptoms i had never experienced before , but i m thankful that i ve been able to navigate through these experiences with the help of my therapist .","267464":"i m not a forgiving person really if someone wrongs me , it s always in the back of my mind , even if i don t say anything about it . i don t like being this way at all , and i sometimes feel as if i should be more lenient on people in general .","267465":"hopefully my dream to eventually publish a book .","267466":"chester bennington . i would tell him how much he and his music meant to my life when i was a teenager , how linkin park in general was my beacon of hope and inspiration to keep moving forward despite everything i was enduring .","267467":"i m going to try to have a positive mindset this year , especially since in itself was a sh tshow . if anything , it has taught me the value of patience .","267468":"aside from social media , my clock app it has an alarm clock so i use that every morning , my banking apps , and my food alcohol delivery apps .","267469":"no , i haven t . i still have the same group of close friends that i ve had for a few years now .","267470":"i m introverted more than anything else , and i m fine with it . it brings me peace to be alone and do things by myself as opposed to being crowded by other people .","267471":"easier to run by linkin park . https www . youtube . com watch ? v u zdmjveqze","267472":"lmao , definitely not . it s people like those who think their rights are being taken away from them who are the ones being unsafe during this pandemic , not distancing , not wearing masks , still going out with their friends , etc etc . and therefore , contributing to the further spread of covid .","267473":"yeah , i m exhibiting no symptoms at all . but better to be safe than sorry .","267474":"my week had its ups and downs like usual , but overall it was a productive week in terms of my job . my new years eve was low key and fun , and now i m just worried for my roommate and my own health at this point . i also need to go to the pharmacy and pick up my medication , but i don t know if i should even go out right now .","267475":"thank you , i appreciate it . he s okay so far just lost his sense of taste and smell , but no other symptoms right now . my other roommate went with him to get tested this morning , and she came up negative . i probably should have gone with them this morning , but i honestly thought he just had a cold since he s been super congested all week .","267476":"there s no harm in reading the bible , so i d say go for it . i ve always been interested in reading it as an adult for research reasons there s a book i plan on writing that i intend to put biblical themes in .","267477":"i like the idea of it , although i ve never gone thrifting myself or to any secondhand shops . i ve bought used books , but not clothing or anything .","267478":"probably at some point long ago when i was in religion classes as a child , but i haven t read it as an adult .","267479":"it doesn t surprise me . it s probably the biggest question there is .","267480":"i m sure it can happen to other people , but i m not sure if a person can break my own spirit completely these days . i m not emotionally invested in anyone right now .","267481":"you re better off asking a philosopher or someone even remotely interested in understanding the origin of the universe life itself . haha .","267482":"well , i rang in the new year with the news that my roommate has covid . he lost his sense of taste and smell last night , so he went to get tested this morning and the rapid test came back positive . so now we all have to quarantine for days since we re all at high risk of exposure due to living in the same household . i m getting tested tomorrow morning .","267483":"just because we don t understand it fully through science doesn t mean it s automatically something omniscient or higher than ourselves in a religious spiritual sense . i believe in understanding the complexities of life and the universe through scientific evidence and research .","267484":"i ve been binge watching supernatural lately . i m almost done with season four with more seasons to go ! .","267485":"i think it depends on the relationship you had with them previously , as well as the friendship you may or may not have with them now . if they were toxic or ab sive to you , then i m leaning towards saying that you shouldn t text them you have to keep your own health and well being in mind , and that may open up the opportunity for them to manipulate you again .","267486":"distancing myself and or ignoring them completely .","267487":"this is the last thing i drew months ago , haha .","267488":"green tea ice cream or chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream .","267489":"no , i m not concerned with other people s lives , especially total strangers . i care about the lives of my friends , and if they re doing well , then i m happy for them . if you can t celebrate your friends successes , then you re not a true friend to them .","267490":"i don t have cable so i can t watch it on regular television , but hopefully there will be a live stream on youtube . that s how i ve been watching the debates and everything else .","267491":"that s a pretty immature mindset . people are allowed to like the music they like , and it certainly doesn t affect your life at all .","267492":"jesus was a real person , from my understanding of religion . however , i don t necessarily believe he was some sort of prophet or supernatural being that s often described in religious texts .","267493":"thankfully , no . i ve been accidentally given someone else s mail or packages , but nothing has ever been stolen .","267494":"the elder scrolls v skyrim . it

in the current times .","267495":"i like a few of their songs , but i m not a huge fan . i mainly like some of their music for sentimental reasons . however , just because you don t like them yourself doesn t mean other people can t like their music . everyone has a different taste in music .","267496":"no , i don t believe in god . i ve simply never believed in god even when growing up . i ve

mind on my end goals and try to make the best out of the situation .","267500":"yeah , i was addicted to self h rm when i was a teenager . i stopped out of a promise i made to my partner at the time , and eventually i realized that there was more bad that comes out of me hurting myself than good . i still have urges to hurt myself most days , but i keep reminding myself how upset and paranoid i would become afterwards . i also quit smoking cigarettes after years of smoking a pack per day . i just stopped one afternoon and started vaping a lower dose of nicotine . i still vape occasionally now , but not nearly as much as i used to .","267501":"yeah , but i cry at basically any sort of emotional movie , so it isn t anything unusual for me .","267502":"my favorite animals are wolves

.","267587":"yes some people just aren t worth investing the time and energy into them anymore if they re being toxic and won t acknowledge their hurtful behavior .","267588":"i definitely should have on multiple occasions , but i never did .","267589":"i ll actually log into work and try to get as much work done as possible , considering yesterday i called out since i wasn t feeling well

depending on the night .","267619":"most of the time , yeah . which angers me , because my job isn t overly stressful a lot of the time , but my own anxiety and self expectations make me stressed out

like a scam . no reputable company would ask for your account numbers .","267624":"the general public is filled with a sholes and people who feel superior to retail workers in general , and i was constantly disrespected and yelled at on a daily basis for things out of my control .","267625":"you re definitely not overreacting . you re rightfully under the impression that you have a monogamous relationship , and you never consented to a polyamorous relationship . he cheated on you , regardless of whether or not he has an attachment with the person he cheated on you with .","267626":"last night was a blur , to be honest . i didn t sleep well either , woke up feeling horrible , and called out of work today .","267627":"it could be , yeah . it could also be because perhaps you think gossiping is immature and you don t want to associate yourself with people who do that .","267628":"working as a cashier in a drug store .","267629":"les miserables .","267630":"i ve been having random flashbacks every few weeks for the past couple of months now , so i can t help but reflect on those memories and try to piece everything together .","267631":"yeah , i ve seen one apparition in my life , and i ve also had other weird experiences .","267632":"i can guarantee that is false , lmaoo .","267633":"i ve been through traumatic events and they ve negatively affected my every day life

.","267635":"my bedroom , if i can access that , or the bathroom .","267636":"i don t set goals for the new year , no . if i really wanted to set a goal for myself , i can do it at any time during the

other people s work .","267642":"if you re going through hell , keep going .","267643":"it s always difficult for me to wake up in the morning because i m constantly exhausted . i really don t know

ignore it . it isn t worth wasting my time or energy on those people , or trying to prove them wrong . people will always think what they want to think , and it s no concern of mine .","267647":"i traveled to northern pennsylvania for a camping trip a few months ago , which was a lot of fun . i enjoy long car rides , especially when we got into pennsylvania and saw the autumn leaves and rolling hills .","267648":"i prefer dunkin over starbucks .","267649":"for me personally , yes . i ve known that i wanted to be a writer from a very young age , and i never considered any other possible career path .","267650":"i m drinking gfuel right now , and this morning i had an iced matcha latte .","267651":"non alcoholic iced tea and iced coffee . alcoholic margaritas , wine , and ipa beers .","267652":"people who send questions to other people s inboxes asking for likes and coins , smh .","267653":"brains is much more important . you can be the most attractive beautiful person in the room , but it s meaningless if you don t have a good personality or consideration of other people .","267654":"i ve never actually done this before , solely because of the fear i have of being in a dangerous situation and not having my phone in order to get help . even when i m taking a quick five minute trip into the drug store or , i bring my phone with me into the store .","267655":"i ve been working for the same company for over three years now , and i love my immediate supervisor . she s the best boss i ve ever had , she understands my mental health conditions , she s considerate of everyone else in the department especially everyone s worried about covid , and she goes the extra mile to stick up for us if upper management is being irrational . i value her authority so much .","267656":"i normally don t , haha .","267657":"sometimes the right job won t hire you unless you have prior experience in working a job or two . waiting for the right job may not work out in your favor for that reason , and it s important to find a job that helps you gain money and experience so you can put it on your resume cv .","267658":"yeah , i probably could for at least a month . i don t tend to spend frivolously to begin with anyway , and the only things i ever routinely splurge on are alcoholic beverages , haha .","267659":"i m feeling mentally physically crappy today , so i mustered up the energy to re organize my desk space at home work station to accommodate the new movies and blu ray disc drive i bought , and i feel a bit more at peace now . organizing things tends to help my mental health at times , i don t feel as crowded compared to the mess my desk used to be .","267660":"it doesn t matter whether or not someone is wealthy or famous during these times the coronavirus doesn t discriminate , which is evident by how many famous people have either fallen ill to it and have even d ed from it . when you have children in the midst of the pandemic , that s even more cause for concern because the children also have to adjust to online schooling , which is something that can be hard for children to transition to as well as the parents who are helping their children . it s a hard time for everyone right now . people shouldn t have trolled her . her concerns are valid .","267661":"not well , my coping mechanisms are trash .","267662":"no , they re nothing special . i ve been experiencing a lot of anxiety lately , so they re pretty gross and bitten up .","267663":"no , i don t speak spanish .","267664":"very much so , although sometimes my anxiety causes me to stay awake or wake up multiple times throughout the night . i ve gotten into the habit of smoking a bit of weed before bed , and that seems to help a lot .","267665":"yeah , sometimes . most of the time , however , it s pretty much to focus their attention on something other than me if they re concerned about me for whatever reason . i ll lie and say i m okay when actually i m not doing well at all .","267666":"it can be somewhat important depending on what you want to do for a living . some jobs require a bachelor s degree or higher , such as if you wanted to work as an attorney or a nurse but that would be a registered nursing license , sometimes a bsn . however , people have succeeded in life without obtaining a formal degree . i have plenty of friends who never finished college and they have successful careers .","267667":"i would rather have telekinesis and be able to move things with my mind , such as getting a drink out of the fridge without having to get up , lmaoo .","267668":"i m not much of a procrastinator at all . when there s something that needs to be done , i try to do it as early as possible , otherwise i ll just get stressed out .","267669":"only towards people whom i care about a lot .","267670":"progress further in my therapy appointments regarding my mental health . i ve only been seeing this therapist since august , but we ve already made pretty good strides and she s offered me quite a bit of insight .","267671":"veggie or carnitas burrito bowls , lamb rice platters with white sauce , and sushi .","267672":"depends on what it is that they ve said and how that person behaves normally . in most cases , that person is already a bit of a problematic person so it wouldn t surprise me , and depending on how close i am to that person , i might step forward and tell them why their toxic statement is hurtful .","267673":"unfortunately , yeah . you need to invest money in order to make that money back in most cases , and very few people have that start up money to begin with .","267674":"no , i don t like nutella at all .","267675":"my friendship with my best friend . we started being friends when we were years old , and now we re both years old .","267676":"yes , i actually have two cats at the moment . my household used to have four before my old roommate moved out .","267677":"lol , it s all good ! ! sometimes it s tricky because i think askfm defaults things to anon , for some reason .","267678":"nobody . you never know how someone else s life is or what they re struggling with .","267679":"most of my favorite movies are from the s and s .","267680":"yes , it used to happen a lot back in like when there was so much askfm drama , rofl .","267681":"leigh can mean either meadow or delicate .","267682":"i don t very strongly about places in that manner , so i can t really think of a particular location that i would never want to return to .","267683":"i m not a teenager anymore , so the whole bad boy girl persona doesn t appeal to me . i would rather be with someone who s able to communicate , who s loyal , whose interests are shared with mine , and who s comfortable with being themselves around me .","267684":"with a mug of hot , steaming coffee and relaxing music .","267685":"i don t really think it s procrastination exactly , but sometimes i do check social media while i m working , particularly if i m receiving questions on askfm and i just want to check up on the app and see what s there .","267686":"black craft cult , if they count .","267687":"yeah , i try not to spend too much time on social media if i have other things going on that i need to focus on . however , if there s nothing for me to do , then i don t really care about how much time i spend on social media .","267688":"no , not at all .","267689":"yes , i think frogs are super cute .","267690":"i had a teacher in high school i think , and he was definitely not a people person or knew how to work around children . the classroom was on the second floor of the school , and there was one time he threw a student s binder and notebooks out the second floor window .","267691":"i m friends with a lot of people who post high quality memes , and i m also a member of quite a few sh tposting groups , haha . facebook is a great distraction for me and it s where i

of my christmas and other holiday shopping has been completely online .","267694":"peaches ! !","267695":"i smoked cigarettes for years , and now i vape on occasion .","267696":"has taught me that the future is always uncertain , so i honestly don t know how i feel about the future versus the present right now . i ve been primarily focusing on the present moment and going with the flow .","267697":"i downloaded an ad blocker on my computer , so askfm doesn t show me ads anymore . i mainly use askfm on my laptop these days .","267698":"work , to be honest . even though i only work hours per week , i m thinking about work even outside of my work environment .","267699":"this goes to show you how terrible society is to oppressed groups even in contemporary times .","267700":"that sounds like they re not such a good friend at all , and perhaps they were just saving face around you because of your boyfriend . i would advise that you talk to your boyfriend about this to get his opinion , and then eventually confront that friend about why they re acting the way they are around you when you two have been civil for the past three years .","267701":"apparently it s a type of pizza that s only made eaten by people from my area , haha . but it s basically a square , sicilian like slice of thin pizza with hand tossed ingredients and more spices than sicilian .","267702":"it s been a lot of things , and the focus has mainly been on my mental health more than anything else . this year , i ve experience a range of new symptoms that i ve never experienced before , and i ve been spending a lot of time with my therapist and psychiatrist in dealing with those symptoms .","267703":"i would love your twitch handle ! ! i m always looking to watch new streamers on twitch . as for your question , i m more content when i buy something that s inexpensive and realize that it s worth a lot or the quality is much better than the price makes it seem to be . this happens a lot with cosmetics , i ve noticed . a lot of high end makeup is good quality , but just because something is expensive doesn t automatically mean it s a good product .","267704":"yes , i absolutely love video games .","267705":"probably too much , tbh . i wouldn t be able to put a number to it .","267706":"nah , i think that s relatively normal .","267707":"margherita pizza , or grandma pizza with vodka sauce .","267708":"it doesn t affect me , and it has nothing to do with me , so it isn t my concern what women do or don t do regarding their sexual lives .","267709":"plaid leggings , combat boots , and a black shirt that has lace on it .","267710":"halloween is my favorite holiday .","267711":"i don t believe i want children because i honestly don t have the patience for children , and i also find pregnancy to be terrifying . if i did want children down the road , i would likely adopt .","267712":"i agree with this statement . someone isn t obligated to agree with you on something simply because they re your friend , and it s healthy to have different opinions on things . however , that doesn t take into account if your friend , for example , says something discriminatory or oppressive .","267713":"yeah , some advice wait until the pandemic is over . we re supposed to be social distancing , not hooking up with people and increasing the spread of covid . and before you guys come at me for saying this because i hooked up with someone over the summer , i know it s hypocritical of me to say this . however , it is indeed true and the risk is too high for me to feel comfortable hooking up with someone again .","267714":"i believe in the paranormal , so i would definitely think they re ghosts , haha .","267715":"i m assuming it was probably a mass message of some kind .","267716":"i didn t eat dinner last night .","267717":"i appreciate my solitude very much . i hardly ever get bored because i have a lot of activities to do at all times , either way . i prefer doing things alone .","267718":"i m not a fan of fireworks at all , and i believe they do more harm than good . they re fun from a distance like if you re sitting on the beach and watching them from across the bay but to set them off in your own neighborhood with tons of houses surrounding you is inconsiderate . one , it startles and scares animals and people s pets . two , it can trigger people with ptsd and other people with sensory dilemmas . fireworks in themselves are also very dangerous if not handled correctly .","267719":"no , at least not me personally . i mainly wear dark colors most of my shirts are black or dark red and green , for example . i just prefer dark colors on myself .","267720":"yeah , i constantly need something in my hand while i m doing pretty much anything

of work and tried to have breakfast and a lot of water . then i fell back asleep until pm , and i feel slightly better now thank god . i m probably not going to clock into work at all today , though , i just want to have a chill day .","267728":"i ve always slept on the right side of the bed , as opposed to the left side .","267729":"austin , texas . the city was adorable with very cute shops , bars , and restaurants , and the atmosphere of the city was very inviting .","267730":"nowhere , i m perfectly content with being in the comfort of my own home .","267731":"i don t believe i was , at

marshmallows .","267830":"no , i m not .","267831":"yeah , except it hurts my bank account . lmao .","267832":"i have a habit of leaving early due to mental health reasons , so i usually have very

words out of context and believe we re making universal statements instead of us simply talking about ourselves and what would make ourselves happy . it s silly . i hate being fat . i don t even eat that much which honestly probably has slowed my metabolism but i do drink alcohol , so that is probably where the weight gain stemmed from , along with the meds i take . i haven t weighed myself in over a year i m honestly terrified to do so .","267848":"i ve never used silk sheets before , so cotton .","267849":"i knew what you meant , but i still think it varies depending on the person . if i had the damn motivation to exercise , then i ll likely lose some weight , but i m lazy and depression is a b tch . hopefully when things are safer after covid , i ll have the strength to go to the gym .","267850":"i don t really think it can be easier , per say , but it really depends on the person . i d feel much better about myself if i was pounds again , haha . i ve also tried to embrace being

flowers make me sneeze and i never know how to take care of them .","267877":"no , i don t litter . i think it s disgusting how people leave literal garbage in places like the street , parking lots ,

.","267879":"it s afternoon where i live nearly pm , but i had a goal of doing all of my laundry , which i just finished doing ! !","267880":"i m very introverted , yes . i don t get bored of being around people , it s simply that being around people especially large groups drains the energy out of me and i become overwhelmed , so i need solitary time to recharge .","267881":"yeah , askfm is fun to me which is why i use it every day i ve honestly been on it all day while waiting for my laundry to wash , lol . i enjoy answering questions and also asking questions to people to see their

i have .","267902":"not everyone has good relationships with their families , so family isn t always the first priority . it isn t unreasonable to be upset when your significant other bails on you to spend time with their family , which is why i said they should divide their time equally between their partner and their family .","267903":"sometimes , but not in recent weeks since it s been chilly out .","267904":"i d like to go camping again in northern pennsylvania , but definitely not in the middle of winter , lol .","267905":"oof , it s definitely not a teenage thing it s nice to wake up to good morning texts , it s more of the sentiment behind it as opposed to the physical saying of good morning . regardless , he shouldn t have made fun of you for liking that that s just mean .","267906":"you know i love art , haha . i m always trying to find new artists on social media .","267907":"it s common , but not really normal or healthy . ideally , he should divide his time up between you and his family evenly , and he definitely shouldn t be cancelling your dates to spend time with his family . that isn t fair to you .","267908":"oh goodness , no . i d probably fall asleep

blu ray disc drive off of amazon .","267917":"i have a few friends who were in the military , but i think they were mainly in the navy and the marines . either way , it depends on the individual person .","267918":"i honestly don t remember , i had a few weird tinder stories too but it was in the spring , so i don t recall much of them at this point . i m like sure it was the facebook guy , though . i remember asking him how he triggers his mania , and he basically said , i close my eyes and focus really hard and i can bring on mania . i was like , uh . . . i don t think that s how that works . lmao . he was super weird , though . he d constantly send me photos of his cat and was very woe is me , which is just irritating to me . he s actually a good friend of my coworker , so during

facebook , the one who said he could apparently make himself manic on his own free will , lmfao . i was never interested in him , but he kept on messaging me every day despite me ignoring him half the time . eventually i did tell him i wasn t interested in dating , and he unfriended me immediately .","267922":"no , i don t believe in love at first sight . what people perceive to be love is actually lust combined with what they want that person to be like , not what they actually are .","267923":"i used tinder for a few months earlier this year , but i wasn t really interested in it at all . it made me realize i didn t want to get into dating .","267924":"of course people s friendships with each other shouldn t be dictated by what gender they are .","267925":"i have playlists on spotify , but i don t really advertise them not because i purposely want to keep them to myself , but i don t really have a reason to share them . however , whenever i do hear a new song that i like , i love showing it to my friends .","267926":"hi , i m leigh . i m tiny but i ll fight you if necessary . lol . just kidding . i really have no idea , i haven t introduced myself to a new person in a long

flashbacks and idk why they re happening .","267932":"honestly , i love netflix . i ve watched a lot of netflix original series that i enjoyed , and most of my favorite shows are on netflix

hunting .","267941":"in certain situations , it can be . especially if the person you re talking to is being rude to you and they won t let down , sometimes being rude towards them in return works well if you need to get out of the conversation .","267942":"it s much easier for me to name three bad things about myself , rofl . i think i m manipulative , i have an addictive personality not in a good way , and i m selfish af .","267943":"there was one vacation i took with my friends where i fell into a really bad depressive episode , and i basically spent the entire weekend locked in my hotel room and sleeping because i couldn t handle being around all of my friends .","267944":"no , that isn t bad . as long as you re taking care of yourself and you re not allowing him to affect your life

a pedestal and you ll be disappointed in them once you actually meet them .","268169":"i advocate for mental health awareness , but that s the extent of it . most of my activism is online through talking about my experiences , and posting educational graphs , pictures , texts , and links . activism as a whole is a good thing , of course , but some people take it to a toxic extent where they re being exclusionary .","268170":"depends on the day . on weekdays when i have work , i normally wake up around am . otherwise on the weekends , it s anywhere between am and am .","268171":"i went camping for the first time a few months ago it was super fun ! ! i really did love being out in nature , spending quality time with friends , grilling food for meals , and just experiencing the silence in the dead of night which is something i m not used to .","268172":"yeah , being too forgiving can be detrimental to yourself because at certain points , you may allow people to walk all over
