I did AV & staging for large events, for many years.

I live in the moment too often, to look forward to or dread much of anything.\n  \n  I suppose a couple of upcoming films fit the bill. Looking forward to the Snyder Cut of Justice League, Godzilla vs. Kong...and further in the future...Deadpool 3.\n  ","600950":"\n  I have a feeling that \"In and of Itself\" will be the most enjoyed of the 3, for my taste. I've heard great things about it, and enjoy Frank Oz's work, so I can't imagine disliking it. I've heard mixed reviews of the other two, so we will see.\n  ","600951":"\n  Maybe in some cases.\n  \n  Mainly, as a sometimes glasses-wearer myself...I think they simply make a person look like they are wearing glasses.\n  ","600952":"\n  Definitely. And sadly, that point, for me, is too far past the point where I SHOULD stop...so I have to actively force myself.\n  ","600953":"\n  I don't practice, nor support organized religion. But people who do can be themselves, as long as they aren't trying to convert me.\n  ","600954":"\n  Randomly psychotic, ranging from brutally violent to simply odd or quirky. Diverse, to the point of annoyance, because so many imagine their uniqueness to be a defining factor and use it as a way to feel or act superior. Flawed, but beautiful.\n  ","600955":"\n  I enjoy films from both directors,  though I haven't completed either of their full catalogues.\n  \n  A few notable favorites from both are: Dogville, Melancholia, AntiChrist, Nymphomaniac...and then The Neon Demon, The Pusher Trilogy, Bronson, Valhalla Rising, Drive\n  ","600956":"\n  Usually the mornings of the day I cook, unless the store run takes place on the day, previous.\n  ","600957":"\n  Sounds good. I used to do food pics, a fair amount. But I just eat it, these days.\n  ","600958":"\n  It doesn't bother me that others enjoy things I dont. I even occasionally cook broccoli for my roommates. I just refuse to eat it, myself.\n  ","600959":"\n  I had a whole lot of fun in my 20s, and while I don't really want to revisit that time period...I do feel like I enjoyed life more, then, than at any other point.\n  ","600960":"\n  Nah, I'm not especially optimistic or pessimistic, in that regard. I just think things will be as they will be, depending on how you approach prior events.\n  ","600961":"\n  My favorite thing is the solitude and feeling of peace. My least favorite thing is not being able to go grab munchies or toiletries at 3am, if I happen to be out of something, because everything is shut down by 9pm. But you adapt and overcome.\n  ","600962":"\n  This is not a competition.\n  \n  They both do awesome things, in a variety of mediums, which can be enjoyed, simultaneously.\n  \n  I like them equally, for different reasons.\n  ","600963":"\n  Why would that be weird? Age shouldn't be a defining factor in whether you like or relate to a person. I'm in my mid-40s, and most people I talk to on here are in their late 20s-early 30s.\n  \n  Obviously there are limits, if you start getting creepy about it, and the people are under 18, but if you mean purely liking people as people...I don't see the issue.\n  ","600964":"\n  I do, yes...although my taste in them is usually wildly different than most.\n  ","600965":"\n  192\n  ","600966":"\n  Generally, legs. I love a well-shaped set of them.\n  \n  But also eyes...which I never find anything less than fascinating.\n  ","600967":"\n  Ha. Most things.\n  ","600968":"\n  There are too many to list them all...but a few are...\n  \n  Bonanza, Have Gun Will Travel, My Favorite Martian, Lost in Space, Bewitched, The Brady Bunch.\n  ","600969":"\n  According to an aunt who did genealogical research on our bloodline, my ancestors were Czech peasants who came over on the Mayflower as servants.\n  ","600970":"\n  Off the top of my head...\n  \n  Jumping into a cool lake on a brutally hot day.\n  ","600971":"\n  I have a few times in the past, but I find it tedious and I'm lazy. If I had a bigger kitchen, a pasta roller and unlimited time, I might do it occasionally.\n  ","600972":"\n  I can't think of any specific food items I'd like to try, but that doesn't mean there aren't any...just that my brain isn't fully functioning, yet. I'd like to try roasting an entire pig, using the island method. That's where you dig a firepit, line it with lava rocks and banana leaves, put the pig in the ground also covered with banana leaves...and slow roast it.\n  ","600973":"\n  I reuse them throughout the course of a day, then discard and grab a new one out of the bag.\n  ","600974":"\n  Sometimes. But mostly not, honestly. The headaches and drama that tend to accompany the situation where I'd be kissing someone are just too much to make it worthwhile, for me to bother.\n  ","600975":"\n  Multiple injuries from working, and a couple of serious car accidents.\n  ","600976":"\n  While it is of course a constantly ongoing work of art, in my opinion...the bulk of it was done the first 2 weeks of living here. That's always the way I've been, when I move into a place that's new to me. I have to have my space the way I want it...need it...because otherwise my sanity is at risk of deteriorating.\n  ","600977":"\n  I appreciate the compliments.\n  \n  All I can say is that I'm just me, whether online or off, and I do my best. I don't try to be different than anyone else...it just happens.\n  ","600978":"\n  I have it, and have heard amazing things about it, so it will definitely get watched, eventually. The primary hurdle is that I like to multitask while I watch things...drawing, sculpting, dusting, whatever. That's nearly impossible to do with a subtitled series, and I just haven't taken the downtime, yet, to get through it. I know there's a dubbed version, but those are typically terrible, and not the version I have, anyway.\n  ","600979":"\n  I like their energy, and the deliberate way they move, with silent purpose. I also like that so many people are frightened of them. It makes me enjoy them more.\n  ","600980":"\n  Dog Fashion Disco, Polkadot Cadaver. Both contain the same members, and are similar styles of music, but still manage to evoke very different reactions. Neither of these bands really exist now, but when they did, they should've been huge...and never were.\n  ","600981":"\n  That is actually a stylized version of the aliens from the film \"They Live\", one of my favorite sci-fi movies. It's not really my work, I just did some editing on it...but I don't remember the original artist.\n  ","600982":"\n  I'm pretty open about all my interests, and in fact, I imagine anyone who pays attention to me is bored with my constant mentions of art, entertainment,  collecting action figures, etc.\n  \n  The only thing that really comes to mind is that people-watching, and observing behavior interests me, but I've spoken about that before, too.\n  ","600983":"\n  Still can't post pics...stupid Ask. But here are a few cool ones.\n  \n  Ibex:\n  \n   http:\/\/imgur.com\/47iylsc\n  \n  - Axlotl:\n  \n   http:\/\/imgur.com\/Urs6VD5\n  \n  - Mantis Shrimp:\n  \n   http:\/\/imgur.com\/U1oULbk\n  \n","600984":"\n  I wouldn't really know, because I can't be friends with myself, and I don't ask. I've been told I am a very good friend, but I do wonder if that's just a nice thing people say. I'm not very emotionally present, I'm extremely ADHD, (non-diagnosed), and I generally prefer being alone, to the company of even close friends.\n  \n  I would do anything for my 2 closest friends, and can be helpful, whenever possible, to friends, online. But overall, I'd say I'm simply middle-of-the-road.\n  ","600985":"\n  I don't usually know the full list until Friday, which is the day my roommates and I paint together and watch things. However, on alternating Fridays, we play D&D, so no painting or movies, this coming Friday. Therefore, movies will be watched Saturday, while I draw or sculpt. For reasons related to the above, I don't watch movies that would go on that list, and stick to quieter, more indie type fare. This weekend will probably be \"Malcolm & Marie\", \"The Little Things\", and \" In and of Itself\".\n  ","600986":"\n  Not a whole lot I didn't know already, but maybe a few things about the archetypal behavior, of the type of people who use an app like this, regularly.\n  ","600987":"\n  I generally go for high-end, 75% cacao, or above...but I also love Milky Way Midnite, Snickers Dark and Reese's Dark.\n  ","600988":"\n  That's a fun little song that I've never heard before. Thanks.\n  ","600989":"\n  Last night, I watched both \"My Comic Shop Country\", a documentary about brick & mortar comic shops...and then \"McQueen: The Lost Movie\", which is a documentary about Steve McQueen. Both were interesting and worth watching, if you're a fan of either topic.\n  ","600990":"\n  Nope. Never been a fan of the idea, at all. I could give philosophical reasoning,  like the fact that the planet is already overpopulated and so filled with chaos, that I think bringing children into it is selfish and dangerous...but the fact is, I'm just not a kid person. I tolerate them when necessary, particularly the older ones who can play video games or who are creative...but little kids just kind of annoy me.\n  \n  I'm well past the prime age for that, anyway.\n  ","600991":"\n  I love the Alien films, as well as pretty much any sci-fi or horror film. I'm a huge nut for all of that. I appreciate the kind words about my work. I am definitely inspired by Geiger, and a number of other dark artists.\n  ","600992":"\n  Same as the other goal question. I have never been much of a planner, or one who looks to the future, and decides where I want to fit into it. I just do what I do, and hope for the best.\n  ","600993":"\n  I'm not a goal-oriented person. I take things day-to-day and just focus on the present.\n  ","600994":"\n  A lot from my Mom, a lot from my various experiences, and I'm sure some traits would be peer-influenced.\n  ","600995":"\n  The town has 2000 people, and I literally know none of them, besides my roommates.\n  \n  Even the two of those who've lived here their entire lives only know a few randoms, scattered around the area. So no, not a one-horse town, just small and quiet.\n  ","600996":"\n  I don't really eat in an adventurous manner. While I'm always willing to try something new, I don't get many opportunities to do so. Mainly, I'm just a chubby food-lover who enjoys eating. I'd say the most out-of-the-box food I've had recently was beginning to enjoy burgers with a soft-fried egg on them. That's a pretty normal thing, in comparison to most, but it was something that I just hadn't ever done, and I was missing out.\n  ","600997":"\n  Oh, I still do the \"ew gross\" thing. But only with very obviously gross stuff, like anything made with organ meat, or raw meat...then like...Thousand Year Eggs and such. Most things I find gross, like broccoli or sushi, I have tried, many ways...and still hate.\n  ","600998":"\n  Awesome, hope you liked it. It is definitely teeth-weakeningly sweet...but worth it, in small portions.\n  ","600999":"\n  Well, for sure Sloth, Lust & Gluttony. The other 4, not so much.\n  ","601000":"\n  I ask and answer questions, and observe behavior.\n  \n  I guess I come back out of some sense of boredom.\n  ","601001":"\n  Landscaping.\n  \n  Mowing, hedge-trimming, raking, mulching, planting, etc.\n  ","601002":"\n  Maybe? I don't pay attention to that.\n  ","601003":"\n  No, that is definitely not a talent I possess.\n  ","601004":"\n  Yes, I do.\n  ","601005":"\n  Sometimes. I like the really dark, grindy stuff, like Sludgestep...not so much the prettier-sounding tracks.\n  ","601006":"\n  Rick & Morty, Solar Opposites,  Bob's Burgers\n  ","601007":"\n  I have before, though not in years. I'm sure I could manage to fold one up.\n  ","601008":"\n  I suffer from insomnia and rarely get more than 2-3 hours of light sleep, at a time. The past couple of days, though, I've managed to double that. It's pure luck of the draw, no specific method used.\n  ","601009":"\n  I don't personally believe in any gods, but if I'm wrong and ever meet them, I'm going to give them a piece of my mind.\n  ","601010":"\n  Yes, some of it. Grew up with it. Though I'll admit that I rarely listen to it, now...and when I do...it's just for a quick, fun nostalgia jolt. I don't really listen to it for musical pleasure.\n  ","601011":"\n  I learned how to sculpt pretty decent, wrinkly eyelids.\n  ","601012":"\n  Pasta. Preferably with a meat sauce, but I'll even eat it with just butter and garlic...or olive oil, red vinegar and black pepper.\n  ","601013":"\n  Rattlesnake Chili, which wasn't really weird at all...just tasted like chili.\n  \n  Or maybe escargot, but I suppose that's normal in some cultures...just weird to me, and I wasnt a huge fan.

Not a fan of raw meat. of any type.\n  ","601030":"\n  I think if I'm in the forest. there would already be plenty of other wild food to hunt. Deer, boar, etc. So I'd save the little guy, since he obviously had the determination to escape his farm. Are we assuming this race of tiny food people have at least a passable intelligence level? Maybe I'd teach him survival techniques, and he'd eventually become the savior of his people.

For them, there is only the moment. They tried to raise us to be perfect in their perfect new world and for a moment, maybe it worked. But I think they finally saw their own shortsightedness and failure in us. We always saw it in them. They attempted to unlearn jealousy, want, and hate, to not possess anything, including each other.

Once you\u2019re capable of doing that it\u2019s hard to be angry at anyone because their actions seem to align with their suffering - a lot of times its not about you. So, I wish people would stop making themselves out to be a victim when someone is acting out due to pain\/suffering. If someone hurts you just remember they did it because they were hurting and once you understand their hurting (because everyone knows what its like to hurt) you\u2019ll be able to move forward.

Yes i am adopted. \ud83d\ude0a\n  \n  I dont know why people think being adopted is a negative thing (not talking about you, i mean generally) it was the best decision my biological mom made for me. I think people assume going into foster care is the same as being adopted when its not. Foster care is from the government. Adopting a kid requires money, lawyers, doctors, & patience. (I was an expensive baby lol) My parents choose me and i was given an amazing life. If i was never adopted i would have been in poverty.\n  ","601897":"\n  I love jeans.

I dont want everyone to agree with me but i just people to accept me for who i am - just like how i do for them.\n  ","601900":"\n  Yes, i have. I have spent some time with someone who suffers from schizophrenia. Its really hard to have a conversation with someone with severe symptoms. A lot of things they would say doesnt make sense because of their delusions. They start to talk as if they are talking to someone else. They will randomly freak out but i always assumed they saw something scary. Its really sad cause they dont live that long when it gets this severe. They cant tell whats real and what isnt anymore and a lot of them commit sui.cide or just drink or do drugs till they die once they get to that point. The most difficult part is the medication only works for so long but its common for them to believe that they are being poisoned and theyll stop taking their medication.\n  ","601901":"\n  I have so much laundry, like so much i need to do.
