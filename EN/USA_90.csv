  Had a 🍆 picture on his camera when he had a project that our shop had to do for him. Obviously the kid doing it shouldn't have been snooping, just get the one you actually needed for the job.

  Was at a golfing place. Bar and restaurant area. Had a DJ tonight which was nice but also kind of annoying based on how loud it was and certain song choices. Most of it was rap. Gave me 90s and early 2000s nostalgia. Hard to hear conversations with everyone. I ended up coming in third place on our side of the game. One of the dudes who went ended up smashing a light that was above the area where you hit the ball. I had some buffalo wings. We shared some mini donuts that you inject with icing.. they gave syringes filled with chocolate, a cream and a jelly one. It's definitely more a place that you'd want to get drunk at but I forgot my ID and didn't like the beers that were in the bucket they gave. They had xboxes, and other games there too. Outdoor area with a firepit and more game options.

  Most have been assholes even when it's a medical reason... most people already know that they need to. Telling someone isn't going to make them get up and do something about it. Some could be in denial, not sure how to start, do good and fall off, need motivation. Lots of people blame it on their s/o or kids because they don't want to make separate meals and other bullshit excuses. Think your life is better than anything you talk yourself out of doing. Really need to want to change and do the work to get where you want to be.

  I don't think I nailed the funny here.... I had an idea but it kind of turned into something else
  
  In the dead of night they come to you. ""Your name"" echoes and fades into the cold still air. A lingering plead. Ones you don't hear but feel. The type you can't see. The air pregnant with the scent of the thing staring, watching, waiting. Silent but deadly are the sins of man. They simply vanish like the moon turning into crescent. Red hot like an engine screaming through the night. The cozy atmosphere is gone. What lingers, creeps and crawls inside of your mind. The things you want to say remain hidden beneath the cocoon. Their voice is like pure silk. Made of spider webs that truly never end. A nightmare within a dream thrusting into consciousness. Only once you hear it, you can't stop. It becomes like a ritual, a lullaby. Never fully alone. Tossing and turning becomes a thing of habit. What would I say? What would I do? So many what ifs and Evers filling the gap of spaces between you and the thing in the night. A fog that never lifts its veil. I once wrote an ode to it. Now the tides have turned like a singing gymnast. Needles spinning in high altitudes. They'd be gone before I surrendered to the call. A name you once knew cascading down on you. What to believe becomes theatrical in the here and now. You don't even know what name they'd like returned. There's no answers, just more doubt clouding the threshold. A truth they aren't willing to share. Piano lines fading to a blur. A person you can't stay mad at. The night cripples my vocal cords. Just a heart exists in this body. One that still beats vividly.

  You really expect me to remember? I was like 5 years old at the time. Excuse me for not asking the doctor for side effects lmao Skinny before and gained weight quickly. Didn't change eating habits either.
  
  I'm not using anything as a crutch. They asked a question and yes.. going from skinny to fat within a fucking year is a huge change back then. There was a letter that was sent home asking about the weight and saying how much I gained within the year back then. Stop trying to undermine things that people felt traumatic about.

  Mosquito bite reaction. Huge ass bubbles on my skin. Steroid shot and gained 50 pounds that year after it. Wonder if I'd have insulin resistance, fatty liver and all that if that never happened. Weight has always maintained and gone up/down a bit. Doing keto really helped it instead of other diets that you'd quit eventually. Sucks that I had to learn that now. Definitely lifestyle changes over diets any day. That's when it really clicked into place.

  ","
  New author? Not trying? Most people have had lots of rejections but never gave up and finally became more than they thought, in good and bad ways. Wealth isn't always the end goal. You can't force someone to publish unless their agent or something. Maybe it's only meant for their eyes or someone special and not the whole world yo see? Writing can be very therapeutic. More about oneself in the works.
  
  So ya.. I wouldn't care. Maybe if they were nonstop complaining then it would be bothersome.. do or dont type situation. Just don't talk about doing it and then not trying etc.

  Silhouette behind us in one of my prom pictures. None of the other ones had anything wrong with them.
  
  Bullet shells appearing out of nowhere and rolling towards my dad. His mom had a table with those Spanish tiles on it and when he was taking down the kitchen ceiling one piece of the tile was up there and landed right into his shirt pocket.
  
  Hearing furniture being moved and footsteps going up and down stairs. Nobody else was there besides my mom and me. There was no furniture currently up there either.
  
  Some shadow figure. I ended up waking up and seeing it. Tried getting a bit closer and felt like I then couldn't move, scream/talk and then a calmness settled over me and the thing was gone. Ended up going back to bed. I don't dream of monsters so I know it happened.
  
  Fire alarm ended up going off when there wasn't a fire. Took the battery out and it was still going. Probably my dad's dad since he didn't care for my brother's friend, my sister's then boyfriend at the time lol
  
  ---
  
  I think this could be one as well. In Maine driving to the store late at night. These people ended up appearing out of nowhere. The clothing was odd and it was like they were glowing too. Mom served around them. And they kept walking and then it was just like they weren't there anymore.

He is unsettled by his hometown, but he returns to help a sinister, mostly mute man being kept in a cage underneath Shawshank. Sissy Spacek and Bill Skarsgård, who starred in feature adaptations of King's ""Carrie"" and ""It,"" respectively, are among the show's stars.""

  ----
  
  Went to get help or want help? Think there's a big difference there. Why don't you feel like you can't, anxiety aside from it? I think you are good enough and deserve happiness. You shouldn't be so hard on yourself either. Sounds like you need to break free from that thinking.. that someone wrote your life. Only you can ultimately do that. You have the choice to want and do better. You need to do it for yourself first. Other people can't influence you in the long run. Just talking about it even helps. Knowing you need to change things.. the hardest part is doing them in a way that actually helps you.

  I'd get medication. Try doing things you love in public settings, forcing yourself out there. Maybe carry something textured with you incase the anxiety acts up. Letting people know you have it so it won't be as awkward for you and them if it gets really bad. Stress balls. Take it day by day.. somedays will obviously be better than others. Essential oils or things that smell good could help. CBD products

  ","
  I think it's more the individual instead of the site/app itself. If there's an algorithm then that could be a factor as well - not seeing the pages you actually want. Some people could only show the good stuff happening to them or lying. Even some fitness accounts go too far with appearing to be fine 24/7 and manipulating filters. Happy for those who do the ig/reality pictures because it shreds some light on perception.

  A racing heart, maybe two
  
  Naked infront of you
  
  Hidden treasure
  
  A melody in the distance
  
  A moan escapes
  
  Promises broken and never said
  
  The meanings get lost, no translation
  
  Silent and watching in the night
  
  Hidden cover under a candlelit moon
  
  Searching but never finding my north star
  
  Tears come unbidden
  
  Hidden from you
  
  Intentions and confusion marks my soul in permanent ink
  
  Patches burn my eyesight
  
  I come unglued in the night
  
  Cautious and curious, unyielding light
  
  Questions with no answers
  
  Understanding, gone
  
  Whispers and chaos dancing, fighting
  
  Breaking free
  
  Dangling, dangerously
  
  Binds tighten
  
  Wrapped around me
  
  Breathing becomes harder
  
  Suffocating is easier, lost in space
  
  divides us
  
  Together or apart, a work of art
  
  Here and there
  
  Breathing scared
  
  Things of nightmares
  
  Thoughts of a different life
  
  When things don't move in the shadows
  
  The truth comes crumbling out
  
  Don't be scared for when that dawn cometh
  
  no more darkness just my shining light
  
  Misery ends

  Did some reviews on influenster & snaps there. Keep getting email surveys for them which usually means you'll get it but last time they even said I'd get nail polish and they never sent me it so I'm more wary of their promises now.
  
  Lulu (dog) kept wanting to come in my bedroom so made her go back into the living room. Was still following me acting like she knew it was new years and wanting a kiss so gave her some. Went back to my room and she left me alone since lol weirdo
  
  Been drinking said drink on&off.. more so closer to midnight.
  
  Watched the ball drop. Felt like of eh about it. Being alone and all that. Wanting to be out but also happy I'm not freezing outside somewhere lol
  
  Went on IG. Ended up doing my topnine. 1 pic of me, 4 of 1stphorm, food and beauty stuff. Makes me realize that I should take more pictures. Been a bit lax with posting there for a few months now.
  
  The tequila surprisingly made me feel tired. Eyes kept wanting to close while the after party stuff was on tv. Blew out my candle and turned the tv off. Washed my glass. Now in bed with the lights off waiting for sleep to take over

  Memory- when I was trying to walk and held onto the table for support. Did it then fell down and hit the table with my face leaving a baby indent tooth mark. Then crying, mom came into the room.
  
  Album- maybe Spice Girls, Britney spears or one of those people? Eminem.. idk.
  
  Movie- probably Lion King or Grease
  
  Success- not sure lol honor roll? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  
  Hard to remember what that could have been. Maybe the 1st memory. Seemed traumatic 🤣

   How is/was the dog and house sitting btw? Lol
  ","
  Very interesting :p
  
  Pickles was whining for food like always. Think the taco bell dog was sad that everyone left them.. wasn't as active as he usually is. Homer is usually the good one. Decided to be icky and jump up on me giving me kisses of death then decided to sit right on my lap earlier. You aren't no small pup!! Overall it was fine.  The first night Homer and Pickles slept beside me. Lyndsey sandwich:(   the other nights they ended up sleeping in the livingroom. Which was a bit odd since usually they are right there when I go to sleep/that room but they were sleeping already and didn't make any noises to come into the room. Rather sleep without dogs besides me anyways.

  Is this a new relationship or been a decent amount of time?
  
  Depends the the way they say it. Like if they felt aggressive about it or more calm and telling you how they feel mannerisms. Well technically they aren't even telling you what's up... just a half assed agreement.
  
  If it was me and felt like the guy was being that way, I'd think something might be up. It doesn't always have to be the worse case scenario. I don't think I'd overthink this much on it unless they got distant or kept going on in that way or I knew that it wasn't the ""right"" relationship for me to begin with.

   @ErinWolf4919
  
  posts.. only you two would know. People have random thoughts at times, could mean nothing. I wouldn't stress over it. Unless more weird conversations happen. Talking in person is way better than text... things can get misunderstood more. Can be tricky when you can't grunge the person's mood and all that. Not sure how I'd reply either.
  "
485655,"
   And when you said “yeah, that’s what I think. what abt you?” and they replied “yeah same.” Would you believe them or there’s something going more to it that they had to ask the question?
  ","
  I don't think I'd believe it. There's obviously a reason why they asked in the first place. Also if there was hesitation when they said that then that is a bit more uneasy to me. I feel like if they were genuine in asking it then they'd atleast give you more than just a ""yeah same"".. like they'd reinforce what they like/love about you, how good you two are together. ""Yeah same"" reminds me more of something you'd say if not paying attention, something/someone else on your mind or whatever.

  We switched to ""youtube tv"" and it basically has all the same programming as regular cable companies. Even records stuff for you. I watched most of the Christmas movies, the voice, pretty woman, impractical jokers and some other shows/movies there.

  Wasn't that dramatic. Then another lady's phone was missing/ someone was going around asking whose phone it was. Wouldn't surprise me if she took it and gave to her friend to ask whose phone it was to not seem guilty. Was not even an hour later after mine.

  Pretty sure this girl tried stealing my phone and obviously looked at my wallet since the lower bill wasn't the top one. Literally 20s then a 5 then back to 20s.. didn't seem like she took anything but damn... she was just major shady. Went over to get my bag and noticed the phone wasn't there so went back looking for it while she was over there. Told my mom that it wasn't there. Then made her call it.. and a few seconds before that the girl gets up off the couch right before the phone rang. Like it was out in the open THEN. She definitely was hiding it. Anyone would notice sitting on a phone... the way the bag was to begin with wouldn't have made it spill out like that either. Was resting there like someone purposely put it there. Her mom is going through a divorce but that's not justifiable behavior. Glad she didn't take anything but ya... like dude?? Then I'm pretty sure she had some of my sangria that I left on the counter. Went back in to get my water and the drink, noticed she moved it like she took a sip and then put it down type way.. not a legit moving it because it was in the way type thing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯was def more careful of my belongings after all that lol

   ""People can have bad days too about themselves."" It's not about bad days for you, since you react the same way always. Women with low self-esteem feel it's always true when someone says smth bad about them, and distrust smone who says anything good about them. You're like that 100%

  No. I'm not always that way at all. Usually laugh about it, agree or whatever. Say thanks. That doesn't really scream ""always"" to me. A few times it has got to me.

   How do you feel about old people driving passed 70? Should there be a law saying they can’t drive no more? Or should they get retested?

  There should definitely be some retesting. That's just normal to do, imo. If they are reckless to themselves and others then they should know better than to keep driving in the first place.

   What’s the difference between justice and revenge? 🤔
  ","
  Revenge seems more like a personal attack. Vengeful. Doesn't care about anything else.
  
  Justice is the right way. It's more a positive light. No grudge attached. Getting what someone deserves.

  Do whatever is right for you.
