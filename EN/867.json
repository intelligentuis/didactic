take much for one to beat me up . although , can zombies run ? bc if not , maybe it wouldn t be so hard to avoid them . . . plus guns would be producing , marketing and selling like crazy , so i don t if the zombies would stand a chance . don t they just slowly stagger after living people thinking about nothing but eating brains ? idk . . . . i ve never really researched or watched much about zombies . but if there was a zombie apocalypse , i would likely just commit suicide right away bc that s too much to deal with in this already sh tty enough world . i think at that point , god must have moved to a while new universe if god was ever present around here in the first place . and that would possibly mean that we deserved to be taken over by zombies so at that point , it s time to just give up on any hopes of a happy ever after . plus , if i committed suicide , then i might become a zombie and we would all slowly turn into the new earth population . . . . wait , what if we all

that means something","802430":"what happens in jurassic park world ?","802431":"well , this is probably gonna sound all messy and long . . . but one big decision i m having trouble with is deciding what i should do about school my future . . . the cs program my intended major at my university is super competitive and i already applied once and didn t get in and i can reapply , but honestly don t think i will get in with the grades i have . . . . i applied to a different school to transfer to and got in , but now the campus is closed so i can t check out the school . . . it s a few hours from home and i don t really like living at home , although i also have problems w sadness and anxiety and being far away might make things harder to handle , idk . . . i would be far from my dr counselor , for example . i thought about maybe trying an online school instead , but some say that employers aren t as likely to hire you then and also that would mean i have to stay at home . . . the school i m at now is known for their very good cs program , so i am worried about what opportunities i might lose by leaving the school . i m afraid that if i go to this new school tho , the sadness and anxiety will just follow me there and finding making friends will be as difficult as it was at my current school , and all this will mess up my school life there too like it did here , and nothing will get better and i will feel even more isolated cus i m in a foreign town . rn , i m taking a quarter off , but i have to decide if i m gonna try this new university or not by may and it s just not a decision i feel prepared to make bc idk how things will be for me by august . . . at this rate , it doesn t feel like things will be any better by then and i don t wanna be struggling there as much as i did here . . .","802432":"thank you for your kindness it s a lot , honestly . idk if you will be able to help . . . i m all sorts of messed up rn","802433":"so so , i guess . i have been staying up late ish and then napping during the day like most each day and i always feel so lethargic , but that s nothing new i guess . the hardest part for me not having my current favorite show airing bc of delayed episodes and anxiety about what happens for me once this quarantine period is over anxiety stressing about a big decision i have to make by the end of next month . and then also just loneliness and lost , but that s not really new either . i m kind of at a crisis or mess i guess in my life rn and i just don t know how things are gonna turn out or if things will get better or feel better , or if i m too messed up . . . . so i guess i m not even really worrying about the quarantine , mostly just personal stress that i already had , but being stripped from the new episodes of my favorite show isn t helping ,","802434":"i don t believe so . i really don t like being in water unless it s a shower or rain","802435":"huh ?","802436":"like the company ? don t really know much

loneliness","802451":"ugh . . . okay , here are my thoughts rn . . . how come everything i do is just wrong in one way or another ? like i can never win ? whenever i try being bolder , braver or showing more confidence or trust or belief , or less trustful , or getting outside of my shell , being more careful , taking risks , trying new things , being the best kindest person i can , reaching out , working harder , laying low , following all directions best i can . . . doing anything really , it s always the same failing result ? i would rather be dead then consistently a failure like rn . how come some people can do so much wrong , but then still get to be happy and successful like nothing happened . how come some people get to naturally be the society s version of attractive , smart , pretty , fit or whatever , while others don t ? some people are set up to succeed more or easier than others . if there s truly anyone spiritually believing in all of us out there or guiding us , they are slacking real hard on some more than others and for no good reason . . . i can t believe there s any kind of god or higher existance when i notice all this , no matter how hard i try , bc then that makes me feel as if that spirit is biased and doesn t care for me and many others , and that s just messed up . then that makes me wanna die even more . i don t think there is anyone looking after me or else why would it be the same results for so many years now ? and why for some but not others ?","802452":"accepting or allowing something or someone even though you don t want to or it s hard for you to do","802453":"i kind of depends on what this statement is saying . like i would wanna say , no , i think their heart is . i believe you have to touch someone s heart figuritively to be able to reach their soul . i would not say the eyes are bc some people are visiually impaired , and that could entail having two fake eyes or wearing sunglasses at all times . those people are definitely not all soul less though . but maybe what this quote is really trying to say that how a person sees something as in perceives it or whether the person seems trustful or not after observation of everything you notice about them . i would then put my answer as more of a yes . . . .","802454":"i think it can be in some situations , but ultimately i think it s more of a resource rather than a hindrance","802455":"go swimming hopefully","802456":"ya hear that , legna ?","802457":"the latter of the three","802458":"i don t really think of people s words like that . . . that s

dameski big will charlize glass matt steffinina robert green movies zendaya . this is all i can think of rn","802461":"i have this kind of idea , but i don t know what the title would be for it , but it would be something to do with helping supporting mentally struggling kids and teens , but in less restrictive ways then like worksheets or something . but i feel like there are more beneficial ways of helping with certain kinds of anxiety or depression than just cognitive behavioral therapy or worksheets . so , for example , going out to do something with them everyday that would uplift them or their confidence or something , idk and ofc there would be legal restrictions to prevent unlawful incidents . . . . just something different and more effective than the way it s typically done now . .

with dislike . . . feel like people should aim to be more loving rather than offending , more sweet rather than being pushy than dry , more warm hearted rather than cold blooded , more understanding rather than aggressive , smoke at others rather than glare . . . that s just one of the many problems of this messed world . people just don t wanna be kind , and when one is treated with rudeness ,

definitely you are right","802529":"well , to me , i would say it means that we love is the same in any instance . we love who we love and that s not our choice bc love is a feeling sensation that comes from within us we can t control it . so , whether it s a girl and guy , girl and girl , or guy and guy , or non binary and non binary , or whatever labels , . . . the love is the same idea the sexual excitement one gets for anyone is not their choice , it s what their body is naturally reacting to . because of this , it s unethical for anyone to be telling others who to love and which loving is right and which is wrong , or discriminating against people who don t love who you think they should . love is just love , there s nothing more to it . it can t hurt nobody , love is not danger , love is not from a rule book . . . . it s just love . no matter how hard anyone tries to reject a sexual orientation , ignore it , hide from it , abolish it . . . , it s never gonna change . love is just love .","802530":"not really , but just spit balling less than mediocre ideas . . . fav music genres ? fav desserts ? fav season ? main social media platform ? best strength between

so i decided to move to that acc instead , but then the ask vip , whatever it s called , was created and that changed everything and , ngl , now it s a bit overwhelming how much questions each acc gets , and it s pretty annoying getting the same questions on both accs a lot and answering my own questions cus they always get sent to me . . . but i like pushing myself to think about things others bring up and be honest about my thoughts w o the pressure , and it s entertaining to a degree , so that s why i keep an acc in the first place so whatever . . . i may end up shutting down javacow soon

that we would go back to when we found something , and put it in . well , eventually , i guess either it took us all a long time to find whatever or someone was just not doing their job right maybe ,
