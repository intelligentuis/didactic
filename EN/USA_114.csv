   Are you good at making grilled cheese sandwiches?
  ","
  Yeah but only the way i like to make it and i dont know if everyone would like it lol
  "
611549,"
   Oh ok, so you're talking about in general. I thought you meant people here don't care when you open up. Well, if someone gives you that impression, they simply don't deserve your energy. What you are is very precious and it need not be wasted on anyone who makes you feel like you aren't.
  ","
  Thanks. People on here are great listeners lol ? thats why i like it so much.
  "
611550,"
   OMG Lady, I can't sleep now...

   Pap of you now

  Im not really in the mood maybe later tho
  "
611552,"
   ? NO MERCY ?
  ","
  Good cause secretly thats what i like ??
  "
611553,"
   What do you mean? Why do you think they aren't paying attention?
  ","
  Because you can just tell when someone cares and when someone doesnt. Its in the body language, its there tone of voice,  and how they respond. When a person doesnt put effort in keeping eye contact when you talk they are most likely not listening (except im always listening, i used this body language trick to make it seem like im not paying attention when actually im seeing everything) when youre in a conversation with someone and you say something and their tone is like a little bit higher than usual means they were thinking when you were talking. Especially what they say after you speak, when someone just goes “ya.” They dont care lol
  "
611554,"
   It’s amusing
  ","
  How would it be amusing? Seeing someone in agony from being tickled?
  "
611555,"
   You would discover what a multiorgasm is.
  ","
  Oh jesus have mercy on my bungus
  "
611556,"
   Ok then that's totally false. It always feels extra special when you really share your deep thoughts.
  ","
  If its so special why doesnt anyone pay attention?
  "
611557,"
   I won't lie, I really want you in my bed.
  ","
  What would we do in your bed?
  "
611558,"
   She is not going to eat you muffin ! at least try once ! maybe your this try get her back dont be hesitate ! be a brave muffin ! wish you a good luck

  Thank you so so so much!!!!! ??
  "
611559,"
   Perfecto Muffin <3
  ","
  Awhhh thank you snickerdoodle
  "
611560,"
   When you feel like that, is it because you think other people don't want to listen or because you just think you're being too open?
  ","
  I fear that nobody really gives a fuck and wouldn’t care less about what i have to say.
  "
611561,"
   how hot is she
  ","
  Shes a beautiful baddie. Her makeup is always perfect and she always looks good.
  "
611562,"
   Was it comfortable when you talked or awkward at all?
  ","
  At first it was awkward and then things got comfortable super quick i think quicker than she liked.
  "
611563,"
   Im in tears rn
  ","
  Wait why are you in tears?
  "
611564,"
   If you made a YouTube channel what content would you be likely to post?
  ","
  I would go around trying different food places in crazy outfits and then eat food like some erotic bathing suit commercial lol
  "
611565,"
   Did the weather start to be a lil cold where you live?
  ","
  Its still hot as fuck.
  "
611566,"
   as a friend i would say try once to get her back !
  ","
  So i should tell her? Im so nervous tho
  "
611567,"
   I guess its about missing a person from past is it ?
  ","
  Yeah it is:( i dont know if i should just tell her the truth or just leave her alone?
  "
611568,"
   Why?
  ","
  I feel like im talking too much
  "
611569,"
   I want to meet you
  ","
  Why is that my dear?
  "
611570,"
   When is the last time you spoke? Is she taken?
  ","
  Yeah she has a boyfriend and we talked a little bit earlier this year. But guys I just realized something, she changed her instagram username to match mine holy shit. Last time i saw it, it wasnt what it is now and i saw it just a few days ago like after I posted pictures which hopefully means she was thinking about me?
  "
611571,"
   Do you think she liked you like that? How long has it been since you were close?
  ","
  She was the one that opened up to me about it. We were having a sleepover and she told me that she really likes me and that she likes girls more than guys. I kinda liked her a lot too but i was to shy cause I really liked her like shes so sexy guys she was turning me on in way i didnt know. Lol but i fucked it up
  "
611572,"
   Hi what's up
  ","
  I need to stop going on rants
  "
611573,"
   omg you've always been an angel. I love you, you sweet blessing
  ","
  It was like they adopted me to hold everyone together cause my sister wouldnt talk to anyone and my mom and dad would get mad and I would just say “keep trying you dont wanna push her away more she will wanna talk eventually. She will soon realize that none of us are getting younger and she will talk more.” And fair enough she has been really putting effort this year lol
  
  I just like helping people. I hate how this world has turned so selfish. Always “me me me. My dream. My page. My shit is better than your shit.” Like i cant stand it, nobody helps one another anymore - unless it benefits them. I hate helping those that are selfish cause they just got help to stomp on more people and it makes me feel shitty and wrong.
  "
611574,"
   Muffin ?
  ","
  Im sorry i got really sad
  "
611575,"
   Tbh any bestfriend you lost?
  ","
  theres one friend that i lost that when i think about it and look back it hurts me so much that i lost her. its all my fault too. if i just didnt shut her out, she would probably still be my best friend today. we really liked each other, to the point where i would have really gave being in a relationship with her a shot. honestly if she told me she wanted to see me now i would.
  "
611576,"
   noooooo ! not a good ! its sounds like perfect muffin isnt it ?
  ","
  it has to be perfect ... lol

   moved in with a idiot and fell out with them so i walked out and lived on the streets for 4 months last year best thing i ever did

  why was it the best thing you ever did?
  "
611579,"
   but i gonna call you my muffin XD! muffin with taste of sweet tart XD!
  ","
  that sounds like a good muffin.
  "
611580,"
   What do you remember as the first situation you mediated?
  ","
  omg i have so many faint memories.
  
  when our nanny was around she only spoke spanish and because of that my first language was actually spanish and until i was 3 years old i would fucking translate and mediate the conversation for my dad when he was mad LOL i have so many memories in spanish but i cant understand what either one of us are saying its the fucking weirdest thing. so my dad told me this story since i only remember pieces of it.
  
  during my parents separation i was the meditator for my siblings and my parents - my sister was very mad about the divorce and my brother went quiet but me i was the one that told them, ""if they are sad they shouldnt be together."" i have been the one thats gone to my parents explaining why my brother and sister do things and then i do the same for my brother and sister about my parents.

  why did you have to give me this visual? lol

   Wyd rn
  ","
  laying in bed with ash my little teacup panther, and on here just learning so much about the person i am because my mind will not stop running hence why this sentence is so long fuck.
  "
611590,"
   I love that! I've pretty much met no one like you in that regard. You being like that must neutralize so many potentially worse situations. I feel like even if I said the wrong thing or was upset, if someone approached me from that angle, I couldn't help but feel better and try to be better.
  ","
  now that im thinking back on it, thats why i never really got bullied cause someone would say something and i would just be like ""ok lets talk about this."" and just start asking questions until we are friends ahahah i would even do it with teachers but more in a smart ass way lol
  
  ever since i was little ive never liked making things worse, and luckily for me my thirst to study the human mind started at a very young age which made me seem like a patient well behaved kid but actually i was just spectating lol and ive always been a mediator cause i hate bad situations wow im learning alot about myself today

  second name?
  
  the name i actually go by is Savannah
  "
611594,"
   Do you prefer extreme cold or extreme heat?
  ","
  extreme cold cause i am a cuddle monster.
  "
611595,"
   That is nonsense, the ones I at least give you aren't and I'm sure it's the same for others. It wouldn't be satisfying at all if they weren't true to me.
  ","
  thank you for being you. :)
  "
611596,"
   Do you have a job?
  ","
  being alive is a job
  "
611597,"
   Why did you stop posting pics for us
  ","
  i just havent taken any pictures lately im sorry!! when i feel better i take pictures. if i dont take pictures i dont feel good. just remember that <3
  "
611598,"
   so you don have your part 2 i meant same mentality person ?
  ","
  it doesnt really feel like it
  "
611599,"
   Well ! that's really great to talk on yourself and groom yourself ! i'm with you in that task XD!
  ","
  thank you!!! you are great!
  "
611600,"
   Why is that selfish though? So what if you're getting something out of it too? You are a good person and you being that way makes relating with you easier, and makes it so there's no need to talk behind your back about any issues with you.
  ","
  thank you. thats very true. like even someone says something to me that hurts me i instantly like say why it hurt me and dive right into asking so many questions lol
  "
611601,"
   i dont think so ! i guess its depend on bonding between you and other person like how he or she treats you in your off mood ! mentality match matters what you say ?
  ","
  thats true. wow that would be nice lol
  "
611602,"
   hahahah well which therapy and what i did ? XD!
  ","
  i have therapy every week to talk about myself ahahah
  
  and helped me work through my thoughts
  "
611603,"
   Most compliments are fake
  ","
  why do people do that?
  
  like if you have nothing to say just dont say anything?
  
  or maybe try the truth LOL
  "
611604,"
   Do I have to shower you with fake compliments so that I get you to answer my question?
  ","
  listen here, im diving deep into myself right now so like its taking me a long time to get to every answer so be patient i am doing great work here
  
  also, dont ever give someone fake compliments.
  "
611605,"
   ahan ! so you want to be mis perfect ? lol !
  ","
  im a HUGE perfectionist. which is why i cant ever finish things because OF MY FEAR OF IT NOT BEING PERFECT.
  
  wow you are doing some great work here, i already had therapy today but goddamn ahhahah
  "
611606,"
   When’s the last time you had to do algebra?
  ","
  i havent done anything algebra related in a long time.
  
  but i had to use a lot of math for my job but not algebra.
  "
611607,"
   You wear small thongs?
  ","
  yeah, why would i wear big ones?
  "
611608,"
   why you dont share your pain with your love one or the person who listens you and give you positive vibes? caring is all about humanity baby girl :) <3
  ","
  because every time i try to share my pain, my side, or my thoughts - it always goes back to the other person and how i feel doesnt matter.
  "
611609,"
   hahah no need to be sorry every one has its own concepts and vision on some points you are right and might be wrong cause we cant be right all time !
  ","
  now thats true which is why i made a very strict rule among myself, ""never talk about anything you dont know about.""
  
  because then i can never be wrong. how can i be right about something i dont know? i hate failure so thats probably why i made that rule lol
  "
611610,"
   How can you yell if they're cold or not when you look into their eyes? Have you ever been wrong?
  ","
  they are empty. literally no soul, nothing. feels like youre looking a creep dolls eyes or a robot.
  
  and ive had many people  believe i was wrong but ive always end up right. and i just patiently wait for them to slip up and show the world their true self and im telling you if you just wait, the truth always comes out.
  "
611611,"
   Especially you tbh because you are someone who responds to attempts at being reasonable, so you have an open ear to anything if the person takes the time to explain where they're coming from.
  ","
  thank you for making it sound like im being a good person but its honestly selfish. i love studying human behavior and the brain. so the more i learn about the person - the better understanding. so it works in my favor. i genuinely am curious about how other perceive things that happen and their point of view and why. so yeah thats probably why it pisses me off.
  "
611612,"
   According to me thats the sign of humanity ! 
we all are equal to each other ! i really appreciate that girly <3
  ","
  we are all connected. people dont understand that we literally are all equal to each other. like scientifically our energy, and our cells - yes all our cells made different things but no one whos white gets more cells than someone thats black. no one thats asian has more energy than someone from Italy. like our bodies our all connected through energy which makes our energy connect to earth which makes our energy connected to the universe. we have to be connected for everything to work. so yes i believe we are all equal and when i see a person i look into their eyes (which makes people really uncomfortable lol) because im looking past their skin and features and i want to see within. thats why it takes me 5 seconds to know whether i wanna be around this person or not. theres been so many people ive looked into there eyes and i had to look away cause they were cold as fuck - and they always end up being actually psycho lol . anyways, i went on a rant im sorry. its my mind. lol
  "
611613,"
   Your late night thoughts ?
  ","
  my mind is racing a million miles per minute.
  
  i have this issue where if someone hurts me or something hurts me and i feel pain in my chest - i will go fucking silent and still and just focus on the pain. i will literally sit there punishing myself to feel the pain cause i am terrible. and no matter how many times i think, ""i need to move and take myself out of this situation."" i cant move. i can only move once the pain in my chest has finally left.
  
  and now im thinking about how much do you really care about someone if you are repeatedly finding yourself resenting them for things?
  "
611614,"
   Impressive <3
  ","
  yeah, and i just laugh and go ""what? im such a spoiled brat."" lol
  
  but i will admit that there are certain life experiences that have made me more grounded for sure.
  "
611615,"
   Have you visited any art galleries or museums recently?
  ","
  they just opened up in this area, so i was thinking of going but the line is INSANE. so maybe once it calms down if it ever does?
  "
611616,"
   I'd only speak well of you to anyone else. When you like and respect someone you make sure to honor them when their names comes up with others.
  ","
  OMG THANK YOU. thats what i literally tell people. you dont respect someone if you instantly go and talk about them behind their back in a negative way.
  "
611617,"
   What size

  small
  "
611618,"
   How much humble you are ?

  ","
  awh! i have to get a new address which i dont have right now.
  "
611620,"
   Please do tell

  i just wish people were better at actually talking to someone about how they feel instead of going to their friends or family and just complain about them and just get support from whatever and then pretend nothing was ever said.
  "
611621,"
   What is one anonymous question you’ve gotten where you would really like to know who sent it to you?
  ","
  theres so many. but the ones where they clearly sound like theyve been around me in person but not someone i really hang out with - those are the ones im super curious about.
  "
611622,"
   Who was talking about our Savannah?
  ","
  i dont want to get into it, but im just super annoyed.
  "
611623,"
   How often do you use your phone?
  ","
  not as often as i used to. i check it here and there but i just need a break from all of that.

   Hahah u can be a model later love, this feels imp and a bright future too
  ","
  yeah i see your point lol
  "
611632,"
   ok you wouldn't need to learn anything. upon arriving, you'd automatically inherit the knowledge of the natives at that time. you'd be living in a group of under 50 people who knew you well and that you were comfortable with. they lived in caves and impermanent shelters they'd set up..
  ","
  this doesnt seem at all bad.
  "
611633,"
   No. First of all, I'm not religious so to speak. But I do believe there is a ""Force"" that makes things happen. Science tell us how everything that happens, happens due to a probability for it to happen whose chances for happening are driven by many external factors we have no control over.
  ","
  star wars just popped into my head lol
  
  i mean yes thats all true. thats all explained by math. theres equations they can do to like somewhat prove this probability.
  
  but i think there is more to all of it that we cant comprehend or most couldnt comprehend.

   it hasn't been around for hundreds of years because the entire premise of the question is based on you essentially being the first person there.

  BUT how would we have the knowledge to know whether i truly was in fact the first person ever? the way im thinking about it is if im an explorer and i was set to sail there with the knowledge that nobody has EVER been there but what if i think i was the first person but i really wasnt? i think of all possibilities
  "
611645,"
   I have an explanation for that
  ","
  this ought to be good. you have an explanation for why God can just work in mysterious ways but no bid deal a father just lost his whole family in a car accident or the mom was raped and murdered but the daughter was left alive but without a mother. what mystery would God have to do that? and dont bring another imaginary friend into this, i dont need to hear about how the Devil works just as hard as the Lord bullshit.
  "
611646,"
   lol you don't go from hunting and gathering with a tiny group to building a castle overnight. not only could you not build one, you'd have no need for it. wherever you'd go, you'd basically be living the hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
  ","
  now how do you know what the land was like before i explored it? maybe to me its new land but i come across a small village thats been around for hundreds of years? and in this time maybe the worlds were able to open doors more frequently which made me the alien mother which made me superior and had the villagers build me a castle because i was one of the Gods for the Stars?
  "
611647,"
   Oh, heretics
  ","
  all of religion is heretics.
  
  today i went on rant, ""they say God works in mysterious ways and they are so mysterious that we will spend our whole lives trying to find the answer that we will never actually find out meaning that if its so mysterious without ANY possible explanation of why the fuck bullshit always happens and why God wanted it too then the God we think probably doesnt exist.""
  "

  ok i miss it too. damn
  "
611659,"
   Do you believe in love at first sight?
  ","
  in a way, yes. im gonna kinda nerd out so i apologize.
  
  we all have chemicals that are just our pheromones. these chemicals are what let us know who we are attracted to and who we are not (not just relationship, like friendship, just people we feel comfortable around) like when you walk into a crowded room with hundreds of people everyone manages to link up with the people they have the most chemistry with. have you ever wondered why that one person you saw across the room ends up sitting next to you talking to you by the end of the night? thats not just cause they are interested in you, their body chemistry attached themselves to you and therefore they believe they must like you. so my answer is yes because our brain cant decipher between feelings, it just knows ""my chemistry mixes with that person must speak"" and we mistake it all as crush/love at first sight when in actually we should look at it more as ""i will get along with that person i should meet them.""

   What's one thing most people don't know about you?
  ","
  Fun Fact: When I was a senior in high school i got scouted for the scholarship program for Harvard.
  
  yup, i say it - HARVARD. I know you guys are all gonna ask questions so ill just tell the whole story. So we all have to take that test before you graduate thats literally just to see if you were paying any attention all four years. I went to a school that taught us how to cheat on those standardized tests as well because (i didnt know this until I met the man from Harvard) those tests have a system where if you answer questions a certain way your test gets flagged and looked at because they can see how smart you are and i guess i scored so fucking high that test put me in the category of like 2% genius or whatever. so when my parents got asked to come to school with me i was terrified. when i walked in my teacher was next to some fancy looking man who was holding christmas cookies for me. He told my parents. ""Savannah is being considered for Harvard. With her tests scores and how she reflects on her transcript is exactly what we are looking for, but she needs to take more tests.""
  
  I turned it down, i wasnt ready to commit to something like that. i needed more life experience.
  
  the man did tell me at the end, ""you're IQ is so high that when you're ready to apply yourself, you'll most likely be able to do whatever it is that you want to do.""

If you vote, and you elect dishonest, incompetent politicians, and they get into office and screw everything up, you are responsible for what they have done. You voted them in. You caused the problem. You have no right to complain. I, on the other hand, who did not vote -- who did not even leave the house on Election Day -- am in no way responsible for what these politicians have done and have every right to complain about the mess that you created.""

  Example: my phone bill for one month was $3000.00 so my dad was pissed and so my punishment was “you wont be able to do that ever again... i got you unlimited everything.”
  
  - now people would think im just spoiled and its not funny at all but if you knew my dad youd be laughing cause youd be in shock

  ""Now, there's one thing you might have noticed I don't complain about: politicians. Everybody complains about politicians. Everybody says they suck. Well, where do people think these politicians come from? They don't fall out of the sky. They don't pass through a membrane from another reality. They come from American parents and American families, American homes, American schools, American churches, American businesses and American universities, and they are elected by American citizens. This is the best we can do folks. This is what we have to offer. It's what our system produces: Garbage in, garbage out. If you have selfish, ignorant citizens, you're going to get selfish, ignorant leaders. Term limits ain't going to do any good; you're just going to end up with a brand new bunch of selfish, ignorant Americans. So, maybe, maybe, maybe, it's not the politicians who suck. Maybe something else sucks around here... like, the public. Yeah, the public sucks. There's a nice campaign slogan for somebody: 'The Public Sucks. F*ck Hope.'""

  If you over use hand sanitizer then you strip bacteria that your body actually needs to survive cause people don’t realize that right now we have hundreds of bacteria on and in us but they are good for us so its not a problem until you take them all away then your body gets fucked by really bad bacteria and doesn’t know what to do to fight it.

  I have a secret that i have never told anyone. When i was a junior in high school i was gonna buy cookies from one of my classmates and after class they asked if i had the money which was odd because he said bring the money tomorrow but i had money in my bag. Well this guy nate and i were pretty close but had a falling out. He stole the money out of my bag and im pretty sure my classmate saw it happen cause of his face, he was like waiting for me to freak out but I just smiled and said, “i must have left my money on my bed, ill bring it tomorrow.” He was so confused and I didn’t tell any of my friends didn’t tell a teacher or my parents but my classmate did and which lead people to figure out that i knew someone stole from me but I didn’t tell a soul because im not a snitch and ever since that day that whole school had my back no joke. They knew they could trust me oh and nate wasn’t spoken too I didn’t realize that people kinda casted him out for doing that to me. So nate if you ever see this, i knew you were going through a really hard time and probably needed the money more than i did since you had to steal. I thought telling people would cause extra bullshit and neither one of us needed that but also fuck you i was nice to you.

  A bomb goes boom,
  
  Eyes pop heart stops,
  
  Resume.

  About what im about to do.
  
  They’re little and blue,
  
  They take you to a new world that youve always wanted to go to.

  ","
  Omg is that how lost we are
  "
612882,"
   you could make a locked question and i could send you some that way hehe ?
  ","
  Oh i will ima put on a cute outfit
  "
612883,"
   And then next thing you know it's been 54 hours and we're still tripping LOL
  ","
  Except we just think we’re tripping but actually since we are so connected we teleported telepathically to our original planet.
  "
612884,"
   would you wear your front slit skirt during a high or trip?
  ","
  I would love too. I would probably give you a little show ?
  "
612885,"
   130. something new you learned.
  ","
  When you look at a starry sky count 1,2 and thats most likely a planet. And 1 out of 5 stars is most likely a planet like ours so that means in our solar system the have about 40 billion planets to look at to see if theres other life.
  "
612886,"
   Dude it'd be fun to trip with you. I'd be in for it cause I can trust you obviously lol
  ","
  Oh yeah I would protect you lol. We would like dive into the stars and the mind of what it must look like on other planets ?
  "

  ","
  The boom shroom - room. ? i wish we could trip together lol
  "
612892,"
   Are you afraid of anything ?
  ","
  Where are world is heading towards
  "
612893,"
   how do you know a girl is into you?
  ","
  Im actually really bad at knowing when a girl likes me or is just really nice
  "
612894,"
   I've never had magic shrooms before actually. I'd probably have to do nothing for the day just to make sure I don't have a bad trip or something
  ","
  Just trip proof your room and make a solid playlist of your favorite music and melt into the floor while staring into the ceiling and see where the music takes you through the universe. Just make the room somewhere you feel safe and cant be disturbed cause that can cause terrible trips. The trick to tripping is 1. Doing it somewhere and with someone you feel safe 2. Keep reminding yourself before it starts that what you see is from the mushrooms, the faster your mind accepts that its impossible to have a bad trip.

   Now I’ll take this even more deeper and disturbing (if it’s not already enough). There are no limitations about sexuaIity anymore, there are no limitations about gender either because everything is a social construct shaped by culture, they claim.

  ","
  ????????????
  "
613058,"
   And sexuaI orientation is defined as “when a person has sexuaI feelings for another gender” and since gender is a social construct, under that logic, sexuaI orientation IS ALSO a social construct, isn’t it? ;)

   Many babies lost their p*nis because of circumcision. Yes, I do feel bad because they're innocent... they don't get to decide. They are FORCED to go through that. They won't remember? You never know, the brain is such a complex muscle, some might even remember pictures of their birth!
  ","
  Actually they’ve done multiple studies about this theory, i had to study the research experiments for a presentation. Someone (like you) was trying to make this point and so their research showed that the babies first year and half don’t retain memories in the way we think. Dont go flipping off your newborn cause the negativity doesn’t help their development of their subconscious but they cant retain those memories. I also read that procedures done on newborns are more successful because their cells are working so well. If you’re freaking out about circumcisions, dont ever watch a newborn go through a heart surgery or collapsed lung or when the baby comes out an addict and the shit they have to do to the poor baby - that’s horrific. If they cut off the penis they have amazing plastic surgery, im sure if they can transition male to female or female to male - i think they can make sure someone has a dick and what if the people whos dick got chopped were gonna have a small penis but since they had to get a new dick they got a thigh slapper? These are the things you gotta think about

   I think you haven't really seen what's like for a baby. If you were to see, and you feel empathy you'll know why it isn't worthy, it's inhumane and immoral to do that to such innocent creatures
  ","
  Innocent creatures? Were you never a baby? And so you’re feeling bad for a baby that will never be able to recollect what you’re feeling bad for? Its like feeling bad for that baby crying in the chair when they are getting their ears pierced... like they wont remember that pain in like a few days and move on to a different pain. Also doing something like that as a baby is the best time because newborns heal increasingly faster than when we start getting older. The cells are still piping hot so the baby will be okay

   Well, these men are different. Unlike the women's movement, they do like men but only deconstructed men. For MGTOW, women are like they are because of biology, therefore they don't believe women can change so they just go their own way.

   It's about men saying they had enough of women and don't want to be around them anymore. The older men turn MGTOW after going through a divorced thar ruined their lifes, and the younger men realize this society doesn't care about men at all and that women only care about status and looks

  Wait, actually what if Hitler was reporting back to the aliens and thats how he managed to get control and they wanted him to cause mass genocide and thats how he got all his advanced technology and why he was obsessed with flying saucers and human experimentation and America figured it all out and wanted to be apart of it and convinced him to pretend to kill himself cause America had bigger plans that would satisfy Hitlers masters of the universe

  ","
  If Hitler won dude omg Hitler would be an alien and we would all worship him.
  
  I have a theory.. what if the reason why Hitler hated Jews and was trying to get rid of them is because he was an alien and we had no idea that jews are actually a different species and thats why jews are the only ones that is a culture,race, and religion. Thats why they were called “the chosen ones” Jesus was a jew as well and we mistakenly thought of him as the son of God but what id actually he was an alien trying to teach his people. Why do jews always end up in high economic careers? Why are most celebrities jewish? Because they are all aliens ?

613560,"
   He was a mass murderer and a monster. He conned his way into power and destroyed the opposition. He wasn't successful, he lied and cheated and killed. Thankfully he was defeated.
  ","
  The definition of success is an accomplishment of an aim or purpose.
  
  His aim was to create a perfect world in his eyes and for him that meant take out an entire race of people. So by the definition he was in fact successful because he in fact accomplished what he was aiming for. His weapons and experiments didn’t just drop off after him, they were continued to be used to create a perfect world by America.. and he successfully murdered 6 million jews - im gonna say thats what he was aiming for sooo
  
  For someone to be successful they can be a liar, murderer, or cheater. The most successful people in the world are corrupted. The richest man in the world has a picture of Hitler and Stalin not cause he agrees with what they did because “they were successful leaders”

  - Her beauty is like learning,
  
  The more knowledge I accumulate,
  
  The deeper my passion has grown.
  
  Whenever I make a dark joke,
  
  Thats borderline inappropriate,
  
  Her laugh fills up the room - her laugh was crafted out of sunshine.
  
  Split second the world stops spinning,
  
  The clock stops ticking,
  
  Everywhere around starts to blur,
  
  All I see clearly is the way she throws her head back and covers her mouth like she’s trying to catch her laughter before it bursts out of her body.
  
  I wish I could spend all night telling her jokes,
  
  Just so I can have her laughter outshine the moon.
  
  The way she fidgets with her hands and bites the side of her lip when she starts to get anxious,
  
  Stopping myself from making our hands intwine and kiss her so she knows shes not alone. “
  
  He pauses,
  
  Holding in his breath,
  
  Stares up into the starlight filled sky,
  
  And begins again.
  
  “You know, she’s a really good person,
  
  I know what you’re thinking- there’s a lot of good people.
  
  She’s a good person down to her very core where most for us can feel a little fire burning,
  
  Hers isn’t fire - she has sunlight.
  
  After time and time again,
  
  people are using there fire to burn her,
  
  they don’t realize she was crafted by an angel - sunlight will always burn brighter than fire.”
  
  He begins to laugh,
  
  “I am so convinced she’s birthed from an angel and a combination of the stars and the sun,
  
  that I’ve started looking into religion again.
  
  I think religion is all bullshit,
  
  But,
  
  how can you explain finding someone with such purity in a world full of cruelty?”
  
  His mother doesn’t answer,
  
  She knows he was only being rhetorical,
  
  So she just smiles at her son.
  
  “What’s even more amazing,
  
  Is that despite all the pain,
  
  Caused by others,
  
  She still dusts herself off,
  
  And gets right back up.
  
  The strength,
  
  Will power,
  
  Resilience.
  
  She will not go down without a fight.”

   It really is. That's because of all the past limiting beliefs we've been told. Like ""money is evil"" or ""it's impossible"". At some point it sinks into your subconscious, and you truly believe in what you were told - even though they're not true at all. That's just what someone told you.

  I am too. My mom used to always say to me “life isnt made for the weak...” that always stuck with me cause 1. Its so true. 2. That was her backwards compliment telling me im strong. And she also would tell me “beauty only lasts for so long but your brain will last forever so focus more on your mind then your appearance” and thats why i got my tattoo on my arm of a brain in a jar. Wow im sorry i didnt mean to make this so long but im really passionate about always using your mind and expanding your knowledge.

The airport was a GHOST town and its one of the biggest international airports. 2. Everyone who was on that flight canceled. And what blew my mind was the people who work at the airport were so like unaware of what’s going on. They act like robots.

   what sort of psychic flashes have you had?
  ","
  well let me explain what psychic flashes are first. they are floating orbs or colored dots in the space, glowing light around people surrounding you (this would be their aura), shadows that appear to be floating in midair, glittering or flashing lights in space around you, or movement and twinkling lights in the corners of your eyes.
  
  i had a couple experience a few days ago. first, i was laying in bed and my room was pitch black and there was bright flashing white light. then i saw this little ball of white light just floating across the room. second, i was sitting on my bed and i was just on my phone and in the corner of my right eye i see movement a women as if shes sitting next to me talking with a lot of hand gestures. third, in the middle of the night around 2-3am i saw a shadow of a figure in the corner of my room. next morning bf at the time tells me he had the worst nightmare and the thing was standing in the corner just starring at him in his dream and i point at the corner i saw the figure and say ""it was standing right there."" and he was so freaked out he didnt know how to respond. he didnt tell me which corner yet... and he doesnt believe in that stuff but he couldnt logically explain how i knew what was in his dream unless i saw it too.

   I've known people like her. If they have problems with who they're dating, they will become extremely vicious about anyone in that person's life. It's hard not to get bothered by baseless attacks, but she's clearly out of control and not worth thinking about.
  ","
  So, she apologized to me last night about everything cause hes been telling her lies and she realized it wasnt me - it was him. But i mean if the person you love was telling you things about another girl, you’d probably believe the person cause you love them and would hope they werent lying the whole relationship but he was awful to her. So everything is ok.

  My response: I absolutely loved your letter? it was super funny actually. The pen moment cracked me up!! You have a great sense of humor. You really love your kitties - I could read about them all day just because I enjoy the way you talk about them. Cali is so expensive, I’m trying to get out of Cali cause I’m broke all the time, I can barley afford it. So you’re right unless you’re super rich it’ll be hard to survive. I had no idea you used to work for a bank?! I desperately so I gotta work that 9-5 even tho I wanna just start my own business and work from home but I kinda need a job to start working on my business. I think this was a great intro letter to start with. I really got to know you on an even deeper for some reason - maybe it’s the handwriting. Your closing signature  was really adorable. Thank you so much ❤️❤️❤️btw your pics of your kitties are the best. Especially the one of missy all mad. Her face omg ?? I got a good laugh

  ok i think theres a difference between domestic violence and defending yourself. if a women is threatening you such as ; getting in your face, cussing at you, essentially trying to fight, biting, punching, slapping you should be able to somewhat wrap your arms around her taking away her ability to attack. no one is saying just wail on the women and make things worse but there has to be a healthy way to stop women from acting this way without causing a lawsuit and uproar in the media.

  what makes me a good is nothing i own is just my own. i share everything when anyone - if youre in need of something and i have it but you need it more than i do ill just give it to you no questions asked. i care deeply of others and i experience deep amounts of empathy. people always tell me i see the good in people but only in those that have good in them - im not one of those people who try and search a good quality in everyone because i dont believe everyone is good. i try to be very considerate of my surrounds and of others. my bf says im too considerate and it makes him look bad lol.

  1997/1998. it was a traumatic year for me cause my parents got separated, i met my moms bf who she was cheating on my dad with, my older siblings were a wreck because they were already like 10. the thing i remember the most is my dad, my brother, and my sister all tried really hard not to show me how much they were all hurting for what my mom did because they wanted to protect the image i still had of my mom since i was way too young to understand what she did. i just remember the energy in our home was dark and tense.

  I judge people who are quick to assumptions and they make comments about things or people even tho they don’t know the full story or what’s going on - they just look at everything from the outside perspective because it makes them feel better about themselves and don’t care enough to actually learn why something is being done or said a certain way.

  If we except a fraudulent check that falls on the person who took the check. If we don’t document where cash is coming from we could be questioned as involvement of money laundering. We have potential or being robbed or held up hostage.
