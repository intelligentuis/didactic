You guys are so supportive of our Cimorelli music, but I wasn\u2019t sure what the reaction would be to my music. I was so scared of putting myself out there. Especially with my song \u201cRunning\u201d. That was the first song I released. Not sure why I decided to start with the most vulnerable one \ud83d\ude43 I remember when I announced it was coming out I was soooo nervous and for that whole week before it came out I could barely eat. Not only was it terrifying anticipating what people\u2019s reactions might be, but at this point in my life I was a very private person. I didn\u2019t like sharing struggles, or vulnerabilities with people. Especially not to strangers on the internet. I wrote this song when I was 17 with the sole intention of expressing my feelings about the situation I was in. I had no idea how to produce a song and not much of an idea how to write a song. My thought when I finished it was \u201cThere is no way I am ever realizing this. This is waaayy too personal.\u201d 3 years later, my baby was about to come into the world. Every song on my EP #Orange came about the same way. The only thought I had while writing these was this: What is the most accurate way I can communicate the way that I am feeling right now? The response I got to all of these songs was OVERWHELMING. Especially to Running. It\u2019s so humbling to see the support you guys have shown \ud83d\ude2d beyond grateful for you all and I\u2019m SO excited to see what this next year brings \ud83d\udc9c also shoutout to Mexico \ud83d\ude18\n  ","921794":"\n  Thank you to everyone who participated in Golden Ticket Week!! \ud83c\udfab So fun seeing you guys posting getting your golden tickets already \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b\n  ","921795":"\n  Like I was just scrolling and gabbie ( wdw jacks gf\/ baby mama) has been traveling the world I think they're in australia now...

We all had to show IDs individually, like why? How do you not know who the band is and when theyre performing etc? Then they refused to let us inside the venue for like 15+ minutes left us standing there in the cold. When they finally let us in we got everything set up and sorted with the equipment and so on.

Been such a crazy month !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well really a crazy last 2 months. We have been working SO HARD trying to get this year all finished out for you guys. Planning our best videos, trying a lot of new things, finishing up our TOUR, coming out with our winter merch line, jewelry line, and BOOK Believe In You !!!! In the midst of all of thisss I\u2019ve been trying to cultivate balance in my life \ud83d\udd4a it\u2019s been difficult for sure bc I have a tendency to be a bit of a workaholic \ud83d\ude05 I\u2019m like oh yeah I can do everything ! I can stay up late ! I can wake up early ! I can ignore my friends ! And myself ! And literally everything else ! But .... that ain\u2019t it. I reposted a quote on my story today that sums it up real well. It talks about doing your best and how you do your best when you take care of yourself. You do your best when you are healthy and happy. Doing your best is not running yourself into the ground til you can barely function. Trying to accept that. The biggest thing I\u2019ve been trying to change is making the choice to do things for myself even if it means sacrificing something else. Like going to bed when I know I need more sleep, being 5 minutes late when I need to grab something I forgot instead of just going without it, canceling plans when I need a night to myself. Bc when life gets so busy, you\u2019re going to have to sacrifice something and I am NOT sacrificing myself. Neither should you. The world will keep turning and you will be fine if you don\u2019t do every last thing people expect of you and you take the time you need to take care of yourself instead. \ud83d\udc9c\n  ","922595":"\n  Not posting the monday mood board on here this week, as that would be an extremely overdo of polls so if you want to want to see this monday mood board looo at my story.\n  ","922596":"\n  Its just awkward ...

Then people just thinking they're entitled ( not fans) to touch\/hug me or for me to hug them etc. HELLOOOO i don't like being touched by strangers or people.I barely know. A fan also has a panic attack as the show was starting, luckily our openers stopped the show completely to make sure she was fine. And theres also so much that was just a disappointment overall.
