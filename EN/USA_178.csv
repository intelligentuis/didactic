   Self love 6: In Ireland ""they love themselves"" and ""they're in love with themselves"" are seen as insults, especially amongst older generations. What's your opinion on this? Do you think they're insults? Is it good or bad to love yourself?

  Honestly I don’t see how loving yourself can be an insult, I mean I guess I understand how it can be to older generations. I guess when they hear love yourself they see it as being stuck up and conceited and thinking highly of yourself.  You should definitely love yourself, it’s very important to love yourself and to stay positive things and to accept yourself the way you are because everyone is unique in their own ways.

   That really is unacceptable behavior and I understand your desire to call him out. Some food for thought: Just leave him alone. He obviously isn’t truly interested in you and therefore isn’t worth your time, energy and thoughts. Especially since he I added you today. (My opinion)
  ","
  Yeah but the thing is he’s done it before. He has gone 6 days without talking to me but eventually gave in and messaged me and this time it was 3 weeks and instead decided to unadd me after 3 weeks that is, I would’ve thought he would have unadded me earlier but it took him 3 weeks to.
  "
955298,"
   It’s totally worth it.

  Right? I feel like it is. Either way he might not receive it or even respond but it’s still worth the try
  "
955299,"
   If his behavior makes you uncomfortable and you wanna set boundaries, A THOUSAND TIMES YES!
  ","
  I mean his behavior is totally unacceptable and disrespectful. I asked him towards the beginning of November actually it was the 9th if he’s still genuinely into me? And he said yes that he was and I left him on read but the thing is after that I haven’t heard a word from him in 3 weeks, absolutely nothing from him. Except he would look at my Snapchat stories and he’s score would even go up so he obviously had the time to talk to others but not me. He claimed to still be interested in me but went 3 weeks without saying a word to me yet had time to talk to others. I want to call him out on that no matter how desperate or pathetic I’ll sound and even though he unadded me on Snapchat today. Since he’s a narcissist obviously that will piss him off that I’m calling him out but I think it’s worth it.

   Sounds like a poopy head to me, Nikki. Well, I'm happy you uncovered this early. That's good. I'm happy you aren't going to be with a poopy head.

  Nooo lol my boyfriend
  "
955302,"
   Well if he does that then dump him because that sounds like a really jerk move. You don't want to get into a long drawn out relationship with someone who will turns everything on you. It's so energy draining. I've been there. No es bueno.

   Yea I'd want to know too. Either you like me or you don't. I got ghosted by a girl once and it was so confusing. I took her out a few time & I had a surgery. She sent me a card saying she couldn't wait to go out again and hugs and kisses xoxoxo all that stuff... and then she ghosted me!!! HAHAHA
  ","

   Aaaaw I see now. Some poopy head is semi ghosting you so you need to get a straight answer. Good luck! You will be better either way. Either a yes or a no. If a no, that's still good because then you know they were trying to ghost you & you don't want to be with a clown who can't be straight forward

   Might I ask, how you reacted or what you thought, when you found out about Chester Bennington‘s d3ath in 2017?
  ","
  Well I remember waking up and checking my phone that day and seeing a news notification that Chester has passed away. I immediately started thinking no this can’t be, it’s not true, this is fake. I started panicking and freaking out. But then I saw more notifications saying that he committed su*cide (which isn’t the case) and I instantly felt my heart shatter into pieces and like a half of me died along with him that day when I found out it was true and it actually happened. I was so devastated and in shock, I still am 3 years later. A part of me died that day and I still can’t believe he’s gone honestly, it’s hard to accept that. I know that he’s spirit is always here with us though🥺 I miss him so much.

   I have a question for you Nikki! How can this guy claim to still be interested in me but show absolutely no interest in me and can go days without talking to me?
  ","
  Well this is what I always say, actions speak louder than words! Sure, he can say he’s still interested in you or into you but what do his actions show you? He can say that but it’s his actions that will show you if he’s still interested in you or not. Don’t listen to what he says, look at what he’s doing. Actions will always speak for themselves, pay attention! His actions will show you how much he respects you. It’s simple really. Also just know if someone really wants to talk to you, they’ll make an effort. No one is busy 24 hours. Bs. And people make time for the things that are really important to them. Remember that!

  People in this generation and society don’t really have the time to do things that we enjoy and that make us happy instead we do things that we don’t enjoy and that don’t really make us happy and because of that we are depressed and with all that’s going on in this world it’s hard not to be depressed.

  ","
  Thank god lol
  "
956910,"
   Why do people kill each other?
  ","
  Ooh good question! Honestly I feel it’s because there’s often hate behind killing someone and even jealously as well. It’s very sad to think about. It could also be because of greed and wanting something that, that person might have and you don’t so you resort to killing them. It’s messed up. I always wonder what goes through a killers mind while they’re killing someone.. like what are they thinking and why do they do it¿  I find it very fascinating to learn what goes on in a killers mind and their thoughts as well.

You have to follow your dreams and passions in life that make you happy and that way you’ll love what you do and you’ll be making money from that and working hard for what you want in life.

   Past Spam: What does ""living in the past"" mean to you? Rant if necessary
  ","
  I believe living in the past means you’re still stuck on something that happened in the past and you can’t move on in matter how hard you try to. It also just means you think too much about the past and you believe that things are the same as the past. It’s better to move on and stop living in the past and live in the present and focus on your future!

   What’s the difference between love at first sight and lust?
  ","
  Well firstly, you can’t fall in love with someone at first sight. That just isn’t possible. And you don’t fall in love, that’s just the feeling . You actually grow in love with someone as you get to know them on a deeper level and maybe even feel a connection to them. And honestly if you do “ fall in love at first sight” it just means you have strong and immediate attraction to someone you have just met. Lust is just basically the desire for someone on a physical level. It’s a overwhelming feeling of sexual desire.
  "
957982,"
   Lol, you’re overreacting.
  ","
  Bahahaha no I’m not, that’s childish
  "

  I mean that could definitely be a possibility without a doubt. I mean that would be a little scary but also interesting if we aren’t real and just living in a computer generated stimulation. Could you imagine all we’ve ever known in our lives is just fake and instead a stimulation that would be insane to think about actually😶 and if we are living in a computer generated stimulation that means people are watching us from another world and thinking to themselves wow these people are crazy!

  I think we dwell on things that don’t matter because we are so caught up in doing things that we don’t like instead of doing things that we’d enjoy in life and that would make us happy in general but that’s not how life works.

   Why do we consider babies healthy if they are ""plump"", but women who have the same body composition are considered ""fat""? 🤔
  ","
  Honestly that’s a good question, I think we consider babies that are “plump” healthy because they look like they’ve been fed and have gotten all the nutrients that they needed while in the womb in order to grow up and be healthy. But on the other hand, women who are plump are considered fat in this society because this society thinks that everyone should have a fit/toned body and if they don’t then they’re not just automatically fat which is very wrong and saddening. I feel like in this generation and society people believe that everyone has to look a certain way in order to be accepted and to fit in. And if someone dares to look different they get judged and treated differently and that’s just so messed up honestly and devastating because everyone is beautiful in their own way and they should be happy with how they look because that’s what makes them, them and everyone is beautiful.

   1. When you receive a question, do clauses like  “don’t lie/be honest” affect the way you answer it?         2. Do you feel better not answering a question when it says “don’t have to answer if you don’t want” at the end?         BQ: Do you answer “bonus  questions”?
  ","
  1) No honestly clauses like that don’t effect how I would answer the question because I always them honestly and genuinely.
  
  2) I mean if they don’t want me to answer it, I wouldn’t but I still could if that wasn’t the case.
  
  3) bonus questions? Meaning shoutouts or?

   Are criminals born or made?
  ","
  Honestly I don’t think anyone is born necessarily a criminal. It all depends on the environment you grow up in and your surroundings as well. Also the people you grow up with. A criminal definitely becomes a criminal due their past experiences or the environment they grew up in. It could’ve hurt them so much and caused them so much trauma that they decided to inflict harm onto others. What goes through a criminals mind is very interesting honestly, like why they do what they do and what they’re thinking while they cause harm to others. It’s fascinating honestly and terrifying at the same time.

   What do you think the effect on humanity would be if we didnt have music?
  ","
  Oh wow, if we didn’t have music I feel humanity would be even more insane then it already is. We listen to music because we find it hard to express how we are feeling and music helps us express how we feel through the lyrics of the songs we enjoy listening to. Music helps us escape reality and go somewhere else where we feel relaxed and at peace. It helps us get through so many difficult times and experiences that we have to experience in life sadly. Music also brings us all so much joy and a feeling of warmth and so much joy and without it the world would go even more crazy and it would be so quiet and dull if you ask me.
