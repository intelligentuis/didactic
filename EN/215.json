All horses have weight limits for things they can carry that can\u2019t be exceeded, otherwise they risk injury.\n  \n  A general rule I was taught is if you (or the weight of the 2 people) weigh more than 20% of your horse\u2019s entire body, then you\u2019re too heavy to ride that horse.\n  \n  For example: an average horse weighs ~1200 lbs, so the animal cannot safely carry a rider(s) + equipment of more than 240 lbs without risk of serious injury\n  ","230779":"\n  No offense, glad you\u2019re recovering, but why are you telling me this...\n  ","230780":"\n  Sorry for your bad experience\n  ","230781":"\n  Yeah if they\u2019re cool with it!

If you\u2019re a balanced rider who maintains proper body position while balancing your own weight over the horse\u2019s 15th thoracic vertebra, allowing your weight to be supported on their latissimus dorsi by your thighs, dropping your weight down through your calves to your heels, you won\u2019t hurt the horse at all! That\u2019s because this position aligns the rider\u2019s center of gravity with the horse\u2019s center of gravity, therefore making it easier to carry you. It also puts the most weight on their supporting back muscles (the lats) which are very strong.\n  \n  When riding in a saddle, in order not to cause the horse discomfort, you should still maintain correct body position as well as having the saddle placed between T8 and T18, so as not to put any weight on the floating ribs or  hinder the shoulder blade movement.\n  \n  If you\u2019re unbalanced and flop around on their back then no matter if you have a saddle or not you could potentially make them uncomfortable or eventually injure them after repeated rides.\n  \n  Here\u2019s an infographic I created showcasing correct and incorrect rider position!\n  ","230787":"\n  Be rude or mean to service people like waitstaff or retail workers or treat animals or children poorly.

Just like any animal you can look at their body to see if they have any visible signs of neglect or abuse like large lacerations or infected areas. That would probs be pretty obvious haha\n  \n  You can also look at their body condition relative to their age. Older horses can sometimes look a bit thinner and droopier just like elderly people, but young horses shouldn\u2019t look that way. You shouldn\u2019t be able to see a young healthy horse\u2019s ribs, backbone, and hip bones too clearly. That would mean that they\u2019re too skinny and don\u2019t eat enough food. It\u2019s also bad for them to be way too fat. You can also look at their hooves and see if they\u2019re overgrown (indicating poor health and bad care from their person) or if they\u2019re nicely maintained and help the horse bare weight evenly. You can look at their teeth, coat condition, eyes, lots of things can tell you if a horse is feeling well or not.\n  \n  Chance is currently 21 I believe.

I like calling him either Chancellor or Chance the Horse like Chance the Rapper haha.\n  \n  He\u2019s an arabian cross and has never raced. He was bred for western pleasure I think but has been a trail horse for most of his life. We usually go on nice trail rides and do strength training up and down hills, practice flatwork and balance exercises with leads and diagonals, and work on bending. Just keeping him in shape and helping him keep entertained.\n  \n  I\u2019d love to teach him to jump one day but I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019ll ever really be able to jump very high.

I have no idea what I was wearing though, why does it matter?\n  ","231713":"\n  No\n  ","231714":"\n  Again, not discussing body count lol\n  ","231715":"\n  Sandy for sure\n  ","231716":"\n  Not discussing body count\n  ","231717":"\n  No\n  ","231718":"\n  Oh lmao no ew\n  ","231719":"\n  What?\n  ","231720":"\n  No I just think they\u2019re wasteful. I\u2019d like a natural burial and to have oak tree seeds planted on my grave site so as the tree grows and it uses my body\u2019s nutrients I essentially \u201cbecome\u201d a tree :)\n  ","231721":"\n  Yeah very often\n  ","231722":"\n  No I don\u2019t want to be buried in a coffin\n  ","231723":"\n  I already told you I don\u2019t do that.\n  ","231724":"\n  Black\n  ","231725":"\n  ...never. Everyone knows that\u2019s rude...?? This is a weird question\n  ","231726":"\n  No I\u2019ve never wondered that...\n  ","231727":"\n  Depends on what poison. Some become ineffective after a certain period of time.\n  ","231728":"\n  Yeah they\u2019re cool I guess. Buttons are quicker tho\n  ","231729":"\n  No it\u2019s pretty cool and I think it\u2019s smart to homestead. The less we have to depend on giant corporations and the more we can sustainably and peacefully exist by ourselves without factory farming, fast fashion textiles, etc. the better!\n  ","231730":"\n  Yeah totally! Critics praised the new  Lion King remake by Disney for its beautiful and realistic looking characters and it made a ton of money in the box office. I thought that movie was total garbage haha so yeah, that just proves your point. Everybody has different tastes and opinions\n  ","231731":"\n  It\u2019s a country that was literally built by immigrants of all races. That\u2019s with the American dream is supposed to be about right?... coming from somewhere where there aren\u2019t opportunities and building yourself a good life in America no matter your background. Haha honestly I think there are almost the same amount of people who speak Spanish (maybe more) in the United States as there are people who speak American English\n  ","231732":"\n  No, constructive criticism helps us grow and learn. Negative and unwanted criticism aka \u201chate comments\u201d etc. only serve to bring others down. Not fuck the critics, fuck the haters lol\n  ","231733":"\n  You can say something bluntly while also trying to put it nicely, but when somebody says that a statement was brutally honest it usually has a more negative connotation\n  ","231734":"\n  No they\u2019d be too obsessed with them self\n  ","231735":"\n  I hate the dentist! I go in for my yearly check up but not much else unless there\u2019s a problem\n  ","231736":"\n  Yeah! Plus I used to live there so we learned about Hawaiian history a lot at my house lol\n  ","231737":"\n  If you\u2019re the same anon as before, then we already talked about this.\n  ","231738":"\n  Is it Hawaii?\n  ","231739":"\n  A question many are asking in these strange and messed up times\n  ","231740":"\n  ... no I already said that I don\u2019t support President Donald Trump\n  ","231741":"\n  No I don\u2019t have enough money to buy enough food to hoard. When the panic buyers scooped up everything at the store we just went without. My parents even had to mail me toilet paper once bc we couldn\u2019t find any at the shoppes\n  ","231742":"\n  A well-educated person not only knows things they learn from books but can also learn from the mistakes and successes of others around them. They have knowledge of other cultures, are open to new ideas, can change their opinions after learning new information, can show empathy and sympathy for all beings, and they make geoliterate decisions.\n  \n  I know a lot of people who went to school who I would not consider well-educated\n  ","231743":"\n  Not when I don\u2019t have to go. I much prefer to use the restroom at home though. Public toilets are disgusting \ud83e\udda0\n  ","231744":"\n  Loooove Smashburger! Their rosemary fries are amazing. I\u2019ll def have to try it out thanks \ud83d\ude0a\n  ","231745":"\n  Nah I\u2019m over vaping forreal. I hopped on the bandwagon when vaping first came out and I had a juul and before that I had a box mod\u2026 But I got tired of it really quickly and didn\u2019t like the way it made me feel. Now seeing all of the anti-vaping commercials that have come out recently telling you what\u2019s in a lot of vaping products (like lead apparently) has me convinced that\u2019s why I felt so bad when I was vaping\n  \n  #OverIt\n  ","231746":"\n  Ooo okay! Is it a fast food chain or a mom & pop shop??\n  ","231747":"\n  I don\u2019t think it matters if God is a man or a woman. If God created the universe in their image and the universe is imperfect, then it is exactly as they envisioned it and is therefore perfect\n  ","231748":"\n  I haven\u2019t gone to church in years\n  ","231749":"\n  Popeyes 4 lyfe\n  ","231750":"\n  Always depends on what the option for soup is and what dressings they have for the salad\n  ","231751":"\n  If it\u2019s crispy and not soggy then yeah I\u2019ll eat it\n  ","231752":"\n  Some people count that as meat and some don\u2019t. I count fish and other seafood as meat, so if I decided to go vegan or something then I wouldn\u2019t eat that either\n  ","231753":"\n  That seems very situationally dependent. Obviously I don\u2019t want to ever eat a person in my entire life if I don\u2019t have to \ud83e\udd22\ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n  ","231754":"\n  Yeah probably but I\u2019ve never tried. I love chicken nuggets too much haha\n  ","231755":"\n  Yes damnit\n  ","231756":"\n  It\u2019s not? It helps you manage your budget and keeps you eating a variety of healthy and good tasting foods\n  ","231757":"\n  Well, yeah of course not. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have taken it to the shop lol.\n  \n  All I\u2019m saying is that I believe what your mechanic was asking your uncle was NOT \u201cplease diagnose exactly what\u2019s wrong with your vehicle for me\u201d and was actually more along the lines of \u201cdoes it make a funny sound, do anything abnormal when you drive it, have a check engine light on, a noticeable leak from the bottom, etc\u201d.\n  \n  You don\u2019t need to be a mechanic to realize your car\u2019s brakes stopped working out or it screeches when you make turns and stuff like that haha. I think he probably just wanted a bit more information before he had to look at every single part of the car to see what worked and what didn\u2019t.\n  \n  My mechanic asks the same questions of me when I bring my truck into the shop. Always thought it was a standard question. Like how the doctor says \u201cwhat brings you in today?\u201d when you visit. Like you don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s wrong with you but you know what the symptoms are so they can figure it out for you. That kinda thing.\n  ","231758":"\n  Your uncle sounds like he\u2019s being rude for no reason...no point in being rude to someone who\u2019s required to ask you that question as part of their job.\n  \n  Any info he would\u2019ve provided to the mechanic would have been helpful and would\u2019ve helped them do their job quicker and easier, therefore costing your uncle less money in labor costs since it would\u2019ve helped them spend less time trying to figure out what to work on on the car...you asked my opinion and there it is.\n  ","231759":"\n  Sometimes \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\udf38 \ud83c\udf33 \ud83c\udf3e\n  ","231760":"\n  What are you going to do today?\n  ","231761":"\n  They biologically develop slower than females. Boys are dumb and irrational and men don\u2019t get mature and calm until they\u2019re like 25-30. Good luck sis! \ud83d\ude02\n  ","231762":"\n  My boyfriend likes ham on his omelette too but I don\u2019t like ham very much. Too salty for me! \ud83d\udc37\n  ","231763":"\n  I haven\u2019t read a book in so long. I think the last one I read was \u201cthe old man and the sea\u201d... it\u2019s a classic that everyone seems to have read before me lol. Everyone seems to go on and on about the symbolism and how great it is, but honestly I didn\u2019t find thaaat interesting.\n  \n  Not bad but not as amazing as people say. Maybe I would have liked it better if I would have actually studied it in school or something and had people explain to me more about the literary devices and stuff \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n  ","231764":"\n  Thanks :)\n  ","231765":"\n  I love omelettes. What do you like to put in your omelette? I like cheese, sausage, peppers, and chives in mine!\n  ","231766":"\n  \ud83d\udc05 no problem :) stay safe!\n  ","231767":"\n  Beezie Madden for her dedication to the sport and her unfaltering and true sense of horsemanship.
