way you deserve to be loved but they do it in a way that the person doesnt like so it looks like they aren t loving them . we put expectations on love when we shouldnt . there isnt only one way to love someone or how to show love to someone . we also dont always know whats best for ourselves , we may think we deserve love in a certain way but we are wrong . example a girl may think she deserves to be loved by gifts and money , but the guy might want to romanticize things a little more but the girl just doesn t care about that kind of love . i feel i will receive the love that people are

their hand or rub their back while helping them take deep breaths . try distracting them with music or singing i cant sing what i like to do is help the person ease into why they are panicking and then kinda guide their mind through it . when someone has a panic attack its because they are bottling up something thats eating them up inside and they need to have a safe trusted person to be able

brains , what makes us really believe that one of them wont suddenly start thinking for themselves or somehow get preprogrammed . we program humans and reprogram over and over . . . why wouldnt we do

was really good at school . so i had a lot of freedom that year . got to go to disneyland six flags a bunch since everyone was in school . my best friend and i hung out everyday , we had no rules from

double the work and got a . gpa so thats why thats my favorite ages . it was lawless for me .","481270":"i don t believe in forcing anything , especially not the universe . if someone cant follow through with something , i understand that theres something else going on . the spirit , mind , or body wasnt ready to do so or it just wasn t supposed to happen . i never take anything personally .

anyone .","481271":"i never want to go to high school ever again . not even i was undercover . high school is so toxic i don t miss it at all . i was ready to be out of high school before i even got

easier for everyone to use . i know im not the only with a lot of activity it would make it sooo much easier .","481275":"nope . theres even some where i understand the context but i just dont know

outlandish idea . they have said that some dinosaurs probably had feathers . they are discovering that we were wrong about dinosaurs for a long time . i can totally see this being a possibility because an alligator is actually a dinosaur that has been evolving and adapting for years . scientists say they are perfectly made for earth .","481288":"i love the things you think about . i would never even think about that . thats just such a lovely thought . thank you so much","481289":"in the car . i actually really enjoy sitting in the car , especially if i can people watch at the same time . one of my favorite things to do with someone is sitting in a nice warm car in the dark with food , a joint , maybe even a bottle , just talk about everything and anything . i used to spend hours in the car with my best friends after going to the beach or shopping and just talk for hours . ive always felt safe in a car . since i was a little girl . i never played with dolls i had toy

photos with other people in certain locations that probably helped him figure out more about me .","481296":"yes . it was so scary . so first they would harass me nonstop on ig this was back in . he kept trying to hang out with me and i had a job at the time so when i was at work i never told him where i worked or lived so he calls my work asking for me and on the phone he says hes outside waiting for me . i had to tell my manager and they kinda protected me and took me home . had to make a police report and everything . so i thought it was over . a random account starts spamming me i blocked all his other stuff and found out it was him . blocked him again . im living in san diego and i get a screenshot from a random account on ig saying they live right next door . which they basically lived down the street . . he kept saying he was gonna come over and all this stuff . well i sent the cops to the location and i havent heard of him since .","481297":"i dont know about that

bad","481300":"what if we are descendent of some alien species which would make them look similar to us but not really like humanoid means standing on two legs . i am also just a bag of bones . so i wouldnt be chosen to eat . now some of these large americans are ripe for the picking . its like america is the cattle for aliens and thats why they are fattening us up and the american government has a deal with the aliens and thats why so many people go missing and arent ever found . wait i dont think a lot of fat people go missing though . . . hmmm maybe they just feed them fat people right after they die from heart disease and thats why thats the leading cause of death in america . . . hmmm these are my thoughts","481301":"i would do anything for a pininfarina battista","481302":"look at this beaut","481303":"people still ask me which high school i go too","481304":"theres some drama on here that i didn t realize but now im all annoyed because i don t understand why people have to steal other peoples identities . there should be a serious criminal charge against people who catfish isnt it kinda like stealing someone s identity ? they dont even think about the damage they are doing to people either . nobody thinks anymore .","481305":"every two days . if i can push it three days without grossing myself out . but i always shower even when i dont wash my hair .","481306":"i am so high maintenance when it comes to my food now . if its processed at all i probably wont eat it . my fish cant be from any fish farms . i try to choose only organic items . i only really like fruits veggies from farmers markets .","481307":"more game creators should make shows and movies . the concepts they come up with for games are so awesome . if people put just half of that much effort into shows movies these days , they would be badass .","481308":"i have no idea . honestly all i would require is a budget for getting my hair done my nails eyelashes makeup shopping allowance gym membership streaming services for shows movies gaming unlimited amount of food so whatever the amount that is that covers all that and i can save","481309":"i sadly don t remember a lot of details but i remember little snippets . for the last week and half i ve been having reoccurring dreams just in different situations . theres always this power ancient wizard thing with more of an ox head in all black hooded cloak . and in every dream he is teaching me magic . last night my dream was about battle magic since someone was trying to kill me . the wizard dude was just coaching me but it was like

wish this was in our mouths","481315":"watching shows actually helps me escape a little bit . reading also helps me get out of my head for a little bit . writing helps me get everyone on paper and out of my head","481316":"life is just unfair . life isnt good to nice people . i had to learn that just because i treat others with respect and kindness doesnt mean people still wont basically spit in my face . everyone wants to have the illusion of being a good person but most dont want to put in the effort of actually being a good person . its hard to find honesty these days and because of that i assume everyone is bullshitting me . it breaks my heart seeing the modern world we live in is creating a world full of inconsiderate people . people only think of others when it benefits them in some way , nobody thinks of others just to think of them anymore .","481317":"i could probably play a high school student or college student .","481318":"it s literally snowing as we speak","481319":"awh

not hating on the instagram thot community onlyfans but i will admit that it has increased the idea for people to just be worried about naked photos . to the point that i have noticed theres an increase of people not caring about what people think or feel and just want to objectify .","481793":"probably from some sort of accident , like a child was climbing a tree and slipped but id be there to catch the little friend . i feel like it would be people of all walks of life . instead of blm it would be glm giants lives matter for the ones trying to protect me and there has to be an other side ya know ?","481794":"awh , thank you ! that makes me happy that you think so .","481795":"i enjoy sharing my mind more","481796":"why ? ! i really dont . i think about a nose job a

out that they just eat garage or trash basically . another thing is most places don t properly clean the shrimp before cooking them and people dont realize that their not only eating an animal that eats shit but you re also eating its shit as well . like my sister showed me how much poop is inside a shrimp . . . its soooo gross .","481815":"i had mexican food for dinner . tacos a

really giant i guess lol probably run for their lives or try to kill me . their would be some conspiracy that i am evil and i eat people but then i would end up doing something nice for someone most likely a little child and then they would protect me and slowly convince everyone not to kill me but their would still be a group called giant hunters that would have to just protest peacefully about my existence .","481830":"what the actual fu . ck ?","481831":"would you dress up as bugs bunny ?","481832":"i am in a pretty good mood today","481833":"ehhh i mean , compared to him im a
