Horses are friendly and curious by nature, and when they\u2019re not, there\u2019s a reason.  In the case of Bucephalus, it\u2019s pretty hard telling how he really was or what really happened with him because history doesn\u2019t write about every detail of people or animal\u2019s lives as they were actually lived. It\u2019s always from a perspective of someone else and sometimes that perspective can be greatly exaggerated or completely fabricated. If that really was true and Bucephalus didn\u2019t let anyone other than Alexander The Great ride him, it definitely had something to do with mistrust, poor handling, or fear leftover from a bad incident in his life.\n  \n  Nowadays we know SO much more about horse\u2019s health, wellness, psychology, and training than we did back then, and our methods today are much gentler and more humane- so it could\u2019ve been a product of poor or harsh training he received that made him like that. Even today though, I honestly believe a lot of \"one person horses\" are human-made. Either their early\/initial training and handling was done by one single person most of their lives and they straight up were never socialized, or something negative happened in their life to cause them to mistrust humans early on and then one specific human was able to earn their trust back.\n  \n  The problem is - it becomes a self fullfilling prophecy. It usually goes like this: The horse is comfortable with their one person and acts just fine with them because they trust them. But if the horse gets introduced to someone else or handled by someone else they freeze up or flip out and the owner immediately thinks \"OMG - horsey has never done that before! This is bad! He can never be ridden or touched by anyone else otherwise he\u2019ll hate it, it\u2019s dangerous, and bad for the horse!\" and then they claim that horse just doesn\u2019t like other people, won\u2019t let anyone else ride them, and that they\u2019re a \"one person horse.\"\n  \n  The horse is then never allowed to work through their fears or trust issues with other people and because of that they are never socialized.  That just makes them become more set in their ways as a \"one person horse.\" Even when people \"try\" to socialize a one person horse, it\u2019s usually only a half-hearted attempt. Maybe an hour or so, or several short sessions with a different person, but it sometimes takes a long time to gain the trust of a horse and build their confidence. It\u2019s much easier to just say \u201cno, he\u2019s a one person horse\u201d and leave it at that.\n  \n  Building on that, back when Bucephalus was alive, I\u2019m not really sure people cared all too much about letting their horses gain trust and confidence like we do nowadays because to them, horses were like machines. They were for transportation, plowing, war, and carrying heavy loads. As long as you could force them into submission enough to do what you wanted it was good enough. Nowadays we understand that that\u2019s incredibly cruel.\n  ","222798":"\n  Yeah I love the snow it\u2019s way better than the freezing rain or ice that we typically get where I live \ud83d\udc36 \ud83d\udc95\n  ","222799":"\n  We had a nice day in since it was snowy and cold.

That would be kinda cruel fr I agree. Totally correct me if I\u2019m wrong but it seems like there might be a bit of misunderstanding going on about the way hunting is accomplished tho? Chasing them and scaring them isnt how you hunt. That\u2019s the exact opposite of what you have to do lol.  That would be waaaay too hard anyways haha. Humans are super slow and it\u2019s illegal to hunt\/ fire weapons from a motor vehicle. Animals are too fast for that and if you scared them too much they\u2019d probs just leave the area and not come back and nobody wants that. Wildlife is so pretty and nice and good for the environment :)\n  \n  I don\u2019t hunt and never have but a lot lot lot of my peers and friends do\/have as well as some of my family and they all tell me that instead, you have to track their movements for a few months beforehand with trail cams and look for footprints and signs of them around you to see where they naturally like to hang out. After you know where they like to be, when when hunting season comes around you go sit in a deer stand, in a tree, or in a blind and you be very quiet and sit very still and wait for hours and hours for them to come to you.\n  \n  You can call to them using special animal calls or by just using your voice (if you can make a convincing enough sound). People usually go to great lengths to go undetected by the animals. I think that whole part is pretty neat. They make a bunch of soaps and stuff that literally takes away your \u201cperson smell\u201d and makes you smell like absolutely nothing so the animals can\u2019t detect you sitting there. Some people even rub dirt on themselves to be better hidden and smell more like the outdoors \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n  \n  When you see the animal you want to choose and they come close enough, you take your shot and you hunt them. No scaring, no chasing, no cruelty, and no pain. I\u2019d say it\u2019s even less stressful for them than if they were naturally predated on by a pack of wolves, coyotes, or a mountain lion where they would def be chased and scared and probably eaten half alive and held down and ripped apart.\n  \n  Hunting with dogs is where the cruelty comes in for me. Thats a whooole dif issue haha don\u2019t even get me started. That\u2019s fucked up for real but a lot of people seem to agree that it\u2019s not good. Dog hunting is 100% ILLEGAL to do for that reason in a whopping 42 out of the 50 states.  Even in the states where it isss legal you can apparently onlyy do it in certain areas and at certain specific times \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n  \n  Also- your point about rangers doing it: that would be the exact same scenario as normal people hunting and would be accomplished using the exact same tactics of sitting still, being quiet, and respecting the wildlife. Not quite sure what the difference would be except that it would be WAY harder to control the population since there are fewer rangers than hunters, more animals would die slowly of chronic wasting disease, & more of the environment would be degraded due to overpopulation\n  ","222808":"\n  Show genuine interest in her life and hobbies, try them with her!

It\u2019s because of hunting that we can maintain healthy wildlife populations and raise money for conservation. States are required to monitor wildlife populations and set limits for each person, each season, for the amount of animals they\u2019re allowed to remove from the population. The total number of animals allowed to be taken is always based on the current population of that animal in the area that you\u2019re registering to hunt in. The money the state receives from hunting tags helps fund research and conservation efforts for those animals so we can better understand how to help them. That money serves as the funding to pay scientists to actually go out in the field and do studies and make and implement conservation plans. There are of course cruel people out there who enjoy hunting bc they just like killing things (and tbh that\u2019s super messed up) but most hunters I\u2019ve encountered are outdoorsmen and women who enjoy nature and want to save it for future generations :) it all sounds like a bad thing bc killing things is generally negative but when you zoom out and look at the bigger picture it\u2019s actually super good for the populations and the overall environment. Especially considering humans wiped out all the top predators that would\u2019ve naturally kept game animal populations in check like wolves and cougars in most areas. Without the top preds, herbivore populations grow too big, they eat all the food in their areas and trample everything down, then they slowly starve to death, get sick, and die painful, slow, awful deaths. Being killed by a hunter\u2019s bullet instantly is MUCH better and less painful than the alternative imo\n  ","222811":"\n  \ud83d\udc34 \ud83d\udc95 \ud83e\udd84 \u2728\n  \n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/Wx-NrVEiGfw\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/8RQ_zoeFFY0\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/ztn6h0hoIuU\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","222812":"\n  Unedited\/raw file but still a cute shot of this doe in my neighbors yard from awhile back \ud83e\udd8c \ud83d\udc95\n  ","222813":"\n  Cloudy and going to rain later \ud83c\udf27 \u2614\ufe0f\n  ","222814":"\n  Thanks haha.
