insulin at home once or twice and i had to drive it to his job for him because he was unable to leave work to grab it himself . that s probably one of the most important examples i can think of , lol .","298776":"i try to keep it as organized as possible because it puts me in a better head space when my personal belongings are clean and in their place . sometimes it does get messy , but i usually try to do a small bit of cleaning every day , or at least every few days .","298777":"i m stressed beyond belief in every facet of my life , at the moment . i m just so beyond done with myself and most people around me . this past week has been a week from hell .","298778":"no . if i hated an app , then i wouldn t use it .","298779":"it doesn t phase me , and i don t see it at all based on who i follow on twitter . if someone has a problem with nudity on their timeline , they can simply unfollow that person .","298780":"i would have to wait for the weather to get nicer daytime gets longer before i can run outside . by the time i get home from work , there s really only minutes left before the sun starts setting .","298781":"depends on what the thoughts are , as well as what context they re in whether you re thinking in a positive , negative , or neutral light . sometimes overthinking can be good in a sense because you re attacking a situation from all angles and coming to a logical conclusion . however , overthinking is generally bad when you re degrading yourself or other people and promoting negative thought patterns .","298782":"not constantly , no . however , i am aware in a general sense because of the brushes with death i ve experienced in the past .","298783":"yeah , me and a few other users have been bombarded with questions related to p dophilia over the past few weeks , it s been absolutely horrid and ridiculous .","298784":"as always , it was regarding p dophilia .","298785":"i don t block anyone on askfm , actually . it s a waste of time because the blocking system is worthless , and if someone is bothering me , then i simply delete their messages .","298786":"not so much lately , no . i ve been communicating my feelings so that they re not constantly in my head , and it s better for my mental health when i express my feelings either verbally or in writing .","298787":"no , it s basically one of my worst fears . standing in front of a crowd and doing anything makes me terribly anxious .","298788":"when i was in high school , i was quiet and kept to myself mostly . i was an academic student , and i spent my free time doing art and listening to music . however , i was also extremely troubled as a high school student and was dealing with a lot of personal difficulties regarding mental illness . i only had a small circle of friends , and i only really ever saw them at school .","298789":"in a way , yes however , similar to my last answer , i believe we should respect people until they give us a reason not to respect them anymore . this goes for elders too . i don t believe that we should respect our elders simply because they re older than us , though . respect goes much deeper than that .","298790":"i believe in respecting people first and foremost until they give you a reason not to respect them anymore .","298791":"no , i never have before .","298792":"emotional stability . i m a fuckin mess .","298793":"askfm , facebook , and twitter .","298794":"i try to keep my room as clean as possible because it helps a lot with my depression anxiety a clean space leads to clear thoughts , and i personally feel a lot better mentally when my living areas are organized .","298795":"neither i believe i m a realist , more than anything . i m not percent positive , but i m also not completely negative either . i try to look at situations from a realistic point of view weigh out all of the options that could possibly happen so that i don t get blindsided .","298796":"idk if it s a trend anymore or not , but i ve always liked the look of slightly ripped jeans , lol . a few of my jeans have tears in them , and i prefer that look over regular jeans sometimes . i usually cuff the ankles and wear ankle boots .","298797":"thanks for the follow . i don t follow people upon request though , sorry .","298798":"i ve experienced sleep paralysis on a few occasions , and it was honestly terrifying . i was sorta awake , but i couldn t move my body and i felt trapped . this was before i knew what sleep paralysis was , so i thought something was wrong with me . my boyfriend experiences night terrors on an almost nightly basis .","298799":"i know that i have dreams , but i seldom remember my dreams . sometimes i ll remember them as soon as i wake up , but the memory disappears within minutes or so . it also depends on how deep of a sleep i m in and when i wake up during my sleep cycle . from what i remember , most of my dreams are rather surreal , but in the sense that they make sense while you re dreaming , but when you wake up they re absolutely ridiculous , lol .","298800":"i always thought that the whole lizard people conspiracy theory was bizarre af , lmao . it makes absolutely no sense to me and it s difficult for me to believe that some people actually endorse that theory .","298801":"it depends entirely on who the person is my relationship to them , what they did to break or question my trust , and how many times they perhaps have done the same thing in the past . i can t really give an absolute answer to this question because it s circumstantial .","298802":"intimacy is important to me , but i don t put a lot of emphasis on it at the same time . i like physical affection , i . e . holding hands , kissing , etc etc . , and i think i would feel neglected if my partner wasn t physically affectionate at all . i also need verbal confirmations of love and affection as well .","298803":"i watched the grudge when i was probably far too young to really see the movie , and it actually haunted me for months . i had nightmares of the horror character for weeks on end , and it was absolutely terrible .","298804":"the best thing for me to do to alleviate a bad mood is to talk about my feelings with someone else and come to a general understanding of why i feel that way and decide on what to do in order to feel better . communication fosters healing , so i usually try to seek out private conversation with a close friend or my boyfriend when i m not feeling so great mentally .","298805":"back when i was a pre teen and didn t know much better , i really enjoyed listening to eminem s music . however , as time progressed , i realized how truly terrible his lyrics were and how he was basically a misogynistic assh le . i haven t heard anything from him in a really long time , unless it s happening without my knowledge . regardless , i have no interest in his music anymore .","298806":"i ve never gambled before in my life i ve never even played lotto , lol . i never really saw the point in it because it seems like a waste of money imo .","298807":"well you asked this yesterday , lol . my morning yesterday was absolutely terrible but this morning was rather good . i got to work early so that i could check my email and get my assignments in order before work actually started , and i was able to catch up on what i missed rather easily , so it was a pretty easy going day . i m currently relaxing at home , and when my boyfriend wakes up from a nap , i ll be heading over to his house since i haven t seen him since last week .","298808":"i haven t watched the recent documentaries on michael jackson , but i wholeheartedly believe that his actions were wrong based on what i do know . the fact that he had children over for sleepovers and had them change in front of him , etc etc . , is predatory behavior and makes me extremely uncomfortable .","298809":"i don t wear sportswear brands , lol .","298810":"the most irritating thing to me personally is when someone hovers and watches me while i work it really gets under my skin and i feel like they re just waiting for me to make a mistake , or they re otherwise judging me . it s too much pressure and i would rather be left alone to get my work done correctly .","298811":"i m strongly pro choice and lgbtq rights . i m also an advocate for mental health awareness and frequently talk about stigma and related disorders on my other social media accounts .","298812":"i only got interested in music when i was a pre teen , and at that point in time , my favorite musicians were linkin park , evanescence , eminem , avril lavigne , sum , green day , etc etc . then i started getting more into older alternative rock music , and i began listening to stone temple pilots , alice in chains , pearl jam , audioslave , soundgarden , and others . my taste today is basically the same , but a lot more diverse . i listen to the same alternative rock music from the s and early s , but i also like newer rock music , such as grandson . i also like poppier musicians , i . e . matt maeson and hozier . at the same time , i m also really into hip hop watsky and grieves , for example . when i m writing , i additionally listen to classical soundtracks for video games .","298813":"i believe the best cinema experience i ve ever had was when i went to the midnight premiere of one of the harry potter movies back when i was a teenager ! ! everyone was there in cosplay , and the audience was so engaged when the actual movie was on . it was an experience in itself .","298814":"i don t go out to eat very often , so i don t really have a favorite place . although there s a local sushi restaurant that s really good . i haven t been there in about a year , though .","298815":"i enjoy watching ice hockey on occasion , but i wouldn t say i love it .","298816":"i don t even own a bikini , haha .","298817":"if you didn t care , then you wouldn t have bothered sending this message . lmao .","298818":"i got my license when i was years old , and my first car was a volkswagen cabrio .","298819":"it s only about minutes away , but it s a pain in the ass to get to .","298820":"thank you","298821":"most recent selfie .","298822":"i use gmail and outlook .","298823":"no , it wasn t because of my job i actually didn t go to work today because of something that happened in my life , so that s why i ve been stressed . although going back to work tomorrow probably won t help since i ve been stressed at work too , lol .","298824":"i d rather not explain it on askfm , it has a few personal details regarding my life that i don t talk about on here .","298825":"i just woke up out of a sound sleep because of a nightmare , and now i can t fall back asleep . today has been stressful enough as it is , i just want to be at peace for a while .","298826":"coffee , lol .","298827":"i never felt compelled to watch shows like the walking dead or grey s anatomy , even though everyone i know loves them . i also was never able to get into the office .","298828":"i don t do yoga , but i ve thought about saving up my money to buy a cheap treadmill that i can use at home . that way , i don t have to deal with driving to the gym and possibly interacting with strangers . however , for now , going to the gym is the better option . it makes me feel better having someone else there with me too .","298829":"i haven t been to the gym in quite a few months , but i m planning on going back this week . my friend and i realized we have the same gym membership so we re going to start attending together .","298830":"people compliment my hair the most , lately . when i first got it done back in december , i had random people in the office building coming up and telling me it looked great , lol .","298831":"there really isn t a definitive means of magically becoming more mature . it happens through time and experience .","298832":"i m sorry that you re going through a rough patch . things haven t been so great for me either lately tbh . when i feel like giving up , i think about my support system and how grateful i am to have a small group of people who genuinely care about me . i think about the successes i ve witnessed within myself already , and i remind myself that i ve been through a lot of difficult times already and have nevertheless survived .","298833":"no , giving someone the silent treatment is pretty immature . relationships , whether platonic or romantic , need open communication and ignoring a person when you re upset with them is only going to make matters worse , not better .","298834":"i m looking forward to seeing my boyfriend , either tonight or later on this week . i haven t seen him in about a week or so , and i miss him .","298835":"recovering from self harm , and graduating from college .","298836":"not really . i usually go to bed between pm and am , though .","298837":"a handful i can t really put a number to it or anything . but i have a few people from askfm added to other social media , and i talk to some of them occasionally .","298838":"no ? ? i said it would make me vomit , lmao . that has nothing to do with thinking you re better or worse than someone else .","298839":"go easy by matt maeson https youtu . be nauxmcsdmji","298840":"this is one of the first ones , i think . i m not entirely sure because the order my pictures are in got screwed up a while ago . but this is my old baby . he died about a year or so ago , i ve had two fish since him who also both recently passed . however , i had him for almost two years which is pretty good for a betta fish .","298841":"probably some sort of janitor service , like cleaning public bathrooms and stuff . i would vomit everywhere because people are absolutely disgusting when it comes to public bathrooms .","298842":"the corpse bride sweeney todd are my top two favorites .","298843":"i haven t , actually . i only recently found out that there was a musical , lol . perhaps i ll watch it soon .","298844":"on sunday , i finished up some freelance writing assignments for my job , moved some furniture around , cleaned and organized my room , helped cook dinner , and went to bed rather early .","298845":"i write extremely well . all of my writing jobs have resulted in me being trusted with high levels of responsibility due to the fact that my writing is concise and flows well .","298846":"my eyes are a greenish hazel .","298847":"i don t eat candy , so no .","298848":"i just got home from work and running errands , so i m currently sitting in my backyard and smoking a cigarette .","298849":"i ve been in a relationship for almost years now .","298850":"i last watched heathers on netflix . it s one of those movies that i can watch over over again , and it never gets old .","298851":"chloe price from life is strange ! !","298852":"lately i haven t been working out .","298853":"this has nothing to do with debates , rofl . hypothetically speaking , i wouldn t enjoy having diabetes . although i would have a lot of support and teaching from my boyfriend , who s a type diabetic .","298854":"no , i have no desire to download tik tok .","298855":"i m watching the truman show . i love this movie .","298856":"obviously they re misguided people .","298857":"my boyfriend told me he s going to start watching game of thrones , yes i m so excited .","298858":"probably the fact that i enjoy drinking and smoking weed , lol . i present myself as a straightforward , reserved person irl so it surprised my coworkers when i told them my vices .","298859":"i was proud of myself for getting through last week without calling out of work or leaving early , especially considering how overwhelmed i was with learning new tasks in a short period of time . sometimes my anxiety gets the best of me and i panic , which causes me to not be able to focus on anything at all . however , despite being overwhelmed , i was able to control my anxiety for the most part and get through the day .","298860":"i have to be in the mood for them . i also don t care so much about other people s opinions , if someone disagrees with me on something then i usually just accept it and move on .","298861":"i really want an axolotl , but i know nothing about caring for them and i also have no clue where to even find one , rofl .","298862":"i don t really put any effort into labeling my opinions these days .","298863":"that s one step to lessening your imprint . not buying certain products and opting for better alternatives , such as vegan and cruelty free products .","298864":"i don t generally hate mondays . i m just not looking forward to tomorrow .","298865":"it depends on the situation . because in that case , then most people would be seen as selfish since a lot of the things people do and buy negatively impact animals and the environment . but if you re taking the right steps to lessen your imprint , then that s not selfish at all .","298866":"not really . i haven t been feeling the greatest mentally , and i m worried that my job might overwhelm me this week .","298867":"pretty much everything , lol . i m not a very confident person .","298868":"it could in some cases . certainly not all cases , though .","298869":"someone who acts according to their own desires without any regard to how it may affect other people .","298870":"it s a natural human emotion to feel sad when someone dies . you can try to rationalize it all you want , but that doesn t erase the impact it has on people .","298871":"death brings about a whole host of emotions , and grieving is incredibly complicated . i m sad for the person who passed who might not experience their children growing up , and i also feel sad for the family who have to handle the aftermath of losing someone close to them .","298872":"linkin park , stone temple pilots , korn , alice in chains , chris cornell , florence and the machine , muse , ajr , bastille , death cab for cutie , mindless self indulgence , and macklemore , among others .","298873":"i m fairly certain you re not the same age as me . i m years old , and adults are more than capable of being in love .","298874":"i enjoyed my literature classes in college , as well as criminology , anthropology , and sociology . i ve always disliked the math classes i ve taken , especially calculus . statistics wasn t terrible , though .","298875":"i m not scottish , so i ve never had it before .","298876":"you re clearly lost . this is askfm , a site to answer questions . if you don t have a question , you can kindly leave .","298877":"pretty much anything that has to do with driving people not using blinkers , cutting other people off , stopping completely at yellow lights , driving under the speed limit in the left lane , etc etc . otherwise , i also can t stand when people eat with their mouth open or make noises while they eat . i don t like when people try to talk over me either .","298878":"i don t know much about my own personality considering it changes on a regular basis depending on who i m around .","298879":"it depends on how busy i am that day . i m normally on off on the weekends since i have free time , but i don t check askfm during the week until night time since i work throughout the day .","298880":"my first job was a cashier at a drug store . i don t remember what i did with my first paycheck , though . it probably went to my car payment or something related to college , since i was a sophomore in college at that time .","298881":"uh , no . i would rather not encourage the foot fetishists who frequent my page .","298882":"laundry . granted , it isn t something that s dire at the moment , but i wanted to at least do one load today just to lessen the amount of clothes in my hamper . i just didn t have the energy today .","298883":"my passion for the things i m interested in , as well as my loyalty and dedication to my friends boyfriend .","298884":"i m in the middle of my career progressing at the moment , and it mainly has to do with more responsibilities being given to me in terms of administration and interacting with clients .","298885":"mental health , life vs death , addiction , and my own personal experiences . most of my work is non fiction , but i also have an idea for a fictional novel too .","298886":"i don t remember when i first became interested in writing , considering i don t remember my childhood . i ve been writing since at least the age of , though .","298887":"i don t go to juice bars , so i really have no idea .","298888":"i m not close to many people , so if one of my friends hurt me without really knowing that they did , i would let them know that their words actions were hurtful in a polite way and advise them not to do it again . it s kinda difficult to really determine whether something was done accidentally or on purpose , though . i have a small circle so i ve never had any issues with my current friends , so i would hope that they wouldn t turn around and purposely hurt me .","298889":"i usually have a large iced coffee in the morning , and then two cups of hot coffee when i get home from work .","298890":"i m not in high school , so i haven t used stereotypical adjectives like that in ten years .","298891":"i have a sense of humor , so i suppose so . lol .","298892":"everyone is judgmental to a certain degree , i believe . i try to remain unbiased until i know a person , though . it s difficult to break out of that habit of judging someone without knowing them , since we all do it from a young age , but it becomes easier after you recognize that everyone has different experiences and you cannot know a person solely from looking at them .","298893":"you don t even know what i look like . lmao .","298894":"i ve never been in this position before . however , i m happy you went through with the divorce you need to do what best serves you , and the fact that you know you deserve better and broke things off with him is a step in the right direction . it doesn t matter what other people think . you have to do what s best for yourself .","298895":"my favorite smoothies are peach banana . my favorite milkshake is oreo .","298896":"having that first cup of coffee in the morning . it totally rejuvenates me .","298897":"wolves are my favorite animals ! !","298898":"watching netflix or hulu , listening to music , or enjoying the quiet . i value my alone time , it s how i recharge at the end of the day .","298899":"i see my neighbor s house , haha . nothing that s worthy of a picture .","298900":"i finished up my freelance work and ran some errands this morning , and i just finished up moving some furniture into the garage . i m also looking on amazon for some new spring clothes since right now i have mostly sweaters .","298901":"i have no interest in entertaining this fetish . this isn t the first time you asked me this question .","298902":"no , it doesn t particularly matter to me .","298903":"hello ! ! my inbox is empty i would appreciate questions .","298904":"the halo soundtrack is one of the best video game soundtracks of all time . don t me .","298905":"it happens every now and again . my existence goes against their world perspective , and even though my gender does not have any effect on their life , they feel the need to rebel against it at every opportunity , likely due to their own insecurities in some way .","298906":"uh , i offered you scientific evidence . if you can t accept those facts , then there isn t much more i can help you with .","298907":"there is science behind it . through studies of various cultures around the world , there is evidence that more than just two genders have existed throughout the ages . one example that i can think of is native american culture , although many more examples do exist . you can easily do research on this topic .","298908":"i m non binary . attending a women s rights march doesn t have any correlation with my gender , lol .","298909":"i think western feminism , particularly this new wave of feminism that has emerged over the past few years , focuses on insignificant issues that doesn t implement real change in regards to women s rights . in addition , western feminism focuses solely on the issues that mainly affect white women instead of broadening their advocacy for other people of color , especially in war torn and developing nations . i m all for traditional feminism , and i respect the original individuals who advocated for feminism back in the s and s . but western feminism these days has largely been a joke and gives feminism overall a bad name .","298910":"i planned on going to the women s protest march in new york city a few years ago , but something happened in my life that prevented me from going at the last minute . my best friend ended up going with her cousin without me , and she said it was an amazing experience .","298911":"i honestly had no idea this was even a thing until you sent me this question , lol . either way , i think it s silly . legislators should be focusing more on other means of reform regarding taxes , education , the prison system , etc etc . , instead of worrying about people who wear saggy pants . the whole saggy pants trend originated in the prison system , where people would wear their pants low since belts were confiscated in the institution . since then , it s been associated with hip hop culture , although i m not really sure where the transition occurred . i don t personally see the point in wearing pants that sag if you obviously own a belt , but to each their own .","298912":"i would like to visit australia , new zealand , the uk , spain , and the caribbean .","298913":"i don t really believe most of my fears are unwarranted or misunderstood , lol . however , i am completely afraid of driving , and it s a fear i unfortunately have to face every day . even though i drive to and from work every day , it hasn t made my fear any less or made me more comfortable driving . some people don t really understand it because they re natural drivers , but there are also a lot of people i ve met who feel the same way as me .","298914":"i believe most things fall under this category especially in terms of vices , i . e . drinking , drugs , gambling , etc etc . most things are fine to do in moderation , but when you feel compelled to do them every day , then that s an indication of a problem .","298915":"yes , i do find it difficult to open up to people . i don t trust anyone from meeting them for the first time , and it usually takes a while for me to warm up to a person until i believe i can trust them if i can at all . however , once i feel comfortable around that person , i m basically an open book .","298916":"i probably use askfm and instagram the most . my askfm page is rather active so i try to remain on top of my questions so that they don t pile up . as for instagram , i like seeing what s going on in my friends lives and i also enjoy updating my stories .","298917":"definitely not enough water , that s for certain . although lately i ve been getting into the habit of drinking flavored seltzer water , which has increased my water intake a lot ! !","298918":"uh , vine doesn t exist anymore . lmao .","298919":"my birthday is november th .","298920":"i would have a relapse in symptoms , i . e . severe depressive episodes , panic attacks , irrational and frequent mood swings , paranoia , dissociation , etc etc . i would most definitely be svicidal most of the time and generally a danger to myself .","298921":"i m most proud of seeking treatment for my mental health during a time when it was detrimental to my well being . i m also proud of going through and graduating from college despite my mental illnesses .","298922":"there aren t really any questions that i routinely ask myself every day . however , a lot of the time , i find myself questioning what s the point and why bother , especially with respect to certain things in my routine .","298923":"i ve seen marvel films in the past , but i don t actively go out and watch them because they re marvel films .","298924":"i take anti anxiety medication , which quells my anxiety for the most part . otherwise , i practice breathing exercises when i feel my anxiety is acting up .","298925":"depends on the values of the people you surround yourself with . i don t really think there s much focus on a person s social status these days compared to part decades , though .","298926":"neither . i don t eat chocolate or candy .","298927":"that s economic status , not social status . lol . but realistically speaking , i probably am .","298928":"i don t care about my social status , so nothing .","298929":"i don t care enough about a stranger s opinion to change the way i answer questions . if you don t like the way i conduct myself , you re free to unfollow me .","298930":"an easy solution to this problem is to unfollow me .","298931":"reverse racism is the idea that people who are white are oppressed due to their race , which isn t accurate . white people have been the oppressors for all of history , so while some white people can face discrimination , it doesn t mean they ve been oppressed .","298932":"i think it s important to recognize that black lives do matter because black people have been the subject of severe discrimination and oppression for centuries , which even pervades to this day . i haven t heard anything regarding the blm movement in a while , but it s still important to remember the history behind black americans and how they ve been subjected to racism for centuries .","298933":"it doesn t actually exist , lol .","298934":"clearly it s terrible and causes a whole host of problems in men . it leads to men having poor body image , suppressing their emotions , and having unhealthy relationships with sxx , among other issues .","298935":"i don t go to clubs . i don t dance , and most clubs are horrendously loud and crowded .","298936":"you can wish all you want , it clearly isn t going to happen .","298937":"hello i m doing fine . just got back from the gas station with beer and cigarettes , so i m spending my night relaxing .","298938":"it isn t sunday where i live . it s currently pm on saturday night in new york .","298939":"some of the more active accounts i follow are urlsareshittbh shehitsback littlesha courrtana kittiemeowsie","298940":"i think it s childish when people instigate drama just for the sake of starting drama especially when anons do it here on askfm . i generally stay out of drama , though .","298941":"no , at least not when it comes to other people s lives , lol . i have a tendency to act irrationally and overreact when it comes to my own life , though .","298942":"debating on picking up a pack of beer from the gas station tonight . other than that , i m just watching television .","298943":"i think you meant conventionally . even so , just because a person meets the typical standards of beauty doesn t guarantee that they ll be attractive to everyone .","298944":"lol , it s okay i knew what you meant ! !","298945":"if you mean through my job , then press releases don t get published with the writers names on them . however , my name isn t legally leigh , so all of my official documents still have my birth name .","298946":"nah , i don t think so . everyone has different tastes so it would be impossible for one person to be attractive to everyone .","298947":"i don t really know what it is you re asking . i don t distribute the releases , i just write them .","298948":"i write press releases for my company as an independent contractor on the weekends . it s different from the usual work that i do throughout the week .","298949":"it s been fine . i fell asleep super early last night and got up early this morning , and then i worked on some freelance assignments and picked up some breakfast . later on , i took a nap and i ve basically been doing some light cleaning and watching television since then .","298950":"hey friends , my inbox is empty so y all should ask me questions ! ! i ll answer anything , as long as it s an actual question it s appropriate .","298951":"yeah , his mood definitely affects my mood . when he s happy , i m also happy . however , the downside is that when he s upset then i feel helpless since i can t lift his mood . he normally needs time to himself when he s upset .","298952":"i have no interest in doing those activities .","298953":"probably when my boyfriend and i took a mini weekend vacation around my birthday back in november ! ! i left work early we drove out east and stopped at a cute little brewery after we dropped our stuff off at the hotel . it was within walking distance from the hotel , so we spent a few hours there and then went back to nap for a few hours . that night , we listened to live music at the poolside bar . then the next day , we visited a huge aquarium for a wine and beer tasting night , which was super fun it s the second year we did this . there was also live music there , so we sat down and drank and listened to music while also looking at the fish . we ended up buying an entire bottle of moonshine that night , lmao .","298954":"i don t know why you would send this question out if you were so convinced they were lying to you . sorry that shehitsback and i didn t give you the validation you needed , but if you truly want to know the answers to your questions , you would ask this individual themselves .","298955":"driving makes me the most nervous . you simply never know when you re going to get into an accident or have car troubles , and you don t know how other people are feeling on the road . you could easily get involved in an issue with another driver if they re feeling road rage .","298956":"it doesn t mean they lied , lol . if you re so concerned , then you should talk to them about this .","298957":"there are asmr videos on youtube .","298958":"i don t think that someone would lie about something like that and then proceed to ignore you . i think what happened in this circumstance means that they likely felt embarrassed by telling you their feelings and are avoiding you because they don t want to embarrass themselves further .","298959":"no , they re videos that trigger an autonomous sensory meridian response asmr . sounds and images that trigger such a response gives you a tingling sensation that starts with your head and travels downward , and it s supposed to relax you .","298960":"i don t know if we can if we re past the point of no return or not . regardless , we need to recycle more , use energy efficient light bulbs , use less air conditioning and heat , and drive less often or carpool more .","298961":"i answered a similar question this morning . i m not really a risk taker but i am impulsive .","298962":"i don t gossip or involve myself in other people s business , so no .","298963":"no , they actually irritate me .","298964":"lately i ve been hyperfixated on true crime documentaries , lol . i watch them every night .","298965":"it s been fine . i did some freelance work this morning , went out and picked up breakfast and cigarettes , and took a nap .","298966":"it doesn t show the stages of sleep , at least my fitbit doesn t . it just shows awake , restless , and asleep stages .","298967":"pretty much all of the lyrics off of linkin park s hybrid theory ep album .","298968":"i don t believe you can ever completely know someone to their entirely . you can understand everyone to a certain degree , but you re not in their head and you re only tuned in to what they want to reveal about themselves .","298969":"i m not sure if i want to have children or not . it s something i m constantly going back and forth with , which is probably an indication that i shouldn t have children . i don t believe the world is overpopulated , and people in general are free to have as many children as they would like granted , of course , they provide their children with a loving and healthy environment . i also believe in the importance of adopting and fostering children because there are so many kids , especially teenagers , who are in the system and they also deserve loving homes .","298970":"i was an academic student when i was younger , so i learned best through lectures , including physical representations of subjects such as powerpoint presentations . i learned best through both listening , reading , and writing , and i often copied over my own notes multiple times to better understand the material .","298971":"i think the increase in the use of technology among children is detrimental to their development , and i m not entirely sure but i also think there are studies conducted on this topic too which reached the same conclusion don t quote me on that , though . i think limiting screen time is important because it teaches children from a young age to become dependent on technology , instead of doing things that encourage personal growth such as reading , playing outside , and practicing hobbies and sports .","298972":"i believe that society in general is just more cognizant of mental health problems in general thanks to the decrease in stigma , as well as increase in mental health professionals and scientific studies pertaining to mental illnesses . in the past , people who exhibited mental illness symptoms were deemed crazy and were locked away at an institution , while today there are more options for treatment and a general understanding . a lot of the people i know irl have some degree of mental illness due to how prevalent it is . not everyone , of course , but i would say most of the people i interact with have had experienced mental illness either first hand or through someone they also know .","298973":"i think taxidermy is incredibly interesting ! ! as long as the animals died naturally and did not die for the sake of being hung in someone s house , at least . i don t know if i would hang them in my own house , but i definitely appreciate the skill it takes in preserving the animals and their general aesthetic .","298974":"i m very good at keeping secrets i don t spread around other people s business and i don t gossip , so generally secrets are safe with me . i know the importance of having someone you can trust and i want to ensure to my friends that they can trust me to keep their problems to myself .","298975":"i would much rather be able to detect any lie i hear , just so that i know whether or not someone is bullsh tting me . it would make life far easier , i believe , because then i would know who to keep around and who to stay away from .","298976":"i googled least stressful jobs in response to this question there were many jobs that came up that didn t seem least stressful at all , lol . one of them that i thought was amusing was pharmacy technician , which is a total lie because that job is actually very stressful depending on where you re working ! ! personally speaking , i would think something like a data entry clerk would be least stressful because you re not interacting with anyone else and the work seems rather mindless .","298977":"i think it s a combination of both , haha . on the one hand , i wonder if they re okay and whether or not they re sick then i wonder how they re actually feeling . on the other hand , i don t want to get sick myself , so i end up keeping my distance .","298978":"i don t generally go to the movie theater , so there aren t any movies that i want to see . if there are , then i usually wait for them to come out on dvd or on some sort of streaming service netflix , hulu , amazon prime , etc .","298979":"i would spend the beginning of the time relaxing because it would be a nice change from the chaos of every day life , lol . but eventually i would have to hunt for food , build shelter , and eventually find a way off the island .","298980":"no , i don t believe that at all . i think we sometimes think it happens because we have an unconscious idea of what the future might entail , and it plays out in our dreams . but i don t believe that our dreams predict the future like some sort of cosmic thing .","298981":"i know i mentioned it on here once before , but i m so sick of my psychiatrist not responding to me in a timely manner , and ultimately , making me skip days of my medication because she doesn t refill my prescriptions on time . last month , my anxiety medication was on back order the pharmacy needed her permission to switch me to a different number of mgs , and i called my psychiatrist at least times within days before she put the authorization through . in that span of time , i ran out of medication and had a panic attack at work . after that got sorted out , here i am one month later and i need another refill on the same prescription . even though i only see my psychiatrist every days , she only authorized a day refill . last week , i called the pharmacy to refill the prescription , and the next day , i received a call that my psychiatrist did not authorize the refill . i called her office three times twice it went straight to voicemail , and the third time i spoke to someone , but not my psychiatrist . i explained to them that i needed a refill asap , but so far i haven t received any notification from my pharmacy . that was yesterday afternoon . if this script doesn t get refilled by tomorrow , i m going to run out of medication again and deal with everything all over like i did last month . i m so done with this doctor . after this gets sorted out , i m calling the office and changing providers because this is ridiculous .","298982":"it depends on the individual . obviously we should be mourning the loss of the person who passed away , but there will always be some people who act selfishly and are actually mourning their own personal loss as opposed to mourning the loss of another life .","298983":"necessary medication , i . e . insulin . it s absolutely ridiculous how much money my boyfriend pays for his insulin every month when it s a medication that not only does he need , but he would also die without it .","298984":"my favorite decade for music is probably s alternative rock . bands like stone temple pilots , pearl jam , tool , soundgarden , nine inch nails , etc etc . stp was my all time favorite band for an extremely long time , so naturally i was mortified when scott weiland passed away as well as chris cornell from soundgarden , rip . however , my taste in music is so vast that it s difficult to really narrow down my favorite songs or musicians throughout the past century . i listen to alternative rock , classic rock , metal , hip hop , r b , blues , jazz , pop , classical music , etc etc . while linkin park and stp are probably two of my all time favorite bands , it has more to do with the memories associated with them than anything else . their music has never defined my musical taste , if that makes sense .","298985":"i m not much of a risk taker at all , but i am rather impulsive . i don t gamble or act on dares per say , but i do act spontaneously according to my mood at that very moment , which sometimes leads me to weird or destructive situations .","298986":"i ve only ever had two best friends , which includes my current best friend as well as my boyfriend . before i met them , there were other people in my life with whom i was close , but i don t really think i considered them to be my best friend . however , my favorite memories with them both have included going to concerts with them and going on vacations with them . my best friend and i used to see concerts when we were teenagers , and we saw linkin park together like times . in addition , her wedding back in was absolutely beautiful , and everyone had an amazing time .","298987":"neither . i don t believe i m a very fun person to be around , and i m definitely not immature , haha .","298988":"yeah , when i was a teenager i tried learning how to play the guitar and the keyboard . i was dedicated to trying to learn those new skills for a long time , but it just never stuck with me . i haven t played either instrument in probably years .","298989":"it depends on the reason why he s ill is he mentally unwell , or does he have some sort of physical affliction that can be treated ? ? i would treat him according to what his symptoms are , so i would probably go to the drug store and purchase otc medication . and if his illnesses were more severe , then we would see his doctor and get prescription medication as well .","298990":"neither . i don t really keep up to date with the news much anymore because it was always mentally exhausting for me to try to remain current with what s going on in the world . however , just because i don t pay much attention anymore doesn t mean that i think it s fake news either .","298991":"thankfully , i haven t had a nightmare in a very long time ! ! although i don t remember my dreams , so at least i don t recall having a nightmare , lol . i think there are a lot of people who do remember most of their dreams , but i just happen to be in the fraction of people who don t remember nearly any of them .","298992":"i listen to the radio every time i m driving to and from work , so perhaps around . hours per day . there s a local alternative rock radio station that just started up about a year ago that has some really great music , so i ve been listening to that .","298993":"probably my laptop tbh . it has a lot of photos and documents on it , and i would be devastated if i lost everything .","298994":"technically , i spend a significant amount of time on the internet because my job requires me to use the internet for researching different things . however , i m only on social media for a limited amount of time per day when i m not working . i don t usually check my social media throughout the day , only when i m home at the end of the day .","298995":"i didn t have breakfast yet today , but i m probably going to make some scrambled eggs and toast later . i usually drink cups of coffee first before eating in the morning .","298996":"considering i m part of the lgbt community , i don t think there s anything wrong with them obviously

the very first time whenever i see them . i don t recognize the person in those pictures , and i have no memory of anything regarding my childhood . it might as well be someone else completely .","299004":"i m not a food critic , and i don t know anyone who is pretty critical towards food either . i don t care enough about food to have strong opinions about it .","299005":"yes , i feel most at peace when i m in nature whether that s in the woods or by the beach or even somewhere like an open field . i like some nature photographs , but i prefer to do the photography myself . this is one of my favorite photos i took with a mm film camera a few years ago ! ! i should try to find that camera again , it made me fall in love with photography all over again .","299006":"i don t follow any specific trends , and in a general sense , i m pretty clueless when it comes to knowing what s trending or not . things change every day , and it s exhausting to try to keep up to date with everything

desire to see aquaman .","299011":"i don t remember much about my childhood , so i really don t know who my heroes were .","299012":"i ll only drink water if i m walking , whether that s outside or at the gym .","299013":"yeah , i got straight as in high school , and mostly as when i was in college with the exception of a few classes .","299014":"i m having a cigarette outside because i just got

increase the effects of the antidepressant . alongside my mood stabilizer and anti anxiety meds , everything has been working great .","299017":"to be fair , it is a good drunk singalong song . i went

passionate about the subject or patient with their students , then it s going to be more difficult for the students to learn and comprehend the material . and yeah , that goes for most other subjects

sugarcoated the truth , they didn t spread our conversations to other people , they stuck by their word , etc etc . i have a difficult time trusting people as it is , and it does take me a while to warm up to people enough for me to be able to say i trust them and confide in them with my secrets , past , health , etc . i have a small circle and i m perfectly happy with that .","299102":"cont . . . i think one of the reasons i m like that is my appearance , i know it sounds stupid and you can t even imagine how embarrassed i m to admit that , i m average looking not ugly nor beautiful just . . plain . and i think i m not supposed to look like the way i look despite beauty or ugliness , when i see myself in the mirror it s like i don t know who that is i don t relate to that person , i doubt if that is body dysmorphia cuz i know i m normal there s nothing wrong with me physically . another reason is that i stress too much about what people think of me i care too much about their opinions and image of me , so you probably know that i hate socializing even if i did socialize i d get anxious because i d think to myself that i m below them and not as good . and this resulted in so much bad stuff , i don t have any friends or a social circle cuz i drive people away from me cuz i don t even like myself , i have no idea what i wanna be or who i am or how to act cuz im lost and u don t feel like a whole person . i don t know how long this going to last i looked up how to get over identity crisis and came with nothing . . . i also have ocd i either do things perfectly or don t do them at all , i guess this is why i m like that , i wanna be perfect from all aspects or be nothing . i m gonna go crazy from overthinking , and going to a shrink is not an option unfortunately . . even if i could i wouldn t go cuz i don t want the shrink to judge . . i m actually sweating i don t want you to judge me either . i don t know if this is one of the reasons but i grew up in a dysfunctional family and i don t feel stable at all i just don t seem to act like a person . . . please do ignore all of this if you want to , i know my problems aren t real problems . i m sorry you re feeling this way , and your problems are real problems in your own life , and that makes them just as valid as anyone else s problems . not knowing your own identity when you re a young adult is extremely common , and you re not alone in the way you feel . transitioning from a teenager to an adult is difficult , but as time goes on , you ll experience more things and get a better feel for who you are and your relation to the rest of the world . your home life could have an effect on the way you re feeling , but i don t know you or your life , so obviously i can t say for certain . either way , what you re feeling is common and normal , and sometimes it s best to take things one step at a time instead of looking at the larger picture . and if you re unhappy with your appearance , perhaps try changing things up a bit a haircut or hair color change , different wardrobe , etc etc . if you need anything , my inbox is always open , friend .","299103":"i m not really aware of what

entirely sure . i don t get bothered by much , and the things that do bother me aren t unusual or not shared by plenty of other people . i think what bothers me the most , though , is blatant

, lol . but those are reserved for adults , so that s perfectly fine . everyone knows what the human body looks like . i think it s different when children are involved because you don t want

!","299134":"like a q a app ? ? there s also tellonym and curiouscat .","299135":"i don t think it s vital , but i think it can be important to some relationships . i was friends with all of my partners prior to getting into relationships with them , so i really don t know what it feels like to be with someone without having that platonic relationship as a foundation , though . like most other relationship values , it depends entirely on the individual . some people want to be friends beforehand , other people don t really care .","299136":"i post about the same topics on other social media as i do on askfm i don t have any theme oriented blogs or anything , and most of what i post on other apps have to do with either my life or mental health awareness .","299137":"i don t honestly think i would do anything different mainly because that may affect the outcome of other things in my life , and there are a lot of things in my life that i don t want changed .","299138":"personally , it isn t so much where i am as it is who i m with . any vacation with my boyfriend is a great vacation regardless of where we go , whether that s out to wine country or upstate new york or out of state . all of the vacations we ve taken together have been wonderful .","299139":"set my alarm and plug in my phone .","299140":"i like to plan things because it gives me something to look forward to , but most of my plans are spontaneous , lol . if i m seeing a friend , we usually decide a few hours beforehand instead of days beforehand .","299141":"wth . i just went to insta to search for it , but i guess amid all of the backlash , she deleted it . i think that s ridiculous . the whole love thy neighbor in reference to people s race , gender , sexual orientation , etc etc . insinuates that we should love people regardless of things that they cannot choose , something that s inherent to them . to class racism with that that s a terrible notion to put forth , because racism is a choice , not something we cannot help . i also believe that the word cure was used wrongly in this context as well , because that also sorta insinuates that these inherent qualities of people is something akin to an illness . . . or at least that s the image she s portraying . either way , the entire post was in bad taste .","299142":"? ? ? mental illness has no correlation with someone s gender . you trolls are something else tonight , lemme tell ya .","299143":"his tweets are the evidence , lol . i told you verbatim what he said on twitter . regardless , calling out a cis person for pretending to be trans isn t transphobic , nor is it committing acts of violence . lmfao . you re just trolling at this point , but your attempts were cute . i have no interest in discussing this topic anymore .","299144":"no , i never have before . it s located in some neighborhood in amityville , and i never had the desire to go there just to see the house .","299145":"yeah , i enjoy eggs . i sometimes have them for breakfast in the morning .","299146":"face palm it doesn t take a genius to figure out that he was just pretending , especially considering his other perspectives and viewpoints from what i ve read on the internet . he literally said i identified as a woman while lifting the weight . as a result of this statement and corresponding video , he s received tremendous attention and interviews . it s a publicity stunt .","299147":"you re clearly missing the point i was making . he was never trans to begin with he only said he was trans to break the deadlift record , and then said he was cis again immediately thereafter . that isn t transphobic , that s realizing that a cis person pretended to be trans for their own gain .","299148":"i vaguely remember playing the recorder when i was in elementary school , lol . i don t know why it was such a universal thing to teach children if they re still doing it , idk , but i always thought it was amusing how it s an experience nearly everyone has . and no , it has served no purpose in my adult life .","299149":"? ? ? realizing that a cis person isn t trans because they pretended to be trans to surpass a specific goal isn t transphobic .","299150":"my favorite way of wasting time lately has been social media , unfortunately . however , social media also relaxes me at the end of the day it helps me wind down and it s brainless activity , so it allows me to recoup from the mental energy i exerted throughout the day .","299151":"singing , lol . i m absolutely terrible at singing , but it s something i thoroughly enjoy , especially when i m driving . it helps with my anxiety a lot as well .","299152":"for the most part , yes . i have a tendency to suppress my feelings when i know they re not productive to a situation , which usually results in me being completely overwhelmed to the point where one minor thing could set me off . i ve been doing a lot better with not suppressing my emotions over the past few months or so , but it still happens sometimes , especially when i m concerned about someone else at that point , i don t believe my feelings matter much because i m so invested in the feelings of the other person .","299153":"i was nine years old when happened , so i don t remember anything at all . i was probably in school when it happened , though .","299154":"this is going in a very transphobic direction , so i mma have to stop you right there . point blank if you re trans , you don t magically revert back to being cis within an extremely short period of time . he was never trans to begin with , and the fact that he claimed he identified as a woman just to break a silly record is extremely transphobic and an insult to those who are actually trans . as for the whole anti woman thing , he s anti abortion , allegedly believes that people have abortions for convenience , believes women should do most of the childrearing , and is against planned parenthood . that pretty much tells me all i need to know , haha .","299155":"i like moderately spicy food nothing too hot , though . i enjoy mild sauces but they don t do anything else for me , and i normally order medium sauces .","299156":"i would rather never eat meat again . i m not a big fan of meat to begin with , and it would sicken me to only be able to eat meat for the rest of my life .","299157":"minor changes don t really phase me at all , but more significant changes do intimidate me sometimes . my anxiety tends to skyrocket when big changes are about to occur , whether it s happening in my personal or professional life . regardless , i also welcome those changes because i know that we , as humans , cannot grow or evolve by resisting change . change is necessary for growth .","299158":"no , i personally wouldn t reach out to them despite having a dream about them . dreams don t necessarily have deeper meanings to them , and just because they appeared in my dream doesn t mean that they should appear in my life again . friendships end for a reason , most of the time . if the friendship was toxic and it ended for good reason , then i would have no reason to invite them back into my life again .","299159":"i was busy with work until pm , then i drove home for an hour . tonight , i m planning on doing some laundry and cleaning a little bit .","299160":"lol what . i just had to look this up to see if you were actually telling the truth . regardless , it s ridiculous . you can t briefly identify as trans and then revert back to being cis just to prove a point . it s an insult to trans people completely . apparently he s very anti trans and also anti woman , so that doesn t surprise me after hearing this .","299161":"i ve only ever taken melatonin when i used to have trouble staying asleep at night a few years ago .","299162":"i have no idea what any of this means , lmao .","299163":"lmao neither . i just fall asleep eventually .","299164":"my boyfriend is around that height , so yeah .","299165":"i usually notice if they have dimples or not .","299166":"aw , that s exciting ! ! good luck to both of you . i don t really have much exciting news . the only thing i can think of is that my supervisor elected me to take over the administration of another program while the initial administrator is out on maternity leave . i thought it was an honor that they chose me for the task , especially considering i was only trained to control programs a few weeks ago and i m still relatively new at the process .","299167":"i don t believe everyone has been bullied , no . i also don t believe that if you weren t bullied then you were the bully yourself . some people go through life without having to deal with that sort of thing . although , the two concepts aren t mutually exclusive . sometimes people who bully others are actually bullied themselves as well .","299168":"i m not around young people , so i don t personally witness this happening . although when i was in high school , it was often the case between people who would hook up and then try to use that activity against someone else .","299169":"i don t do anything to safeguard my askfm friends because they don t need any form of protection , haha . i have my askfm friends added on other social media alongside my irl friends .","299170":"either their height , their hair , or their smile .","299171":"you asked this yesterday , so i ll answer regarding yesterday my day was good , though ! ! i slept in until am , had breakfast , and then went out to run some errands . i went over my boyfriend s house for dinner , and we just hung out for a few hours before going to bed .","299172":"depends on what you exactly need help with .","299173":"askfm is for answering questions , not chatting .","299174":"it wouldn t emotionally affect me , although it would suck to have to start over from scratch , lol .","299175":"the simple things in life inspire me seeing my boyfriend laugh , looking at scenic landscapes , certain themes in movies or television shows , other people s writing and art , etc etc .","299176":"the coldest place i ve ever been was the berkshire mountains in massachusetts . i don t remember how cold it was , but with the wind chill , it was definitely below fahrenheit .","299177":"water , food , and my medication .","299178":"my favorite books are girl interrupted by susanna kaysen , the shining by stephen king , interview with the vampire by anne rice , i am not a serial killer by dan wells , fear and loathing in los vegas by hunter thompson , and american psycho by bret easton ellis .","299179":"hey friends , i made a back up account just in case this account gets flagged ! ! please follow lunampoeta ! !","299180":"i believe most people have good and bad in them , it just depends on which side they decide to act out on . although i believe that people who are genuinely evil don t have much good in them at all , especially with respect to mass m rderers and p dophiles .","299181":"i would want to travel to alaska , the grand canyon , australia , new zealand , the uk , spain , and the caribbean .","299182":"lol . i m so done talking about this .","299183":"hello do you have a question ? ?","299184":"he doesn t even interact with underage girls , and you have no idea who my boyfriend is . lmao you re saying this with no evidence whatsoever .","299185":"he isn t attracted to underage kids at all . lmao you just pulled this out of your ass .","299186":"in the same vein , i also want to point out that it s never the minor s fault either . a lot of people are quick to say yeah but the young girl sought it out or was okay with it that means absolutely nothing because they ve literally been groomed and was raised to believe that this behavior is okay . in addition , it s extremely difficult for a child to have a say in those kinds of relationships because it s a power trip for the older person and they want complete control .","299187":"ugh , it s so sad and disgusting . it s definitely a lot more common than people realize . i have zero sympathy for them too , they should ideally be locked up for the rest of their lives so that they don t have the possibility of interacting with children anymore . also , in prison p dophiles are basically detested by everyone , so if someone were to take the law into their own hands , i wouldn t be opposed to it .","299188":"no . as my bio indicates , i m a writer and editor .","299189":"you can clearly see my hair in my profile picture .","299190":"i would say that s because you re a normal human being , but considering you re trying to justify p dophilia , that isn t really the case here .","299191":"the idea of attraction basically means you desire to have sxxual relations with that person , so they re interconnected . regardless , we were talking about both concepts .","299192":"lol . also , those types of therapies are rarely effective to begin with . we should make it impossible for them to be around children in the first place .","299193":"i agree , it s absolutely ridiculous and disgusting . it only shows how much society has deemed it okay to sxxualize children , to the point where predators believe that they re actually doing no wrong .","299194":"yeah , they re still minors . they cannot consent to sxxual activity and have no business being with an older individual .","299195":"saying something as absolute as everyone is inherently incorrect . not everyone is attracted to someone who s when they re much older than them . you don t have to believe me , but the only person i find attractive is my boyfriend and he s years old .","299196":"this is indeed true . it s a power trip for the older individual , which is abvsive in nature .","299197":"you can believe i m not credible , but that doesn t change my opinion . i have no sympathy for p dophiles and non offending ones are just as disgusting as offending ones , and it s only a matter of time until they act out on their desires .","299198":"it s science sweaty you can correct my reasoning without insulting me , you know . lmao . this is true , but it still doesn t make it fine for a year old to be attracted to someone who s barely an adult . they re at two completely different stages of their life and if someone who s wants to be in a relationship with someone half their age , then that s a harsh indication of their mindset .","299199":"definitions are broad it s still p dophilic behavior to be attracted to a minor even after they ve reached puberty . the fact that you re trying to justify this is a bit scary , not gonna lie .","299200":"technically it s legal , but it s still a red flag for ab se . there s no reason for someone who s to be attracted to someone who s barely an adult .","299201":"you re wrong by definition , lol .","299202":"this is true too ! ! it s rude and disrespectful , as well as creepy . i don t know if it s illegal or not , though .","299203":"you re welcome ! !","299204":"i m pretty neutral on this question because i believe it could go either way depending on the individual . a lot of proverbs are relatively commonplace and universally known , so it wouldn t really make someone more intelligent for knowing those proverbs or understanding what they mean . at the same time , however , it also doesn t make someone less intelligent because their knowledge of the proverb could be an indication of their opinion , just in a metaphor like manner .","299205":"even though she s not a minor , it s still p dophilic in nature considering the large age gap between the girl and the older man . also , you can t tell how old someone is just by looking at them and there s a good chance that the older man believes that she s a minor . cases of p dophilia aren t one time acts , they re recurrent in nature and guaranteed he has tried to do this before to similar aged girls .","299206":"i think our dreams have the capability of holding meaning , but it isn t always guaranteed . there will be some dreams that are utterly meaningless other dreams that do have meaning behind them . sometimes our dreams are indications of our stress levels and desires that aren t apparent when we re conscious , while other times they may be completely random .","299207":"i would probably try to travel a lot and make the most out of my life , living each day in the present moment . i would still keep a part time job to pay for my every day expenses and also to keep myself busy when i m not traveling , but mostly i would just want to experience the world .","299208":"i suppose the information i would be most interested in knowing about would be whether or not i was happy and healthy in the future .","299209":"it depends entirely on the secret and the situation . i believe that if someone is in danger , whether to themselves or other people , then that may be a valid reason to reveal a secret if it means that by discussing that secret , you will be helping them in the long run .","299210":"i usually don t condone violence , but i think that s completely justified . p dophiles and other similar offenders deserve punishment , and it s unfortunate that most cases of p dophilia go unnoticed . in those cases , i stand behind acts of viligante justice and civilians taking matters into their own hands .","299211":"not really , no . my circle of friends is quite small though , lol . i only really hang out with three people excluding my boyfriend , and two of them i don t see very often at all . regardless , we ve always had the same vibe regarding the same people and if someone dislikes someone else , then usually that feeling will carry over .","299212":"i think one of the most pressing issues is the topic of white supremacy . there have been so many tragedies done by the hands of white supremacists and nothing is being done to stop them , government wise at the very least . racism is becoming more and more prevalent these days or at least racists are being given the validation they desire for being racist , and there are still a lot of people who see nothing wrong with it .","299213":"no , i ve never told anyone that , let alone my boyfriend . i think that s an extremely disrespectful statement .","299214":"i m feeling fine , albeit a bit lazy . i have to go out and buy a gift for my boyfriend s step mother this afternoon , but i m really not feeling up to it . i m hoping this cup of coffee changes my mind , haha .","299215":"buzzfeed unsolved s true crime and supernatural videos are mind blowing , in my opinion ! ! they re so interesting and addictive . https www . youtube . com watch ? v dcc hq gjw","299216":"i don t have any photos of when i had piercings saved anywhere . i had a labret when i was in high school , and i only had my nose pierced for one month when i was a bit older .","299217":"i sleep with my door closed .","299218":"no , i m not religious in any form . i m also not very spiritual either , at least not compared to how i used to be . i m pretty much a full fledged atheist at this point .","299219":"thank you","299220":"i very much disagree . by remaining silent in the face of adversity , you re unconsciously siding with the oppressor . you can t obtain peace by remaining silent on matters that are important . you have to let your voice be heard , otherwise nothing will progress .","299221":"this is a good idea it s honestly something i ve never done before . i ll definitely try it out .","299222":"probably anything within the field of information technology or computers . at the same time , there s also always a demand for medical professionals as well .","299223":"my facial recognition is much better than my vocal recognition . it s difficult for me to distinguish people s voices sometimes , especially since a lot of them sound so similar to each other .","299224":"yeah , i agree . for me personally , the most daunting part of writing is the beginning when you re staring at a blank page and have no idea where to even begin .","299225":"you say this as if it s supposed to be news to me .","299226":"i don t have any piercings at the moment . i want to get my nose re pierced , though .","299227":"extremely well . i ve always been talented at writing and it s my primary means of communicating my feelings , as well as my creative outlet .","299228":"this is definitely true ! ! thank you","299229":"yeah , i can keep a secret better than most other people .","299230":"no , i was drinking so i didn t feel a need to sleep . i don t have work tomorrow so i don t need to go to bed early .","299231":"am .","299232":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","299233":"? ? ? i have no idea what this means , but okay .","299234":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","299235":"nah , i m not getting drunk tonight . i m tipsy but that s the extent of it .","299236":"i just said vodka , so yeah .","299237":"yes , i have a boyfriend .","299238":"i m drinking flavored seltzer and vodka at the moment . i had a blue raspberry seltzer , but now i m drinking an orange passionfruit seltzer .","299239":"i ve always loved criminal minds . it s one of my all time favorite shows . i love the psychology behind the criminal profiling , and over time , i really grew attached to the characters .","299240":"me too ! ! i haven t seen it in so long . there s apparently a new movie coming out where they re covering beatles songs , and it made me think of across the universe so i put a few songs on . i forgot how trippy that movie is , lmao .","299241":"i listen to all sorts of music , ranging from heavy metal to classic rock to indie to hip hop and everything in between .","299242":"i m listening to various songs from the across the universe soundtrack at the moment . they re basically remakes of old beatles songs .","299243":"i m neutral . they re just a bodily anomaly like anything else , like acne or body hair . it isn t sexy or gross , it just happens sometimes and you have to treat it accordingly .","299244":"depends on the context of the relationship . i m in a monogamous relationship , so if he had sxxual relations with other people , then he would be cheating on me . however , if we were in a polyamorous relationship , then i wouldn t see a problem with him being with other people at all . it s only possessive if you re controlling your partner and dictating what they should and should not do . whether that s in terms of their friends or their career or anything in between .","299245":"no , not really . he has his own life , just like i have my own life . he sees his friends while i see my own friends , and there s nothing wrong with that . i trust him wholeheartedly and i know if he was unhappy with our relationship then he would talk to me about it first before doing anything else .","299246":"don t call me honey . my boyfriend doesn t even call me that , haha . not much though . i m just listening to music and drinking .","299247":"nope .","299248":"no , i ve basically accepted my short stature at this point . sometimes when i m at concerts , i wish i was taller , but otherwise i m fine with my height .","299249":"sure , that s one way to put it .","299250":"i m five feet tall .","299251":"thanks . . . again .","299252":"thanks , man .","299253":"flavored seltzer and vodka ! !","299254":"it depends on the item , in my opinion . i like some neon things , but definitely not everything . i . e . i ll wear neon socks , but that s pretty much it lol .","299255":"hello i m doing well , just listening to music and drinking .","299256":"i said i don t answer sxxual or invasive questions , so i m not answering this .","299257":"no , but my coworker has started calling me tiny juicy lately , lmao . it started because i snapchatted her a photo of me drinking a beer called tiny juicy . she said it would be an amazing nickname , so she s been calling me that now . lmao .","299258":"of course ! ! i wouldn t be with him if he didn t make me happy .","299259":"listening to music , especially when i m with my boyfriend and we re talking about music and swapping songs we like to show each other .","299260":"whatever you want . i just don t answer questions that are sxxual , trolling , or overly invasive . i do like answering questions pertaining to mental health , my hobbies , my education and career , my relationship , etc etc . obviously i m not limited to those topics though .","299261":"hello ! ! i m doing well i m currently tipsy listening to music . my mixer has caffeine in it , so i don t think i ll be sleeping anytime soon , lmao .","299262":"i know absolutely nothing about parenting so i have no idea how to help you .","299263":"i don t remember tbh . i ve owned a cell phone since i was in high school , so i really don t know how many phones i ve had over the years .","299264":"i ve had it for three years .","299265":"no , i don t have a spare phone .","299266":"my phone is old , so it would make more sense to just get a newer phone .","299267":"she probably wasn t angry with you , although obviously i don t know the exact situation and can t say for certain . if she still seems angry now , even though it s been quite a few days , then perhaps you should talk to her about it ask her what you did wrong and how you can better the situation .","299268":"yeah , if my current phone stopped working then i would try to buy a new phone either the same day or the following day . it s my primary means of communication with not only my boyfriend friends , but also my coworkers and supervisor . i need it to wake up for work in the morning , be reminded of appointments , etc etc .","299269":"yeah , i used to drink drive in the past . it was a terrible decision and obviously i don t recommend it because it s very dangerous .","299270":"i am i ve been really into vodka sodas , so i m currently drinking vodka with blue raspberry flavored seltzer .","299271":"this isn t a question .","299272":"hey friends ! ! my inbox is empty i d appreciate some questions","299273":"aw , i miss witty rabbit ! ! i forgot all about them . i like answering questions related to mental health , my hobbies , my relationship , my career and education , and television shows i ve been watching . i m up to answering nearly anything as long as they re not sxxual , trolling , or invasive .","299274":"aw , thank you i ve been getting a lot of new followers recently if any of you guys have any questions , please feel free to ask ! !","299275":"hello do you have a question ? ?","299276":"no , i don t play games on my phone . if i m bored , then i just browse social media or do another hobby of mine .","299277":"thank you","299278":"i don t generally like big multiplayer games like that , no .","299279":"no , i treat my body like a canvas .","299280":"no , i don t play pubg . i watch my boyfriend and his friends play together , though .","299281":"it s all right if she wanted to talk about it , then she would reactivate and post about it . but i would rather not talk about this anymore because i m sure she wouldn t want people to be gossiping about her like this , so this is the final thing i m going to say about it .","299282":"i don t believe in the death penalty , but i do think he doesn t deserve to see the light of day ever again .","299283":"this is at least the th time i ve gotten this question i already answered it earlier today . also , any decent human being will say that they re saddened by this tragedy . i don t really know what else people expect me to think about this .","299284":"i don t talk to cadie , so i don t know what s going on . it s a little weird that you re sending this out to multiple people , though . respect cadie s privacy .","299285":"sometimes , yeah . but then i try to think about all of my successes in life and use that to inspire me to keep moving forward .","299286":"i like relaxing at the end of the day with either a cup of coffee , seltzer over ice , or an alcoholic beverage while watching netflix . i also wind down by listening to music .","299287":"my passion about the things i care about , my loyalty to my friends and relationship , and my talent in writing .","299288":"i haven t ! ! i just looked it up , though , and it sounds like something i would be interested in playing .","299289":"anyone have any questions ? ? i m doing some freelance work and my inbox is empty ! !","299290":"my weight , my mental health , and the way my face looks . haha .","299291":"i don t think that any religious institutions should even need security , but it s sad that it might have to come to that point . no , society needs to get down to the root of the problem which is gun control . i don t know what new zealand s gun laws are like , but at least in the united states and other places with lax gun laws , it should be much harder for people to obtain a gun in the first place .","299292":"i don t generally argue with my friends at all .","299293":"i m years old , and my favorite color is dark purple . i m feet tall , and i m currently in a relationship . my best memory was going on vacation with my boyfriend a few years ago although all of our vacations are amazing memories . my last kiss was friday morning , and my last hug was last night .","299294":"individuals shouldn t be praised for being lgbtq allies . i recently saw a post on facebook questioning whether people should be rewarded for being allies to the lgbtq community , and i thought it was ridiculous because you shouldn t be praised for being a normal , decent human being . it s common sense to support people of different genders and s xual orientations , and to go to far as to induct cis , straight allies into queer ceremonies is pointless .","299295":"i don t have a full understanding of the trial or details of the case in general , so i can t really make an informed opinion . however , the whole idea of him being around children has never sat well with me , even prior to this new documentary that just came out . i always found it alarming how he would invite children to his house and have sleepovers with him because i ve always considered that ped philic behavior .","299296":"i already have an idea for a book in mind i don t really want to discuss the details of the plot or characters because i want it to remain a secret for the time being . but i eventually need to work out the timeline and character development before i begin working on the book . either way , i m excited about what it s about . i haven t had a creative idea like this in a long time and i think it ll be life changing .","299297":"i don t think i would live to see the age of . regardless , i believe my interpersonal relationships are what will matter most to me at that age because life isn t ultimately about work or making money it s about the experiences you have with people close to you that make life worth living .","299298":"i don t think i consider things to be a red flag which other people don t consider at all . most of the red flags i look out for are lying about where they ve been or who they re with , hiding their phone from me , witnessing a sudden change in personality or libido that isn t due to life events or medication , etc etc .","299299":"financial stability , lol . ideally i want to be making more money than i am currently so that i can afford an apartment , at the very least , and be able to further erase more of my debts .","299300":"their personality , first and foremost . i think people with beautiful personalities are caring , loyal , passionate about their interests , and compassionate toward other people . i think people are beautiful when they have goals that they work towards and are percent themselves regardless of whatever opposition exists .","299301":"i would leave my life as it currently is . if i were to re arrange my life or do things differently in the past , i wouldn t know if i would still be in the same position as i am now because of the domino effect . although there are things i would improve in my life now , i m still fairly happy with the way my life is headed and i wouldn t want to ruin that .","299302":"i don t really have a diet , lol . i eat what i want to eat within reason , and i don t naturally eat junk food anyway . i also don t drink soda because i don t like soda .","299303":"my job requires a reason , but they re fairly lenient as long as you re not calling out too often i . e . at least times per month or so . she s lying , at least in my opinion , because she wants to look good in upper management s eyes . she s already the favorite of the ceo of the company and she doesn t want to ruin that , so she makes up bullsh t excuses that seem more than valid instead of letting it be known that she s probably calling out just because she doesn t want to be there .","299304":"chester bennington is my idol . although he passed away , that doesn t take away from the fact that he helped me immensely when i was a teenager when i was going through severe depression .","299305":"cold , windy day .","299306":"pay off all of my debts , buy a house for my boyfriend and i , buy my boyfriend a new car , perhaps get a few more tattoos , and adopt a lot of animals .","299307":"i think i found it on google , although i ve had this background for well over a year at this point , haha .","299308":"i m currently looking forward to the vacation i m planning on taking next year me and my boyfriend s family are taking an day vacation to the caribbean ! ! in addition , a highlight of my life so far is the added responsibilities i ve been given at work . in addition to the new program i m in charge of , my supervisor elected me to take on another program while the original administrator is out on maternity leave .","299309":"a skyrim background ! ! i absolutely love it .","299310":"usually spinach , although i like margherita pizza as well fresh mozzarella and tomatoes with olive oil .","299311":"i m currently listening to me and my friends are lonely by matt maeson https www . youtube . com watch ? v un aixcksu","299312":"i would tighten up laws in relation to gun ownership and make it harder for people to obtain guns , especially ones with bump stocks and other modifications that could inflict the most damage . there s absolutely no reason for people to be able to own an ar or anything similar in today s age .","299313":"pretty much all day . on the weekends , i usually only eat breakfast and dinner without a lunch in between . i don t feel hungry in between those times at all .","299314":"yes , i absolutely love poetry ! ! my favorite poet is pablo neruda .","299315":"i think the attacks are incredibly tragic i feel sympathy for everyone who was affected by the tragedy . i don t know much about the perpetrator , but i saw my friend say it was an alt right white supremacy thing , so that does make me angry .","299316":"my shirts are put in the hamper after one wear , but i ll wear jeans times in a row before i wash them , lol . i don t do any physical labor or anything , so i don t need to wash my jeans every wear .","299317":"my passion is writing ! ! i ve loved writing for as long as i can remember , and it makes me incredibly happy when something i ve written has helped someone else or made them think of the topic in a different light . i also enjoy emotional responses to my writing as well some of the stories i ve written in the past have made people tear up because of how strongly they felt about the piece since it moved them so much .","299318":"i m not entirely sure . i use my phone as my primary means of communication with my boyfriend and my close friends , and i also use it to save doctor appointments , set alarms , pay my bills , etc etc .","299319":"i tend to be drawn to people with vibrant , bold personalities people who aren t afraid to voice their opinions , who hold strong opinions , and who aren t afraid to be percent themselves regardless of circumstance .","299320":"go easy by matt maeson ! ! https www . youtube . com watch ? v nauxmcsdmji","299321":"no , that has never been important to me . i don t really care about my standing in relation to my peers or community , the only thing i care about is how my loved ones feel towards me .","299322":"one of my coworkers has a really terrible habit of lying about a lot of things related to her actual work or why she called out sick . there was a big issue regarding the work she neglected to complete about a week ago , where she refused to do the longer assignments and only did the shorter ones to the point where my other coworker found things from october in her pile that she never finished . recently , my coworker who lies said that she left work early because her sister s appendix burst and she had to pick up her children from school , or something . however , i didn t believe that at all because of her habit of lying so much last week , she called out sick because she had pink eye , but she never went to the doctor and came to work the next day and was fine . it made me roll my eyes .","299323":"it depends on where in new york you re traveling . new york city is fun to visit as a tourist , so i m assuming you mean you want to travel there . there s also upstate new york and long island , which are two vastly different environments .","299324":"probably not , no . i ve lived in the suburbs for my entire life , and even then the whole suburban lifestyle can be far too wild and hectic for me to handle . i couldn t imagine living somewhere like new york city , it would be too busy and fast paced for me .","299325":"i trust my boyfriend the most out of any of my friends . if i tell him something in confidence , then i know that he won t say anything to anyone else and will keep it between me and him .","299326":"following your own dreams is more important , in my opinion . your life , your dreams and your goals are important , and you re your own individual above anything else . your parents should recognize that and understand that you should ideally pursue your own dreams because that is what will make you happy , and they shouldn t pressure you to follow their dreams simply because they perhaps couldn t follow through with them themselves .","299327":"yeah me , lol . i dislike shopping , especially if i have to go on the weekend in the middle of the day when everyone else is out . i dislike crowds of people and lines , so i try to do my necessary shopping early in the morning when everyone else is still asleep .","299328":"it depends on the movie . i have a few movies that i can re watch time and time again , and i ve already seen them a plethora of times . however , i can t do that with every movie i ve seen . sometimes one time is just enough .","299329":"i m pretty content rn ! ! i just woke up not too long ago it s almost am , and i just made myself a cup of coffee . i had a fun night last night to the point where my cheeks hurt from laughing so much . now i m going to go through my inbox here and then work on some assignments for work .","299330":"for the past two months , i ve been working every weekend . i work in the office monday through friday , and on saturdays and sundays , i work from home .","299331":"no , i ve been in a

states .","299341":"i enjoy it in the present moment , and that s all that really matters . regardless , it s easy to forget everything that happens in a season of game of thrones when you haven t seen it in about a year , lol .","299342":"yeah , i ve been driving since i was years old .","299343":"i can drink in moderation nothing too wild or anything , though . my medication just makes it easier for me to get drunk .","299344":"alternative rock , nu metal , and hip hop .","299345":"how many times a day are you going to ask me this ? ?","299346":"freelance writer , where i can basically sit at home and work throughout the day on my own time . ideally i would want to be writing short stories , poetry , and novels .","299347":"i would want to learn how to sing well . i ve always wanted to be a musician , particularly a singer songwriter , but unfortunately i don t have a voice .","299348":"cleaning the bathroom mainly scrubbing the bathtub and shower , as well as cleaning the toilet .","299349":"it s my gender it basically means i m not a man or a woman the two gender binaries . i m simply non binary .","299350":"i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","299351":"i m smoking a cigarette outside .","299352":"it s a darker color denim , as opposed to light wash , which is a lighter color denim .","299353":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","299354":"i usually wear dark wash jeans or black jeans . for shirts , most of my shirts are either patterned or are dark red , black , navy green , or gray . i don t wear anything different in the summer compared to the rest of the year .","299355":"somewhere in between . i don t like them too soft because it hurts my back , but beds that are too hard are uncomfortable af .","299356":"showers . i don t know when the last time i took a bath was . i ve only done it once or twice as an adult .","299357":"no , not so much anymore . i grew out of that stage after i turned or so .","299358":"anyone have any more questions ? ? my inbox is empty","299359":"warning will perform emotional parkour at any given moment .","299360":"i don t really know what you mean by and hiding . but one of my close friends recently got fired from his job , so my boyfriend set him up with an interview at his own place of employment . i really hope he ends up getting the job , because i think it would be a productive environment for him to be in . he s going to be worked tooth and nail , but it would be worth it for him .","299361":"i don t know much about global warming , but i do know enough to confidently say that global warming climate change is an international crisis and if we don t start taking it seriously , then it s going to cause a lot of issues in the foreseeable future . it s extremely important to lower our impact on the environment , not only for our own safety but also for the safety of the rest of the ecosystems which exist .","299362":"yes , there are often strong thunderstorms in my area actually . i don t feel compelled to learn more about meteorology , but i do find weather to be an interesting phenomenon especially things like thunderstorms , tornadoes , hurricanes , etc etc . the most beautiful weather , in my opinion , is when it s chilly and gray with freshly laid snow on the ground . i love being outside late at night after a snowfall and everything is quiet . the scariest weather i ve ever experienced , however , was hurricane sandy in .","299363":"i don t know if i would want to be anyone other than myself , especially considering i simply don t know the struggles everyone faces . a person who may seem to be collected and happy on the outside might actually be harboring negative thoughts and feelings or struggling with bad events .","299364":"if someone is changing alongside you , and it s happening naturally , then that isn t a bad omen at all . it s relatively normal , especially as two people are getting older together . people do change as they grow , and that isn t necessarily a bad thing because it s natural and expected .","299365":"what , lmao . that s absolutely ridiculous . i ve never heard of this before and i can t find any pages online regarding this , though .","299366":"i m not sure about this one ! ! there s a lot of compelling evidence to suggest that it was staged , but i simply don t know enough information about the ordeal to really have an informed opinion . i would like to believe that the moon landing was real , but if it was exposed to be staged , i also wouldn t be surprised .","299367":"i believe in false memories , yes . some of the examples on the mandela effect website hold true to me personally , but i think it all depends on how good your memory is .","299368":"i would delete them all . social media is fun and all , but it s completely unnecessary . i wouldn t want to spend money on a social media platform , especially considering most of my friends probably wouldn t be on them anymore either .","299369":"texas ! ! i only visited austin , but it was an extremely interesting experience and the culture was completely different from the culture that i m used to witnessing .","299370":"weak by ajr https www . youtube . com watch ? v txccybmkdb","299371":"chester bennington has always been my idol . even though he passed away , it doesn t change the influence he had on me when i was going through crucial stages of my life due to his openness about his feelings and experiences , as well as his support to his fanbase .","299372":"as long as i have something to say about the topic , i suppose . some things i have a lot to say about , while other things i m fairly neutral .","299373":"answering questions , listening to music , and drinking coffee .","299374":"honestly , i would probably do the same thing i do every day . lmao . i don t really have any desire to do something special if i was invisible if anything , i might pull a prank on someone and make them believe i was a ghost or something .","299375":"i believe in aliens , and i believe that they know of our existence already . it would be ignorant to assume that earth is the only planet hosting life forms , especially considering how much of the universe is unexplored by us .","299376":"no problem ! ! it s something i ve always struggled with i ve never had a clear sense of identity , even though i m an adult . my interests wax and wane .","299377":"broccoli and spinach .","299378":"a fried egg on a croissant with a heaping cup of coffee .","299379":"i don t believe the government is harboring aliens in area , but i do believe that a lot of secret military activity goes on there , especially with respect to technology and extraterrestrial life .","299380":"i ve literally never heard this theory before , lol . either way , that sounds a bit far fetched . i don t believe it s true .","299381":"no , i don t believe the government has the cure to cancer . i find the conspiracy theory compelling because it does somewhat make sense that the government would hide such a cure , considering the costs of cancer treatment and how much money facilities make through radiation and chemo , among other treatments . however , i believe science is authentic and if there was a cure , we would know about it . cancer is far too prevalent and fatal of a disease to keep something like that in hiding .","299382":"i was younger than a teenager when i reached puberty , actually . i don t remember exactly what happened to me , though . probably just the typical stuff that happens to people when they go through puberty as a pre teen teenager .","299383":"i think my fitbit is really great i don t have the most advanced one , but it still tracks my steps , calories burned and consumed , and my sleep patterns . i find the sleep analysis to be the most interesting part , i look it up every morning lol . there are also fitbits that track your heart rate , which i think is rather cool too .","299384":"i cracked the screen of my ipad once when i was a lot younger . my boyfriend purchased it for me while i was still attending college , and i almost dropped it but still smashed part of the screen on the table . it still worked , but i felt absolutely horrible about the entire situation .","299385":"i refuse to pay for water particularly water bottles , excluding flavored seltzer water of course . there are water coolers in my office my refrigerator has running water with a filter attached , so i almost never need to purchase water unless i m out somewhere .","299386":"yes , i ve seen all of the seasons of game of thrones thus far . my only issue is that i don t remember anything from last season , lol . i would watch it over again , but the episodes are super long and i can t guarantee i ll have the energy or attention span to get through them again .","299387":"i like most of the questions i received today , obviously minus the trollish , invasive , and inappropriate questions . those i simply delete , though .","299388":"financial stability . it s the biggest issue in my life right now , and i m really hoping that this promotion comes with a substantial raise . in the meantime , i ve been doing a lot of freelance work throughout the week and on the weekends for extra cash .","299389":"heathers , girl interrupted , the punisher , i am not a serial killer , and the crow . all of which i ve already seen multiple times , lol . they re some of my top favorite movies .","299390":"i don t really have any all time favorite songs , but lately i ve been listening to apologize by grandson . beggar s song by matt maeson . almost sweet music by hozier .","299391":"no , i don t believe so . i believe that sadness is a foundation upon which we can judge happiness , because we simply wouldn t know the highs if we didn t have the lows to compare them to .","299392":"my life changed for the better after i started seeking treatment for my mental health . prior to that , my outlook on life and general well being was poor . but once i started taking medication and attending therapy , i started to feel rejuvenated and i looked forward to doing things again .","299393":"drive to and from work every day . my commute is so long and painful , but i have to do it , otherwise i wouldn t be able to have a job , lol . i wish teleportation existed .","299394":"the best case scenario of my future is that i either get a substantial raise at my current job or i find a new job that pays me much more money than what i m making now . with that money , i ll be able to move into my own house with my boyfriend , and we can afford to live independently and adopt a lot of animals .","299395":"my favorite fruits are raspberries , bananas , blueberries , pomegranates , peaches , and mangoes .","299396":"this is a difficult question because i don t understand myself , so i wouldn t know how to traverse getting someone else to truly know me through different media . i only know my likes dislikes , but i m not entirely sure whether or not they define me , so to speak .","299397":"yes , i believe unconditional love exists . quite often , the love that a parent has for their child is unconditional .","299398":"i think it s more important to be respected . you don t have to like someone in order to respect them , their opinions , and or their decisions . in addition , not everyone is going to like you you can t please everyone , and it s worthless to worry about who dislikes you because they don t genuinely matter .","299399":"the songs i m listening to right now don t have lyrics , lol . they re just lo fi chillhop mixes on youtube .","299400":"bad things happen to good people because life is unfair . you re never guaranteed to have good things coming your way simply because you re a good person life happens spontaneously , at random , with no rhyme or reason .","299401":"it could be interpreted as both a compliment and an insult , haha . it depends entirely on the context of the statement and who was saying it .","299402":"no , i currently have no interest in learning a different language .","299403":"they both hurt equally in different ways . they re vastly different , so it would be impossible to compare the two . it also depends entirely on the individual . some people can handle emotional pain but not physical pain , or vice versa .","299404":"i most get arabic speaking individuals on my page , although occasionally i ll also find some spanish text in my inbox . i think it s because askfm is extremely prominent in arabic countries , probably just as much as in english speaking countries .","299405":"i can live without both of those , considering i seldom eat chocolate and ice cream to begin with . i can t remember the last time i actually had ice cream .","299406":"no ? ? it isn t a real woman , lmao . it s just ai technology . there s no need to read into it further than that .","299407":"depends on the area you live in . that s reasonable and actually incredibly cheap in my area , but in other states , that s quite expensive .","299408":"well my day has just begun considering it s only am . however , yesterday was all right . i had a lot of anxiety yesterday which prevented me from being super productive at work , but today i m feeling much better so far .","299409":"i was sleeping when you sent this to me .","299410":"i think it s wrong for a person to expect someone else to take care of them solely because they re lazy and don t want to work assuming they re not disabled , at least . however , that honestly only really accounts for a small fraction of people who don t work . there are a lot of barriers to employment , such as difficulty finding positions , lack of transportation , disability , etc etc . also , not everyone needs to work either , which is evident in households where one partner may stay home while the other works and makes enough money for the two of them .","299411":"i m fine , although i could be better . today was a long day wrought with emotions , and i m so mentally and physically drained .","299412":"i ve never been served by a robot before , so i don t really have an opinion on this matter .","299413":"no . the past can often be misconstrued because of lapses in memory .","299414":"there s a lot i would change about the past . but the past isn t going to ever change , the most we can do is learn from it and cope with it while bettering ourselves for the future .","299415":"formspring died out , and i heard about askfm around the same time , so i made an account back in .","299416":"no . if that was the case , then everyone with the same name would act similar .","299417":"no , i ve learned that it isn t worth it to be afraid to be yourself around other people . individuals who matter to you won t be bothered and will embrace who you are , while those who are bothered don t end up meaning anything to you anyway . i wouldn t want someone in my life who can t handle me for who i actually am .","299418":"i don t have an alexa , but my father and my boyfriend do . idk what my father has been using it for besides setting alarms and hearing about the weather , but my boyfriend mainly uses it to listen to music . i don t personally want one , even though they re both obsessed with their devices , lol . i don t have a need for something like that .","299419":"yeah , that s true . it only gets triggered when there s conflict in any of my relationships . although sometimes the most minor things can set the fear off .","299420":"someone s social media usage has no effect on whether or not i would date them , as long as their use isn t problematic in the relationship i . e . not socializing with your partner , ignoring them for your phone , etc etc . i use social media a lot more than my boyfriend does , and it s never really been an issue . he browses occasionally , but he seldom posts things .","299421":"depends on whose hair it is , whether i m eating out or at home , how much hair there is , the type of food i m eating , etc etc . i sometimes find hair in food at home , lol . it isn t a big deal to me when i know whose hair it is and where it came from . however , i might feel disgusted if i m at a restaurant and find a hair in my food .","299422":"i m wearing a gray hoodie with black stripes on the arms .","299423":"i have a fear of abandonment , but i don t know if it would classify as a phobia .","299424":"no , i don t watch porn .","299425":"i ll be good by jaymes young . https youtu . be poqevwroeqs","299426":"as of this answer , i m in the united states .","299427":"email support ask . fm and they ll guide you through the steps . it s just a verification system to show that you re not a fake profile .","299428":"i fear abandonment by my loved ones .","299429":"i m probably going to heat up some soup that i bought over the weekend .","299430":"yeah , my instagram is working fine .","299431":"i would certainly hope so .","299432":"apparently ! ! who knew .","299433":"i haven t changed my hair since before christmas . lmao .","299434":"if you knew my friends , you wouldn t think it was disrespectful . lmao .","299435":"god forbid i do both at the same time . lol . you can simultaneously be on social media and socialize .","299436":"lol . precisely .","299437":"that doesn t mean i don t have friends who aren t my best friend .","299438":"you obviously don t know them because they don t use askfm . lol .","299439":"i m out with my friends .","299440":"i have no clue . i ve never discussed that with them .","299441":"i ve never been arrested for a crime , so technically no .","299442":"somewhat , sure . most of the time , i have good intentions . however , my morals are a bit questionable .","299443":"no , i don t have any pets right now . i used to have a betta fish and a corycat , but they both passed away . i had them both for over a year , though .","299444":"i m assuming you meant wearing ? ? sweatpants and a tee shirt .","299445":"my antidepressants . lol . but to actually answer your question what makes me happy are hanging out with my boyfriend , drinking coffee , writing prose that i m happy with , sleeping without an alarm being set , drinking with friends , having a productive day at work , and positive reinforcement .","299446":"i agree with it somewhat it sorta entails the perspective that your thoughts toward yourself are what matter most of all , and if you believe you re attractive and have confidence , then it could take you far . my boyfriend makes me feel attractive . generally i think i m a pasty potato , but he does make me more confident in myself .","299447":"i believe that the spirit and our own conscience are two separate entities . our conscience is what drives us in our current vessel , while our spirit transcends our bodily form and remains regardless of whether we re alive or dead . i believe that after our body dies , our spirit lives on and moves to a different medium because it s made out of energy .","299448":"i have experience with ouija boards , and based on my experiences and what other people have told me , they re nothing to play around with . i wholeheartedly believe that they can be used to communicate with spirits , except bad spirits as well as good spirits have access to it , and therefore , you . i haven t used one since i was a teenager , and i have no intentions of using one again .","299449":"i would probably travel to the early s assuming i can retain my current age , of course . there was so much great music then and i would have loved to see grunge and other hard rock bands perform live .","299450":"oof , this is a difficult question . i suppose it would be alternative rock , since the genre in itself is quite diverse and i listen to it the most out of any genre to begin with .","299451":"i just want to be able to live independently with my boyfriend and a few pets while maintaining a full time job to keep myself busy . that would probably make me the most happy and free , at this stage of my life . i m currently tied down to my parents house which holds a lot of terrible feelings and memories , and i think i ll flourish once i m out of this toxic environment .","299452":"in certain cases , yes . however , you should never feel obligated to forgive someone and your healing should be on your own terms .","299453":"depends on the individual . in most cases , it s best to allow them to cry and get their emotions out , and some people prefer to stay silent while others vent . let them know that you re there for them and if you can do anything to help them .","299454":"i don t make enough money to live independently , and that bothers me every day . i wouldn t be able to afford rent by myself .","299455":"i haven t had a crush in over ten years , lmao .","299456":"tumblr . com might be your best bet . there s also wordpress and blogspot .","299457":"i left work early last friday because i had a migraine and my stomach was upset , so i e mailed hr and i was nervous that they would have a bad reaction to me leaving early . they didn t btw , they just told me to feel better .","299458":"yes , i have one brother .","299459":"i like both dogs and cats , but i would probably adopt a dog first .","299460":"i m doing fine . i just got home from work and i m figuring out what i m doing tonight , if i m doing anything at all .","299461":"i m leigh i m years old","299462":"dark , royal purple . especially when it comes to hair color , lol . it s just always appealed to me .","299463":"i m on my lunch break at work , so i m standing outside smoking a cigarette .","299464":"i prefer instagram over snapchat , although i do use both . my instagram username is poetalunam . however , my account is private and i only accept people i know .","299465":"false . you re not obligated to spend money on your significant other , especially if you don t have much money to begin with . ideally , you both should split the costs of things , like dinners and whatnot .","299466":"my name is leigh , my dude .","299467":"i have a dell , but i don t remember which one it is exactly . i got it in . i also don t know which laptops are the best , although i assume it all depends on what you re using it for .","299468":"somewhat , yeah . i used to talk to people online on discussion forums and they were strangers at the time , but eventually i became their friend . there s one person in particular that i still wonder about , but i haven t been able to find them on any social media .","299469":"courrtana didn t live alone . and trust me , if i had the finances to move out , i would have done so a long time ago .","299470":"no , i would jump on that in a heartbeat . that s only between two people .","299471":"lately i ve been using facebook and instagram a lot . i mostly repost things on facebook add things about my day to my instagram story .","299472":"my new job didn t give me as much money as i thought it would due to taxes and health insurance , and my boyfriend s former promotion wasn t as much money as he would have liked it to be . it s something we re still striving towards , though . it s difficult when a one bedroom apartment is upwards of month , though . most people don t understand how expensive it is to live on long island , unfortunately .","299473":"like . . . gossiping ? ? or talking sh t about other people to their face ? ? idk , i m not really the type of person who does things like that . i m assuming it s because they re either bored or they feel the need to say something when someone else is doing something wrong .","299474":"this makes absolutely zero sense .","299475":"exactly the same thing as when you asked me this an hour ago .","299476":"we re talking right now .","299477":"i m tipsy and i just agreed to write a letter of recommendation for my coworker s child to say why he would qualify for this special summer camp . how do i find myself in these situations . lmao i ve never met this kid what the hell am i doing .","299478":"scrolling through memes on facebook , listening to music , and drinking .","299479":"hey friends ! ! i m having a few drinks tonight so y all should ask me questions","299480":"i m not sure what my thoughts are regarding this conspiracy . i ve seen a lot of videos discussing why it could possibly be an inside job , though , and it was really compelling to me .","299481":"if i lived on a deserted island , there wouldn t be people there . just me and my boyfriend . it would be a nice change to be away from the general population for a while .","299482":"play video games , watch television , write , paint , do photography , sometimes read , and hang out with a friend or two .","299483":"hello do you have a question ? ?","299484":"i was years old in , so barely .","299485":"my memory doesn t go back further than years old , so who knows . lol .","299486":"i was years old in , so i don t remember much . i just know it was an extremely difficult part of my life and i struggled a lot with abvse , self harm , and svicide .","299487":"i ve heard the opposite and have always had that stuck in the back of my mind , haha . i m too lazy to research into it right now , though .","299488":"my shower ? ? fine . i used overtone deep conditioner to brighten up my hair , but i don t see much of a difference .","299489":"government wrongdoings alien cover ups are my two biggest conspiracies , apparently . lol .","299490":"i d much rather live without television . music is one of my passions and i m basically listening to music all day long . most of the time when i come home from work , i put youtube or spotify on for the rest of the night while i do other things .","299491":"this world is already hell .","299492":"i consider my boyfriend to be my best and closest friend . he s extremely intelligent , loyal , caring , hard working , and rational . he s not afraid to call people out on their bullsh t and he doesn t sugarcoat anything . he s been my biggest support system and i m forever grateful for his love and encouragement .","299493":"sure , we ll go with that .","299494":"doesn t make a difference to me . askfm doesn t show you who s following you anyway .","299495":"google news , whatever is streaming on the headlines . they have an assortment of sources there .","299496":"i have no interest in following you .","299497":"i m not entirely sure because i honestly would have no idea what to do . i ve never gone legitimate hiking or camping in the wilderness .","299498":"i don t have one particular location that i would like to visit most , but in general , i want to at least visit australia , new zealand , spain , the uk , the caribbean , alaska , and the grand canyon .","299499":"fleeting .","299500":"hello i m doing well . just got out of the shower now i m texting my boyfriend about what to do for his step mother s birthday next week .","299501":"no , i can t even remember the last time i ate chocolate . i m not really a big chocolate enthusiast .","299502":"the typical stuff santa clause , the easter bunny , the tooth fairy , etc etc . i used to also believe that cracking your knuckles would lead to arthritis , and that shaving hair makes it grow back thicker and darker .","299503":"i spoiled myself with a cup of coffee after work tonight because i wanted to treat myself for doing a good job today .","299504":"i was just cleaning and organizing my room laundry while listening to music .","299505":"i m fairly certain it s already illegal . i don t know enough about the topic to have an informed opinion , though .","299506":"i seldom wear makeup .","299507":"i m doing well , actually . i had a good , productive day at work and it made me feel great to be able to get as much work done as i did . i haven t felt this sort of motivation in a few weeks . as for tonight , i m just planning on eating dinner , showering , and watching the staircase on netflix .","299508":"gas is around . a gallon around here right now , so it could be better .","299509":"i still think this is my favorite selfie ever , even though its more than a year old .","299510":"yeah , that picture in particular was from my phone . however , i also own a dslr . i never studied photography , it s just a hobby .","299511":"i really can t think of anything . i would say mountain dew baja blast , but you can still find the bottles in a few stores and you can always get it at taco bell . i miss being able to buy it from my local gas station , but i figure it isn t something i should be drinking anyway , lmao .","299512":"sorta , haha . my best friend and i insult each other all the time because we re close enough to each other to know that we don t actually mean the insults at all . we re both really sensitive people , so if another friend were to say those things , then we would probably be a bit angry .","299513":"i don t want to change the world because i don t believe i m a significant enough of a person to make a substantial difference in this world . i believe the world needs a lot of changes in general , but i have no special skills or attributes that would allow me to make any notable contributions .","299514":"i didn t even know it was legal to keep venomous pets ! ! lmao . as long as the owner is super educated about the animal and knows how to handle them , i don t see any problem . it s always going to come with certain risks , but just like any venomous animal handler , there are always precautions to take .","299515":"this is one of my all time favorites . i took it perhaps years ago when i went upstate .","299516":"i ve never lived alone before , so i don t know which one i would prefer . even when i was in college , i had a roommate . i think i wouldn t mind being alone , but i would be lonely and isolated . i would probably work best living with one other person .","299517":"i m usually not motivated at all when i m going through a depressive episode . the only thing that semi motivates me is the fact that if i don t go to work , i might get fired .","299518":"aw , i m happy someone actually remembers that i used to use this dp ! ! lol . nah , i just wanted a cartoonish one .","299519":"i don t use any tactics because it s silly to pretend to be someone other than yourself just to get someone s attention .","299520":"i m not sure if i want children or not . the concept scares the crap out of me .","299521":"i don t follow people upon request , sorry .","299522":"there s no evidence that vaccines cause autism . the doctor who made that statement falsified the report and got his license taken away . the anti vaxx movement is beyond stupid and ridiculous . parents are putting their children at risk of developing fatal diseases and its gotten to the point where many of those diseases are returning after not being seen for decades .","299523":"i do that every monday through friday , haha .","299524":"if i had to choose between the two , i suppose i would rather follow my head . making logical , sound decisions is super important and in certain cases , it s integral to look at things from an unbiased perspective .","299525":"i d rather always be calm . anger hurts you more than it hurts other people , and it s an unhealthy emotion .","299526":"i haven t watched it , so i don t have an opinion .","299527":"i could barely open my eyes , so i gave myself more minutes of sleep .","299528":"yup , it s still blue .","299529":"it s currently am in new york .","299530":"you won t really know what you like unless you take chances and experiment . if you re bored of your current job , then you should try to find a new job that seems interesting to you . if it isn t a good fit for you , you re not obligated to stay there .","299531":"i don t really watch comedians , but i used to like george carlin .","299532":"my favorite comedy shows are parks rec and how i met your mother . idk about movies though . i haven t seen a comedy movie in a really long time , lol .","299533":"ah , your message got cut off . but i agree with you unfortunately a lot of addicts don t have adequate support both mentally and personally , so it would be difficult to find someone to designate as their child s guardian like that . even so , the idea of refusing someone their necessity to eat because they tested positive for drugs is so extreme .","299534":"ah , that sucks . it was a great lineup , but honestly , the entire event was ridiculously expensive . it was in brooklyn , so not only did we pay for the concert tickets , but also train tickets and then whatever we paid at the actual show regarding food and drinks .","299535":"yeah , i would feel more comfortable in a group too . when i travel next year , i m going to mainly be with my boyfriend , so i m thankfully not too concerned about getting lost . we always find our way regardless of where we are , lol .","299536":"i think alabama s food stamp proposal is ableist people still deserve to be able to eat regardless of their drug use , it s a necessity and to deny someone their need to eat goes against human rights . in addition , food stamps are also used for children of recipients and it s incredibly wrong to deny those children food too . as for arkansas proposal , i also think that s a bit ridiculous . sometimes junk food is cheaper than healthier food , and people are allowed to enjoy things instead of being forced to buy certain foods just because they re not in a position where they can t afford to not be on food stamps . being on food stamps doesn t mean you re a lesser individual . and i think it s wild how there s such a stigma against those who need extra help , solely because the standard and cost of living is too high for most people to afford .","299537":"i ve heard the name before , but never looked into what it was . however , i just googled it and holy crap i need this now .","299538":"? ? ? i honestly think that s pretty ridiculous . people can call their significant others whatever they want , whether it s boyfriend or girlfriend or person or partner or love , etc etc . it isn t immature by any means .","299539":"i think my biggest concern would be accidentally getting lost and not knowing enough of the language to find my way back to wherever i need to be , haha . although losing my luggage is another concern of mine too . i ve thankfully never lost luggage before , but i know it happens often .","299540":"the last show i went to was a radio station s holiday show called not so silent night . the artists were ajr , chvrches , mike shinoda , death cab for cutie , florence and the machine , and muse . it was hella fun .","299541":"unfortunately , i haven t left my country before although i ll be traveling next year ! . i really want to visit australia , new zealand , the uk , spain , and the caribbean .","299542":"anyone have any questions ? ? i have nothing to do tonight my inbox is empty","299543":"i absolutely love that song . i think it was also one of the first ones i heard from him years ago . btw , my boyfriend said that the watsky show was the best show he s ever been to . he still talks about it , rofl .","299544":"sloppy seconds , simply because i have a lot of good memories attached to that song .","299545":"racism is defined as the discrimination towards oppressed groups based on their racial makeup .","299546":"i listen to some classical , yeah . most of it is video game soundtracks , though like the skyrim soundtrack and the halo soundtracks .","299547":"lately i ve been listening to alternative rock and hip hop ! ! artists like grandson , matt maeson , two feet , watsky , and grieves .","299548":"the collection it s in is called four past midnight ! ! there are some other good stories in there too .","299549":"yeah , i use paypal for online shopping .","299550":"i decided to switch up my diet from heavy beers to no calorie drinks . gonna try this out tonight i love peach flavored things so i hope it s yummy ! !","299551":"awesome ! ! my favorite short story by stephen king is secret window , secret garden . they made a movie out of it , but the story is entirely different from the movie .","299552":"depends on what genres you re into ! ! i ll always recommend the hobbit by jrr tolkien if you haven t read it already . it s an easy read and it s fantasy , but it s very entertaining and a good introduction to the rest of the lord of the rings books . my all time favorite book is girl interrupted by susanna kaysen , which is also a pretty easy read . it s about a woman s experience with her own mental health as she lives in a psych hospital . stephen king s collections of short stories are great as well . if you re into thrillers , then i recommend the shining or cujo too , they re a bit more detailed than the previous books i mentioned but they keep you on the edge of your seat .","299553":"i haven t paid attention to snapchat scores in years . i don t even know what mine is .","299554":"what s dishonorable ? ?","299555":"it only equals out to cents per can .","299556":"like molasses cookies ? ? i ve never tried them before .","299557":"call me a stupid hipster idc , i just bought two packs of peach la croix for and it s my favorite flavor i m so happy .","299558":"i think it s sad that dark skinned people feel pressure to lighten their skin because of expectations from society , which is due in part to what i mentioned before about european features being seen as the most attractive . obviously i m not going to judge a person for using those products because to each their own , but the reason why they even exist to begin with seems racist to me .","299559":"do you still have a question then ? ?","299560":"no , i don t . not unless i know who they are .","299561":"why did you copy the question of the day , rofl . regardless no , i don t agree with the statement . love can last years , decades even , as long as both people put in the work to allow the relationship to flourish and have effective communication to make things better . if you view your relationship as a habit , then that s an indication that you don t feel as deeply for your partner as you should and perhaps it s time to move on . you shouldn t stay in a relationship for the mere sake of being in a relationship .","299562":"depends on whether or not the criticism is warranted . if it s warranted or i m asking for constructive criticism , then i ll take the opinion into consideration because it s always good to view things from a different angle . however , if it isn t warranted , then i usually just ignore it .","299563":"yeah , most beauty products in particular are catered toward light skinned people . i only know of a small number of companies that actually have a diverse product range for dark skinned people . in addition , society in general views light skinned , european looking people as more beautiful . there isn t as much representation of dark skinned people as there should be .","299564":"perhaps ! ! i mainly find books online based on recommendations and descriptions anyway . i can t remember the last time i went to a bookstore and browsed the aisles , haha .","299565":"yeah , i recently came to that conclusion about a certain friend of mine . he only reaches out to my boyfriend and i when he needs something and never takes our opinions into consideration when we tell him that we re concerned about something he s doing . regardless of how often we ve told him , he never acknowledges that he did something wrong . it s gotten to the point where telling him again isn t going to change anything , so we ve been distancing ourselves from him .","299566":"yeah , that s another reason why i decide not to say anything because i don t want them to think i m just being nosey , haha . although sometimes i ll offer my ear and tell them , if you need to talk , my inbox is always open just to let them know that i m thinking about them .","299567":"yes , all the time ! ! particularly when i don t talk to a person often but i m genuinely concerned with how they re doing . sometimes i ll reach out to them on other social media sites if i see that they re doing bad , though .","299568":"i haven t painted or drawn in a really long time . it also doesn t help that i have no idea where i put my paint or brushes , haha . the last time i painted was a few months ago , it was a silhouette of a tree with a swing and a sunset background . i didn t like the way it turned out , so i never finished it . i think my creativity does play a role in deciding my outfits in particular because i have a good sense of which colors complement each other .","299569":"i absolutely love personalized questions that pertain to my life questions that ask about my relationships , my career path , my former education , my interests and hobbies , etc etc . don t get me wrong , i also love spam questions as well , but it feels nice when someone asks how i m doing or how my day is going , as well as things personalized to my life in particular .","299570":"probably cheeseburgers , lol . i think a lot of people from other countries think of things like cheeseburgers and hot dogs as american cuisine , even though there are a lot of other cuisines which are catered to american tradition while incorporating other cultures .","299571":"all of the prayer cards i ve acquired throughout the years have the most interesting , albeit sad , stories . they re remembrances of loved ones who have passed away and they contain memories of not only who they were as an individual , but the interconnection between everyone who showed up at the funeral services . everyone came together during a difficult time to support each other .","299572":"i honestly believe it can be both . social media is a wonderful way to connect with like minded individuals from across the globe and make friends , and it s often a useful means of communication and socialization for those who don t really do well in real life situations . however , at the same time , it has the potential to encourage real life isolation if a person spends too much time on social media .","299573":"i think it ultimately depends on what those views are . if someone is being willingly oppressive toward a group of people , i . e . if they re transphobic , ableist , homophobic , or racist , then i won t feel comfortable being friends with them because it directly discriminates against a group of people . however , if someone has varying political opinions from me , then i don t believe that s a big deal at all .","299574":"nah , not really . however , i do think that most bits of information can be useful depending on the situation . even random facts about animals i . e . , a fish will only grow as big as the tank its in can be useful to people who own animals or are in an industry where they deal with animals on a regular basis .","299575":"i don t really have any guilty pleasures because i m generally not ashamed of what i enjoy . however , i can t help but admit that thank you , next by ariana grande is seriously catchy . it s nowhere close to the type of music i listen to , but i really like it .","299576":"lestat from the vampire chronicles both movies books smells , in my personal opinion , like worn leather , tobacco , and spices , with a hint of fresh blood .","299577":"assuming that i can retain my current age while traveling back in time , i think i would want to visit the s or s because of the music . there are so many bands i would have loved to see perform live that don t exist anymore in today s age .","299578":"well , my day has just started considering i only woke up about an hour ago . however , the best part of yesterday was seeing my boyfriend in the afternoon and evening . i relaxed with a drink , and we were watching funny videos on youtube for about an hour or so before we switched to some music .","299579":"i ve never used a subscription box before , no . however , i have started with their free trials then canceled the subscription after receiving the box , lol . my boyfriend has a subscription box to some website , though . i m not sure what it is , but they send him a box of gadgets and other things relevant to his interests every month for pretty cheap . last month , he got a really nice knife , a monthly planner , a time turner , and a few other things . when he first started the subscription , they gave him really nice beard oil , brushes , shaving cream , and a razor .","299580":"i don t watch commercials , so i really have no clue which one would be the best .","299581":"that s basically what i meant , lol . i didn t mean start my life over in a literal sense .","299582":"i m not sure if it s illegal or not , but why wouldn t you . . . ? ?","299583":"i have the low battery emoji because i m in a constant state of exhaustion .","299584":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","299585":"that s the general plan for the next few years , yes . i want to move down south and start my life over .","299586":"i ve talked to a few people and it isn t a mistake . apparently it has something to do with trump s tax laws from everyone else i know either didn t get much back at all or owes a lot of money to the irs .","299587":"i always return to playing skyrim and fallout . they re both my all time favorite games .","299588":"i suppose , lol . i mean , i m happy that i didn t end up owing more money than i got refunded . but last year , i got hundreds of dollars . this year . . . ? ? am i being punk d ? ?","299589":"yeah , that s how it works . i ve claimed the same number every year though , so idk why it s different . unless some new tax law passed that i m unsure of , ugh .","299590":"i do them myself using the same program i ve always used . i haven t changed anything with my withholdings and my income is exactly the same as it was last year . the only difference is the freelance work , but that only deducted less than from my refund , which isn t a big deal . but i owed money to the state , which is why it only equals out to overall .","299591":"i m getting back . that s literally it . like . . . did something happen this year or am i just really unlucky ? ?","299592":"tax season this year is a fucking joke . i m so angry .","299593":"criminal minds will always be one of my top favorites .","299594":"these days , yes . i can tell when a person is trying to manipulate me or someone else . however , in the past , i wasn t as cognizant of the concept as much as i am now .","299595":"you re anonymous and i have no clue who you are . also , sending this out to mass amounts of people may be seen as needy and irritating to some .","299596":"i ve never heard of it before .","299597":"lmfao since when .","299598":"i like both of them for different reasons .","299599":"i m already grown up and working in my field of study .","299600":"as my bio indicates , i m years old .","299601":"australia , new zealand , england , spain , the caribbean , etc etc . i also want to see alaska and the grand canyon . they all just seem like interesting and diverse places .","299602":"i don t have an ultimate favorite song , but lately i ve been listening to beggar s song by matt maeson a lot .","299603":"my strongest fear is my fear of abandonment . i m always terrified that my boyfriend or close friends are actually fed up with me and will leave .","299604":"i have a lot of favorite shows how i met your mother , parks and rec , criminal minds , ncis , supernatural , the x files , ghost adventures , etc etc .","299605":"not very late . the latest i ll wake up is around am because that s sleeping in for me .","299606":"thank you and i do wish you luck . i m sure you ll be able to overcome it once you re in a stable position in life .","299607":"i normally don t have plans on the weekend at all to begin with , besides sometimes seeing my boyfriend when he s not working . normally i just play it by ear , though . a majority of my weekly plans are spontaneous anyway because i can t guarantee i ll be up to seeing people if i make plans in advance .","299608":"i like saturdays the best . it s the day where i get to sleep in , and i normally don t have much to do except freelance work and laundry . it s also a productive , yet relaxing day , so i feel accomplished while not being stressed out .","299609":"by friday afternoon , i m normally mentally fried and physically exhausted . working five days in a row is a lot for me to handle a lot of the time , especially considering my job makes me exert a significant amount of mental energy .","299610":"my weekends begin on friday night ! ! although is it technically still a weekend if i work from home on saturdays and sundays ? ? lol .","299611":"over time , i realized that their words don t hold power over me as long as i remember that i m more than what they think of me . i m still in an environment where i deal with emotional harassment from time to time , so it isn t something i m completely over .","299612":"yeah , i was in the past .","299613":"i don t care about other people s opinions .","299614":"sometimes , but i only usually watch docu series on netflix .","299615":"depends on how social i have to be , lol . i need alone time after spending time with other people , but i m usually fine if i m only around or people at the most . however , if by social you mean being around a large crowd of people , then i would rather be alone .","299616":"i m listening to the elder scrolls v skyrim soundtrack because it helps me while i write . as for my job , i m a writer and editor for a publishing company .","299617":"hello i m doing well . at the moment , i m just listening to music and working on some freelance assignments for my job for extra cash .","299618":"depends on the outfit . sometimes i roll up my jeans to my ankles and wear short boots , while other times i wear long boots over my jeans .","299619":"happy saturday ! ! nothing is new with me at all . i m just going about my normal saturday routine of ingesting gallons of coffee and working on some freelance assignments for my job . i woke up at am for some ungodly reason , so i ve been making the most out of it .","299620":"because he yells at everyone and insults them . even though it s amusing on television , it would probably be nerve wracking in real life .","299621":"boots . i don t wear heels .","299622":"no , not yet . i m probably going to dunkin after i finish up this one assignment that i m currently writing , lol . i ve been craving iced coffee since i had one yesterday morning .","299623":"i know it s super early it s not even am on the east coast of the united states , but if anyone is awake , i would appreciate your questions ! !","299624":"i m grateful for my best friend for sticking my me during my lowest points and being a source of unconditional love and support when my mental health was worsening . i m also proud of her for persisting through her endeavors , both personal and professional , despite enduring several hardships along the way , ranging from chronic illness to death and everything in between . she s always been a source of inspiration for me .","299625":"i already have a boyfriend , so i ll just list his qualities that i like he s passionate about the things he cares about , he s incredibly hard working and will go above and beyond expectations , he s knowledgeable about a variety of things , he s very open and communicates his feelings well , he doesn t sugarcoat the truth and tells you how it is , he s creative and often paints and writes , he has a terrific taste in music , and we have the same sense of humor .","299626":"i don t believe it s new , nor is it a trend . when it comes to things like abvse or assault , then you should believe the victims up until evidence comes out stating otherwise . if there s factual and scientific evidence proving the contrary , then obviously the victim was lying . but when there isn t evidence at all then it s right to think that the victim is telling the truth , especially considering the small fraction of people there are who are lying about abvse .","299627":"i guess technically yes but who cares ? ? if you need help with a game , then you have the freedom to look up how to beat it or get an achievement . i ve done that with certain things as well .","299628":"i don t have a photo of that . it was just things like milk , rolls , butter , and coffee creamer .","299629":"of course honestly , he would probably give me an anxiety attack , rofl .","299630":"i m five feet tall .","299631":"no , i believe i only started getting your questions today or within the past week from what i remember .","299632":"i don t have any pets , unfortunately . however , i do want to adopt a lot of dogs and keep a few fish tanks . i also love lizards , and i expect my boyfriend s bearded dragon will be around for quite a while .","299633":"you or someone else asked me this question a few days ago , and my answer was that i didn t know enough about the case to have an opinion . i know a documentary recently came out regarding the topic , but i haven t watched it yet .","299634":"i m going to be bored for the rest of the night , so you guys should ask me things to keep me entertained ! !","299635":"deciding to stick through with college , even though i was severely depressed at the time and wanted nothing more than to drop out . it s because of my college degree that i ve been able to have these great job opportunities which have turned my life for the better lately they have provided a sense of routine and stability for me .","299636":"i believe in assisted s icide , but only in cases of terminally ill patients . i believe people should be given the right to die on their own terms in such cases , and it should also be regulated strictly on a case by case basis . princess tal also raised a good point about the mentally ill mental illness isn t a terminal diagnosis so i don t believe those with just mental illness should qualify for assisted s icide .","299637":"i honestly have no idea . i must have been around years old , so perhaps in .","299638":"no , i haven t used myspace since high school , lol . i think i stopped using it around or so .","299639":"yeah , i was active on myspace for several years .","299640":"my friday hasn t been so great thus far . i developed a stomach ache and a migraine halfway throughout the day , so i ended up sleeping away most of the afternoon to try to ward them off . i have no intentions of going to a party , and honestly , i can t remember the last time i actually did . if anything , i might be relaxing at my boyfriend s house tonight .","299641":"in the past , i accidentally would refer to people as their wrong pronouns because i simply wasn t aware of the importance of pronouns when i was much younger . in the same vein , i also try to signify the importance of prefixes , especially when speaking with clients . many of the clients who purchase products through my company are doctors , so it s important to be aware of their credentials . as for my own pronouns , i go by they them .","299642":"what does international women s day have to do with this answer ? ? rofl . i can appreciate what women have done in society to advance the progression of science , medicine and the arts without being a woman myself .","299643":"lol , no . i don t feel bad for teenagers who never experienced that . if anything , it s so much easier to listen to music now with all of the various streaming services , like apple music and spotify . and in most cases , it s also easier to find new artists as well . i think technology has really stepped up in terms of that because it s become so much easier to listen to and share music .","299644":"neither i feel like my actual age . when i was younger , i often felt older than my age because i was more mature than my peers . but these days , there isn t really much more maturity i can have considering i m years old .","299645":"i ve had a stomach ache and migraine all day , even though i felt fine when i woke up this morning . it got worse as time progressed so i ended up trying to sleep it off which actually somewhat helped , lol .","299646":"sometimes , but i try not to regret actions like those . if i m doing something nice for someone and they don t express gratitude , then that s a reflection of them , not me . the only thing i can do is continue being the best person i can be , and if someone doesn t appreciate that , then they don t deserve to be in my life .","299647":"pride , i suppose . i completed a batch of new orders at work last week for the first time i . e . compiling them and sending them all to clients , and my supervisor said i did everything correctly , so that made me feel proud of myself .","299648":"autumn is my favorite season . i like the chilly air , the falling leaves , and halloween .","299649":"the only museums i know of are in manhattan . i can t remember the last time i went to a museum , though .","299650":"i m honestly not sure . it just allowed me to do it a few months ago when i wanted to add an emoji there . they might only accept certain emojis , but i m not entirely sure .","299651":"i m not a fan of cars in general , so it doesn t much matter to me . as long as a car drives and is comfortable , then i don t care what make or model it is .","299652":"i don t really know how much car insurance is elsewhere , so i have no basis for comparison , lol . i m sure it s undoubtedly more expensive in new york , though .","299653":"i don t personally see the problem with it . my boyfriend and i share the bathroom all the time . however , not everyone is going to obviously feel the same way . and it ultimately depends on each relationship and what works best for them .","299654":"on askfm in particular , some anons try to convince me that i m a woman , even though they clearly don t know me at all or have gone through my experiences which have led me to determine that i m non binary . it s silly above all else . if i m steadfast about something regarding myself then an anonymous stranger on the internet isn t going to lead me to believe otherwise .","299655":"i don t believe my stance will ever change on abortion . people have the right to decide what to do with their own bodies , and they deserve the freedom to choose what they want to do with an unwanted pregnancy .","299656":"no , not at all . two years ago , i was severely depressed svicidal , i was stuck in a job that made me cry nearly every day , and i was friends with people who didn t care about the friendship to the same degree that i did . since then , i ve gotten professional treatment for my mental health , got a new job , and dropped old friends who didn t contribute to my life at all .","299657":"girl interrupted by susanna kaysen . interview with the vampire by anne rice . the shining by stephen king . i am not a serial killer by dan wells . my mind is going blank rn , so those are the only ones i can remember .","299658":"i don t love anything about my city , lol . i like how there s a gas station within walking distance from my house , but that s basically it .","299659":"i don t have any real plans . i m intending to see my boyfriend tonight into tomorrow morning , and then the rest of the weekend will be spent working , doing laundry , making phone calls , and doing my taxes .","299660":"moral of the story by watsky . https youtu . be uoaz cvaaec","299661":"not generally , no . i try to avoid most people at all costs .","299662":"i feel horrible , so i ve been sleeping on and off all afternoon . i just got up to make myself a sandwich because i haven t eaten in nine hours . i m hoping to see my boyfriend tonight , but idk when that will be .","299663":"thanks i prefer coke , simply because they have vanilla and cherry flavors , lol . however , i seldom drink soda as it is .","299664":"this doesn t happen with all girls , and it certainly can happen with men too . however , it normally happens when a person is too trusting of their potential date or become too emotionally invested in their date before anything can be finalized .","299665":"nope . that s why it would be devastating to me if i lost my files somehow someone previously asked me a question regarding what i would save in a fire . i ve been meaning to transfer everything to google docs but i haven t done so yet .","299666":"i have them all saved on my laptop . that s where i usually write them .","299667":"lol , no . unfortunately , i ve never met shehitsback .","299668":"beer , particularly fat tire .","299669":"considering how drunk i am right now , i think it s amazing too .","299670":"i m not sure . i m not close to my parents in that way .","299671":"my father is , but my mother isn t .","299672":"i live with my parents . they use the landline phone .","299673":"i don t use my landline phone . i always use my cell phone for communication .","299674":"that s literally what i just said .","299675":"the only one i have samsung galaxy s .","299676":"not really , no . the only opinions i care about are those of my boyfriend and my best friend .","299677":"yes , there s a landline at my house .","299678":"yeah , i m still awake .","299679":"lol . if anything , i m all soul . i have way too many emotions to be classified as a robot .","299680":"my inbox is empty y all should send me questions ! !","299681":"i grew up during the s , so that doesn t surprise me .","299682":"i remember watching thundercats , rocket power , catdog , and dexter s laboratory when i was younger .","299683":"lol . no , i can t build virtually anything . i don t have a mechanical brain like that .","299684":"the alexa doesn t set your phone . the alexa is its own separate device . but people use it for convenience , it s a lot easier to set verbal reminders , alarms , music settings , news settings , etc etc . , as opposed to manually entering it all into a smartphone .","299685":"i don t sugarcoat things , so if you re looking for someone to cover up the truth just to comfort you , then i m not the right person for the job . i tell my friends situations as they exactly are , and when their behavior is wrong . i value honesty above all else and i believe people deserve to know the truth regardless of how much it might hurt .","299686":"no , i don t believe the dog should be euthanized . the child put a sock over his arm and stuck his arm beneath the fence . the dog didn t know that it was a human arm to his perspective , it looked exactly like a toy . in addition , the owners said it was his first bite incident , and normally the dog is incredibly docile . you can t blame an animal for acting on its instincts when confronted with a situation like that . it goes along the same lines as knowing not to annoy an animal , and teaching your children not to poke or prod or climb all over an animal .","299687":"yeah , you can do basically everything an alexa echo can do with a smartphone . on the phone , it s just manual .","299688":"you can play music , see the weather for the day or upcoming week , have the news read to you , set alarms and reminders , etc etc . i don t have one personally , so i m not sure what all of the benefits are .","299689":"i don t encounter artificial intelligence in any aspect of my life , as far as i m aware . the only thing i can think of is the alexa echo that my boyfriend and i use when i m at his house . it s convenient because we mostly use it to play music , so we just have to say the song out loud and it ll start playing .","299690":"there s no show movie game etc etc . out there that s for everyone . people will always have their different interests and standards .","299691":"no . that seems rather pointless and impossible , at any rate .","299692":"this is my current dilemma i honestly have no clue . if i had a topic to write about , then i would be writing about the topic at this moment . however , after i ve written a significant piece , my brain sorta fries out and i develop writer s block again until another idea miraculously comes to me .","299693":"the year is still fairly young we re only two months into the year thus far . i don t know if i ve grown particularly in at all , but i have developed a better handle on my personal and professional lives .","299694":"i suppose my other biggest source of advocacy is freedom of expression through art , whether that art form is painting , drawing , music , writing , sculpture , etc etc . the arts have been incredibly important to me growing up and i will always invest my time and efforts into making people realize that those are still noble professions to pursue .","299695":"i thought you was a compelling , psychological and thrilling show . it certainly isn t for everyone , since i know a few people who didn t like the show at all . however , i liked the mind twisting aspects of it there were points where you began to sympathize with the main character until you snap yourself to reality and realize , wait , no . he s the villain here . i m excited for season two , even though i m fairly certain nobody knows when it s coming out .","299696":"i believe that may be a large component of it , yes . some people try to move on from previous relationships without completely getting over their ex , which may cause issues when pursuing new relationships . there s this comparison between their ex and their new date , and sometimes people unconsciously judge their new date based on how their ex would behave .","299697":"i m an omnivert i m extroverted in low stimulating environments , but introverted in high stimulating environments . i . e . when i m alone or with one person , i m more apt to be social , talkative , and open . however , when i m with a large group of people or in a crowd , then i m closed off and quiet .","299698":"i would probably save my laptop . it has all of my work , writing , and photos on it . i would be devastated if i lost everything .","299699":"your guess is as good as mine , my friend . while i tolerate myself , i don t believe i can genuinely say that i love myself ."}}
