Working with many tools. Going to alot of locations, dealing with many different cases, different histories in areas and places and what happened there. I've just worked alot with it for years and years. Helping guide people. Just many different levels of it all. I enjoy it.\n  \n  Singing. I've been singing since I was about 4-5 years old. I'm very passionate about it. I've sang for many different places, events, bars, churches, games, colleges, schools, and other different events. I even let a church choir for about 2 years. I love to sing. I enjoy giving tips and stuff. I also enjoyed taking tips from other people. Hearing other people's different ways of singing. For the longest I was going to go on American Idol but it's just so much money. So many things you have to do. I may consider doing it Monday but not right now in my life. I also enjoy watching many different singing shows also. I took a big interest in singing.\n  \n  Volleyball is another one that I'm really good at. I play volleyball for about six or seven years. Two of those years I was team captain. I hope take a lot of people different things with volleyball. I really like doing that. One day I maybe we'll get into coaching on that.\n  \n  There's a lot of things that I wish I could learn a lot more in. I want to learn more about cars, blacksmithing and way more about art.

I absolutely love being creative. It brings the best side in me my creativity side. But I really want to get into Carpenter anymore. I feel that I need more practice in that.

Jealous plays sometimes a bug role in whisper gossip talk. Sometimes people whisper it because maybe they are afraid that the person they are talking about might hear them and the person they are talking about might show them what's up? Prove then wrong. Catch them. Because most of the time when people are gossiping whispering. More than 90% of the time.... it is a lie. But then again that's not always the case. Sometimes it is true but the thing about it is... why can't we all just mind our own business? and worry about ourselves? That's the point at the end of the day. Worry about you. Focus on you and not more or less on others. Let them learn.\n  ","40944":"\n  I honestly never really got into that show too much.

This person absolutely loves peanut butter and jelly sandwiches but randomly became allergic to peanuts somehow.

I've had multiple people around me witness the same things and the kind of all looked at each other and question of what it was. Considering it so unexplainable.  I mean I've witnessed thousands of things.. A ton..  We've seen doors open and close in front of us. When there is nothing there no wind no force. We sit there trying to figure out what could have made it move but nothing. Me and a few people will be sitting in a room and then get up and go in the other room and come back into that room and things have been moved around that no one touched originally. This happens a lot. Hearing groups of people talking and there's no one there. This is just a few things of many. I've had friends get attacked randomly and nothing was touching them they never bumped their arm or has someone hit them just miraculously had scratches all over  or burns or may have been touched or shoved. Start to feel choked. The paranormal world is very confusing and interesting. Leaves you on wonder to what could be there. We tried to ignore but sometimes it's hard to ignore it when it's trying so hard to let us know that it's there. Some people experience it it while others don't. It's kind of just random.\n  \n  And it's okay to be a skeptic. I have no problem with people that don't believe in it or maybe just don't see anything in it because they haven't seen anything happen before.

You don't know me know me. What I do and what I wear on a day to day basis. Who I hang out and who I have grown up around and how.\n  \n  My whole life growing up I played football with the guys on their team. Was pretty much the only girl playing. And if there was another girl she would usually quit or only play for one day because she didn't want to keep playing because they would either be too rough or it would be too muddy or she wanted to hang out with the girls. Used to tackle and get covered in mud and everything. Loved this. I still do this. I fish. I hunt. Love working on vehicles. I love to build things and go bike riding and 4-wheeler riding. And at times I do love chilling and being a girl because I'm a girl. At the end of the day. Yeah I look cute and pretty and girly in some of my pics because I like that too because I am a girl. But being a tomboy does not mean you have to always look like one and always have to act like one. It's how you been raised and what you were raised around. I was raised out on the countryside and out on the Bayou.\n  \n  My whole life growing up I was raised around boys and guy friends. Girls and other tomboys. We used to wrestle and fight and teach each other how to defend ourselves. Jump on trampolines. Play street ball and build our own fields and club houses out of things out of trash. Sometimes still do this when I have the time. Get outside and sometimes just dig a hole just to get dirty. Just now I chased my dogs all the way across the yard and got covered in mud. I have to come inside and clean up and now I'm laying down because I'm cold from the water. But I had a blast. Tomboy from the heart. Always will be. It's in my roots.\n  ","41357":"\n  Nope.

The one that I mostly recommend would have to be the hydrogen peroxide one. You could probably add a little bit more water to it ( just make sure that the water is warm. Super super hot. It will soothe your throat) and what I said but just don't add more than 1\/4 cup of water maybe. But you can do the ricola cough drops the one with the medicine that numbs your throat in them. I would take those as your throat hurts. And then spray the Chloraseptic continuously ( get a flavor that you like. I think they have cherry and spearmint and mint and Bubblegum) in your throat as the day goes so it numbs your throat. Suck on cough drops to numb and and mints. Then when you come home I would so the step with the honey and tea and bourbon. And then right before you go to sleep I would do the little gargling and stuff but make (with the hydrogen peroxide again) sure you don't eat or drink and lay down immediately after. The remaining hydrogen peroxide that touched your throat will soothe your throat and make it better. I would try this combination throughout your day of things. It will keep your throat painless and it will help speed up the process of getting better. This is what I do when I have a sore throat and it usually helps. You're more than welcome. I don't like sore throats either so that's why I try to help others when they are sick. I got these remedies from other people by the way they're not just one that I made up.\n  ","41369":"\n  ??\n  ","41370":"\n  Your words are amazing! Thank you kindly! You have an amazing dang! And same back to you also!\n  ","41371":"\n  ? A house.\n  ","41372":"\n  Get plenty of rest\n  \n  Drink fluids\n  \n  Try comforting foods and beverages\n  \n  Number one thing to gargle is hydrogen peroxide (add just 3 tablespoons), warm water (6 tablespoons) mint mouthwash (the type of mouthwash that doesn't have alcohol in it) (3 tablespoon) and a little bit of salt the mix together and gargle 3x times (make sure all of this is warm) gargle that and then do not drink or eat for 30 minutes, usually lay down for an hour, maybe take a nap after. This helps to attack the acids that are hurting your throat. Will speed uo the sore part process. DO NOT SWALLOW THIS. Usually take this at the beginning of the sore throat and do about three times of day. Do not do too much or it may irritate it too much.\n  \n  Then you can....\n  \n  Gargle with salt water\n  \n  Humidify the air where you were at\n  \n  Consider lozenges or hard candy (helps numb pain)\n  \n  Get Chloraseptic spray (helps numb pain)\n  \n  Take some medications too\n  \n  Like Benadryl or Tylenol\n  \n  Warm tea mixed with honey and sometimes people add a little bit of bourbon to it to help numb and soothe throat.\n  \n  Any types of salt water.

Because if the water that were drinking out of the faucet isn't clean then how are we supposed to stay hydrated. Besides just going to the store and getting bottled water, what happens if this runs out? This opportunity? What happens if a lot of meat starts going bad and then we have to go to the store to buy some but they don't have any? It's important to hunt and to remember this skill. Because sometimes you got to do it to survive. What happens if a small apocalypse does breakout? We need to go to protect ourselves and help one another. What happens if all the bodies of water become contaminated and we can't go swimming in it at all. Then we just can't go swimming anymore. It's important if we make sure that our environment is clean and we take care of it.\n  ","41384":"\n  Yeah, sometimes I do this.

It is good for everyone to be a little social in their life. It helps stretch your communication skills. It helps with your comprehension and handling certain situations also. You do not want to be completely unsocial. Cuz I promise you... it's not healthy.... But if you don't really favor having conversations with people on a daily basis there's nothing wrong with that. You just don't prefer that. And you don't have to do it everyday all day. Even calling someone on the phone for 10 minutes is healthy and good for you. But some people are more shy than others. Some people just don't like people. But if you are the second one I would honestly try to stretch your social skills when you get the chance.

It can attack your skin and if it gets in your bloodstream, it can kill you.

Unless of course, you see that person about to embarrass themselves then you pull them to the side and talk to them one-on-one better than embarrassing them in public and going ahead and just doing the complete opposite of what should be done.\n  \n  But you don't need to judge people like as in just because you see someone dressing scary you automatically assume that they might be dangerous or a bad person. That's not always the case because I used to be like that and I was nice I wasn't mean. When people got to know me they saw a different side of what they thought. Don't be so quick to judge because judging a book by it's cover one and you go to read it it's a completely different thing.\n  \n  Or a name of a song.

Hey\n  ","41682":"\n  Basically when you have a fever obviously your body temperature is higher than normal. You are warm inside so of course the outside of you would be cold and you feel that you are cold because it is your skin, the surface of your body that is cold. You do not want to bundle up and you can put a towel on your head but... it doesn't really mean it's going to reduce your fever but if you more or less try to drink cold fluids that is getting the inside of your body temperature to go down some. Yes I guess sweating out the temperature could be better but honestly sometimes people temperature just keeps getting higher. Medications and Tylenol and fever reducers or what you should turn to. Try to figure out what your body is lacking such as Vitamin C. Stay hydrated. Take showers. But under any circumstances don't bundle up because then you're just making the surface temperature of your skin hot too and that is honestly just making things worse. Even though you feel cold does it mean that you are really cold.\n  \n  Ex: Have you ever went into a pool and swim for a good while and it was cold in the pool but your body or your skin adapted to the temperature in the pool with the new you want to the restroom it felt like when you pee it was hot because the inside of you is actually hotter than the surface of your skin.\n  \n  This is a good example of how my statement becomes true and what I said about you feeling like you're cold but you're not really. Either your body is the regular temperature or can be hotter. It just all depends. At the end of the day you should do a lot of research if you are sick and you're trying to figure out how to get better or really just visit your doctor and they can help you. And you don't have to do the research or take risks and doing the wrong research and waiting longer to get better.\n  ","41683":"\n  ??\n  ","41684":"\n  When they are around, not around. Whenever.
