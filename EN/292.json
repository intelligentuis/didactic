that s friends or family or a therapist . continue living your daily life , and try to keep in mind that you existed before that person , and therefore , you can exist after them . it also helped me a

and i always live every day with anxiety , paranoid thoughts , and the occasional flashback , among other symptoms . the only times i feel like i m free are when i m under the influence .","270392":"unconditional love wouldn t make you trade anything or compromise anything that s already beneficial to your life .","270393":"my day has been fine . i woke up extremely tired because i had a late night zoom session with two of my coworkers whom i haven t seen since march , and we were all high and talking until like am , haha . i worked my regular shift at work , ate dinner , fed the cats , did some dishes , and watched supernatural for a little while . now i m on my laptop and i m determined to write a few thousand words before i go to bed tonight .","270394":"i think it s ridiculous that it s easier to obtain a gun in the united states than to apply for disability or get decent health care .","270395":"basically half of the candles i own , lol . i have so many candles but i pick favorites , so i burn all of those instead .","270396":"being happy with yourself and your life , regardless of what that life looks like .","270397":"the stigma against complex mental illnesses .","270398":"i believe it s worse to make mistakes with the clear knowledge that what you re doing is a mistake . at least when you re unaware that you re actually making a mistake , you can be educated and corrected . when you willingly make a mistake , or you simply don t care about the consequences , then that s pretty terrible .","270399":"i read somewhere that it s simply the result of brain chemistry misfiring .","270400":"kinda along the same lines as courtneyuwu s answer , but i once got so angry as a teenager that i ripped my closet door off of its hinges . that was fun trying to explain that to my parents .","270401":"yeah , my anxiety causes chronic nail biting and skin picking .","270402":"i overthink everything , haha .","270403":"yeah , i mean you could try uninstalling and reinstalling the app just in case , but chances are it s the game itself .","270404":"it honestly may be the servers , millions of people play among us every day and sometimes it takes like minutes for my friends and i to secure a private server at night . i haven t played in a while , but the last time i played , i noticed a few glitches so it could just be the game itself .","270405":"lol . what s the problem ?","270406":"a month of rain i love snow just as much , but i m more comfortable driving in the rain as opposed to the snow .","270407":"depression","270408":"yeah , that s pretty immature and silly . who cares about what other people wear .","270409":"people have the freedom to express their opinions regardless of their internet popularity . they re still human , and in the grand scheme of things , how many likes or followers someone has doesn t mean a damn thing .","270410":"ugh , that sounds terrible . december isn t very much away , so perhaps you d benefit from trying to set up a consistent sleep schedule in preparation for going back to work like setting an alarm every morning and trying to go to bed kinda around the same time every night .","270411":"lol , yeah that happens to me on occasion . yesterday , i woke up around am or so and stayed awake until am last night . my sleep schedule is consistent most of the time , but not all the time .","270412":"yeah , that wasn t very long ago .","270413":"parents can obviously give advice and show concern regardless of their child s age . but for the sibling to basically run to their mother and tell her to talk to the other sibling might result in a confrontation where the pregnant sister becomes offended , and her behavior might get worse . that s why i suggested that the anon talk to their sister themselves . the pregnant sister may be more receptive than going through a third party .","270414":"absolutely not , rofl . that would scare the sh t out of me .","270415":"the truth is always better regardless of how uncomfortable it may make you feel . regardless , all lies come out to the truth anyway it s better to know the truth as it happened rather than finding out much later .","270416":"i mean , your sister is a grown adult , and as harmful as her decisions are , telling your mother to talk to her will probably result in an unfavorable outcome because of the fact that your sister is an adult . try talking to your sister yourself and saying you re concerned about not only the baby s health , but her health as well . smoking and drinking is extremely harmful to fetuses .","270417":"my friendships .","270418":"i m doing fine at the moment . i just finished up with work i had a snack , and now i m debating on whether i want to try writing something , watch television , or play video games .","270419":"yes , that s correct .","270420":"no , i m pretty much a recluse in my house at this point

stuff .","270422":"my nails are bitten to the quick , they look gross , rofl .","270423":"i was only an infant when he was the mayor , lol .","270424":"i m obsessed , rofl . it s been my favorite flavor for such a long time , probably because i love the cookie dough chunks . ben jerrys has the best one .","270425":"ice cream chocolate chip cookie dough . liquor tequila .","270426":"not only his comments but also the allegations evidence against him about sexually assaulting groping women . it s absolutely disgusting how people still support him , especially now those people who are in such denial about the election results that they re still chanting that trump is their president .","270427":"i don t remember my dreams of the time , so unfortunately i don t have an answer to this .","270428":"thank you","270429":"my friends opinions are most important to me . i don t really care about what others think of me other than those friends .","270430":"publish a book , travel to europe , and adopt a lot of pets .","270431":"i d rather take a pill never eat again .","270432":"my pronouns are in my bio .","270433":"this is also extremely true ! !","270434":"i m sure there are many meanings to it that s just the first thing i thought of .","270435":"i don t really watch reality television shows , but i used to like all of those tattoo shows back when i was in high school late s .","270436":"it honestly makes me think that a lot of those women have internalized misogyny or they cater to their male counterparts , which further details the differences in sexes and gender equity in america .","270437":"nope , lmaoo . that s what my mechanic is for .","270438":"thankfully , no . i ve been too paranoid throughout my years of driving to come that close to a low tank .","270439":"bacon , lettuce , tomato , cheese , and avocado .","270440":"i know a few people like that , yes . it s extremely difficult to get them to open up and view other possibilities

like a disaster .","270449":"i ve been to a baseball game and an ice hockey game .","270450":"probably at some point , yeah .","270451":"my week has been fine , though it is only monday , haha . yesterday , i saw my parents to celebrate my birthday , which thankfully went pretty well no arguments , awkward moments , or nosy behavior . i stayed there for dinner and dessert , and then went home . today was a regular work day , and then i had a therapy session afterwards . i just finished eating dinner now i m laying in bed with a glass of wine and i m about to put on television .","270452":"i m doing fine , just relaxing in bed and i m about to put on some television .","270453":"this sounds like it s a quote from something that i m not aware of .","270454":"that too , yeah .","270455":"uh , the idea that you re dealing with someone who struggles with bipolar disorder sounds a bit arrogant and ableist , not gonna lie . people with bipolar disorder aren t burdens , they require understanding . even still , everyone is different a person is more than just their illness , and it s up to you to talk to them about how you can help with if they re experiencing an episode .","270456":"i d rather live in a modern community . traditional communities , from my experience , have a tendency to not be very inclusive .","270457":"i d pick the guaranteed , . i wouldn t want to risk my chances .","270458":"i m an extremely heavy sleeper , especially if i ve been drinking or smoking .","270459":"what the f ck that s a really horrible joke and that was so rude a disrespectful for him to even say that in the first place . on another note , it is valid to break up with someone if you re even questioning it to begin with . everyone has their different goals and desires , and if you see marriage in your future and he doesn t , then that s going to cause problems later on when you definitely want to settle down . marriage is one of those things where both people would want to do it , otherwise it s one sided .","270460":"i ve unfortunately never seen any of his movies , but apparently hereditary and midsommar were both ridiculously good based on reviews from people i follow . i know midsommar is in netflix , i can easily watch that . idk about hereditary , though . i ll have to look into that more .","270461":"the cruise to the bahamas was really nice i got mild motion sickness because there was a storm one of the days , but laying on the beach with a tropical drink and seeing the crystal blue water was amazing .","270462":"the borat movies are hilarious to me , even though they re super offensive and controversial .","270463":"i don t have one , lol . i don t go to the store unless it s the pharmacy or the grocery store .","270464":"i don t have one , i just go to stop shop for my groceries because they carry everything i need .","270465":"i d like to adopt a dog one day .","270466":"for the most part . for lunch , i had a salad and then a cookie directly afterwards , lmaoo .","270467":"i like psychological thrillers and action movies . some of my favorites are the crow , american psycho , the shining , and lord of the rings . i also like musicals , lol . my two favorites are les miserables and sweeney todd .","270468":"in the living room , strangely .","270469":"i don t generally eat candy , but twix is pretty good .","270470":"my room is basically composed of all led lights , lmaoo . i never use the overhead light , i just put my led lights on at night .","270471":"i used to play pocket camp a few years ago when it came out on mobile , but otherwise no .","270472":"i ve reverted back to drinking coffee in the morning , so yeah . i usually have two cups .","270473":"unfortunately i haven t , but i have a lot of friends who

bought them .","270479":"basically two brothers who go out hunting supernatural creatures , it has its funny moments too .","270480":"i answered a question similar to this a little while ago , but the last thing that made me laugh was the show supernatural i m rewatching it and i watched a few episodes last night .","270481":"yes , i ve lost plenty of friends over the years for a variety of reasons . most of the time , it s because we all just simply grew apart from one another and moved on with our lives , while other times , it was because that friend was acting toxic or inappropriately towards me or others .","270482":"eh , probably not , although it depends on what that opportunity is . however , if it s regarding money i . e . winning the lottery then i would still work my regular job just to keep a routine schedule and keep myself busy .","270483":"i ve written plenty of letters before , although i can t remember the last time i wrote one .","270484":"i d continue working from home , or if that wasn t an option , then i would relocate the office closer to my house so i wouldn t have to spend minutes every morning night commuting .","270485":"yeah , we would make it work somehow , whether it s through us learning together how to cook better or just ordering takeout more often .","270486":"probably the best cook i ve ever met , considering i don t know how to cook well at all , haha .","270487":"thankfully , i do enjoy my job a lot it s within my field of choice and i like the actual work i do , as well as my coworkers . the only thing i would change is how upper management treats their employees . they can act ridiculously at times , especially now during covid .","270488":"i m re watching the show supernatural , and there were a few jokes in the episodes i was watching last night that made me chuckle .","270489":"either to europe or new zealand .","270490":"i got my direct deposit last friday .","270491":"chips spinach dip or queso . chicken nuggets barbeque sauce . pretty much anything else ranch .","270492":"i m easy to please , so i honestly like chain restaurants like applebee s and chili s , lol .","270493":"i don t know of any misconceptions about me , rofl . i m not exactly a person that others talk about .","270494":"nah , i ve got nothing to hide so there s no point in me using incognito mode .","270495":"not really , no . i find them to be interesting , but i don t really believe it all to be true .","270496":"sure , why not .","270497":"you ? by two feet . https youtu . be ipjmhjvgtzq","270498":"yes , i ve have paranormal experiences that i can t rationally explain .","270499":"thank you ! !","270500":"it was i spent maybe three hours with my parents and brother , which wasn t bad . my brother has a bunny , so a lot of the interactions was just talking about the bunny and then obviously celebrating my birthday . we ordered italian food for dinner i brought some pastries home . it wasn t a terrible night at all , nobody brought up anything bad or awkward thankfully .","270501":"i wouldn t say haunted , more like traumatized it s a more accurate term .","270502":"both .","270503":"i d rather live in the countryside as opposed to a major city .","270504":"this is kinda a question that doesn t really apply to me because i was ab sed by my parents , so . . .","270505":"i m not entirely sure still this honestly is what happened between me and my ex , and my ex lost feelings for me towards the end of the relationship regardless of how much we tried working through it . they just weren t there anymore , and i dont blame him for anything because i know it was out of his control , especially since we did try to work on it as best we could . it just happens sometimes .","270506":"i mean , chances are they did love you you re not a fool , but you won t know for certain until you two have a civil and mature discussion about it . sometimes people s feelings diminish over time it isn t necessarily a reflection of us . it also doesn t mean they never loved you during the time you were together either .","270507":"i ve had veggie burgers boca burgers ! before at this point , i prefer them over beef burgers . they re so delicious , especially paired with lettuce and tomato . i need to find a good vegan cheese alternative , though . i ve just been using real cheese on them .","270508":"i ve struggled with anxiety and depression way before i went to college i remember first experiencing anxiety depression when i was years old .","270509":"perhaps to be honest , i m not really educated enough on how new york has been impacted financially by covid .","270510":"sending a letter to your enemy that explodes with glitter when they open it , as well as sings this is the song that never ends , except there s no off switch to the song .","270511":"i like his music , but i don t know many of his songs . hold you in my arms is a good one , though .","270512":"i take a regular multivitamin and biotin every day biotin helps the strength and resilience of your hair , skin , and nails . i also sometimes take valerian root to help me sleep at night , b for energy , and htp for anxiety .","270513":"considering i ve been on the opposite end of this , as the person struggling with mental illness , i can assume that your girlfriend is likely aware of this and feels bad about it already , and she s probably unsure of what to do herself . if you haven t tried already , have an open discussion with her about these feelings and see if you two can create a plan for when she s in a bad place , i . e . doing things for her that may make her life easier while she s in an episode or just being there for her and caring when she needs it most . also , if she isn t already doing this , suggest therapy medication if that s something she s able to do . the combination of having medication and going to therapy does wonders for a lot of people with mental illness , especially bipolar disorder .","270514":"i can agree with this , yes . as you take on more responsibilities , you start to realize what s genuinely important in your life versus what is a bit insignificant in the long run , and you have to adjust accordingly . of course , this unfortunately does not apply to all adults as some adults are still quite immature and irresponsible .","270515":"early s alternative rock , emo , and pop punk .","270516":"yeah , until they give me a reason not to be nice anymore .","270517":"the covid pandemic is definitely the worst thing to happen in , considering the devastating impact it has had on the general population , between people passing away from it and their families not having the opportunity to even have a proper goodbye .","270518":"yeah , i volunteered for a few years when i was with my ex and we set up a basketball scholarship fund in honor of his late mother .","270519":"the idea of wearing a mask is that you re protecting other people not protecting yourself . therefore , if you don t wear a mask , then you evidently don t care about spreading covid or any other illness to other people should you have it .","270520":"no . the desired effect is what that person who is wearing makeup wants to do . there s no such thing as too much makeup , it s each person s individual decision to make and they re allowed to wear as much or as little makeup as they want .","270521":"no , i ve never tried cutting my own hair because i have zero experience with it i know i would regret it immediately .","270522":"yeah , i believe there can be multiple special people significant others for everyone . i ve never believed in the whole everyone has only one soulmate thing .","270523":"yes , although i honestly don t think i would do it anymore .","270524":"i don t think it s disrespectful they took the time to think of you purchase you something as a gift . it isn t the gift that matters in the end , it s the fact that they thought of you and went out of their way to give you something that they thought you would appreciate .","270525":"askfm , haha .","270526":"nobody is obligated to talk about anything , on the internet or otherwise , that they don t want to talk about . if someone doesn t feel comfortable discussing religion , then they have the freedom to express that . and just because you re on the internet doesn t mean that you re required to talk about everything about your life . some things are private for people that s perfectly okay .","270527":"yes , i went camping for the first time back in october ! ! it was super fun i would definitely do it again .","270528":"it s a bit on the warm side , and it was also drizzling when i was out earlier .","270529":"no , besides the nearly constant back pain that i experience . but it s been happening for so long that i ve become almost desensitived to it .","270530":"i shower in the middle of the day on my lunch break at work , rofl . however , before i started working from home , i showered at night .","270531":"i don t talk to isole outside of askfm , so you re asking the wrong person . anyway look at the new projector lights i got for my bedroom .","270532":"there s nothing that i know that other people don t already know .","270533":"in that case , criticism usually does happen but the best way to go about it is through constructive criticism which means offering a critique of your work or if you have a problematic opinion , as well as offering a solution on how to better yourself .","270534":"my friends ask me for advice every now and again , yes . usually related to job things or relationship problems .","270535":"no , i seldom dance when i do , it s always to music .","270536":"happiness in oneself .","270537":"depends on what is being criticized .","270538":"usually my family just orders italian food on holidays , lol .","270539":"i hate when anons go out of their way to speak about white people speaking about racism and how they hate white people or men in general , in general .","270540":"i totally failed nanowrimo this year , but that s okay . this is the furthest i ve gotten in the past two years i ve been participating i m up to , words . i m trying to get further , perhaps to , or even , words , this week but i can t seem to get into the groove right now . i have two unfinished short pieces of creative non fiction , but because i m not in the same mindset as i was when i first started writing them , it s difficult to get back into the swing of it .","270541":"i always let it dry naturally . i never have anywhere to go these days , so there s really no point in blow drying my hair .","270542":"i have zero idea , lol .","270543":"no , i m not .","270544":"i shower every other day , and i seldom ever take baths .","270545":"i feel like i answered this three times already , lol . the only things i ve done this morning are make breakfast and have coffee . i just logged onto my laptop now i m listening to music while i finish off my coffee .","270546":"i haven t been to a pool in years upon years .","270547":"for me personally , yes . i usually wake up between am .","270548":"eh , not really . i can t handle the heat , although i used to like tanning in the sun .","270549":"answering questions on askfm , listening to music , and drinking coffee .","270550":"absolutely , lol . i literally know absolutely nobody who has waited until marriage .","270551":"why did i do this ? lmaoo . this is sorta related to the last question i answered , but usually the morning after whatever activities i took part in , i ask myself why i even thought it was a good idea . then i realize that i didn t care at the time , i deal with the consequences , and then the cycle repeats .","270552":"i don t need to justify myself in making bad decisions i just do them without a second thought . i m fairly impulsive and do things on a whim according to my own desires at the time .","270553":"box recipe , lmaoo . i ve never made anything from scratch before really , i m terrible at cooking .","270554":"i focus on smaller segments that compose of the bigger piece at hand , that way it s less overwhelming .","270555":"perhaps likely not for another few decades , though , at the very least .","270556":"right now , probably covid . a lot of places are flaring up again and going into another lockdown .","270557":"i can t pick just one , but they re les miserables , sweeney todd , and the lord of the rings trilogy .","270558":"my friends mostly ex friends and i made it a habit to constantly steal street signs and other government property when we were much younger , especially cones and barrels . we ve also stolen the entire street sign including the pole , stop signs , construction signs , and big road signs that say the exit number and stuff .","270559":"i ve only been awake for about an hour , so it s going well . i slept well last night i m relaxing with a few cups of coffee before playing video games , probably .","270560":"no , most of my dreams are nightmares or just flat out bizarre .","270561":"this is true , yes , if there were significant problems stemming from the person s past relationship particularly if they were the perpetrator . i was mainly talking about standard relationships , though , especially with respect to people s sexual history .","270562":"my friend is a licensed hairdresser , so i go to her to cut and color my hair . i ve never done it myself before , i don t trust myself doing my own hair .","270563":"absolutely nothing , considering i ve been awake for less than an hour , lol . i made breakfast and coffee that s all .","270564":"thanks , i hope so too . i just want to get in and out as fast as possible .","270565":"i only follow around people here , and i m close to only some of them . so i would say not really .","270566":"i don t remember most of my childhood , so i really have no idea .","270567":"all the time , tbh .","270568":"play video games , listen to music , write , read , paint draw , and interact with my friends .","270569":"it wouldn t matter to me how much money he has , as long as he has a steady income has enough to keep himself afloat .","270570":"thank you i m kinda nervous about tonight because i m going to my parents house to celebrate my birthday . things will probably be civil and i m thinking too much into it , though .","270571":"no , i haven t .","270572":"nah , not really . not much makes me cringe .","270573":"i m feeling pretty well , i had a good night s sleep now i m drinking coffee and eating breakfast . i m probably going to continue playing assassin s creed valhalla in a little while .","270574":"here s one of my playlists at least a small portion of it . i haven t updated it in a while though .","270575":"depends on your personal views toward sex . some people like pushing the boundaries experimenting , while others play it simple .","270576":"no , it isn t necessary . most people , in my experience , don t feel the need to share every detail about their past relationships . it doesn t affect the current relationship .","270577":"if something isn t my fault , then there s no sense in me apologizing . i used to do that a lot when i was younger i would apologize even when something wasn t my fault just to end the argument but currently , i m not willing to do that anymore .","270578":"all of my years blend together , so i honestly have zero idea .","270579":"spending time together , personally . some people might choose the opposite , though .","270580":"i m probably going to start re watching supernatural .","270581":"going to be sucked into this for the next few months .","270582":"honesty . i expect my friends to be honest with me , whether it s something they re going through and they feel comfortable enough to speak to me about it , or they feel that i did something wrong or i m being problematic . friendships where you can t be honest with each other are normally very superficial .","270583":"i never learned how to ride a bicycle when i was younger . i had a german shepherd growing up , she passed away when i was in my early s . i originally went to college for creative writing , specifically fiction and poetry , before i transferred . i was the only freshman student to be published in the college s literary journal .","270584":"i m indifferent to it . just because the calendar year is ending doesn t mean anything is going to change we re not going to wake up on january st and things will be different . we ll still be dealing with the everyday chaos that we re dealing with currently .","270585":"tiktok , considering i ve never heard of the second one before .","270586":"i wanted to be the complete opposite from them . i can t remember my actual childhood , but i do remember most of my teenage years , and the adults in my life mainly family members were manipulative , ab sive , and just overall very toxic people . one of my worst fears is that i would turn into my mother , and i still carry that fear to this day .","270587":"i ve come close to tears , but i ve never legitimately cried out of happiness before at least that i can recall .","270588":"gossip about family members , smh . whenever my mother and i talk on the phone , she always ends up gossiping about everyone else in my family , i suppose to keep me in the loop or something , but it s honestly something i care very little about .","270589":"i suppose somewhere in the middle .","270590":"through honesty and communication those are the foundations of any relationship , and if you can t communicate effectively with your partner , then the relationship likely won t last . both partners also should keep an open mind when it comes to discussing problems in the relationship and place themselves in the other person s shoes , to see from their perspective .","270591":"i haven t watched the movie in such a long time ever since they took it off of netflix here , but i ve debated on buying the movie because i love it so much . it s strange to say , but it s one of my comfort films , ahah . the next time i watch , i ll have to keep a close eye on those things and see .","270592":"no , i don t believe in magic . most magic tricks are just illusions meant to guide people s attention away from the logistics behind the trick and make it seem magical .","270593":"i just follow the arrows on the floor and keep my distance from others while wearing my mask . i try to get in out as fast as possible , which lately has been more difficult because the grocery store i go to completely changed all of their planograms , and i have no idea where anything is anymore . lmao .","270594":"i don t believe i ve watched a scary movie that wasn t specifically a horror movie , lol . i also don t tend to watch scary movies anyway , they make me super anxious and paranoid .","270595":"i m listening to medieval fantasy music drinking tea , so i m pretty relaxed rn .","270596":"i would consider that to be a big age gap , yeah . even though you re legally an adult at the age of , you re still very much a teenager and just graduating from high school . someone who s , on the other hand , is an established adult who in some cases has already graduated from college with

worst traits my stubbornness and ability to manipulate people .","270598":"cont . . . excluded me , as if she was blanking me , to make me feel left out , lol . how b tchy is that ? jeez , that s passive aggressive and also extremely immature . i would have called her out on it , personally , but that s just me . lol .","270599":"the series of unfortunate events that happened last night when my friends came over to celebrate my birthday last night , lmao . my roommate got very drunk and wrestled his father playfully , obviously , and they ended up breaking his closet door and a snack table . my one friend went home with another distant friend of ours who just happened to be there , and they hooked up . my other friend started making out with my roommate s dad s girlfriend . meanwhile , i slept through the entire thing . lmao .","270600":"i would rather hear an uncomfortable truth . most lies eventually are revealed in the long run , and i would much rather hear the truth now as opposed to finding out later , especially if it s through someone else .","270601":"i think that would be passive aggressive , yeah , because they re not saying it directly to you . for example , if a person was insulting you to someone else with the intent that you will eventually hear see it , then that is very passive aggressive .","270602":"i m both a cat person a dog person , or just an animal person in general . i ve had cats , dogs , and fish , and several of my friends also have various lizards and small animals like rodents .","270603":"i believe our physical body perishes , but our souls spirits whatever you want to call it are transferred to another medium into the universe . our spirits are composed of energy , and as energy cannot be destroyed , it must be transferred and embody something else .","270604":"straight up aggressive , lol . i prefer when people including myself are direct and to the point , as opposed to being passive aggressive where they allude to something but don t want to outright say what s bothering them .","270605":"i think the last concert i went to was almost two years ago . i saw a concert hosted by a radio station , and some of the artists who performed were ajr , mike shinoda , florence and the machine , death cab for cutie , muse , bastille , and chvrches .","270606":"i would travel to the s as an adult so i could experience the music from that era , particularly all of the alternative rock , grunge , and nu metal music .","270607":"when my ex and i were dating , i had to have a serious conversation at one point about his drug use because he was addicted to a lot of drugs , and he was in denial about it all .","270608":"i have two cats , and they love string , rofl . they have so many random strands of cat string in their toy box , and they have the tendency to bring them into my room or outside of my bedroom door at night while i m sleeping . i ll wake up to string all over the room .","270609":"the feeling of euphoria when i was high on cocaine , haha . i don t want to do cocaine again , though , so i doubt i ll experience that sort of euphoric happiness again .","270610":"i don t normally like comedy movies , but for some reason , both borat movies are hilarious to me . they re definitely not everyone s cup of tea because of how offensive controversial they are , though .","270611":"yeah , i have a few close friends that i consider family to me , especially since i m not close to my own family at all .","270612":"i like rainbow cookies cannolis , which are both pretty popular where i live

dude .","270618":"there s body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria , from my understanding . gender dysphoria is the distressed feeling that trans people feel because their gender doesn t match their assigned gender at birth . body dysmorphia is when a person regardless of their gender is hyperfixated on a perceived problem or insecurity with their own body , which kinda ties into gender dysphoria .","270619":"i prefer cold weather .","270620":"eh , not really . i ll drink it sometimes but i don t love it .","270621":"i guess brown beige ? my carpet is dark brown , so i bought brown furniture

anyway .","270625":"yeah , i realized that a few days ago . ugh .","270626":"you evidently are uneducated on the difference between sex and gender . if you re going to try to argue about my gender ,

just finished up doing some freelance work for extra money now i m relaxing on askfm and drinking an iced coffee .","270631":"i mean , i ve always been of the belief that most people find intelligence to be attractive i m not one to believe in all of the weird subsets of different sexual orientations , like micro labels and whatnot .","270632":"probably , but i honestly don t remember what my views even were at that time because of how long ago that was , lol . i do remember acting like everyone else and labeling myself with all sorts of weird , insignificant labels and i think i even put them in my bio , like hi , i m leigh , a pansexual genderfluid femme and then just an entire list of my mental illnesses , lmaoo .","270633":"i like spinach and mushroom salads .","270634":"i haven t done any christmas shopping yet .","270635":"i never usually went anywhere on friday nights besides possibly a friend s house on occasion , or i would have people come over my house . i never liked going out on the weekends , especially to bars and such , because they re normally way too crowded .","270636":"it was when you initially asked this question , but now it s saturday where i live .","270637":"i think so , yeah . i ve always been of the belief that animals have some sort of innate sense of when a human is not what they appear to be , and animals are naturally more comfortable with kind souls and people who are compassionate .","270638":"i don t think humans are designed in any particular way , and it all comes down to what each individual person is most comfortable with .","270639":"lol , who knows . if they do , it definitely would not surprise me .","270640":"anger affects me the most out of all of those emotions . i have a tendency to get angry easily over seemingly insignificant things , and i hold it within myself because i don t want to inflict that anger onto other people .","270641":"definitely not , haha . i can barely get through this current life , let alone contemplate the idea of living eternally .","270642":"i know plenty of people who use onlyfans . i don t have any strong opinions on it or anything , i support their choice because they have bodily autonomy and can do what they want .","270643":"i have no interest in fame , so i would much rather have an abundance of fortune . at least i can put that to good use .","270644":"going out with people without being paranoid terrified that i m going to catch a virus and spread that rapidly to other people .","270645":"yeah , lol . they just updated it this week

very much , lol . i don t get why twitter decided to add stories besides the obvious fact that they want to keep up with other forms of social media . it s pretty pointless , in my opinion .","270649":"the whole we are the virus thing is a bit misleading , in my opinion , and can be a dangerous thought process . i remember the memes going around a few months ago that pushed that narrative because nature was healing as a result of humans staying inside and quarantining because of covid . but , the we are the virus takes away from the notion that millions of people have d ed , especially in underserved communities , and we re still very much a part of nature and the ecosystem in itself . humans aren t inherently bad , and it s mainly major corporations and government entities that are inflicting harm upon the earth . a lot of people push the idea , when they say we are the virus , that we re almost deserving of a new plague , so to speak , and i think that s honestly terrible .","270650":"my creativity .","270651":"i don t believe that i m a strong person , lol . i have several weaknesses that i give into all the time .","270652":"i d rather order mexican

sexist .","270665":"it isn t awkward at all , and i don t believe it s weird or odd either . it s very common for exes to remain friends after a break up , especially if the break up was on good terms .","270666":"i post on askfm literally every day .","270667":"no , i ve never visited chicago before .","270668":"yes , i already have seven tattoos .","270669":"i don t believe i have , but i guess

.","270678":"i can t recall , so probably not .","270679":"it can be classist in a sense , yeah , because generally the term white trash describes a white person who looks and behaves a certain way due to their economic class status , whether it s the clothing they wear or how hygienic they are or whether or not their teeth are straight .","270680":"eh , i m doing all right . i took the afternoon off from work , so i ve been napping on and off for the past few hours .","270681":"the only conspiracy theory that i believe in is that the government is probably hiding evidence of extraterrestrial life from regular civilians . otherwise , i don t think there are any other theories that i believe in , although i do find them interesting .","270682":"i would much rather go vegan , considering that s the healthier option of the two .","270683":"not really , no .","270684":"there s a little icon in the top right corner of the screen that looks like pac man . i m pretty sure that s how you disable shout outs .","270685":"no , i ve never been to a psychic before . stuff like that freaks me out a bit , ahah . i don t want them to say something bad and then it end up being true .","270686":"yeah , sometimes i watch foreign movies that are subtitled . i also keep the subtitles on for the english shows movies i watch because it s easier for me to follow along

bit boring , especially considering i hated establishing settlements .","270706":"i liked him better as an awkward person as opposed to after he got his confidence back , tbh . when he spoke on the

please tell me what to do r x i know what you re going through because the same thing happened between me and my ex except he was the one whose feelings dwindled , not me . it s better to be upfront and honest about how you re feeling instead of faking sentiments , like you just said . it may hurt them , of course , but it would be doing a disservice to yourself and to your partner if you continued to pretend you re still in love with them . you both will become very unhappy .","270727":"pasta , lmao .","270728":"i ve never assembled ikea furniture before , but i ve assembled a few of

as they re usually based on decades old notions and misconceptions .","270779":"no , there are few things that a person can be too old to do , and music is definitely not one of them . if you want to embark on a new hobby , then you have the freedom to do so .","270780":"most of the time , bullies don t have self confidence and are simply taking their own frustrations and insecurities out on other people by giving them a taste of their own medicine , you re placing yourself in the same position as a bully , which is going to lead that bully to further harrass other people . there isn t such a thing as bullying people until they become humble . that s why you need to approach them with patience and maturity while educating them that their behavior is completely wrong dangerous . and if they continue , then block report their messages so they won t bother you further .","270781":"i am emotionally physically exhausted .","270782":"i ve never been admitted to the hospital before .","270783":"no , that just worsens the problem doesn t make you any better than the bully themselves . depending on the circumstance , the best thing to do is to simply put your foot down and tell

oriented sites , though .","270789":"if you re expecting a phone call , especially from a prospective employer , then you re best off just answering it and seeing who it is . if it happens to be a

.","270800":"i prefer candles over wax melts .","270801":"a machine that automatically makes me mentally stable .","270802":"like a few people have said before me , this is a potentially dangerous question that can lead to an exacerbation of symptoms in people who already struggle with dissociation , psychosis , paranoia , etc etc . i understand your intentions are good , but you also have to recognize your audience because many of the people you ve sent this question to have mental illnesses and have difficulties perceiving reality .","270803":"mostly against there s a big difference between suspecting you have an illness and claiming you do have that illness , though . it s extremely healthy and normal for people to have their suspicions that they may be struggling with a disorder such as mental disorders , but then it becomes a bit problematic when that same person automatically tells others that they have that disorder without consulting a medical professional first . there s a reason why doctors go through years upon years of schooling and medical training it s all about the cross examination of symptoms because symptoms of numerous disorders can overlap , and it isn t the responsibility of the layperson to make that determination themselves . this is most prevalent in mental health communities online , i ve noticed , where people think they have a disorder and just roll with it instead of considering outside possibilities . i understand that not everyone has access to medical care , but you can say that you suspect you have a disorder without downright claiming that you have that disorder .","270804":"i m all right it s been a sad few days for no reason whatsoever , but i m trying to push through because i know it s only temporary and hopefully i ll feel better by later in the week . other than that , i m just trying to find the motivation to write and drinking a beer .","270805":"i have no idea , i can t remember that far back

.","270808":"cont . . . another really big telltale is whether or not you ve opened up at all . therapists are trained to help you feel comfortable to do this sooner or later . if i still feel like i m in the breaking the ice stage , that s usually an in my face sign that this therapist isn t the right fit . this this this this . thank you for putting it in words more eloquently than i ever could have at the moment , lol . you re definitely right about waiting the sessions thing i did that with my previous therapists before deciding they weren t the right fit for me , because it s difficult to really determine if you fit well with a therapist on the first meeting alone , unless something is very wrong , like you said , or something makes me feel super uncomfortable . this is all good advice to heed , so i hope my other anon sees this .","270809":"someone who s passionate about what they do for a living and or their interests , whose eyes light up when they talk about something they genuinely enjoy , and someone who is unapologetically themselves without caring what others think about them . someone who is intelligent which is multifaceted where i can have a conversation with

finished a book in a very long time . i started reading you by carolyn kepnes the movie that the netflix series is based off of and it was really good , but then i lost motivation to finish it . then two weeks ago , i decided to start reading fahrenheit by ray bradbury , which i also enjoyed , but i haven t read it since then . i only got maybe pages into it .","270814":"write , read , listen to music , watch television , paint draw , and play video games .","270815":"seeing my family next week for my birthday for thanksgiving .","270816":"i was proud of myself today for getting through the entire work day without leaving early despite feeling extremely sad crying halfway through the day .","270817":"i just logged into my laptop to check askfm , listen to music , and perhaps do some creative writing .","270818":"i haven t eaten dinner . i m just not hungry , but i m getting a headache so i should probably have something .","270819":"he has major , intentional slip ups trust me , he knows what he s doing and he is a pretty terrible , cowardly person .","270820":"it isn t unfounded . he s simply provided a platform for others to spew their hatred toward minority groups in light of his own animosity toward minority groups .","270821":"it s a lot more complex than that , unfortunately . when you come from an ab sive environment , you have to give and take to a level congruent with your own safety . it s safer for me to suck it up and go as opposed to telling them no dealing with the consequences later .","270822":"i am , though . if i don t attend then i ll get a sh tload of backlash that i honestly could not handle , so for the sake of my sanity , i just suck it up and go for the few hours that i m there .","270823":"i think both , because while we re making great strides in the sciences and technology and everything else , humankind is also terrible i feel like the worst comes out of people a lot , especially lately and within the past years . if anything , the past years have really shone a light on how inhumane and cruel people can be .","270824":"spending time with my family makes me extremely anxious and nervous , and i wish we didn t have to have a family dinner every year .","270825":"this time of year , i normally just wear a hoodie , regular leggings , and boots . later on in the winter , i have fleece lined leggings that i sometimes wear ,

break from work i m laying down before taking a shower .","270832":"sometimes although this is a weird question .","270833":"thank you ! !","270834":"that s interesting . i don t think i would ever use it .","270835":"i don t even know what that is .","270836":"trump is neither a strong leader nor does he care about the regular american public , lmaoo . if anything , his words and actions have proven otherwise .","270837":"i m working until friday , and i m debating on taking thursday off from work because my birthday is wednesday i might drink that night so i don t have to worry about working while hungover , lol .","270838":"i m five feet tall .","270839":"sometimes , mostly if i see them inside the house .","270840":"absolutely .","270841":"no , i don t subscribe to people on

.","270846":"definitely not , rofl . if anything , trump s presidency has proven that he as well as some other men are too driven by emotions as opposed to logic to be in a position of authority . someone s ability to be rational vs . emotional isn t dictated by their sex .","270847":"not snails , but other small bugs like ants and spiders .","270848":"yes , i will be once one is released .","270849":"i don t think i did , but i can t say for certain .","270850":"good thing i don t plan on having kids anyhow .","270851":"no , pregnancy scares the sh t out of me .","270852":"some random person called my work number thankfully i didn t answer it and left a voicemail saying you called me and hung up twice . i m going to block you if you try again . wanna tell me what the hell is going on ? so i looked up the number and it was a private investigator from ohio , so i m just like . . . super confused .","270853":"i don t usually like sweet coffee , but there are some seasonal drinks

different therapists because the first few weren t right for me . it took me a good months before i was comfortable enough with someone to see them long term . i was with one therapist for . years before she quit her job , which really saddened me . but now that i ve been with a new therapist for a few months now , i ve realized that my old therapist wasn t really acting like a therapist to me it was almost like we were friends who met every week instead of it being a therapeutic session .","270859":"our brains are active to nearly a capacity in most cases , and the idea that we only use of our brain is false .","270860":"martial arts can be therapeutic for some , but it isn t professional therapy . therapy is when you see a licensed therapist or clinical social worker which i assume you did when you went to anger management .","270861":"i don t think it would hurt at all , so in a sense , yes . you don t necessarily need to have something wrong in order to see a therapist . sometimes it s simply good and healthy to talk to someone with an unbiased perspective on an issue that you re dealing with so you can work through it better .","270862":"no , i m pretty sure everything has been debated by someone at least once or twice . i don t think there s anything universal that can be agreed upon by everybody .","270863":"i wouldn t have started self h rming at all when i was a pre teen , because it basically made me a depressed paranoid wreck for the rest of my teenage years into adulthood .","270864":"about a month ago when two of the cats who lived here moved out to live with my roommate who also moved out at the same time .","270865":"lol . i can most definitely see that . that s why i like using social media on my laptop most of the time , i m terrible at typing on a phone .","270866":"i m the same person compared to when people are watching , except i just talk to myself more . rofl .","270867":"i m not sure , haha . like i said , he s always been an upfront sort of person anyway , so anything else would have been out of character for him like if he decided to sugarcoat it or something .","270868":"i would feel worse if nobody showed up to my wedding , considering i would be dead at my own funeral and wouldn t know who showed up either way .","270869":"self care is the act of doing something or several things that s beneficial to your own mental and physical well being .","270870":"i think it s adorable as long as the pet doesn t mind , of course . there are some animals who almost need the extra layers in the winter if they cannot create enough body heat themselves , particularly hairless cats and dogs with very short coats .","270871":"thank you for the follow i m going to be going to my parents house for thanksgiving dinner this year

people have the freedom to voice their opinions regardless of what those opinions are , whether they re wrong or not . it isn t up to us or social media to police the opinions of others .","270877":"i know one person who is anti vaxx , and they already know my feelings on it .","270878":"i prefer eating alone .","270879":"morgan freeman should be everyone s answer , rofl .","270880":"i don t pay attention to people s zodiac signs .","270881":"while i think being anti vaxx is stupid dangerous , i don t think people who are should be banned from social media . that treads into the territory of controlling the media based on personal opinion , which is very much a big brother sort of thing to do .","270882":"save it up to get another tattoo .","270883":"when i m bored , i usually either play video games , watch television , or sleep .","270884":"i got your second message , don t worry lol . yes , i speak to a few of my old coworkers , and my old supervisor from when i worked in retail is now actually one of my closest friends .","270885":"i don t think i ve ever tried oat milk before ! ! usually i just get almond milk . i just woke up now i m craving another peppermint mocha iced coffee , lmaoo .","270886":"it s been a few months , but i don t understand why that s any of your concern .","270887":"i m pretty sure i have ibs , but i ve never gotten it checked out

.","270893":"some people don t have the time or money to travel , or even to take a vacation in the first place . not everyone has that privilege .","270894":"depends on who you ask .","270895":"no , i prefer dunkin .","270896":"it s all right , i seldom eat it .","270897":"i don t think i do , at least not personally .","270898":"because i m mentally ill .","270899":"i m depressed i haven t left

.","270905":"no , my friends wouldn t do that .","270906":"covid would be the most obvious reason , rofl . however , i invite people over a lot .","270907":"yes , i enjoy it a lot . it s formal but i also have the opportunity to be creative as well .","270908":"aaron lewis from staind .","270909":"no , i heard it was a good show though .","270910":"just regular questions like i would send the people i regularly follow .","270911":"no , i don t believe in god .","270912":"magazines , press releases , website content , etc etc .","270913":"i d rather never be able to eat meat again .

company .","270916":"eventually , sure . i have no pressing need to travel right now , though . not that i even have the time or finances to do so , anyway .","270917":"unless a person is writing in a formal context , such as for a job or for school , it doesn t really matter whether or not someone is grammatically correct . it s just the internet and this is coming from someone who proofreads ,

previous girlfriend .","270928":"there was a proper end . we broke up in august of .","270929":"this isn t exactly something i can predict . i m just going with the flow and living each day as they come .","270930":"besides now , it was years ago .","270931":"in retrospect , i knew towards the end that it was ending , i just didn t know when until we both sat down and talked about it . i was a bit in denial about it because i was still so much in love with him , but his feelings weren t reciprocated anymore and i could tell just by the way he acted towards me within the last months or so of the relationship .","270932":"nah , i have no interest in relationships right now . i m content with being single .","270933":"no , i have no interest in dating at the moment .","270934":"no , that wasn t the reason for the breakup . we re still close friends even post break up because we ended amicably .","270935":"depends on my mood , usually dark red or purple though .","270936":"we didn t

.","270937":"i don t understand how they can miss me i m home and always leave my door open at night so they can come go as they please , rofl .","270938":"not completely no , at least not yet . there are so many school districts that have been closing temporarily because kids and faculty are getting sick , though .","270939":"i m not entertaining this because it sounds like a fetish considering how often it s asked to me and other people .","270940":"years .","270941":"a little over a year .","270942":"it s weird how often this question is asked , not gonna lie .","270943":"yes , i m single .","270944":"yes , i love scented candles ! ! i have a few from bath body works which are amazing , like fresh balsam and one just called winter not sure what the actual scent is . i also like jasmine , cinnamon and vanilla , sandalwood , patchouli , and peppermint .","270945":"daily reminder that calls to forgive abusers , be the bigger person , set a positive example for people who have unapologetically hurt you , and bear the burden of reconciliation singlehandedly are all tactics of perpetuating said abuse . don t fall for it . seek justice .","270946":"i haven t had lunch yet , it s only am .","270947":"don t put effort into others if they won t reciprocate the same level of effort into you i m mostly talking in a friendship context , but the same goes for relationships .","270948":"my back and neck hurt as it is , and i wouldn t call any of my pain chronic pain because i feel like that takes away from people who do experience chronic pain to the point where it s disabling . i also feel like i m developing carpal tunnel syndrome .","270949":"i suppose creative writing , since i know the most about it , especially with respect to expressing yourself honestly .","270950":"any sort of compliment on my writing is among the best compliments i ve received .","270951":"not necessarily happy , but calmed and tranquil . i like listening to instrumental music from the lord of the rings movies and the skyrim soundtrack , because they put me at ease .","270952":"thank you it hurt a lot at the time obviously , but looking back on it , i ve come to terms with it and i m grateful that he was at least honest with me about his feelings instead of beating around the bush or making bullsh t excuses . i mean . . . he probably could have worded it a bit better , but he s also always been a very upfront sort of person , so it makes sense coming from him . he didn t mean it in a malicious way , but obviously it still broke me .","270953":"i don t remember much of my childhood besides the random flashbacks i ve been experiencing lately , and they re not good memories .","270954":"i don t love you as much as you love me .","270955":"i don t have children , and i don t think i even want children in the future which works well for me , considering i think i m infertile anyway .","270956":"i suppose constant pain , because i m used to experiencing physical pain and i could probably adjust to it for the most part after experiencing it for a long time . itching , on the other hand , drives me up the wall .","270957":"well , that wasn t supposed to be there . . .","270958":"i don t have one , i think pickup lines are silly .","270959":"well , technically this wasn t today considering it s only am and i ve only been awake for about an hour . but last night , i talked to my coworker via video chat on zoom , and it cheered her up a lot . she s been going through an extremely difficult time and it felt nice to see her laughing and smiling .","270960":"seeing my friends , whether that s virtually or in person . i had a great zoom video session last night with one of my coworkers whom i haven t seen since march .","270961":"ah , i understand . i don t get sick or anything and i would much rather be cold than hot . for instance , i just got home from taking a quick dunkin trip and i wore a light hoodie flip flops , rofl . it s only degrees fahrenheit outside .","270962":"under dressed cold .","270963":"uh , i think you hit send before you completed the question . i m assuming you mean person and not that you re referring to an animal , lmfao .

bad before .","270965":"i couldn t fall back asleep so i just went to dunkin for a peppermint mocha iced coffee veggie breakfast sandwich .","270966":"i ve always loved the window seat .","270967":"thank you","270968":"i like fruit , but i like vegetables more .","270969":"i m all right i woke up a little bit ago to use the bathroom now both of the cats have so much energy that i can t fall back asleep , haha . one of the cats was pawing and meowing at the bathroom door while i was in there , and then he immediately jumped on my shoulders once i went back to bed .","270970":"no , i m bisexual .","270971":"i was playing halo and i killed both of my teammates on accident with one bullet , lmfao .","270972":"no , i don t speak to people privately . i m going to delete your statements from hereon out .","270973":"that s too bad then .","270974":"if you re so eager to tell me something , you can do so here .","270975":"i don t eat candy or any kind of sweets really .","270976":"i don t talk to people privately .","270977":"no , i answer questions openly assuming those questions are appropriate , of course .","270978":"i answers questions on askfm . so if

cream .","270982":"go right ahead .","270983":"yes , i have been .","270984":"extremely , particularly within the past few years . i ve gained so much weight between the ages of and , ugh

the assassin s creed series . however , i recently started playing the witcher for the first time .","270989":"the arts , video games , mental health awareness , and my own career .","270990":"aw , i m happy to hear that ! ! once i switched over to a routine sleep schedule , i began feeling so much better throughout the day . even when i don t have to wake up early in the morning , i do so anyway just to get more out of the day , and it makes me feel more optimistic and more productive .","270991":"i ll be thinking of something and see certain images in my mind that correlate with whatever i m thinking about , whether directly or indirectly . honestly , it blew my mind when i found out that some people don t have that inner voice , lol . i thought it happened to everybody .","270992":"when i think to myself , i hear a distinct voice relaying those thoughts to me that s just above my subconscious . i don t necessarily think in colors or anything , but sometimes symbols do play a role .","270993":"escape .","270994":"if you re referring to the covid vaccine , then yes i will get it when it does come out .","270995":"lyrics are somewhat important to me , but it really does depend on the song . i appreciate great lyricism , but at the same time , i also love instrumentals that also compose of a song , so if the lyrics are lacking and the instrumentals are great , then that s fine . i m fairly good at memorizing lyrics , haha .","270996":"probably nami the national alliance on mental illness because i m passionate about advocacy for mental health awareness .","270997":"peaches are my favorite fruit .","270998":"lol , well i m not drunk im tipsy at best , and i had already completed of the assignments prior to posting that video . i only had to proofread copyedit press releases this weekend , so it isn t as much brain power compared to if i had to write them myself . i just had to make sure the grammar was fine and information was consistent . anyway , yay i m done now that s extra money in my pocket . only took me maybe minutes in total .","270999":"i don t , but i would prefer to because i want to get f cked up tonight , and i already know i m not going to

my bed next to my feet .","271001":"has definitely had a lot of setbacks education wise , particularly for children whose families don t have the resources or time to dedicate toward providing them an education that they would normally receive in in person schooling . the more a child goes without continuous education , the less they re going to comprehend sorta like when we had summer breaks in school , we forgot half of what we learned the previous year since we weren t actively practicing it . in underserved communities , this is definitely more prevalent . rich white children obviously have the benefit of having more resources to attain adequate education during this covid year , such as home schooling and whatnot . this can t be said for a large majority of people , though .","271002":"i normally escape through music , alcohol , marijuana , television shows movies , and video games .","271003":"i m not well versed in child behavior or what may work best for children at that age in regards to schooling , so in a general sense , i honestly don t know . however , given the current climate of , it s much safer for children to engage in remote learning than in person learning for the safety of everyone involved children , faculty , family members , friends , etc etc .","271004":"traveling would be pleasant , but it isn t an immediate goal of mine

times , i do . however , you don t need a partner to make yourself feel whole , and i m currently in the midst of navigating those waters myself . i m focusing my attention on my own self improvement and my own goals .","271007":"sometimes , but not very often .","271008":"i don t think so , personally . it s always a plus if you have the same taste of music movies as your partner , but i don t think it s really a make or break type of situation . also there are so many types of movies and television shows out there , it would be difficult for a couple to not agree on a single thing . chances are , there is a few shows or movies that both people enjoy , even if it isn t in line with what they generally like .","271009":"coins added to your account each week , promotion on various aspects of the website , and overall more traffic to your page .","271010":"thank you for responding ! ! that s silly they don t have a section on the desktop , but oh well . thank you

name i just can t see it ? also i primarily use askfm on my desktop , is there a way to track my progress on the desktop version instead of the app ? i can t figure it out .","271013":"i ve sorta done it before , yes . when i went on a cruise last february , there was very little service since we were on the water most of the time , so i didn t use the internet for several days at a time the cruises was days long in total . it felt nice to disconnect and just live in that moment .","271014":"ah , probably falling asleep in the bathroom at the bar when i got way too drunk on one of my birthdays . it was a one person bathroom where you could lock the door behind you , so after i used the toilet , i sat against the wall to gather my bearings and ended up drifting off to sleep just sitting there . i woke up idk how long it even was to the sounds of my friends banging on the bathroom door and calling out my name . lmao .","271015":"depends on my mood ! ! last night , for example , was very relaxing because i made a few drinks played video games for a few hours . then i was super tired and fell asleep by pm , lmaoo . otherwise , i also love relaxing with my laptop and trying

taking part in my favorite hobbies .","271018":"it could be for a variety of reasons . some people are simply more comfortable expressing themselves online via text as opposed to in person , and more of their personality comes out online via social media compared to irl . it isn t necessarily a bad thing . you are who you are regardless of whether your presence is online or irl , and there s honestly more freedom of expression on the internet , which prompts others to be more expressive and honest with themselves .","271019":"i d rather be loved by my friends and hated by everyone else . i don t really care about what other people think of me to begin with , and the only opinions i do care about are those of my friends .","271020":"living in a small wood cabin somewhere in the woods
