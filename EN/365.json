life. there's so much we don't know about space and other galaxies in general, and it's more than possible for there to be life that we have yet to discover.\n  ","391748":"\n  i don't generally

a different job i had applied for. i didn't think i would like this work as much as i would have liked the other job's work, but i took a chance and accepted this job offer instead. the hiring managers made me feel incredibly comfortable, while the hiring manager at the other job made me wait 30 minutes just to talk to me during the interview.\n  \n  i'm glad i took this job because it's

of sociology and psychology, so i would love to freshen up on that knowledge.\n  ","391804":"\n  idk, probably a better\/faster laptop so that i can do my work more efficiently. i'm not much into technology at all, so there has never been any types of technology that i've specifically wanted.\n  ","391805":"\n  no, i don't believe that everything happens for a reason. there are terrible things that happen to people for no good reason whatsoever, and not everything is a lesson or a means of teaching someone something. somethings people get the sh*t end of the stick, and we have to adjust and deal with it.\n  ","391806":"\n  yes, absolutely. tbh, i find it a bit annoying when i'm out with a friend and they're on their phone the entire time. :\/ i feel like they aren't truly valuing the

different than my regular life, LOL. no one recognizes me where i live, so i'm left alone whenever i go out to run errands and whatnot.\n  ","391811":"\n  i don't think i really have any prized

never really studied them intensively or anything. i studied the social sciences while in college, but that was the extent of it.\n  ","391822":"\n  i'm pretty content at the moment. i have music playing in the background, i have a beer, and i'm enjoying answering questions here on my laptop while my phone charges.\n  ","391823":"\n  obviously lately it's been things related to COVID-19, such as when i'm going out in public and driving and whatnot. i always wear my mask and wash my hands immediately after coming home.\n  ","391824":"\n  i don't get stomach cramps often at all, tbh. i've never visited a hospital for any of my own illnesses, mental or physical.\n  ","391825":"\n  it could be either, tbh. it could be part of BPD, but it could also just be inherently a part of who you are naturally. it isn't really uncommon for people to sorta \"define\" themselves by their interests if they don't have a steady sense of self.\n  \n  however, i can most definitely relate to this. i really have no idea who\/what i am most of the time, and i often become obsessive over new interests or pursuits until eventually i lost interest, and then because i lost interest in them, i lose a sense of who i am again. it's a weird cycle.\n  ","391826":"\n  ideally, i'd like there to be quite a few chairs and couches along the walls all facing toward a central television unit\/entertainment center. there would be paintings and some other pictures on the walls with plants here and there. ambient lighting, i.e. unique lamps, instead of an overhead light. big windows looking out toward the front yard. just an area that's very comfortable to relax in.\n  ","391827":"\n  i don't know if i could date someone who wasn't interested in music at all. music is such an important part of my life.\n  ","391828":"\n  uh, do you mean like... drugs and alcohol? lmaoo.\n  \n  i've drank way too much alcohol in one sitting, yes. i've blacked out before on numerous occasions. :\/\n

i know a lot of people who were diagnosed with it, and i have friends\/coworkers who have had friends and family members pass away from it.\n  ","391831":"\n  i prefer coconut milk over almond milk.\n  ","391832":"\n  peaches, mangoes, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and bananas.\n  ","391833":"\n  the shining, cujo, and under the dome (which took me a long ass time to read, smh). i've

when it comes to music, it just depends on what i'm in the mood to listen to at that moment. lately i've been listening to alternative rock, hip hop, pop, indie rock\/pop, blues, and swing. i also like classical compositions, particularly soundtracks to movies, video games, and television shows.\n  ","391837":"\n  i don't usually use emojis at all, tbh.\n  ","391838":"\n  hot dogs and

","391840":"\n  mistakes i've made, even if they're minor. i always beat myself up for work-related mistakes because i'm terrified that it's going to screw everything up, even though realistically most of those mistakes can be fixed.\n  ","391841":"\n  i was reading a short story two weeks ago, but i haven't picked it back up since, lmaoo. i haven't had the attention span or motivation to read a book recreationally because i read and write all day long to begin with.\n  ","391842":"\n  no, i'm not currently saving any money for anything in particular. i try to transfer some money every month to my savings account just for emergencies.\n  ","391843":"\n  birkenstocks looks much, much more comfortable.\n  ","391844":"\n  i don't believe anything is under my bed at the moment, unless it's one of my plushies that has mysterious gone missing the past few days.\n  ","391845":"\n  well based on what i'm currently watching, it would be the television series \"paranormal lockdown.\"\n  \n  which would be... terrifying, to say the least. lmaoo.\n  ","391846":"\n  this sounds like a homework question, tbh. i don't know the answer to this. you're better off doing your own independent research.\n  ","391847":"\n  LOL, i've definitely never gotten an opinion of being *that* young before. regardless -- thank you. i've always looked younger than my actual age, which will probably benefit me in the future.\n  ","391848":"\n  abandonment, enclosed spaces, and public speaking.\n  ","391849":"\n  i enjoy the writing of stephen king, bret easton ellis, and anne rice. some of my

so we would be able to listen to the same music together, though.\n  ","391857":"\n  eh, it depends -- i have a wide variety of music that i listen to, so i'm sure there will be at least *some* overlap there. i don't care much about movies, so that isn't a big deal. however, music is very important to me.\n  ","391858":"\n  emotional stability, financial stability, and to be back with my ex. ugh. lmaoo.\n  ","391859":"\n  i have on one or two occasions, but i'm not a big fan of baths to begin with. i get bored super quick, lol.\n  ","391860":"\n  it's my ex. lmaoo.\n  ","391861":"\n  unfortunately, yes.\n  ","391862":"\n  probably the x-files \"i want to believe\" poster that i currently have hanging on my wall, ahah.\n  ","391863":"\n  i normally just eat ceasar salads. i used to like chicken cobb salads but those have a lot of carbs in them and aren't exactly \"healthy,\" from my understanding.\n  ","391864":"\n  i never understood the appeal behind the whole \"daddy\" thing, lmaoo. it just seems super weird to me.\n  ","391865":"\n  my long-term ambitions are to write a book or more, and then also eventually move into my own place by myself. having roommates is nice, but i also believe i need to live by myself for once to really \"find\" myself -- if that makes sense.\n  \n  as for what i'm doing, not much. i haven't written creatively in a few weeks, and i don't make enough money to live on my own.\n  ","391866":"\n  my friends and pets are a first priority to me, not so much family because i'm not close to my family by any means.\n  \n  my hobbies are important, but those are things i do in my spare time more than anything else (things like writing, reading, video games, listening to music, etc etc). i really do value my friendships first and foremost above anything else.\n  ","391867":"\n  i suppose i have more of an inclination to trust someone more if they confide in me that they've suffered through things in the past. not only because they've suffered and i can relate to that, but also because they entrusted that information with me to begin with, and it makes me more comfortable when someone can trust me before i make the decision on whether or not to trust them in return.\n  ","391868":"\n  nah, not tonight. i'm on my laptop rn because i had so many questions in my inbox and wanted to answer a decent amount of them, instead of trying to tackle them all on my phone.\n  \n  also, my roommate is home and i don't want him to think i'm talking to myself. lmaoo.\n  ","391869":"\n  yeah, but i also don't have to wake up for another 12 hours. i'm not planning on getting drunk or anything, though. i'm just having a few glasses of wine.\n  ","391870":"\n  EDM, i suppose? i've never been a big fan of that type of music at all.\n  ","391871":"\n  i wish i was drunk rn ... lmao.\n  ","391872":"\n  i haven't seen anyone say anything about shane dawson, so i really have no idea who would be saying that. i also haven't been on askfm much the past few days.\n  ","391873":"\n  i don't believe you're being too much, not at all. it's normal to crave attention from our partners, especially if there are things in the way that are preventing you from conversing with or seeing your partner to begin with.\n  \n  really though, a person *should* take the time out of their day to talk to you -- even if it's just a short five minute phone call in the middle of the day. you'll always find time for those you care about, so i do believe this is a conversation you should have with your boyfriend.\n  ","391874":"\n  yeah, for over 10 years now, the number 23 has been standing out to me everywhere. it hasn't happened much recently, but i was obsessed with the repetition when i was much younger, it seemed to follow me

went out of my comfort zone and called my internet provider and spoke with a technician about troubleshooting my problem, which took maybe 30 minutes. :\/\n  \n  i'm normally really horrible when it

children's parent and being their friend. they should confide in you confidently because they feel comfortable enough with you, but you also shouldn't lost the fact that you're their parent and are looking out for their best intentions and are there to guide them through life, among other things. it's a really thin line to tread.\n  ","391899":"\n  yes, i very much prefer dark humor actually.\n  ","391900":"\n  i used to watch music award shows way back in the day, like in the early 2000s and such. i haven't watched any award shows since -- i've lost interest in them, tbh.\n  ","391901":"\n  i mean, idk about being banned completely. but it shouldn't be marketed as a kid's toy because it's definitely not a kid's toy.\n  ","391902":"\n  there have been dozens of different things said to me over the years from multiple people, i.e. telling me to k*ll myself, saying i'm worthless or a disgrace, telling me i'm better off without my ex, berating me for simply expressing myself, etc etc.\n  ","391903":"\n  i literally have not found a way to stop myself from worrying, but as a means to reduce stress, i generally try distracting myself with media (i.e. youtube videos, video games, music, etc) and\/or drinking alcohol.\n  ","391904":"\n  i'll take your word for it, because i honestly have no idea what a \"girl code\" is. that's news to me.\n  ","391905":"\n  tbh i used to be a typical \"dog person\" back in the day before i lived with cats, but ever since i moved into my new house with my roommate's cats, i've fallen in love with cats. :'))\n  \n  they're unique like dogs in that obviously they all have their own personalities, but it's silly to do the whole dog vs. cat thing because animals as a whole are great. i've also had fish in the past, and my ex had a lot of reptiles too.\n  ","391906":"\n  i think that's disgusting. i've looked a bit more into shane dawson over the past day or so, and apparently he admitted to pleasuring himself over literal children, including willow smith? absolutely horrific. he's a p*do, and there's no reason to defend someone for that.\n  ","391907":"\n  depends on how drunk i am, ahah. i have a better chance of dancing the more i've drank, but i did dance a lot at my best friend's wedding three years ago.\n  ","391908":"\n  what the hell is a \"girl code,\" lmaoo.\n  ","391909":"\n  honestly, i'm really skeptical of it too. i haven't done very much research into it, but i recently realized it's still a *thing* when previously i thought they eradicated it long ago because of how unethical it used to be.\n  \n  idk if i would try it, tbh. i would be too afraid of any adverse reactions. i don't know anyone else who have tried it either. :\/\n  ","391910":"\n  the true king of the north ;\n  ","391911":"\n  my friend's

i want (usually anywhere between 8-10:00am).\n  \n  -- either make breakfast or order breakfast takeout, and make coffee.\n  \n  -- scroll through social media for a bit.\n  \n  -- just generally relax.\n  ","391915":"\n  that would bother me a bit too, particularly the part where your friend said that you were ungrateful. i would find that a bit rude \u2014 just because you're finding it difficult to juggle parenting with everything else right now doesn't mean you're not grateful for your family.\n  ","391916":"\n  i think it's a combination of both, especially considering racism is so ingrained in society to begin with.\n  ","391917":"\n  my passion for the things i'm interested in.\n  ","391918":"\n  i think that if two people are committed, honest, and loyal enough to one

night, which was good because we got a chance to catch up and talk, but it's also left me feeling confused about my feelings.\n  \n  on top of that, i'm going through xanax withdrawals rn, so... :'))

all.\n  ","391925":"\n  no, most psychologists have an advanced degree (like a PhD) in most cases, and therapists just need their license in counseling or social work.\n  \n  ...from my understanding, at least. i'm not 100% on that, so don't quote me on it, lol. they are different though.\n  ","391926":"\n  i'm quiet, but i'm not all that shy. i just keep to myself most of the time.\n  ","391927":"\n  i was a hard working student.\n  ","391928":"\n  no, i still struggle greatly with my depression.\n  ","391929":"\n  no. intensive therapy and medication, depending on the person.\n

could help you too. i understand the feeling though, i wouldn't be able to be a patient of a doctor who was rushing me out the door all the time.\n  ","391932":"\n  nah, i'm good.\n  \n  in other news \u2014 we finally have air conditioning in the house, and omg i'm so happy. :'))\n  ","391933":"\n  i would recommend seeing a therapist first because it seems as if you need to work on processing your feelings\/navigating the relationship with your mother first. you don't really discuss in depth things with psychiatrists, they only really prescribe medication.\n  ","391934":"\n  find a new job.\n  ","391935":"\n  i prefer soy milk.\n  ","391936":"\n  smoothie, especially fruit smoothies. milkshakes have too much dairy for me.\n  ","391937":"\n  yeah, i haven't had them in years

question?\n  ","391942":"\n  i don't have any quarantine goals, haha. i'm just trying to take each day as it comes along instead of worrying incessantly about the future.\n  ","391943":"\n  i don't

currently answering questions and drinking some coffee.\n  ","391948":"\n  no, i rarely buy myself new clothes unless i need to. i spent some money a few weeks ago on new clothing (a few tank tops and sandals), but that was only because my wardrobe has virtually no summer clothing left in it, lol.\n  ","391949":"\n  i don't know very much about him, but apparently he's a p*do? at least that's what i've read while scrolling through my facebook feed this morning.\n  ","391950":"\n  no, i don't give out my snapchat to other people.\n  ","391951":"\n  tonight was beautiful. \u2661\n  ","391952":"\n

playing some nights.\n  ","391954":"\n  yeah, it's been ridiculous around here. my friends and i were eating dinner outside earlier today & they were shooting off like wild. my friend who lives in brooklyn then told me that in his neighborhood, people were setting off fireworks almost every night until like 2:00am. it's ridiculous.\n  ","391955":"\n  lately, drinking alcohol. hence why i'm still drinking and it's 3:00am.\n  ","391956":"\n  perhaps instead of cutting her off completely, talk to her about it instead. by removing all alcohol from the house prior to having a conversation about it, she's going to feel attacked, humiliated, angry, and ashamed. she's going to probably lash out and find even more adverse ways of coping with her feelings.\n  \n  just talk to her about her usage and how you're worried about her. if you approach it the wrong way, you're going to send her spiraling.\n  ","391957":"\n  i'm not aware of what other people are saying about kinks.\n

when i was a pre-teen\/teenager.\n  ","391962":"\n  no, although there was one book i never returned to the library when i was a teenager because i completely forgot i had it, lol. when i was cleaning out my belongings when i moved, i found the book and remembered everything.\n  ","391963":"\n  perhaps you should wait for them to contact you when they're ready to talk to you again.\n  ","391964":"\n  my day has been pretty low key so far \u2014 i did some laundry and laid down in bed for most of the morning, lol.\n  \n  tonight, my roommate and i are going to my friend's house just to hang out for a bit.\n  ","391965":"\n  no, lol. i'm not a doctor or a scientist.\n  ","391966":"\n  nope, never heard of that either.\n  ","391967":"\n  i don't know what that is.\n  ","391968":"\n

robert downey jr., angelina jolie, helena bonham carter, winona ryder, and jason statham.\n  ","391970":"\n  i didn't eat dinner last night. i'm not sure what i'm having tonight \u2014 i'm seeing a friend, so i might have dinner at their place.\n  ","391971":"\n  renting out a log cabin in the woods for a week, going fishing and swimming and having campfires, and cooking on the BBQ outside or over the fire.\n  ","391972":"\n  i think of spirituality in terms of deriving a sense of faith from the natural elements, i.e. the earth and trees and environment as a whole. some people feel complete and whole when they're in nature, and they claim that as their spirituality.\n  ","391973":"\n  adults who tell their sons that showing emotion is a \"weakness\" and condition them into being cold and stoic for their entire lives instead of showing their emotions in a healthy manner.\n  ","391974":"\n  i haven't watched an animated movie since i was a teenager, haha. with the exception of studio ghibli movies.\n  ","391975":"\n  i want to go back to sleep.\n  ","391976":"\n  you're supposed to use \"an\" instead of \"a.\"\n  ","391977":"\n  i probably ate them when i was much younger, but i don't remember if i actually enjoyed them or not.\n  ","391978":"\n  no, most schools start up in august so the timing seems appropriate.\n  ","391979":"\n  when other people are taking a photo of me, yeah. i don't smile in some of my selfies, though.\n  ","391980":"\n  yes, i have, on numerous occasions. lmaoo.\n  ","391981":"\n  no, i definitely don't. i feel uncomfortable when i'm in the center of attention and i prefer to remain on the sidelines or behind the scenes, if anything.\n  ","391982":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","391983":"\n  abandonment, enclosed spaces, and public speaking.\n  ","391984":"\n  good morning !!\n  \n  i just ordered dunkin coffee and an egg sandwich, and i'm hoping i can get over this hangover fairly quickly so that i don't feel like sh*t when i go see my parents in a few hours.\n  ","391985":"\n  spelling \"inconvenience\" wrong \u2014 it's one of those words i can *never* spell correctly on the first try, lmaoo.\n  ","391986":"\n  i really only want to own my own house or a nice apartment, preferably not in new york, and publish a book or more.\n  ","391987":"\n  i've had this happen to me on a few occasions. :\/ especially last sunday when i had a telephone appointment with my psychiatrist, i was kinda venting to her and she cut me off and recommended that i try to continue therapy again.\n  \n  on the one hand, yeah your doctor is really there to just prescribe you meds depending on how you're feeling. but in order to do so, you really need to discuss those feelings somewhat in depth to see what will work best for you.\n  \n  if your doctor is rushing you off the phone or out of the office and you don't feel like you're worthy of their time, then maybe you should consider finding another doctor. ideally, your doctor should be a person you feel comfortable around \u2014 especially when it comes to mental health needs.\n  ","391988":"\n  i'd get up and move to a more isolated seat. lmao.\n  ","391989":"\n  if you're at risk of hurting yourself or someone else.\n  ","391990":"\n  a person can be ignorant if they hold a specific opinion\/viewpoint (especially in relation to politics or social justice) and refuse to rethink their opinion if what they believe is problematic and presented with contrary, reliable facts stating otherwise.\n  ","391991":"\n  true crime, and gorey movies and shows. i'm not sure why i like gore so much, but it's just interesting and appealing to me.\n  ","391992":"\n  having scars\/body abnormalities\/body hair. it's such an archaic concept for people to be basically hairless and \"perfect,\" and i'm so tired of people staring at me because of the scars on my body. especially during the summer time when i can't cover my arms.\n  ","391993":"\n  just because i appear \"normal\" (aka neurotypical), it doesn't mean that i'm not unstable or prone to breakdowns or anything else. i struggle a lot with my mental health, but i've just learned to suppress\/hide it extremely well.\n  ","391994":"\n  talk down to me as if i'm inferior to them, or talk to me while pitying themselves and expect me to give them extra sympathy.\n  ","391995":"\n  honestly, i remember going on forums on various fansites and deviantart in the early 2000s, and those were *such* a source of comfort to me \u2014 just talking to people every day and getting to know them, but not feeling obligated to be online 24\/7. this was before cell phones had social media apps, so you'd only go on the family computer after school and catch up with online friends then. i spent so many long nights just talking on forums.\n  ","391996":"\n  i went to the gym a few years ago, and having that routine definitely was better for me than if i were to try exercising around the block or something. i also like numbers, so i enjoy keeping track of the miles and calories burned while i'm exercising on the treadmill.\n  ","391997":"\n  i don't like candy, so neither.\n  ","391998":"\n  no? that person would be cheating on their partner then.\n  ","391999":"\n  i just fed the cats, and now i'm waiting until 6:00pm so i can jump into my job's virtual happy hour meeting ~~\n  ","392000":"\n  i

famous, and i wasn't referring solely to askfm. there have been several people whom i've wronged in the past.\n  ","392009":"\n  it's good in that we have trains and buses and taxis, but it's honestly much easier to drive myself somewhere than rely on public transportation.\n  ","392010":"\n  the heavy duty vacuum that we own \u2014 it's necessary because of all of the cat hair that accumulates every day. it's cheap because my roommate got it for free from a family member, haha.\n  ","392011":"\n  one of my pet peeves is when people speak over me while i'm talking (or even when people do that to others). i find it really disrespectful and rude.\n  ","392012":"\n  i really dislike driving. :\/\n  \n  i also dislike cleaning the bathtub, because it hurts my back and knees a lot, lmaoo.\n  ","392013":"\n  i'd rather be hated by someone \u2014 i'd rather not hold hate within me because it can be damaging to my emotional wellbeing, and i don't really care about what other people think of me. i'm sure there are dozens of people who hate me.\n  ","392014":"\n  i've never donated financially to a charity, no. however, i helped raise money for a scholarship fund that was named in honor of my ex's mother after she passed away.\n  ","392015":"\n  no, i seldom procrastinate. when it comes to work, i try to do things as soon as they come up (i.e. arriving in my inbox) and i prioritize accordingly.\n  ","392016":"\n  no? i don't even really know who you are, lmaoo.\n  ","392017":"\n  not at all !! evidently i was raised here in new york with a misunderstanding of the term

my coworkers tonight. tomorrow, i'm cleaning at my parents house in the morning, and then i'm spending the afternoon with a few friends who are coming over for some burgers and a campfire.\n  \n  i don't have any plans for sunday, i'm probably just going to sleep and relax.\n  ","392020":"\n  i never said it was a brand. it's a descriptor to refer to what type of food it is in my area \u2014 there are places called \"shah's halal food\" and \"naz's halal food\" and \"the halal guys,\" among other restaurants. so when i say i'm craving halal food, i mean food specifically made in those types of arab restaurants. a lot of them are chain restaurants.\n  \n  perhaps i was raised in ignorance, idk. i like the food because it's prepared fresh, it isn't greasy, it's delicious, and i don't feel gross after i eat it like most other foods.\n  ","392021":"\n  i know what it means, lol. but that's the way we refer to it where i live \u2014 in reference to food. if i ask my roommate what he wants for dinner and he says \"halal food,\" then i know where to order from. there are dozens of halal food places here.\n  ","392022":"\n  it's specifically from halal food places where i live, which is why i specify it in that way. i know halal is a catch-all arabic word in technical terms, but that's the way the word is used with respect to food here.\n  ","392023":"\n  aw, thank you ~~\n

","392034":"\n  yeah, not only can it be harmful on a relationship scale \u2014 but also the porn industry is horrid, and most actors\/actresses don't actually want to be in that position. there are also high rates of sex trafficking in porn circles.\n  \n  i'm pretty sure i saw an article recently about mia khalifa and how she regrets being in the porn industry. i didn't read it, though.\n

few months, i've gotten into sorta a groove when it comes to my finances and bills so i'm somewhat comfortable, but it's still ridiculous.\n  ","392038":"\n  it wouldn't surprise me. regular one-bedroom apartments on long island are between 1200-2000 per month (1100-1200 was the lowest i could find after apartment searching for months last year). obviously i can't afford that.\n  \n  the

i had a very low libido and was never in the mood. eventually, it never happened because i realized i was uncomfortable with it myself and we dropped the subject.\n  \n  if i was into polyamory and my partner was uncomfortable with the idea, then i would respect their feelings and continue with the relationship as it currently is. if the relationship is already great and communication is wonderful, then ideally nothing bad could come of that situation\/conversation. you have to respect your own partner first and foremost.\n  ","392203":"\n  i don't trust people in general, but i've never really

intentions and spread good will towards friends, family, community, etc etc.\n  ","392205":"\n  having malicious thoughts and acting upon those thoughts with ill intent, knowing full well what they're

and it negatively affected me because they argued every day, which made tensions in the house very high. i was always afraid to come home after school because i didn't know what i was walking into.\n

helps.\n  ","392211":"\n  it definitely can, yeah. p*rn can lead to people having unrealistic expectations when it comes to sex, as well as a lot of misinformation regarding sex. it could negatively

understand the gravity of the situation. when my father was in florida, i did everything i could but i also went there in a mask and gloves only when something necessary needed to be done. she

from me working in the office, i can't just get up and leave. i just have no idea where this is even coming from, and really i shouldn't be upset over this because that means she's getting what she wants out of me, but i can't help it. :\/\n  ","392263":"\n  thank you, livi. \u2661 i really appreciate it.\n  \n  it just makes me question myself, like \u2014 am i in the wrong here? or is she just gaslighting me to the extent that it's making me question myself all over again? she's always tried to exert control over everything in my life, and i don't know if she even realizes what she's done to me or if she's just continuing to be manipulative.\n  ","392264":"\n  i haven't heard anything from him. he did text me that one day about the whole lunch break ordeal, and he asked if i could just take time off from work and make up for it later. i told him i couldn't do that because it would need to be approved by upper management, my job is really strict about PTO. especially if it's within the same day and not in advance.\n  ","392265":"\n  i'm not 30, and i'm not a drunk. lmaoo.\n  ","392266":"\n  i just explained it above.\n  ","392267":"\n  it's a really long story.\n  \n  to shorten it a bit... my mother is disabled, and she requires my help every now and again (especially a few months ago when my father was down in florida). she has a bad habit of asking me to help her very last minute. earlier in the week, she asked me to come to her house during my lunch break at work to help her. it wasn't plausible \u2014 i wouldn't have had enough time to drive there, help her, and drive back. so i explained this to her, and she got angry and hung up on me.\n  \n  a few minutes later, i got a really angry text from my aunt telling me to go there *now* and she doesn't want to hear excuses. i told her i only had 10 minutes left until i had to clock back into work. she proceeded to berate me, tell me \"i hope you sleep well at night,\" etc. i told her i could go there after 5:30pm when i clock out of work, and she said \"your dad is home at that point, so nice try.\" i was calm the entire time i was talking to her and eventually she just ignored me.\n  \n  fast forward to today. i had a busy afternoon planned, and my mother texts me last minute asking to go to her house and clean. i told her i couldn't because i was busy, but i'll see her and my father tomorrow for father's day. then i received a 5-paragraph long text message about how inconsiderate i am, how i'm not even her child, how i never help out, how ungrateful i have been my entire life, how she gave me everything, etc etc.\n  \n  needless to say, i got really angry. she's physically & mentally ab*sed me for 15+ years, and i thought i would have peace of mind after i moved out but apparently it's only gotten worse. i have no idea what to even do.\n  ","392268":"\n  LOL. i'm like that when i drink whiskey, which is super rare. :\/\n  \n  i settled on margarita mix. i'm still angry about the situation with my parents and i don't want to spiral down tonight.\n  ","392269":"\n  for some reason, wine just makes me super emotional -- moreso than i already am. i've noticed a trend of me breaking down into crying fits after having too much wine, but that doesn't happen when i drink beer or liquor.\n  ","392270":"\n  tbh, wine makes me cry more than anything else. lmaoo. i might just open up a bottle of ready-made margarita instead, now that i think about it ...\n  ","392271":"\n  definitely thought you meant a physical window, and i was *very* confused. lmaoo.\n  ","392272":"\n

she's in town, so i might actually be able to see her tomorrow night after i leave my parents' house. so that will be good.\n  ","392274":"\n  it's pretty good !! those are the only two things i order, though, lol. i'm normally a sushi sort of person.\n  ","392275":"\n  i usually just order general tso's chicken or orange chicken.\n  ","392276":"\n  when i fell in love, i don't really think my behavior changed all that much. what did change was my perspective on life -- i felt like i had something to lose, for a change, and it gave my life an extra spark of meaning.\n  ","392277":"\n  i mean, i get nervous around talking to *anyone* because i have social anxiety, lmaoo.\n  ","392278":"\n  a lot of it has to do with self confidence. ideally, you shouldn't be afraid to talk to someone because they're only human with their own thoughts, feelings, aspirations, etc etc., just like you do. the best option is to simply put yourself out there, and if heartache is involved, then you'll handle that if\/when the time comes. you won't gain anything by being too afraid to make that first step.\n  ","392279":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree. i'm pretty sure the rest of the world is disappointed in the united states in general, and considers the country a laughing stock.\n  ","392280":"\n  nowhere. i'm not interested in dating.\n  ","392281":"\n  like, do you mean crying? if so,

absolutely despise myself.\n  ","392373":"\n  i don't really care.\n  ","392374":"\n  no, because my past is what made me into who i am today. granted, i would certainly erase the ab*se from my

attention span has been so sh*tty lately that i can only really read for 30 minutes at a time before i lose focus, regardless of which book i'm reading.\n  ","392377":"\n  it changes all the time, but

especially facebook and twitter.\n  \n  everything on the internet goes through phases, and myspace in particular was more of an early-to-late 2000s thing.\n  ","392395":"\n  i think it's amusing

arrogant and believe their opinion is correct even when presented with contrary information.\n  ","392412":"\n  the brand's logo is based off the song \"old aunt jemima\" from a minstrel show performer and sung by slaves during slavery's peak. it has deep roots in southern racism.\n  \n  additionally, the logo is based on a \"'mammy,\" which was a submissive slave who nurtured the children of her white master\/mistress while neglecting her own children. this is also deeply rooted in racism.\n  ","392413":"\n  i enjoy traveling, but i seldom get to travel.\n  ","392414":"\n  abandonment

look for x, y, or z in a woman because everyone is different.\n  ","392431":"\n  nah, it doesn't bother me. it's unfortunate that being cisgender is seen as a default in today's society, but i don't blame people for assuming i'm cis since i do present as femme and have a lot of typical feminine features.\n  ","392432":"\n  yes, i used to have a horrible habit of stealing random sh*t from stores, lol.\n  ","392433":"\n  i really want to see grandson live in concert. his music is intense af, and from what i've seen, his shows are a lot of fun.\n  ","392434":"\n  thanks for the follow ~~\n  \n  i don't follow people upon request.\n  ","392435":"\n  as far as i know, my friends are okay rn. they're also young compared to a lot of other people who have contracted COVID, so i don't know if the effects would be as apparent as someone who's older (my friends who got it are between 25-30 years old).\n  ","392436":"\n  yes, i know quite a few people who got COVID.\n  ","392437":"\n  well, the day is basically over considering it's nearly midnight, lol. i made breakfast, worked for 8 hours, laid down for 2 hours, then spent the night on social media & watching television.\n  ","392438":"\n  i'm not using askfm on my phone rn, so i can't see the new update. i've been using it on my laptop all evening.\n  ","392439":"\n  i try to, for the most part. however, sometimes it becomes way too overwhelming for me and i need to disconnect for a while. there's too much chaos going on in the world and it has the tendency to really f*ck with my mental health.\n  ","392440":"\n  this is difficult, because while i like the idea of forgetting who i am when it rains, it would make working every day difficult because lately it's been raining most afternoons during the week, lmaoo.\n  \n  at the same time, i already forget a lot of the time what i'm doing when i walk into a room, and it frustrates me *so* much. to have that happen on an everyday basis would be so annoying.\n  ","392441":"\n  listening to an instrumental harry potter medley video on youtube, answering questions on askfm, perusing my facebook feed, and drinking wine. :'))\n  ","392442":"\n  no, it ideally shouldn't create problems at all in a healthy relationship. what's in the past stays in the past, and it's normal to talk about your past sexual relations in order to really get a better understanding of what people like or dislike in the bedroom.\n  ","392443":"\n  my most recent, memorable moment was probably the small \"party\" (i use that term lightly, there was only a few of us and we distanced ourselves in the backyard) my roommate and i had last weekend. i honestly can't remember the last time i laughed that hard, it was an amazing gathering and exactly what i needed at that point in time.\n  ","392444":"\n  my grandfather died just about a month ago. he lived in florida, my father flew down there for about a month to look after my grandmother while my grandfather was in the hospital and nursing home.\n  ","392445":"\n  none of my close friends got COVID, but my father and i suspected that my grandfather d*ed from it because he was displaying all of the symptoms in the days leading up to his death, but there was no formal diagnosis made.\n  \n  i do know a lot of people who have had it, though. it was running rampant in new york for a long time. i believe it's getting better now (we're in phase two of reopening), but that still doesn't mean that COVID is gone.\n  ","392446":"\n  i don't have many friends to begin with, so no. lmao. i keep a very small inner circle, and i only talk to maybe 4-5 people.\n  \n  this doesn't include coworkers, though. i have three coworkers with whom i talk semi-regularly. but we've become distant ever since the office closed.\n  ","392447":"\n  if they're spewing hateful\/oppressive\/discriminatory comments either online or IRL, if they're not putting the same effort into the friendship as i am and won't change their ways after discussing it, if they become rude or arrogant or entitled to certain things or friendships, and\/or if they're being manipulative and ab*sive.\n  ","392448":"\n  i don't generally go to the movie theater, haha. i don't think i've ever seen a movie long enough that required an intermission, tbh. i much prefer watching movies at home, where i can pause whenever i need to to get food and snacks, or use the bathroom without missing anything.\n  ","392449":"\n  i don't believe i have the update on my phone yet. i'm not entirely sure, i've been using my laptop to answer questions this evening.\n  ","392450":"\n  no, i haven't felt that way at all. i just have zero interest in pursuing a new relationship or even dating in general.\n  ","392451":"\n  eh, yes and no. i have a stable job and whatnot, but my mental health ranges between being absolutely amazing to being in the trash within the course of a few hours.\n  \n  i'm medicated now and i engaged in therapy for like, 2-3 years, but i still can't help but feel whatever mood swings i feel at any particular moment. i also recently dealt with a break up, so that has really f*cked with my emotions over the past few months.\n  ","392452":"\n  hi friends, my inbox is basically empty.\n  \n  send me some interesting\/appropriate questions. :'))\n  ","392453":"\n  honestly, i'm not all that picky. it really depends on my mood that day.\n  \n  i enjoy drinking beer, especially lagers and IPAs. as for liquor, my favorite is tequila but i also like light rum and amaretto. in addition, my favorite wine is sauvignon blanc.\n  ","392454":"\n  that's pretty questionable, lol. i do enough to get by, do my job efficiently, and pay my bills on time. that's all that really matters at the moment.\n  ","392455":"\n  yeah, i drink alcohol on a fairly regular basis.\n  ","392456":"\n  probably sometime in my early-to-mid 20s, when i was living my life to the fullest and going on vacations 2-3 times per year and was otherwise managing my mental illnesses well before i had a breakdown when i was 25 years old. i was working towards my bachelor's degree and felt extremely educated, and i was also writing a lot creatively.\n  ","392457":"\n  when i'm anxious, it feels as if my heart is beating out of my chest cavity. i get extremely overheated and sweat profusely. i get vertigo and light-headed. my mind races. my stomach churns and makes me nauseous. i can't breathe. etc etc.\n  \n  i used to be diagnosed with panic disorder, but i'm pretty sure it's in remission now because i haven't had a panic attack in quite a few months.\n  ","392458":"\n  LOL. again, the answer is a resounding no.\n  ","392459":"\n  i don't talk to people privately. if that's what you're aiming for, then you can kindly leave my page. this is a question and answer site, after all.\n  ","392460":"\n  no, i don't give those usernames out. askfm is the only place you can contact me.\n  ","392461":"\n  i have anxiety disorders, so my doctor prescribed me xanax to manage my symptoms.\n  ","392462":"\n  it isn't a fact, it is simply an opinion. regardless, thank you for the compliment.\n  ","392463":"\n  i'm not close to anyone in my family at all, and i only really see my aunts and uncles on holidays (sometimes, we've been seeing them less lately over the past few years). my aunt on my mother's side is probably the one to whom i'm closest.\n  ","392464":"\n  i appreciate the compliment.\n  ","392465":"\n  you asked me this already, lol. i said i was drinking coffee, listening to music, and perusing social media.\n  ","392466":"\n  i'm very picky when it comes to bars, and there are only two bars that i regularly visited before COVID-19 happened. the rest of the time, i preferred going to brewing companies since there are a lot on long island.\n  ","392467":"\n  i answered a similar question earlier, but my day has been okay. i managed to get through the work day just fine (i had enough work to keep me preoccupied), and i haven't done much since clocking out three-ish hours ago.\n  ","392468":"\n  thanks for the follow ~~\n  ","392469":"\n  you're speaking to me now.\n  ","392470":"\n  hello ~~\n  \n  i'm doing fine. i'm currently listening to music, perusing social media, and drinking coffee.\n  ","392471":"\n  there were quite a few people from my office who were furloughed because of COVID-19, we were losing revenue. i wasn't one of them, thankfully.\n  \n  the situation is slowly getting better in new york, and company-wise, we're making just as much money now as we were before COVID-19 hit new york state. i'm comfortable in saying that my job is very stable right now.\n  ","392472":"\n  i don't believe the popularity of social media would change much, because as much good there is on social media that people like to talk about, there are also others who feel comfortable to post the bad things that have happened to them as well. in fact, posting the bad things may make people more compassionate and receptive to others because it only proves that we're all human and endure similar struggles, even if the circumstances are different.\n  ","392473":"\n  no, if that was the case then i would have been unemployed months ago. i've been working remotely from home since mid-march.\n  ","392474":"\n  a perfect relationship, in my opinion, is a relationship where you have the same sense of humor so that you can enjoy the same things together, while also maintaining a distinction between both of your interests. while you share similar interests to some degree, it's also important to have different interests as well to maintain your sense of self outside of the relationship.\n  \n  relationships are also meant to be open and you should be able to communicate effectively with your partner, regardless of how awkward or difficult the topic is. your partner should ideally be open and responsive to what you have to say, and vice versa, and not restrict you from being your true, authentic self.\n  ","392475":"\n  it would be a small, quaint bar with a wooden bar stand, 5-10 taps behind the bar with a big mirror to make the space look bigger, and antique lighting hanging above the bar and within the bar itself. there would be a large outdoor seating area adorned with string lights and plants, with an interior design made of dark wood and metal (sorta industrial, but also modern). the bar stools would be cushioned with soft, velvet material and there would also be an area in the back where you can order simple bar food, like loaded fries or sliders or pretzels and dip.\n  ","392476":"\n  i've always been attracted to the idea of lestat from anne rice's vampire chronicles, haha. also, draco malfoy from the harry potter series and patrick bateman from american psycho.\n  ","392477":"\n  drinking three glasses of wine last night, followed by eight xanax pills before going to bed. it calmed me down following my mental breakdown, but i woke up horribly foggy and unstable this morning. i was unsure if i would be able to focus on the computer screen at work because i was so disoriented.\n  ","392478":"\n  i suppose happiness can be defined as being content, and possibly even joyful, with yourself and your surroundings. you're self-assured and have a direct idea of where you're headed in life, and you do everything in your power to complete your goals.\n  ","392479":"\n  my ex doesn't think i'm selfish, at least that i'm aware of, lol. if anything, he's described me as selfless because i dedicated myself fully to him.\n  \n  i've always thought i was selfish because, for one my parents instilled that idea in me from a very young age. i grew up convinced i was selfish and everything i did was self-serving without the consideration of other people. it's followed me through to adulthood and i still often think of myself without how it will affect other people.\n  ","392480":"\n  my day has been fine, although tiring. because of my breakdown last night, i woke up extremely exhausted and mentally\/physically unstable. i managed to make it through the entire work day, but i laid in bed for like two hours afterwards because i was mentally drained.\n  \n  i didn't even have dinner tonight, i'm simply not hungry. i'm just drinking coffee and trying to relax myself with calming music and social media.\n  ","392481":"\n  yeah, i miss my friends most of all. when this whole COVID-19 situation has calmed down, i'm definitely inviting a lot of friends over to the house and having a party, lol.\n  ","392482":"\n  i believe i am, yes.\n  ","392483":"\n  not so much anymore, no. i *was* terrified of it when it was at its peak in new york, especially when i was still working in the office, but now that i've been out a few times to the grocery store and pharmacy and hardware store, etc etc., i've calmed down a bit.\n  ","392484":"\n  mentally unstable, self-destructive, selfish, manipulative, and addictive. at the same time, i'm also very dedicated to both my work and my friends, creative, passionate, and emotional.\n  ","392485":"\n  my biggest dream\/goal\/aspiration is to publish a book, or at least a collection of essays and short stories.\n  ","392486":"\n  if i had to choose between the two, i would say pessimistic. however, i'm actually a realist more than anything else. i try not to be too optimistic or too pessimistic about anything, although i definitely do have my moments where my pessimism comes out.\n  ","392487":"\n  i would much rather read a novel, holding a physical book in my hand. staring at screens too much hurts my eyes, and it's much easier for me to read a physical book as opposed to an e-book or collection of online stories.\n  ","392488":"\n  this is actually a really difficult decision for me because i use both askfm and facebook equally, haha. i love answering questions on askfm, but i also enjoy sharing informative articles and memes on facebook.\n  ","392489":"\n  neither. i don't like flowers, and i'm not the biggest fan of chocolate. chocolate makes my stomach hurt.\n  ","392490":"\n  i don't collect either, lol. however, i recently bought two new pairs of sandals because i realized i only had one pair and a pair of flip flops for the summer.\n  ","392491":"\n  i'd choose cosmetics over jewelry. i only wear one necklace because i'm not the biggest fan of jewelry, and i also like applying makeup every so often because it makes me feel better about myself.\n  ","392492":"\n  i like sitting on the front steps or in the backyard and watching the rain fall and\/or a thunderstorm rolling through.\n  ","392493":"\n  most calming sounds ;\n  \n  -- crackling of a wooden campfire.\n  \n  -- rainfall on the windows and roof.\n  \n  -- the lord of the rings soundtrack.\n  \n  most irritating sounds ;\n  \n  -- construction happening while i'm trying to work.\n  \n  -- the squeaking of clean fruit or plastic bags against each other.\n  \n  -- cats pawing at boxes or pretty much any sort of plastic, lmao.\n  ","392494":"\n  gasoline, firewood, freshly brewed coffee, lavender, patchouli, dragon's blood incense, balsam, and freshly cut grass.\n  ","392495":"\n  i prefer savory flavors over sweet flavors. i prefer foods that have a hint of salt to them, like chips or pretzels, as well as spicy food. i've never been a fan of sweets.\n  ","392496":"\n  ???\n  \n  the only person who's interpreting it as sexual is you, my dude.\n  ","392497":"\n  when i order online, yes. however, i have a terrible habit of obsessively tracking delivery progress, LOL.\n  \n  when i text a friend, not so much. it also really depends on what i'm texting them about, because if it's about a serious topic, then i get extremely anxious while waiting for their reply.\n  ","392498":"\n  i feel lonely on occasion, but it's more of a mental loneliness than a physical loneliness. i'm home with either one or both of my roommates throughout most of the day, and while i'm working, i'm frequently in contact with my coworkers through messages or emails.\n  \n  my loneliness mainly comes late at night when everyone is sleeping and i'm just laying awake in bed.\n  ","392499":"\n  soft kitty fur (i'm currently watching a mainecoon and his fur is marvelous), wrapping my hands around a hot mug of coffee or tea, and soft sherpa blankets.\n  ","392500":"\n  disappointing my workplace and friends.\n  ","392501":"\n  robert downey jr., helena bonham carter, johnny depp, angelina jolie, natasha lyonne, and matthew grey gubler.\n  ","392502":"\n  now why would i give away my methods so quickly on social media? smh.\n  ","392503":"\n  i only watched the full first season, and then i think half of season two, but i enjoyed it. i wouldn't say that it lost my interest story-wise, but i ended up finding other shows to watch and completely forgot about it.\n  ","392504":"\n  that's fairly normal \u2014 there are certain types of beer and liquor that i can't drink because i had too much in the past and now i can't even smell it without wanting to gag, haha.\n  ","392505":"\n  sushi, lamb and rice and hummus platters, veggie burrito bowls, caprese salad, and scrambled eggs on english muffins.\n  ","392506":"\n  i would probably freeze up and not be able to say anything at all, haha. i'd ask for a picture and then run away in fear.\n  ","392507":"\n  probably, sure.\n  ","392508":"\n  lol, absolutely nobody wants to see that.\n  ","392509":"\n  hello \u2014 do you have a question?\n  ","392510":"\n  yes, we still talk most days out of the week, send snapchats, play video games together on occasion, etc etc.\n  ","392511":"\n  i support it wholeheartedly, it just isn't something i'm personally interested in.\n  ","392512":"\n  very rarely.\n  ","392513":"\n  no, your body reacts in different ways and not everyone cries. it doesn't invalidate their happiness at all, some people just don't cry when it comes to things like that.\n  ","392514":"\n  i would simply tell them.\n  ","392515":"\n  i don't know if i'm anyone's favorite, but i do have a few facebook friends who react to my posts and share them on a regular basis.\n  ","392516":"\n  i've never considered anyone to be a mentor in my life.\n  ","392517":"\n  the latter, i assume. people rarely approach me when i'm out in public.\n  ","392518":"\n  both. i like the feeling of being drunk, and i also like the taste of some drinks (like certain beers and especially tequila).\n  ","392519":"\n  if i set my mind to it, then maybe. i seldom drink water, though, it's a really bad habit and i should ideally drink more.\n  ","392520":"\n  i'm eating lunch rn.\n  ","392521":"\n  i've been suppressing my feelings and i've been drinking wine and i finally broke, lol.\n  ","392522":"\n  fiction mimics reality.\n  ","392523":"\n  having mental breakdowns on tuesday nights is the latest rage, haven't you heard?\n  ","392524":"\n  unsuccessful \u2014 i haven't done anything substantial at all.\n  ","392525":"\n  apparently they sorta straddle the concept of being alive and being dead.\n  ","392526":"\n  only towards my friends, sometimes. i put a lot of effort into my friendships.\n  ","392527":"\n  because i'm fat, obviously.\n  ","392528":"\n  because i was conditioned from an early age to think of myself as a piece of sh*t and it's

me telling askfm.\n  ","392532":"\n  well yeah, nature is obviously alive. it doesn't have the same level of intelligence as humans or animals, but that doesn't mean it isn't alive.\n  ","392533":"\n  i'd visit one of my friends who lives there and i'll let her show me around. :'))\n  ","392534":"\n  no, but people certainly take nature for granted.\n  ","392535":"\n  no, i don't care about my body hair. if i feel like shaving, then i'll shave. if i don't want to shave, then i won't shave.\n  ","392536":"\n  no, i'm just trying to survive at this point. it's better for me to try to take each day at a time, otherwise i get too overwhelmed with everything going on.\n  ","392537":"\n  because i'm mentally ill, prone to s*icidal ideation, have an alcohol problem, and if my body doesn't give out first then my mind definitely will.\n  ","392538":"\n  yeah, there's such a thing as internalized sexism where some women feel the need to blame other women or discriminate against other women because they've been taught to do so from an early age.\n  ","392539":"\n  i'd be surprised if i make it to the age of 40.\n  ","392540":"\n  women do not stigmatize themselves. the stigma and oppression women face have existed for centuries.\n  ","392541":"\n  because i have unhealthy coping mechanisms and alcohol is the easiest way for me to cope with them. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  \n  i've always been pretty open with this sort of thing, i've always had some sort of substance ab*se problem going on in the background. lately it's been alcohol.\n  ","392542":"\n  well considering i answered a very similar question today already (my answer was sushi), right now my new answer would be a bucket of margaritas.\n  ","392543":"\n  i answered a question, and it certainly wasn't flaunting.\n  ","392544":"\n  i don't pay much attention to things like that when i'm out and about. i really have ever gone out to see my friends, and that's it (even before COVID).\n  \n  in general though, women have always faced a social stigma simply because they're women.\n  ","392545":"\n  if i could afford it, i'd certainly design it but i would hire a group of people to actually build it.\n  ","392546":"\n  i can't even build a damn bench, let alone a computer.\n  ","392547":"\n  yeah, sometimes. my one friend is a pharmacy technician and always yells at me because i drink on my psychiatric medication, lmao. apparently the combination i'm on doesn't bode well with alcohol.\n  ","392548":"\n  nah, i would miss my friends.\n  ","392549":"\n  a hell of a lot less traumatic than it has been, lmaoo.\n  ","392550":"\n  selfie of the night ~~\n  \n  send me questions.\n  ","392551":"\n  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af\n  \n  i honestly can't even envision myself as a parent, let alone a grandparent.\n  ","392552":"\n  eh, i love spicy food but nothing overly hot. i'd say somewhere in between very spicy & not spicy at all \u2014 like moderately spicy, haha.\n  ","392553":"\n  probably !! i'm only human.\n  ","392554":"\n  they're transphobic, as well as you considering i've stated multiple times what my gender is.\n  \n  also, please stop posting on my page. i've already deleted everything else you've sent me over the past few weeks. hiding behind anon won't change that.\n  ","392555":"\n  yeah, in a lot of circumstances online you can't really evaluate the tone of someone's voice, you're only seeing the text on the screen. some people misconstrue messages for that reason.\n  ","392556":"\n  well yeah, who i am is the same regardless of whether i'm interacting with someone online or IRL.\n  ","392557":"\n  it doesn't affect me at all. i really couldn't care less about sex.\n  ","392558":"\n  youtube is a blessing.\n  ","392559":"\n  no, i barely have one these days thanks to psychiatric medication.\n  ","392560":"\n  i forget some nights, but most of the time i do remember, lol.\n  ","392561":"\n  i love this fluffy boy.\n  ","392562":"\n  all of the star wars movies, all of the indiana jones movies, the godfather, inception, and slumdog millionaire.\n  ","392563":"\n  not a problem at all !!\n  ","392564":"\n  perhaps she's just trying to respect you by not prying into the subject, considering it may be a sensitive topic?\n  \n  i'm honestly not sure, haha. i obviously don't know your mother or how she behaves, she may just be processing her own feelings about it.\n  ","392565":"\n  i'm fairly socially awkward, thanks to anxiety.\n  ","392566":"\n  i've never experienced that before.\n  ","392567":"\n  i could really go for some fresh sushi rn. that'd be the perfect gift.\n  ","392568":"\n  yes, askfm is a question & answer website. its purpose is to ask and answer questions.\n  ","392569":"\n  okay. this isn't a question.\n  ","392570":"\n  unless you have a question, you can leave my page.\n  ","392571":"\n  no, the only language i know is english.\n  ","392572":"\n  i don't particularly care.\n  ","392573":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","392574":"\n  LOL. you're the one on my page. if you're unhappy with my response, you have the freedom to leave.\n  ","392575":"\n  i don't give out likes upon request. additionally, you appear to have a substantial number of likes to begin with.\n  ","392576":"\n  eh, i don't disagree. i don't know very much about the animal breeding industry.\n  ","392577":"\n  honestly, i have no idea. but their fluff is incredible.\n  ","392578":"\n  angora rabbits !!\n  ","392579":"\n  i don't really get jealous these days, tbh. the only instance i can think of is when one of my \"favorite people\" is talking to other people but ignoring me (whether accidentally or purposely).\n  ","392580":"\n  increase ;\n  \n  -- mental stability.\n  \n  -- intelligence.\n  \n  -- confidence.\n  \n  decrease ;\n  \n  -- physical strength.\n  \n  -- alcohol tolerance (lol).\n  \n  -- selfishness.\n  ","392581":"\n  slender man and the chupacabra, most definitely.\n  ","392582":"\n  i've been heartbroken more than i've broken hearts (well, at least to my knowledge).\n  ","392583":"\n  i woke up at 7:00am for some reason (even though i didn't have to log into work until 9:00am), so i made breakfast and coffee and listened to music before i clocked in.\n  ","392584":"\n  uh ... wut. LOL.\n  ","392585":"\n  crossing my fingers for you !!\n  ","392586":"\n  ah, okay. your initial message made me think that your mother just assumed you were pregnant and scheduled a random blood test on your behalf, lol.\n  \n  either way, i hope things work out in your favor (whichever you decide).\n  ","392587":"\n  thank you ~~\n  ","392588":"\n  that seems a bit extreme for your mother to want to find out if you're pregnant through blood work, not going to lie. pregnancy tests are fast and easy, though. i recommend taking more than one because sometimes you can get a false reading.\n  ","392589":"\n  i have two roommates, both of whom are men.\n  ","392590":"\n  a pregnancy test is much easier than blood work, haha. i absolutely hate having my blood drawn.\n  ","392591":"\n  the needles themselves never bothered me. the most troubling part of getting a tattoo is sitting in the same position for hours at a time (at least for me, haha). i also hate when the tattoo gun goes over a nerve and i can't help but twitch -- it always makes me afraid that the artist is going to screw up a line, although they never have before.\n  ","392592":"\n  i honestly can't remember a specific incident. i don't really go around telling people what to do, and usually my friends take my advice into consideration if they *do* ask me for my input.\n  ","392593":"\n  my ribcage tattoo, most definitely. i knew it was going to be painful going into it, but i didn't realize the *type* of pain it would be. it was a searing hot, white pain that i've never experienced before.\n  ","392594":"\n  yes, most recently i was on a cruise ship to the bahamas last february. i've also spent some time on people's boats when i was much younger.\n  ","392595":"\n  i have seven tattoos at the moment.\n  ","392596":"\n  yeah, there are a lot of mom and pop shops around here, and i try to support local businesses as much as i can.\n  ","392597":"\n  i don't believe i've ever been inside of an antique shop before.\n  ","392598":"\n  eh, it depends on my mood. sometimes i prefer one over the other. when my roommate and i had the BBQ over the weekend, i had one of each (one cheeseburger and one hot dog).\n  ","392599":"\n  i prefer to listen, mostly because i don't like burdening people with my own problems and i prefer to face my problems on my own time without intervention. i'm always there for my friends when time\/mental state allows it.\n  ","392600":"\n  the only place i've seen the arrows is stop & shop, where i do my grocery shopping. and honestly, they make me so anxious because i'm terrified i'm going to go in the wrong direction, lmaoo.\n  ","392601":"\n  i send out questions on the rare occasion (usually on the weekend when i'm extremely bored). i try to ask interesting questions that will prompt interesting answers because i like reading them. i don't care at all for the coin system, it doesn't mean anything to me.\n  ","392602":"\n  get the rest of my entire body tattooed (granted i have the funds for it, at least). i would definitely touch up my ribcage tattoo and get a sternum tattoo, first and foremost. i've also always loved chest tattoos.\n  ","392603":"\n  i found my favorite flavor of arizona iced tea at 7-11 earlier today, if that counts for anything.\n  ","392604":"\n  i'd rather spend a weekend in a cabin in the woods with friends while we fish and BBQ some food. :'))\n  ","392605":"\n  i don't eat steak very often, but i prefer it medium rare with worcestershire sauce on the side.\n  ","392606":"\n  i would pay off all of my debt, purchase a new car for my roommate (because his car is ancient and always giving him problems), and probably put the rest of the money towards buying a house.\n  ","392607":"\n  not in recent years, no. i probably did this when i was much younger and less self-assured, and wanted the person to still like me regardless of what they've done. however, since then i've retained a bit of confidence in who i am and i don't allow people to use me in an effort to further their own reputation.\n  ","392608":"\n  it depends on the situation, because people choose to ignore the truth for a number of reasons. sometimes it can be because the truth is too painful for them to bear, so they ignore it or distance themselves from it in an effort to prevent themselves from feeling the pain.\n  ","392609":"\n  i'm not entirely sure, tbh. the things i want to do with my life aren't things that make me afraid. for example, i want to eventually buy a house or move into an apartment on my own, adopt animals, publish a book or two, etc etc. they don't frighten me, i just don't have the opportunity to do most of those things right now.\n  ","392610":"\n  i suppose my passion for the things i'm interested in, as well as how much hard work i allocate towards my job.\n  ","392611":"\n  no, i wouldn't. my family's opinion isn't valuable to me at all because i'm not close with my family. this has already happened to me in the past with my most recent ex -- they didn't like him and didn't want me to be with him because of things he had done in the past, but it never swayed my opinion.\n  ","392612":"\n  my aspirations to eventually become a published novelist in the future. i haven't exactly worked towards that goal, per say, because i've never started a novel. however, i do have a brilliant idea for a novel that i might want to write in the future once i find the motivation to expand upon the idea and write a timeline\/layout.\n  ","392613":"\n  -- i have a medical thing where i sneeze in bright sunlight or if i look directly towards the sun.\n  \n  -- i'm left-handed.\n  \n  -- i'm on four prescriptions for mental illness.\n  ","392614":"\n  cocaine, most likely. i tried it a few times when i was younger, and i don't think i'd ever try it again.\n  ","392615":"\n  i would rather have skin that changes colors based on my emotions !! it would be like a kaleidoscope because my moods change so often. :'))\n  ","392616":"\n  \"hey leigh, i don't advise drinking that entire bottle of bacardi in one night because you're going to feel horrible until 5:00pm the following day.\"\n  ","392617":"\n  thankfully, no. i am in debt but it isn't by very much because it's only student loans and a few credit cards.\n  ","392618":"\n  i like really hot showers, mainly because it helps the skin on my arms heal faster and hot water is very therapeutic to me. the temperature doesn't change unless it's a *very* humid day outside and i need cooler temperatures to really cool off during the summer.\n  \n  my showers usually last between 10-15 minutes.\n  ","392619":"\n  anons always love to pry into business that isn't their own -- it's just how they are, unfortunately. this is one of the more mild questions i've received, haha.\n  ","392620":"\n  unstable, media-oriented, artistic.\n  ","392621":"\n  i've never been camping before, and i also have never been to a hostel before (i think hostels are primarily a european thing?). however, my friends and i want to plan a camping trip later this summer if COVID allows it. :'))\n  ","392622":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","392623":"\n  i am very well aware of this, thank you.\n  ","392624":"\n  thank you ~~\n  \n  my day has been a bit terrible, not gonna lie. i feel really down right now, and i haven't felt this sense of emptiness in a few weeks. i'm trying to have a good day because it's beautiful outside, and i even ran to 7-11 to pick up some beverages and lunch, but i just feel very hopeless.\n  ","392625":"\n  no, i've never planted a tree before.\n  ","392626":"\n  i usually go any time i want my hair colored, which is between 4-6 months. however, because of COVID, the last time i cut and colored my hair was last november. :\/\n  \n  i've been trying to grow the long side of my hair out while keeping the shaved side to a 0 or 1 (buzzed), and i always see the same hair stylist. she's actually a close friend of mine who has had her license for quite a number of years.\n  ","392627":"\n  drink and smoke excessively.\n  \n  i don't exactly have the most positive coping mechanisms, so obviously i don't recommend this. it's just how i cope when i'm dealing with a terrible mood.\n  ","392628":"\n  i don't have a tiktok, but pretty much all of my friends have the app downloaded and watch them on a regular basis. my roommate has shown me a few & they were pretty funny.\n  ","392629":"\n  yes !! i love when helena bonham carter is in movies. :'))\n  \n  idk what it is about her, but she's so unique, attractive, and hilarious.\n  ","392630":"\n  rainfall.\n  ","392631":"\n  freshly brewed coffee, gasoline, and firewood.\n  ","392632":"\n  askfm, facebook, and snapchat.\n  ","392633":"\n  i just have seasonal allergies (pollen and stuff). which reminds me, i should probably take a zyrtec otherwise i'm going to be a sniffling mess by this afternoon.\n  ","392634":"\n  i've been lied to in a relationship, but the relationship itself wasn't built on a lie.\n  ","392635":"\n  you may simply be overthinking the situation \u2014 however, again this is something that has to do with trust, and if you're having these feelings then you may not trust your partner as much as you think you do.\n  ","392636":"\n  depends on what you mean by \"a lot,\" lol. mothers are more than just a mother, and they're entitled to have their down time and fun just like anyone else. if they want to take a vacation and see their friends, then they have the freedom to do so as long as they're not neglecting their child(ren).\n  ","392637":"\n  LOL. no, i've only ever had one dog and she was afraid of the doorbell ringing.\n  ","392638":"\n  scrambled eggs on an english muffin.\n  ","392639":"\n  i would say it's common, not necessarily normal. you should trust your partner to not be romantically\/sexually involved with their exes, so really a sense of jealousy shouldn't come up. perhaps you should explain these feelings to your partner.\n  ","392640":"\n  it isn't the first time i've been asked this question either, which is weird. but that's why i never give out what i make per hour \u2014 i know stupid anons will make a big deal out of it, whether they think it's too little or too much or whatever. it's no one else's business.\n  ","392641":"\n  i haven't !! i'll definitely have to look it up.\n  ","392642":"\n  i love the smell of freshly cut grass !!\n  \n  other scents i enjoy are gasoline, brewed coffee in the morning, chlorine, lavender, ocean water, firewood, and old books.\n  ","392643":"\n  i absolutely love your questions. ?\n  ","392644":"\n  lately i've been listening to ashnikko a lot, lol.\n  \n  \"hi, it's me\" by ashnikko ;\n  \n\n   https:\/\/youtu.be\/4o_IQavlMDA\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","392645":"\n  i've been on the beach at night,

LOL.\n  \n  i don't discuss my salary because i'd rather not have anons on my page talking about money. that has literally no correlation with lgbtq+ rights.\n  \n  i also don't believe in any gods\/goddesses, and my fears include enclosed spaces, speaking in public, and abandonment.\n  ","392648":"\n  my days are pretty set to a certain routine. i wake up between 7-8am, make breakfast, log into work at 9:00am, and then work until 5:30pm. afterwards, i feed the cats if no one has fed them yet, have dinner, shower, and then relax in front of the television.\n  ","392649":"\n  disgusting ass mayonnaise.\n  ","392650":"\n  as i've discussed before, i don't talk about finances on my askfm page. this includes my salary, my bills, my rent, etc etc.\n  ","392651":"\n  my friends are close and dear to my heart. i care about them more than most other things in my life.\n  ","392652":"\n  if my salary was $5,000\/year, i wouldn't be able to survive. lmaoo.\n  ","392653":"\n  yeah, i don't see why not. you're probably better off asking a man who's in a relationship, though.\n  ","392654":"\n  hopefully i'll be going camping with some friends. :'))\n  ","392655":"\n  not nearly enough as i would like, lol. however, i'm going to ask for another raise when the pandemic is over and we return to the office.\n  ","392656":"\n  he's pretty good. i recommend \"moral of the story\" and \"sloppy seconds.\"\n  ","392657":"\n  watsky \u2014 \"exquisite corpse\"\n  ","392658":"\n  i am very cozy rn ~~\n  ","392659":"\n  when i asked for questions for video responses, this isn't what i was asking for.\n  ","392660":"\n  ask me some questions & maybe i'll do video responses to them (as long as my roommate doesn't think i'm losing it, lmaoo).\n  ","392661":"\n  idk if i would consider it cute \u2014 especially in relationships. like, your partner is ideally supposed to take time out of their day to talk to you, regardless of how busy they may be. even a two-minute phone call can mean the world to someone.\n  ","392662":"\n  LOL. i wish more anons had that mentality.\n  ","392663":"\n  most definitely !! also, the askfm video camera is weird because it seems like it... elongates things? i can't explain it, but it makes me look super weird.\n  ","392664":"\n  thank you ~~\n  ","392665":"\n  lol, aw. there's no need to be anxious when sending me questions. if they cross a line, i'll simply tell you or i'll just delete the question. you don't seem like someone who would do that, though.\n  ","392666":"\n  ahh, thank you !! i'm still weirded out by showing my face because i look like a wreck 99% of the time, but perhaps i'll do some tonight ~~\n  ","392667":"\n  LOL. i mean, that has happened to me on only like one or two occasions. but i appreciate it.\n  ","392668":"\n  claustrophobia and a fear of speaking in public (not sure what that is technically called?).\n  ","392669":"\n  idk why everyone is being so nice to me today, ahah. thank you ~~\n  ","392670":"\n  aw, thank you !! i tend to receive backlash from it or just no response whatsoever if people decide to get testy with me, lol.\n  ","392671":"\n  haha, that's true. there are also political\/social figures who were also terrible people, but i can't think of any specific names rn.\n  \n  besides trump. but, ya know. lmaoo.\n  ","392672":"\n  i used to when i was much younger, but i haven't since i've been in my 20s. i leave it up to the professionals, ahah. i trust my hair stylist so much and she's the one who's been coloring my hair for the past few years. :'))\n  ","392673":"\n  idk, i don't really have many hobbies besides listening to music, writing, and playing video games, lol. i get asked some questions about them every now and again.\n  \n  when it comes to video games, i've been playing games since i was a child. i remember playing on my cousin's N64 and i think someone else in my family had the old NES console too. my first device was the original gameboy, and i played it constantly. then i got the gameboy advance and eventually i got the original xbox. i've been buying xbox consoles since then.\n  ","392674":"\n  i love singing, but i'm just terrible at it.\n  ","392675":"\n  when other people belittle, mock, or make fun of my friends.\n  ","392676":"\n  no, i've never attended a protest or rally before. large groups of people give me panic attacks, so as much as i want to go and show my support, it wouldn't be good for my mental health.\n  ","392677":"\n  they're touching paws. ?\n  ","392678":"\n  english \u2014 i majored in professional writing with a focus in english literature while in college, haha.\n  \n  i've always hated math, even though i grasped the topic pretty easily when i was in school.\n  ","392679":"\n  the space needle in seattle looks pretty interesting.\n  ","392680":"\n  as long as you're respectful, i'm more than happy to answer any questions you have. you seem really thoughtful and considerate !!\n  ","392681":"\n  aw, this is so sweet. :'))\n  \n  thank you for the questions !! i'm pretty much an open book so i'll answer basically anything, unless they're like sexual or trollish questions.\n  ","392682":"\n  i really have no idea. the whole thought of COVID still gives me anxiety, so i try not to think about it. i'm just keeping abreast of major news every now and again, such as the reopening phases. long island just entered phase two last week.\n  ","392683":"\n  they\/them are pronouns for people who don't identify as she\/her or he\/him. they're considered gender neutral pronouns.\n  \n  however, gender can't really be quantified because it exists on a spectrum. you have the two gender binaries (man and woman) and what exists in between. personally, i just identify as non-binary because i'm neither a man nor a woman.\n  ","392684":"\n  i drink alcohol.\n  \n  (note: obviously i don't recommend this. i have very unhealthy coping mechanisms.)\n  ","392685":"\n  honestly, i don't believe that's hyperbolic at all. this has had such a devastating impact on society and people's lives that it's weird to imagine things going back to what we thought of as \"normal.\"\n  \n  restaurants and bars have opened up with restrictions, for example. but i'm terrified to go because people don't really *have* to wear masks at their outdoor tables, which i think sorta defeats the purpose. idk.\n  ","392686":"\n  i honestly have no idea \u2014 if there will even be a sense of normalcy after this, too. i'm just trying to take each day as it comes.\n  ","392687":"\n  my emotions have been within the normal range that i usually feel on a weekly basis, lol.\n  \n  that also isn't saying much because i constantly fluctuate between being content to being sad to being irrationally angry to being paranoid. my racing thoughts haven't been as terrible and i haven't been manic in a few weeks, though.\n  ","392688":"\n  aw, thank you ~~\n  ","392689":"\n  i never said i expected people to know (IRL at least). when it comes to askfm, however, my gender is in my bio.\n  ","392690":"\n  people assume i'm cisgender when i'm not, lol. non-binary people can present as femme and that doesn't invalidate their gender.\n  ","392691":"\n  forensic anthropology. it has always been something i considered as a career choice alongside my writing career.\n  ","392692":"\n  the holocaust.\n  ","392693":"\n  idk, there's nobody whom i really look up to or aspire to be. i have always just focused on my own self improvement according to my own needs and pace.\n  ","392694":"\n  hello ~~\n  \n  not too much, i'm currently working. only two hours to go until i'm clocked out for the day. :'))\n  ","392695":"\n  i used to walk occasionally when i was working in the office, especially considering the parking lot was far away from the building and i'd also walk on my breaks.\n  \n  i haven't been physically active much at all since i started working from home, unfortunately. i haven't done anything to compensate for it, haha.\n  ","392696":"\n  i just use an over-the-shoulder bag when i go out.\n  ","392697":"\n  last week, i reminded my roommate that the garbage needed to be taken out to the curb when he got home from work, lol.\n  ","392698":"\n  being mesmerized by the flames, listening to music, and chatting with friends.\n  ","392699":"\n  zero. this is weird that i get this question so often \u2014 i'm pretty sure i answered this same question over the weekend.\n  ","392700":"\n  depends on how long i'm going to be out of the room. if i'm leaving the room to just go to the bathroom or something, then i'll leave the light on. otherwise, i always turn it off.\n  ","392701":"\n  i have it set to black at the moment, but i might change it up soon.\n  ","392702":"\n  i'm doing well. i decided to be unhealthy today & i ordered mcdonalds for lunch, LOL. i also got a mocha frappe, which i'm excited to drink.\n  \n  only 3.5 hours left of work to go !!\n  ","392703":"\n  alcoholic ; margaritas, mojitos, and IPA beer.\n  \n  non-alcoholic ; coffee and tea.\n  ","392704":"\n  these days, i spend more time at home (for obvious reasons). however, before quarantine i spent most of my time out of the house because of work. i would be out of the house from around 7:45am until 6:30pm.\n  ","392705":"\n  mosquitos and wasps \u2014 i'm terrified of getting stung by a bee.\n  ","392706":"\n  i'd rather never have to pay for food at restaurants !! i love eating out every now & again, and it would be great if all i had to do was tip the server, lol.\n  ","392707":"\n  i usually enjoy drawing and painting, but i seldom do it.\n  ","392708":"\n  it was once considered the \"epicenter\" of COVID cases, unfortunately. last week, we entered phase two of re-opening so now bars and restaurants and other small businesses can begin opening up again with certain restrictions.\n  ","392709":"\n  that was my thinking too. i also don't want to over-exert myself right off the bat. i'll probably start going only twice per week and then increase depending on how i'm feeling\/progressing.\n  ","392710":"\n  most definitely. i felt good that i was contributing to my health and losing weight.\n  \n  after gyms open back up again after COVID is over, i'm probably going to go back and start little by little. i'm extremely out of shape so i'm thinking of starting small instead of jumping right into it.\n  ","392711":"\n  somewhat, yeah. i enjoyed the aftermath of it more than actually exercising itself, lol.\n  ","392712":"\n  depends on my mood. because of quarantine and staying inside for about three months now, i've been aching to go out, lol.\n  \n  some restaurants and bars are open with outdoor seating, but i'm still wary because no one has to wear a mask at their table and everywhere just seems super crowded.\n  ","392713":"\n  i've never stayed in an airb&b before, but the homes my friends have stayed in have been super cute. i'd definitely jump on that opportunity.\n  ","392714":"\n  i don't follow people simply because they told me that they've followed me. i only follow a small number of people.\n  ","392715":"\n  yeah, i sometimes drink red bull. i prefer it over monster and other energy drinks.\n  ","392716":"\n  besides refilling my cup of coffee, i just finished writing a magazine article for work.\n  ","392717":"\n  i used to go to the gym, but that was way before the coronavirus even started. i stopped going last summer or so because i lost the motivation.\n  "}}
