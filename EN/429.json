few years ago and it made her have an even bigger falling out with her biological dad . there s probably more resentment since she found him cheating as a young kid .","397050":"if you two never talked about marriage at all and they went behind your back to ask then i feel like that could be disrespectful . you should really talk about marriage with the person way before they ask you . or you ask them ! it s a nice gesture but obviously outdated at the same time . either way , at the wedding they d give you away so i just view it in that way ? it s their blessing . i feel like if the parents and the soon to be bride groom didn t get along at all then f ck even asking to begin with lol . hopefully both are adults and can make their own decisions on the best way to move forward . there s a lot of different wedding etiquette to be looked at . i think it would be a better surprise to tell parents you got engaged instead of all we knew kind of thing but i don t really see getting their blessing a bad thing either . personally , i could careless what my dad had to offer up but knowing what my mom thought would be nice . clearly , i d know ahead of time on her views on the s o

insulin resistance , but they are different medical conditions . in case of ir , the beta cells will keep producing insulin . even after the muscle and fat cells become resistant to insulin , the pancreas will keep producing more insulin to help the body cells absorb the glucose that has accumulated in the bloodstream . on the other hand , diabetes occurs when the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin or the body becomes resistant to insulin . however , in the long run , ir can lead to prediabetes , which , if not treated , can progress to diabetes . there is no evidence to show why some people develop insulin resistance while others develop a sensitivity to insulin .","397319":"wonderful","397320":"why are you sharing your cat s pooping schedule ?","397321":"arm and leg wouldn t
