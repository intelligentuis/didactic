  Of course I believe in it.
  
  I just don't think it exists for me, most of the time.

600885,"

  "
600887,"

  Probably split pretty evenly between the PC and phone, generally. Since I don't leave the house too often, the PC probably gets more use when the balance tips.

  I don't eat ice cream often, but when I do...I like it to have lots of various tastes and textures.
  
  So crumbled up cookies...or cereal...both great, mixed in.
  "
600889,"
   What are your thoughts on Hollywood running good movies in the ground with crappy sequels? For example, the Transformers franchise.
  ","
  First of all, it's not like Transformers are the pinnacle of filmmaking.
  
  Whether it's the original animated film from 1985, which was produced solely to sell toys, or the first live-action entry in the newer franchise.
  
  It's all popcorn-selling, heavily stylized action fare, with very little real substance.. which is what general audiences like.
  
  And that's the rub.
  
  You're blaming ""Hollywood"". Hollywood makes ALL the movies, indiscriminately...good or bad...because that's what goes on there.
  
  If you want to blame someone, blame general audiences.
  
  They're the ones giving those films literally billions of dollars, which is what allows sequels to be made.
  
  Studios are businesses, and businesses like making money...so if the general audiences show they're willing to pay the money...the sequels and spin offs are going to keep coming.

   Do you sleep with our feet under the blanket? Or not?
  ","
  I can't keep a blanket over any part of me, when I sleep.
  
  I run too hot.
  "
600895,"
   What's your lucky number?
  ","
  I don't have a ""lucky"" number, because I don't believe in luck, unless it's bad.
  
  But I do enjoy the number 8, because it's an infinity symbol.
  "
600896,"
   Do you enjoy drama?
  ","
  No, and people who do, bug me.
  
  Just go watch a movie or tv show...maybe reality shows, if that's the desire...that's what they're made for.

   When is the last time you built a snowman?
  ","
  Winter, 2017
  "
600904,"
   are you spontaneous or do you prefer to plan things in advance?
  ","
  Not really either one. I'm not a planner, at all. Don't make lists for the future, or dreamboards or any of that. But I also don't decide, on a whim, to just do random things like fly to a distant place, or talk to strangers, or whatever else is  classified as spontaneous. I live in the moment, but do things after a bit of thought.
  "
600905,"
   As a child, did you have an imaginary friend (or friends)? What were they like?
  ","
  I had a fuzzy dragon friend named Bobby. I'm pretty sure he's still around, I just don't refer to him by name, anymore.

  I do, yeah. Mostly snakes, but various lizards and such are cool, too.
  "
600908,"
   how do you delete questions?
  ","
  Slide them to the left, you'll see a trashcan. Press to delete. This also where you'll see 3 dots, pressing those allows you to block or report people.
  "
600909,"
   how many questions are in your inbox right now?
  ","
  Just this one..and now it's gone too. 😊
  "
600910,"
   Depression is winning tonight
  ","
  Sorry to hear that. Advice from strangers is rarely wanted, or useful, but in hopes of helping...
  
  Try to busy your brain and hands with a creative pursuit, or even some type of cleaning, maybe with music playing. Anything you can focus on, that allows you to get out of your own head. Just a suggestion. Hope you feel better.
  "
600911,"
   Do you have a workout or exercise routine ?
  ","
  No. I definitely should, but I dont.
  
  I stretch each morning, but that's the extent of my routine.
  "
600912,"
   Do you follow people to unfollow them ?
  ","
  No? Who does that? What a waste of time & energy.
  "
600913,"
   Are You A Genius
  ","
  Not by a longshot.
  "
600914,"
   Craziest thing you've ever done ?
  ","
  The only thing that comes to mind is walking on the edges of tall buildings, bridges, or truss, with no safety lines...which, in retrospect...was a stupid thing to do. Kids will be kids, eh?
  "
600915,"
   Do you like Jazz music ?
  ","
  Sometimes. I like a little or a lot of most existing genres, and jazz is no exception. But it's not something I listen to, regularly.
  "
600916,"
   Do u ever wonder what u was in your past life ?
  ","
  No, because that concept is not one I adhere to. I don't judge people for believing in it, but it's just not the way I think.
  "
600917,"
   When people say no offense, do you get more offended or does it lessen the blow?
  ","
  I think it's a copout disclaimer used by wishywashy people who absolutely mean to offend, but are too cowardly to do it, outright.
  
  Obviously, there may be some nuance to it, with some people, but I find it generally distasteful, and think people should just say what they mean.
  "
600918,"
   Have you ever felt hated by others/someone before? If yes, when was it? and why?

  Felt it? Not that I remember. I feel like people throw the concept of hate around, a bit too freely. I have definitely been disliked by people, at various times, and was made aware of it, but not pure hatred, for any reason.

  I certainly do, but not something I go into, unless I'm very comfortable with a person, and feel an intense connection with them.

  I have never, will never sign up for, or seek out TikTok.
  
  I don't mind watching interesting content from it, once it's been posted to Instagram or YouTube. But I find the app, itself, to be a trendy annoyance...and possibly dangerous, if some of the press about it is true.
  
  At any rate, it's difficult enough to keep up with the social media I'm already on...I don't need more.

  Why would that be weird? Age shouldn't be a defining factor in whether you like or relate to a person. I'm in my mid-40s, and most people I talk to on here are in their late 20s-early 30s.
  
  Obviously there are limits, if you start getting creepy about it, and the people are under 18, but if you mean purely liking people as people...I don't see the issue.

   whats left you want to try?
  ","
  I can't think of any specific food items I'd like to try, but that doesn't mean there aren't any...just that my brain isn't fully functioning, yet. I'd like to try roasting an entire pig, using the island method. That's where you dig a firepit, line it with lava rocks and banana leaves, put the pig in the ground also covered with banana leaves...and slow roast it.
  "
600973,"

  While it is of course a constantly ongoing work of art, in my opinion...the bulk of it was done the first 2 weeks of living here.

   have you seen the german series ""dark""? thoughts? i dont typically ever watch series but i did see that one.
  ","
  I have it, and have heard amazing things about it, so it will definitely get watched, eventually. The primary hurdle is that I like to multitask while I watch things...drawing, sculpting, dusting, whatever. That's nearly impossible to do with a subtitled series, and I just haven't taken the downtime, yet, to get through it. I know there's a dubbed version, but those are typically terrible, and not the version I have, anyway.
  "
600979,"

  I wouldn't really know, because I can't be friends with myself, and I don't ask. I've been told I am a very good friend, but I do wonder if that's just a nice thing people say. I'm not very emotionally present, I'm extremely ADHD, (non-diagnosed), and I generally prefer being alone, to the company of even close friends.
  
  I would do anything for my 2 closest friends, and can be helpful, whenever possible, to friends, online. But overall, I'd say I'm simply middle-of-the-road.
  "
600985,"
   whats on the docket my friend?
  ","
  I don't usually know the full list until Friday, which is the day my roommates and I paint together and watch things. However, on alternating Fridays, we play D&D, so no painting or movies, this coming Friday. Therefore, movies will be watched Saturday, while I draw or sculpt. For reasons related to the above, I don't watch movies that would go on that list, and stick to quieter, more indie type fare. This weekend will probably be ""Malcolm & Marie"", ""The Little Things"", and "" In and of Itself"".

  "
600990,"
   did you ever want kids or entertain the idea?
  ","
  Nope. Never been a fan of the idea, at all. I could give philosophical reasoning,  like the fact that the planet is already overpopulated and so filled with chaos, that I think bringing children into it is selfish and dangerous...but the fact is, I'm just not a kid person. I tolerate them when necessary, particularly the older ones who can play video games or who are creative...but little kids just kind of annoy me.
  
  I'm well past the prime age for that, anyway.

  I don't really eat in an adventurous manner. While I'm always willing to try something new, I don't get many opportunities to do so. Mainly, I'm just a chubby food-lover who enjoys eating. I'd say the most out-of-the-box food I've had recently was beginning to enjoy burgers with a soft-fried egg on them. That's a pretty normal thing, in comparison to most, but it was something that I just hadn't ever done, and I was missing out.

  Ah, ok. Never really seen it before, but I'm pretty out of touch with the general public. Interesting that pointing is still considered rude. Never understood that concept. But definitely no knuckle pointing, where I am.

  Well, I have obviously passed the psych exam and prepared us for a bright, bold future...where tiny people rule the world.

   I mean, hypothetically, he's either going to the grill or he's going to want it, he can't do anything.

  ","
  Herniated discs, pinched sciatic nerve, displaced hip, and shoddy knees. So...yeah.
  "
601026,"
   what if our little friend wants to be swallowed alive instead of being grilled?

  Why would he want that? Is he suicidal or is this some strange, tiny people kink? We have the makings of a pretty solid B-horror film, here.

  I don't eat anything alive. Not a fan of raw meat. of any type.

601030,"
   for example, on a forest trip alone, you saw one on the floor, what would you do to it?
  ","
  I think if I'm in the forest. there would already be plenty of other wild food to hunt. Deer, boar, etc. So I'd save the little guy, since he obviously had the determination to escape his farm. Are we assuming this race of tiny food people have at least a passable intelligence level? Maybe I'd teach him survival techniques, and he'd eventually become the savior of his people. So many possibilities!

  Nope.

  I wouldn't eat the pet, of course. But no reason not to eat the others. Same logic as the previous. People have pet chickens and pigs...but they still eat other ones.

  ","
  I imagine they'd be raised for that specific purpose...just like cows, pigs, chickens, etc.
  
  Very few people consider the moral implications of any of that, so in this obvious fantasy world created by your scenario, why would it matter? Not like I invented this idea. People have eaten other people for millennia.

  Hrm, that's a tough one. The first time I met members of the band GWAR, I was surprised at how intellectually profound they could be, although I'm not sure why.

It's always a shame when you meet someone who you respect, immensely, for their work...but in that moment, as just people, they disappoint you.

  That's certainly a factor. I don't have the opportunity, the motivation, nor the desire to meet anyone in real life.
  
   Online is the push of a few buttons, and some typing. Much faster, more convenient, and safer for those who may worry about that. Plus, it gives us a chance to meet a wider variety, instead of the small pool surrounding some of us. Hence, the idea of connection can be made with much more diverse and interesting people, as opposed to those already in your bubble or area.

  I live in one of those little towns.
  
   Can't speak for anyone else, but I personally prefer it to the droning chaos of city life, or the in-between state of mid-sized towns that will eventually become more of the same.
   
    Small town life is quiet and cleaner and safer, and just generally more enjoyable to me.

   Which Actor played the best Batman? And which played the best Joker?

  Mark Hamill is my favorite Joker voice, but Heath Ledger is my favorite live-action Joker.
  
  Jack Nicholson is great, as is Caesar Romero, but both a bit campy.
  
  I liked Joaquin Phoenix, but that's barely the Joker, to me.
  
  Batman is a lot more difficult.
  
  I think Ben Affleck has been the most accurate, but obviously, the movies he's in aren't super beloved. Maybe that will change with The Snyder Cut of Justice League.
  
  Of the others...I'm tempted to say Keaton, but that would be a nostalgia pick. He kinda sucked as Bruce Wayne, and his Batman was stiff and couldn't really fight.
  
  I honestly don't think we've ever had a perfect Bruce Wayne/Batman combo in live action.
  
  I'm fairly stoked to see what Robert Pattinson does with his Year 2 portrayal, though.

  Controlled breathing is the best advice I have.
  
  It calms the body and the mind at the same time.
  
  Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and inhale slowly, counting to 6, then exhale slowly. with the same 6 count.
  
  Repeat this, and focus strictly on the counting, and breathing.

   Have you ever tried drugs in your life ?
  ","
  I've tried almost every illicit drug in existence, as well as a number of pharmaceuticals, for recreational use.

  I stopped doing all of it by the time I was in my early 30s.

   When I say seperate, I mean two different things rather than one, they have relationships of course.

  Some folks are just like that, I guess. Or maybe a money situation. Good ink ain't cheap, and cheap ink is rarely good, as they say.

601329,"

601330,"
   That is entirely fair, and makes a lot of sense. also, ow to the nips. I've wanted a lot of piercings, but I've always been afraid to get them. like, Im 22 years old and I JUST got a cartilage piercing. still just a single lobe and now my cart. i want more. but also more ink

  I think piercings are great if you have the time and motivation to take care of them, and are careful with them. Most people I know who have them seem to do a better job of it than I ever did. I was kind of wild, at that point.
  
  Tattoos, I love. Gave myself my first one when I was 16, and have slowly amassed another 12 professionally done pieces, since then...with plans to get more, after all the craziness in the world has calmed down a bit.
  "
601331,"
   Wow! that was a lot of piercings! If you don't mind my asking, why do you think you got bored of all your others?
  ","
  It's actually a combination of things. The eyebrow, bridge and nipple piercings were getting caught on shirts, and getting yanked all the time...and I actually ended up getting my nipples ripped out in a moshpit.
  
  The oral piercings were destroying my teeth, so I got rid of those.
  
  My cartilage and industrials were all so cramped together,  they never healed properly even after over a year, and were keeping me from sleeping.
  
  And then my septum just got annoying whenever I had a cold.
  
  It was all just too much effort.

   I mean can the sound of a jammed radio be considered beautiful? If the matter of taste is completely relative, it can.
A banana peel taped to a board gets sold for a hundred thousand dollars as a form of art... Is it just a matter of taste?
  ","
  Taste is always a highly subjective thing, of course. Some niche enjoyment may completely bewilder most people, but if one person likes it...I suppose it counts.
  
  When it comes to art, like the whole banana thing...that may rely more on notoriety of the artist influencing reaction...but I have to assume someone, somewhere enjoys it.

   Really? That’s awesome! I think snakes are cool, I would like to maybe get one in the far future, but I would feel bad feeding it live mice and stuff😂 I would love to cuddle with one to be honest lol
  ","
  The feeding is definitely the hardest part for most people. If you get a smaller snake, you can mostly get around the live food. They'll eat ""pinkies"" which are frozen baby mice that you just thaw out, and many small snakes will just eat insects, which are a little easier to handle, if you get weirded out by the other stuff.
  "
601377,"
   That’s awesome, I think snakes are pretty cool, I don’t know many of the breeds tho:/
  ","
  I mainly love red-tails because of their interesting markings...but there are tons of other cool ones. Also, never let anyone tell you they aren't cuddly or loveable. While some breeds are more standoffish, a lot of the boas and pythons have a lot of personality, and love being petted and loved.

  To be perfectly honest, I've been ghosted by the last two women I thought fit well with me...so maybe I just need to stop bothering.

  ","
  Long questions deserve long answers...
  
  I think we should assume this is a one way/one world situation, so I won't choose the world...that seems a bit much.
  
  So, first off...drones exist.
  
  I'd send one through, and assuming the tech stayed working, I could see exactly what I'm dealing with, on the other side.
  
  Further assuming the portal hasn't closed yet, and the world looks safe and fun, I would absolutely walk through...because why waste the chance, right?
  
  I would hope I could get back, since a cursory examination might not reveal all sorts of hidden dangers..but if not, I'd make the best of it.

  An octopus walks into a bar, and says: ""I can play ANY musical instrument in this place!""
  
  A resident rocker walks up and hands him a guitar, which the octopus plays...as if he were Hendrix, Satriani, and Vai, combined.
  
  Then the bar piano player offers his seat, and the octopus slides in and tickles the keys as well as Ray Charles, Elton John, or Mozart.
  
  As he finishes up, a Scotsman staggers up, and lobs a set of bagpipes toward him.
  
   The octopus looks at first confused, then excited, and fumbles around a bit.
   
    The angry Scotsman says: ""What's wrong, ye leggy bastid...can ye no play it?""
    
    Wide-eyed, the octopus looks up and says: ""Play it?!?! I'm gonna f**k her brains out, when I get her pajamas off!""

   What was it about moving back home that made you realize it for the first time?
  ","
  Growing up I was around a lot of other families that had the same sense in security just show in different ways so i didnt have exposure to other ways of life. So, i had to go into the real world. I really wanted to get some life experience but i was naive to think i knew enough because i didnt, it was a cultural shock for me. I learned how majority of family households were like & to the point where i made myself look like an asshole because of how shocked i was that there parents would judge them. I created a lot of enemies due to my ignorance of how my family was a part of a certain demographic. So, i didnt realize how much of my anxiety came from that until i moved back with him. & thats why now ive been sticking to that demographic because envy makes people impulsive so i have to be around other people who have equal or more in order to feel safe.
  "
601498,"
   That sounds beautiful. What do you think makes finding security like that again impossible?
  ","
  Well, there’s judgement everywhere we look. There’s people telling other people who they should and shouldn’t be. Theres so much pain around us. & honestly not that many people out there are like my dad who was beyond selfless & wanted us to be exactly who we wanted to be and believed in our dreams or passions. He truly understood individualism. There’s not many people like my dad who actually put in the hard work to become successful in order to give his kids this sort of utopia so they can be secure in themselves. he knew how to embrace our strengths & build and strengthen our weaknesses.
  
  It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows though. Trauma diluted all the great things he was doing but I didn’t realize that the only person thats ever made me safe to be me was my dad until i moved back home when i was 22.
  "
601499,"
   did you like him as a teacher?
  ","
  He was the best teacher I’ve ever had. He made me believe in myself as a writer and an out-of-box thinker. He let me have a creative freedom. I will never forget the time when he had me come see him after class and he says, “this was an outstanding essay from a writers point of view, you’re a natural writer but from a college essay youd fail.” & he spent extra time with me teaching me the perfect formula for essays & i have gotten perfect scores on my essays ever since that I actually made money writing them for some friends. He truly believed in me and believed in my voice - ill never forget him honestly.
  "
601500,"
   Can you define the security you felt?
  ","
  It felt like nothing could go wrong, like everyone in the world wasn’t suffering. I could do anything. I could be anyone. It was safe to be exactly who i wanted to be and i was free to embrace it. It was encouraged in fact. It was the only time when freedom really was free (for me lol)

  ","
  The family that lives there had me over a few years ago cause they wanted to meet someone from the family of the man (my father) who built the house because they just wanted to know how he built it & where he got all his ideas, especially the bridge he made that was 50ft high and 30ft long connecting the front yard to the complete other side of the mountain. While I was there I was sad that it wasnt ours anymore but i was watching the kids play and they were using everything my dad built & i knew that it was supposed to be passed on for other families to give there kids an awesome experience growing up.

They cant even get proper food. They are forced to use soil with residue of radiation. They cant even have pain medication even though the radiation is causing insane disabilities and cancers. There’s hospitals filled with children that are given up, left in a dumpster, or on the hospital doorstep just because these kids are disabled due to the radiation & all they do is just basically tie up the babies and kids to chairs with bedpans under them and these kids start to go crazy and the hospital is just waiting for all of them to die.

  • able to recognize more possibilities.
  
  • can think abstractly - sarcasm promotes conceptualization.
  
  • they can see right through you
  
  • great at problem solving
  
  • equipped with key social skill for modern times
  
  • have thick skin
  
  • healthier brains - studies show that someone who cant recognize sarcasm has early onset dementia.
  
  • makes the people around them smarter
  
  • deliver an insult & make you laugh
  
  • have friends that truly love them.

   What is the weirdest thing you have seen in someone else’s home?
  ","
  When i was a little kid i had a playdate with one of the neighbors. Never hung out with her before. So she was giving me a tour of her house and she takes me down this small dark hallway that led to like a door youd see in a horror movie like in Saw. It was rusty metal with bars on the window and about three locks on the outside. You could see a little bit inside from the window even though it was tinted but since the light was on i could see power tools and saws were actually hanging from the ceiling. She points at it and says, “this is my dad’s dungeon. Nobody except him is allowed to go inside it. He’s in there right now.” I looked at her and asked, “have you seen inside it?” And when she shook her head no my survival instincts started going & i just remember i made some sort of excuse to call my other friend to come hang out so we would have a reason to leave.
  
  I will never forget how dark and sinister the door looked or the feeling i got inside my stomach.
  
  Everyone thought this family was a little strange but i dont think anyone really understands HOW strange though..

  You know, people say their nervous to go outside or back to normal life because of infection but I’m terrified because I dont know what’s going to happen when people can be around each other again. Everyone is at home filling up their minds with the media, news, & subliminal messages in shows/movies. They are teaching you how to think. They even want to change your language so they can tell you how to speak. There has been an increase in hate crimes since everyone has been locked inside, but nobody is talking about it. There’s so much hateporn all over social media. Suicide rates are increasing, but nobody wants to talk about that either or about how drug addiction is way too high. Everyone is all on edge & I’m terrified what that means for the public entirely.

   What quote resonates with you more then any other?
  ","
  “They never planned for the future. They weren’t supposed to get old and we were never supposed to grow up. The lost, unwanted, and the abused came here with the purest of intentions, to build a place where there would be no rules, other than a peaceful existence. There are no couples for them. For them, there is only the moment. They tried to raise us to be perfect in their perfect new world and for a moment, maybe it worked. But I think they finally saw their own shortsightedness and failure in us. We always saw it in them. They attempted to unlearn jealousy, want, and hate, to not possess anything, including each other. They tried to free themselves from materialism, but soon they were drowning in it. Finally we saw failure in each other and everyone was looking for a way out.”

601635,"
   what do you wish you could make people understand?
  ","
  I wish people had more of a deeper compassion for others suffering. I think people consciously can understand someone else’s suffering - even though a lot of people choose not too. I wish people were better at taking themselves outside of themselves and focus on someone else’s pain. Once you’re capable of doing that it’s hard to be angry at anyone because their actions seem to align with their suffering - a lot of times its not about you. So, I wish people would stop making themselves out to be a victim when someone is acting out due to pain/suffering. If someone hurts you just remember they did it because they were hurting and once you understand their hurting (because everyone knows what its like to hurt) you’ll be able to move forward. Also, don’t demonize those who do drugs because they are doing them out of pain. So many different variations of pain but its always about pain nevertheless.

   What's your thought on forgiveness?
  ","
  I am really good at forgiving others, but that doesn’t mean I forget. I believe that people are capable of change & i also believe in not forcing change either. It’s looking deeper into the context of why someone would have done the actions theyve chosen. Its having a deeper understanding & compassion that humans are always going to make mistakes & usually those mistakes are the effect of something caused in their life. Everyone goes through pain & suffering in their own way. It manifests in different ways. But, i can forgive every single way because I understand what its like to do something hurtful or mean out of anger & pain.

   3. With such a low bar for whites committing hate crimes, it becomes skewered, statistically. So while whites may commit more ""racial hate crimes"", blacks commit more violent crimes in proportion to each group's population.

   2. Re: Hate crimes. You have to remember that hate crimes are calculated differently for whites versus other races. If a black man shoots a Hispanic man dead, it's called inner-city violence. If a white man kills either/both men above, there's a serious chance of it being charged as a hate crime.

  Oh yeah... its always classified as “gang related” that’s a very good point.

   Homogeneity versus racial diversity. However, the concept applies more strongly to some cultures than others. Example: Sweden. Once one of the lowest-crime nations in Europe due to a largely homogenous population, since ""refugees"" started being admitted in the last 6-7 years, crime has skyrocketed.

   There's no need to be politically-correct about it. A more diverse population increases the proportion of poorer individuals. An element of criminality comes with that desperation.
  ","
  Even when the population numbers of certain places are the same, yet when one is more diverse then the other, what does that mean? Also, most hate crimes are done by white people. If a city is primarily white theres not a lot hate crimes so the crime is a lot lower. They are also saying hate crimes are increasing ever year..

  No, because he was supposed to marry his girlfriend but she ended up passing away over a year ago so i kinda moved on from crushing on him cause i thought i had zero chance.

  When I was in High School I was on the cross country team and there was this guy who was on the varsity team. He looks like Zac Efron (no joke) and I remember when i first saw him running without his shirt on. Omg. And when we had to go to our first race and he sat right next to me. So thats how i met him. After that, we started running together. We actually became really close. Met up at the beach constantly to tan together & at the time i had no idea that he really liked me but because i thought he was out of my league it made him think i didnt like him. So he started dating another girl, she was a sweetheart i was really happy for him. We still met up and went out to eat on occasions but then he moved so i stopped hanging out with him. We actually still text all the time & i am going out to eat with him when im in san diego. I didnt realize until right now how close he and i are... and how hes been a big part of my life for a long time.. whoa.

  Yes, i have. I have spent some time with someone who suffers from schizophrenia. Its really hard to have a conversation with someone with severe symptoms. A lot of things they would say doesnt make sense because of their delusions. They start to talk as if they are talking to someone else. They will randomly freak out but i always assumed they saw something scary. Its really sad cause they dont live that long when it gets this severe. They cant tell whats real and what isnt anymore and a lot of them commit sui.cide or just drink or do drugs till they die once they get to that point. The most difficult part is the medication only works for so long but its common for them to believe that they are being poisoned and theyll stop taking their medication.

   Hello haw are you doing today
  ","
  Social media is bad for anyone who’s unsure with themselves. They get easily effected by anyone who dislikes or disagrees with them. It’s causing so many people to start growing insecurities because of someone else’s insecurities. We need to stop comparing ourselves to everyone. No wonder so many people feel like its them vs the world.

   You don’t have to be insane to be afraid of death. Most people who aren’t afraid of death probably aren’t on death row. So, who’s more likely to be suicidal a younger person or a mid age person?
  ","
  It honestly depends on what country you’re looking at.
  
  Japanese are not afraid of death like at all so their suicide rate is high for all ages.
  
  But in America, theres been an increase in 40 & up committing suicide since 2019, but since 2018 ages between 10-34 have been pretty steady, little increase and little bit of decrease. They honestly dont have statistics for just under 21.
  "
601965,"
   I think the older a lot if people get, the crazier they get. Not everyone, but many people will begin to see the issue in their life/world and not care if they die or live. Or they start hating the world more than a lil kid would.
  ","
  The statistics of people who are truly insane and truly aren’t afraid of death is about 8% (i used to study this) but even people on death row (you can watch on youtube) start to fear death once they are put in prison. A lot of them say they deserve to die & they turn to a religion because they admit they are afraid.
  "
601966,"
   I’m starting to believe a lot of people lose their fear of death by 21.
  ","
  I think people gain more fear once they hit the age 21. Under 21 people usually feel fearless, maybe even careless. Haven’t you watched a kid run around play? Its like they always have some sort of death wish. Think about how rebellious teenagers can get. They are always so anxty that they dont give a fu.ck and thats why there’s quite a lot of sui.cides of young people. Kids are super resilient and can endure quite a lot of pain. Once you become an adult you start to feel more of the pain and you become afraid of all it. Afraid of death, losing someone, & the pain that might come from right before you die. The difference with adults is they just become more cautious - its not because they lost their fear of death. Especially the elders, why do you think majority of people that fill up a church are our older generation? Because they are afraid of death and want comfort about what comes after. Its the same reason why parents have become bubble wrapping sheltering helicopters.. they are afraid of losing anything. We live in a society that created a fear of death. If nobody is afraid to die then all these multimillion dollar companies, corporations, hospitals, pharmaceuticals, ect will lose power.

  Demons, the darkness inside everyone’s soul. We all got our own monsters lingering inside us, the heart beat is the evil knocking asking to be let out and be free. They say that the world is evil and full of sin, and we were born innocent, but the world’s air is what we breath to keep us alive, water makes us healthy, and land that keeps us dry. The only reason we have destruction, is because we’re all dark. The world is saving us, we’re not close to saving Earth. To keep us sane, our mind tells us to do selfless acts towards everything and everyone, but we feed off pain and struggles. Some have hungry eyes and starving souls, chose to hurt others to make them full. As others, hurt themselves to hurt others around them. When the rest lie to themselves to the point they believe they are okay. When in the end, they need to stop trying to save others and the world, and save them from themselves. The world is easy, simple, and full of life. Human nature is complex, complicated, and unexplained. Nothing is explained, nothing is understood, everything is still put in question, no matter how much faith you have in it. The voice in your head, isn’t a conscious- it’s a monster. The subconscious dreams are the truth behind what is masked over when your awake. The daily image of being perfect and angel-like, is just part of the imagination. A strive, the motivation to keep hell locked up. Prisoner of our own imagination, creation of heaven keeps people hopeful. We’re just ghosts playing our role again in a reality that we perceive to be real, but the demon already made the thoughts, actions, and reasons before, that’s why everything happens for a reason. The people who don’t believe that, and believe that they have control are unleashed demons making their first rounds before they create a new image and perceive a reality. There’s never good or bad, angel or demon. Just bad and bad, demon and demon. You can’t run and hide. You have no where to go. Our lives revolve in going in circles, you will end right where you started. Let out the monster once in awhile, realize they are there, because that’s the only friend you will have in the very end.

   Do you feel that you won't receive the kind of love you deserve?
  ","
  We all have different ways of expressing our love & sometimes someone could be loving you exactly the way you deserve to be loved but they do it in a way that the person doesnt like so it looks like they aren’t loving them. We put expectations on love when we shouldnt. There isnt only one way to love someone or how to show love to someone. We also dont always know whats best for ourselves, we may think we deserve love in a certain way but we are wrong. Example: a girl may think she deserves to be loved by gifts and money, but the guy might want to romanticize things a little more but the girl just doesn’t care about that kind of love.

   How would you alleviate the torment of someone having a panic attack in your presence? Why?
  ","
  Since I get panic attacks I know what I want someone to do when I have them & I’ve actually helped a couple people during their panic attacks. Best thing to do is hold their hand or rub their back while helping them take deep breaths. Try distracting them with music or singing (i cant sing) what i like to do is help the person ease into why they are panicking and then kinda guide their mind through it. When someone has a panic attack its because they are bottling up something thats eating them up inside and they need to have a safe & trusted person to be able to confine in.

  I am terrified. Think about it this way - the way our bodies works is like a machine, almost like a clock. If you take out a piece, it stops ticking. Camera lenses are the closest thing we have to our eyes & a computer is the closest thing we have to our brains. If we start to make more advanced machines (robots) that can mimic our brains, what makes us really believe that one of them wont suddenly start thinking for themselves or somehow get preprogrammed. We program humans and reprogram over and over... why wouldnt we do that to robots? We all want to evolve and change.. but nobody thinks about how our evolution might be humans go extinct because we made humanoid robots.. what if thats our next civilization?

  2. You can put your big boy pants on & be the intelligent person you are and figure out how to get back or stay in sock Narnia for as long as youd like. You might me your sock lover that you had no idea could make your heart so full and happy.
  
  The opportunities are endless.

  We went to the same school but she was a grade older than I was, so I never really had much interaction with her until a mutual friend invited both of us to her birthday party.

But would come visit at least once a year, it became sort of a tradition. Now she lives in San Diego again. So I must go spend time with her. 😊

   the other thing i think keeps people around past the initial stages is your ability to make them feel ""welcomed"" and ""wanted"" showing them the attention that they crave as humans and from such a vibrant and desirable specimen to boot. as for the long long term. im not sure. it has to be charm/wit..
  ","
  I remember there was this girl where she was so upset that i didnt talk to her as much anymore and i came up to her to apologize. When i said we can hang out more she blurts out “i cant live without your scent, you smell like home.” I’ll never forget it. The way she looked it was almost like my scent alone made her feel accepted and loved. Sorry, what you said reminded me of her. I kinda miss her but I really hurt her in the past.
  
  Anyways, thank you so much!! I love your observations.

  If i lived in New York, London, Paris, or Rome ect, I would be more inclined to do so. Where I live right now.. if you dress like that normally, people think you’re some pompous as.shole and think you’re attacking their ego just because you want to look good. Its annoying. Not worth the headache.

  I did. I went to a charter school. I did double the classes and double the homework without teachers or other students. (I wanted to graduate with honors credits) I only had to show up on Wednesdays to take all the test which took me about 15-30 minutes each time. When I didnt have to worry about the bullshit that comes along with going to school - i was really good at school. So i had a lot of freedom that year. Got to go to Disneyland/Six Flags a bunch since everyone was in school. My best friend and I hung out everyday, we had no rules from our parents. My grades were exceptional and I graduated 4 months earlier than everyone. (after being told i didnt have enough credits, people thought i wouldnt graduate so i not only graduated but did double the work and got a 4.1 gpa 😂) so thats why thats my favorite ages. It was lawless for me.

  I don’t believe in forcing anything, especially not the universe. If someone cant follow through with something, I understand that theres something else going on. The spirit, mind, or body wasnt ready to do so or it just wasn’t supposed to happen. I never take anything personally. We should all learn how to be more compassionate to others. More people need to learn to give people more grace. All this pressure is just causing more problems. So ya, i don’t believe in forcing anyone.

I used to spend hours in the car with my best friends after going to the beach or shopping and just talk for hours. Ive always felt safe in a car. Since i was a little girl.

  Yes. It was so scary. So first they would harass me nonstop on IG & this was back in 2014. He kept trying to hang out with me and i had a job at the time so when i was at work (I never told him where I worked or lived) so he calls my work asking for me and on the phone he says hes outside waiting for me. I had to tell my manager and they kinda protected me and took me home. Had to make a police report and everything. So i thought it was over. 2016 - a random account starts spamming me (i blocked all his other stuff) and found out it was him. Blocked him again. 2018 - im living in san diego and i get a screenshot from a random account on IG saying they live right next door. Which they basically lived down the street.. he kept saying he was gonna come over and all this stuff. Well i sent the cops to the location and i havent heard of him since.

  What if we are descendent of some alien species which would make them look similar to us but not really- like humanoid means standing on two legs.

Its like America is the cattle for aliens and thats why they are fattening us up 😂 and the American government has a deal with the aliens and thats why so many people go missing and arent ever found.

  Life is just unfair.

Its hard to find honesty these days and because of that I assume everyone is bullshitting me. It breaks my heart seeing the modern world we live in is creating a world full of inconsiderate people. People only think of others when it benefits them in some way, nobody thinks of others just to think of them anymore. 😔

   Yes you will be the best mom mine died before i was 2 years old and i always wanted a mommy and my stepmom is evil i don't see her as a mom so i claim you as my ask.fm you are perfect and i'm 11 i think you

  Well, i do believe in being able to pick your family. History has taught me that. It doesnt matter if you’re blood related- that doesnt stop families from being assholes to each other.

  That is so cute. People dont realize that our brains feel connected to people we like the smell of. Because of all our pheromones. Its a huge part of liking someone. If you dont like them smell of someones body odor, dont try to be with them. It will end. It means your pheromones do not combine.

   Yeah it's very strict. Only essential shops are open. You can only go to work if you are a key worker or can't work at home. You can't mix with people outside your house, not even family.

   You are right about Instagram Sav. It's almost expected now to post pictures like that. As you've seen on mine it's just places I go to!

  Theres so much pressure from every aspect of life on IG. Instagram is causing the highest increase in depression, anxiety, self-harm, drug-use, and suicidal thoughts.

  Religion should teach people how to respect other peoples beliefs and faith no matter what - but instead most just teach how they are the correct one and everyone else wont be saved except them.

  All i am thinking is, yup most likely true. I’ve been saying this since I was a little kid 😂 but everyone would literally laugh in my face (well not everyone. My brother & dad didnt) and tell me im crazy & i would always say “youll see in the future” & now im just sitting back feeling good cause the truth is coming to light and singing in my head “damn it feels good to be a gangster” 😂

   Random question for Boom: Why do you think some people are still so close-minded even though it's 2021?
  ","
  I truly wish i could understand why people are so closed minded. A part of me feels like its because the truth has been narrowed down. I also think people are getting to comfortable and honestly believe that they dont need to learn anything new. People get trapped in a loop & don’t really see a good reason why they should try to get out of it. I ask myself this question everyday honestly.

   The structure of DNA appears to be intelligently designed, what are the implications?
  ","
  I have been saying this for over a decade & no one believed me.
  
  They have figured out that our DNA has a “marker” or a “stamp.” Like, when you buy something and theres an engraving on the bottom of who made it or where its from - ya we all have that on our DNA. They never understood what it meant till recently, since they figured out that 93% of our DNA is considered “unidentifiable exterrestrial DNA” that the little stamp on everybody’s DNA is most likely the signature of the creator. The only issue is they still havent figured out what exactly it stands for since its considered alien. They are releasing a lot of the scientific proof for this since the evidence is irrefutable.
  "
603173,"
   Is trust more important than love?

  ","
  No, in order to experience pleasure you have to experience pain. We need to be in total darkness in order to see light. We have to feel sadness to be able to experience happiness.
  
  In my experience those who havent really experienced pain, struggle, sadness, or trauma have a harder time finding happiness.

   Has someone close ever disappointed you?
  ","
  Everyone will let you down one way or another. Which means even you will let down those you love. Its just human nature. It should be taken as a positive thing because when you care about someone, you want the best & for them to do their best. Well, we tend to hold high expectations for those we care about which leads to be let down - but it only ever comes out of love. When you dont care about someone, you dont care what they do so its hard to be disappointed.

   Scariest person you’ve ever met?
  ","
  So, I make friends with people of all walks of life.
  
  I became friends with what you would consider an OG. when I first met him, not gonna lie, he scared the shit outta me. I even told him straight to his face that he scared the shit out of me. lol. he had tattoos literally head to toe. The gang he was a part of was tattooed on the top of his head lol. I got to know him cause he did landscaping. I learned a lot from him and we actually became really close. he had a lot of kids and his daughter is on death row so he kinda always made me feel like i was his daughter. I could always trust him too, every time I had an issue or I needed help - he always had my back. BUT he never failed to scare me all the time. 😂

   I wonder if that anon knows BMI isn't an accurate way to represent a human body. It's flawed in more ways than one imo.
  ","
  I agree. I never really followed it. I dont feel like we should be measuring peoples weight that way either. Some people are more dense then others so they could weigh more on paper but in person they are probably in outstanding shape! Some people have big bones and some people have small bones. Someone with big bones just kinda looks bigger but a lot of the times they are at their natural weight. Someone with small bones cant really even hold that much weight on them. Theres so many variables to weight and the body... its just like how i don’t believe a test can measure true intelligence.

   I think we will too! Honestly I'm pretty stubborn but I would loooove to talk to you about it all ❤️😘

  I felt like such a fucking idiot once I figured out that Lucifer & Satan (Satanachia - Lucifers Commander - in- chief) are two different entities. Now i have to go read Biblical texts with a different mindset because there talking about so many different entities that everyone just generalizes and says satan or the devil when actually they arent the same at all.

  Actually, you are not gonna like what im gonna say and its probably not gonna make sense to a lot of people. i watched a documentary about someone else kinda saying the same thing but its not exactly nothing.  (Many MANY scientists are starting to discover the truth in this) Its because our universe has infinite amount of layers and whenever the sun finishes its star cycle is burns up everything and everyone but because of the layers the universe is capable of restarting an infinite amount of times unless we create a massive hole in just one of the layers then we will be completely and utterly destroyed forever. No coming back from that. Nuclear bombs can create that hole.

   How do clothes affect your confidence or personality?
  ","
  Its not a lie when people say when you dress really well, you hold yourself up better. You walk with confidence. It makes you feel good. I’ve had people never understand why I put a lot of effort into my outfits or I just randomly dress up until i forced them to dress up with me & their body language changed. They stood with such confidence. Clothes make a huge difference. Thats why in the business world, attire is very important.

  The explanation for our existence is much more complex and extremely scientific (physics) that people cant really understand right now. As a society, we truly havent expanded our minds enough yet to understand. & you know what, who knows if its even a positive thing too... we might not even want to know the truth. The only person that got truly close to understanding where we come from was Stephen Hawking. He believed in some pretty awesome theories. Big alien believer because he actually proved the probability. You literally cant argue with math. Lol. Anyways, ive always believed that there’s something greater than us - we just dont know the truth.

  It was awhile ago. I vaguely remember it now. I have no idea where the location is either. I couldnt recognize it at all. There was a group of guys like getting in a fight and it was getting pretty gruesome so i was trying to stop it but I couldn’t.

   Yes The exorcist Back in the day I am movie first came out scared the living shit out of you
  ","
  The movie made me laugh. I saw that when i was little & I remember laughing so hard. I even looked at my brother in full confidence and said, “thats not even remotely accurate”
  
  Kinda freaked my brother out cause like when i say i was young i mean i was 7ish when i watched it.

603290,"
   you ever see those vids where the monks burned themselves alive in protest. imagine that..
  ","
  Ya i cant watch those cause I literally just explained how it literally feels like i am being burned alive like it triggers something in my brain, like its happened to me before.

   Pepsi or coka cola ?

  I dont drink soda.

  No, not really 😔 i wish

603293,"
   What was the dream did you see a man?
  ","
  I saw way more than that.
  
  It was like i was there but they couldnt see me... like i was some outer body looking in. I just remember trying to warn them but they couldnt hear me. It was like i was a ghost in my dream. So wild.

   I meant wise decision for what to belive in. What kind of evidence or proper logic to believe in these thoughts. Nothing. I want to be sure of my thoughts before death moment. people have an endless number of contradicting thoughts
  ","
  Why do you need to know what happens after you die, you’re gonna be dead? Do you remember what it was like before you born? Death is gonna be like that.
  
  Also, it can go both ways. Theres a lot of people who do bad shit because of religious beliefs. If you are just a decent person, you wont have any issues of death. The reason so many people are worried about what comes after is because of regret. I logically don’t understand why we are so concerned about afterlife and not focused on this life and trying to make the most of it when we dont have any proof of what actually happens when we die. Zero proof. People fear death when its a huge part of life. Death restores the energy in our universe. Stop living in fear.
  "
603296,"
   how much hope do you have?
  ","
  Im a little too hopeful sometimes.. like annoyingly hopeful. I somehow have a lot of faith in myself so that creates a lot of hope. Sometimes it can be unrealistic though
  "
603297,"
   Exactly.👍🏻
  ","
  Thank you 😊 i am so happy you understand.
  "
603298,"
   Cool. But this seems negative in terms of an effort to make more wise decisions. I want to be sure of my thoughts before death moment. What if the god is expecting more from us?
  ","
  God isn’t expecting shit from us cause you know logically it would be a God who would be all powerful. Its idiotic to think God would need anything from us. You can make wise decisions without needing to accept a God, just be a good fucking person. Is that so hard? If you just believe in something beyond yourself, thats all you need. We. Arent. Smart. Enough. To. Actually. Comprehend. “God.” Kinda the whole point cause you know, its a God or Gods. Who the fuck actually knows. Just live your life with passion. Ricky Gervias honestly says it perfectly.

  2020 was the year that forced me to reprioritize my life.

  When you say “life really isnt that bad” thats YOUR perception of life that YOU are trying to make others understand. So its about you.

  But not everything is about you. You can’t compare yourself to everyone else. The only thing you can focus on is doing YOUR best. Everyones pain is valid. Something that happened to you could effect someone else in a completely different way. We all perceive life in such different ways.

   Why are a lot of people on this site suicidal? Like, life isn’t that bad and all you got to do is, do your best, and anyone who does do something to you, kick there ass 🤷‍♂️
  ","
  I haven’t really seen any posts of that nature on here, I don’t really think you can really talk about that subject.. but since we are....
  
  lets discuss why people are $uicidal. They believe everyone around them and the world in general would be better off without them. Or life just isnt bearable, it almost seems pointless. Some peoples suffering is greater than others. Or (extreme version) they have information that cant be shared so they have orders to take their own life.
  
  people who experience $uicidal thoughts aren’t able to just changed their mindset in that way, if they were able too $uicidal wouldn’t happen. People think suicide is selfish but i think its selfish to force someone to be alive when they are in so much pain just because we don’t understand what they are going through and WE dont want to go through the pain of losing someone.
  
  We should try to be there to support these people and not just tell them “do your best” its so much deeper than that.

   Yes, there are multiple demons for each Zodiac signs (1 for each decan), originally Egyptian star-gods. When you have time, try to get Frances A. Yates's classic of scholarship ""The Art of Memory"", which delves deeply into this and other related occultic topics.

  ","
  I am glad you are aware of it.
  
  Im pretty sure everyone and i mean everyone loves opium, & thats the issue. I love how people don’t understand that morphine is opium. But nobody is complaining about that when they are in the hospital lol they put synthesized opium in so much stuff that people would never know because of all the scientific names they use. Did you know that if you only did the milk of the poppy, it doesnt have any addictive properties. I watched a documentary about it lol 😂

  Well considering most of us are growing up in a self-absorbed selfish society it makes it hard not to have some narcissism.

  Yes, it happens all the time.
  
  When we are little its the lack of exposure that causes allergies but when we get older it becomes excessive exposure that can cause allergies.
  
  If you can try to drink a lot of Kombucha, the probiotics from it may help relieve some of the symptoms of allergies.

   Did you see that Super Gonorrhea is trending on twitter? That's so scary dangerous stuff!
  ","
  I have been telling people my whole fucking life to be careful with prescription meds and antibiotics because our becomes resistant.
  
  Why? BECAUSE THINGS EVOLVE. Bacteria is the fastest evolving life. Eventually theres going to be bacteria that will be able to resist antibiotics. Its been a huge controversy for a decade now. They are saying that bacteria is evolving faster than we are making antibiotics. A lot of people are going to get sick and probably die and theyve been anticipating that for awhile... if you work in the hospital you kinda already know this.

  • my mom is like 70% plastic. Not gonna lie, she looks really good for her age. She told me ill have the money to afford those kinds of things when im older.
  
  • also, when i was working at Union Bank multiple people (older generation male & female) who constantly and i mean CONSTANTLY would tell me, “my face will get more beautiful as i age.” Which they also made it very clear how rare that is so im just like yaaaa we will see wont we.
  
  All I know is that i look really young still. In pictures im really good at making myself look older but in person i could probably go into a high school and nobody would ask questions. Anyways regardless of beauty, ill probably have a youthful face for a long time since my biological family looks 30 when they are like 50.

Find out what is worth your time & life becomes more enjoyable when fill up your time doing something you love. Dont be afraid to take risks. Life is just a series of trial & errors.” ✨

  Ive believed for a long long time that there’s several soulmates and it doesnt only mean relationship wise. I believe soulmates literally means your soul connected with another soul in someway. I have friends that understand that our friendship is because our souls are just connected somehow.
  
  But i also have a darker belief where i dont think EVERYONE is lucky enough to possess a soul to have a soulmate. Just like how in video games theres computer generated characters, in my life i have been around people who literally feel like they are just NPCs.

   Yeah, but we're talking about people obsessed with you. Perhaps, a few are obsessed in eating you? Who knows. Besides, I always think of the spinnetods from Grimm. Ironically, the predatory ones were female, too, though. -- And aren't you a female, anyway?

   Actually, on second thought, that would be the 'black-widower'. Basically, he mates and then feed on the liquified remains of his female now-prey. Avoid like Covid.
  ","
  Why did you change it from being female to male? We all know its females that are black widows. There’s actually a fuckton of animals out there where the female will eat the male or use the males insides to lay eggs. Omg theres an animal that devours the male after they mate than the eggs grow inside it and then eats there way out of the mother. Nature is scary. 😂
  
  But you know, women arent much different - females will take a shit on your heart and psychologically fuck you up.

  I was laying bed but my back was towards the door and i was facing the wall. I had the hall light on which was shining on the wall. I remember it being around 2:30-3:00. Well a shadow of some sort starts to form up behind me then i see an arm rise over me with a knife in its hand. I quickly turn around and theres nothing there but a knife on the ground. I ran and screamed for my dad and he didn’t believe me until he saw the knife. He has never seen that knife before either. He didn’t know what to make of what happened. It was so scary.

  ","
  I can get away eating with chopsticks but I’m not that good at it. The only skill i managed with chopsticks is im able to pick up one grain of rice at a time lol.
  
  I practiced by getting a piece of paper and a rubber band. At the top you fold the paper really thick then wrap the rubber band around it, you do it until you created the muscle memory of how to hold the chopsticks. Then its pretty easy after that, it takes practice and it honestly helps using chopsticks with everything to get good at it. Like salad or pasta.

   do you believe someone can actually die from a broken heart?
  ","
  My grandma died two years before my grandpa. For almost the full two years my grandpa would ask about my grandma and where she was... we would just tell him she was at the hospital. (My grandpa was DEVOTED to my grandma, every day before she died he would just sit in the room with her for hours. She had severe dementia so she wouldn’t have even known the difference if he was there or not..) well, it got to the point where he just stopped asking about her. Very soon after he passed away. My mom truly believes that he died from a broken heart or that he is such a sweetheart that he held on until he knew she passed away first. My grandpa was the sweetest man. Fuck im actually crying right now. I miss him so much.

  Thank you so much for asking!
  
  Im still studying Demonology.
  
  Im now on the letter B.
  
  So far i have learned;
  
  • theirs a demon thats attached to the Zodiac Sign Aries. Which my next question is, are their demons for each zodiac sign then?
  
  • i also recently learned about Sabbatical Witchcraft & Occult Grimoires from Knights Templar because they follow after Baphomet (a demon)
  
  • also learned that Astroth is the first MALE demon recorded ever in history because actually he was created after a FEMALE. Just think about that one for a second.
  
  • then i read that they say most serpents will come as women & thats why these demons all have the gift to show MAN how to protect themselves from them. Now I understand why im against a feminist world...
  
  Project;
  
  Im cutting pictures out of magazines because im making a picture out of pictures of a open mouth goat head that becomes a beautiful tree with a city growing in his mouth.

   People who have money aren't generous anymore. Tho i'm broke xD
  ","
  I think because of the way my grandma was so beyond generous with everything (its a buddhist thing i think) it made me extremely generous even in the moments i have nothing. Whenever someone saw something of mine and was like “omg i love it” my response is “do you want it?” Without hesitation. I have an issue of blindly being generous sometimes.
  
  Like whenever someone has stolen money from me, my response is always, “they must have needed it more than i do if they needed to steal it so ill think of it as a gift” and i move the fuck on.
  
  People like my grandpa & myself don’t exist anymore.

   I must completely disagree before I fall back asleep. If they were so powerful, why wait to conquer Earth? I think they need humans as corporeal forms in order to even exist. So it may be symbiotic in nature
  ","
  Or, what if they have been conquering Earth this whole time? What if theres extreme hierarchy in demonology that the ones you would imagine would already be conquering actually are already doing so but using their little soldiers to take over human vessels to blend into our society? What if where demons are from is Earths paired closest dimension?

   🎀🎁.. Advantages and Disadvantages of being a VIP??..🍃🎄🍃.. Ventajas y Desventajas de ser VIP??..🎁🎀
  ","
  Advantage: secret answer option
  
  Disadvantage: all the tasks you have to do.
  
  Logically i would imagine becoming a VIP should be more like a “Congratulations for being highly active, now we will reward you with more coins and less tasks.” After completely the tasks every week for a certain amount of time or with certain scores idk.
  
  I feel like the tasks should be for those who aren’t that active on here and have a hard time getting enough activity, not for the people who already have SO MUCH going on when they come on. Like why are they congratulating us by giving us more work? Thats like there whole thing right? They say like the more active you are, you can be VIP & thats how they suck you in, then once they got you they make you do a whole bunch more than you probably already do.. because ive been just not doing any tasks & omg its so much better. I stopped caring about the leaderboard. Im just here cause i enjoy it.

   When will we stop using these ridiculous masks? Not only are they extremely irritant but they also cover 75% of our faces.

  Awh!! I know, im sorry 😔
  
  I was actually thinking about this when i last did my makeup and i realized they can only see my eyes BUT then i realized thats like the best part of my makeup and arguably of my face  so i was stoked about that. Then i realized with masks you cant smell peoples bad breath or people wont have to smell your own. AND i realized that i blush A LOT and the mask protects me from looking like a red tomato. You know, im hitting a lot of positives for me... i do hate how my makeup gets all over my mask though 😔 and my voice is so quiet no one can hear without the mask, nobody can hear me now 😂

   How are you in 2020 🙂
  ","
  This year has be an emotional rollercoaster that has finally leveled out to where i am the happiest i have ever been. I just feel good mentally & physically. I know this is going to sound really bad, but if COVID never happened i dont think i would have ever gotten to this mental state. Because of COVID i was able to take a step back and look at my life and go, “wow all my priorities are flawed” I wasn’t doing ANYTHING i wanted to do. I was so miserable. Unhappy. So, my parents were the ones that pushed me to see its an opportunity to change my life around, start over. Well, actually my mom was more like, “we have money. Dont risk working. Just take a break and do art or something.” At first, it was so hard but then I slowly started to seep back into my old self but a smarter version and now i think it was the best decision i have ever made. So 2020 is bad for majority of society, but for me it kinda literally saved my life. My heath was declining so bad, i mean I actually ended up with a super deadly infection that still makes ZERO sense how i survived. So ya, its been a rollercoaster but im ready for the new year! 💖

   What is your biggest impression in a social setting if a Man approaches you while you are wanting to just chill with your girlfriends?
  ","
  Oh, im always really nice. Its my girl friends that kinda get all awkward (now i realize its because its always me theyll talk too) anyways, I’m always super nice. I think its super bold to do that. Quite flattering. I have really good social skills especially with strangers which is why i was so good at working at the bank so it doesnt bother me. Idk if girls understand how big your balls have to be to go up to a group of women and try to talk to the one you like without getting verbally attacked. I know how fucking terrifying it is cause ive done it many times (girls or guys actually- mostly just to tell them they are stunning) & it doesnt get easier with time 😂
  "
604287,"
   I’m laughing. She is such a good girl. I love how she is always attached to your side. Nice Ash 😊😺 also? Apple needs new cat emojis so you can get the right color fur. It annoys me that I have to use a cat emoji with yellow fur. Lol

   Without an exam,  just reading your words. Believing it's your stomach? my first thought is pancreas, on the left side,  gallbladder towards your right.  An ultrasound could help narrow it down.  zero to do with smoking.  genes and or what you're eating,  might.  Any family history of either?
  ","
  Well, ive gone through surgeries & multiple ultrasounds. They never found anything. So i changed my diet and it has changed my life. Except from earlier.

   Opinion on indigenous people hunting/killing animals
  ","
  In my opinion, hunting is more humane compared to just having a bunch of slaughterhouses and lining up animals just to be murdered.
  
  Some people are meant to eat meat. (Check out the blood type diet. Type A blood type is the only one that has to be really mindful of meat consumption but im blood type O so im supposed to have a very high protein diet because i produce so much stomach acid i can handle digesting a lot of meat.) also, they were using ALL of the animal. The fur, making leather, teeth, bones, and meat. Nothing went to waste and hunting helps keep the population down which is why during certain times of the year you’re allowed to hunt certain animals. Its kinda the circle of life. I know we try really hard to say we arent animals but like we are, just like how theres animals that only eat meat, only eat greens, or a little of both - why should we be any different?

   id ask you overall if its a blessing or a curse but i guess since you have always been that way you dont know what a non photographic memory is like just like i dont know what yours is like. yet another interesting facet about you though. thanks for sharing.
  ","
  I find it a blessing because most of the people i know dont have this ability and i see them struggle a lot because of it. I know its hard for them to be around me sometimes cause i can just learn something once and remember how to do it. It makes learning very easy for me which made school/work a breeze for me. I just hate institutions, & they hate people with minds like mine as well. I cracked the code on standardized tests cause its a pattern that they do and I just memorized the pattern 😂 even my dad was confused cause my scores were insane 😂
  
  I also hate watching people lose their minds when they cant find something, so its really nice to be able to know where everything is cause of my memory.
  "

   oh thats interesting. can you talk about how your memory works? ofc i have heard the term but actually never spoke to anyone who had a photographic memory.
  ","
  My mind takes like 10 pictures per second. My brain is like a file cabinet of millions of pictures. I can just go into a certain category of something ive learned and i can visually see everything ive ever learned about that subject just flash in my head, i can skim keywords in my head, until i find the information im looking for. It happens within seconds. Its actually what makes me a really fast reader/reading comprehension as well. Its also how i know where everything is because my brain takes mental pictures of my surroundings so i never lose anything.
  
  Its really hard to explain how it works honestly.

  Happy Thanksgiving 🦃
  
  I would explain its a holiday in America that people don’t realize is a celebration of bringing disease and slaughter to a new land & they feasted together once the English declared a win. Instead of adapting to Natives, they decided to take it so we celebrate by stuffing food into our faces and being thankful for conquering.
  
  But now its a time for us to be thankful for everything and ignore the reason why it even started. Oh, & natives(ones who still live on reservations) don’t celebrate it.

  I have a secret journal that nobody has touched, i think i can keep a secret.
  
  Also, i have secrets that i know about with everyone because the longer i keep a secret - ive noticed a persons loyalty grows.

  I will tell you about a dream i had a couple days ago.
  
  So, i was in an abandoned run down victorian home that was out in the middle of the forest. I was with Ash. I run into the bathroom and i start crying because i am terrified. I looked at Ash and said, “i have to find her.” With tears streaming down my face because i had to go find the little demon girl in a white dress because i need her help. I spin around in the bathroom until i face the mirror and look at myself but then i look behind me  in the reflection because I expected the little demon to pop up so i look away and run to find her. (I needed her help getting to the witches in the forest cause there was a secret portal)
  
  Then i end up in the middle of the forest with three witches behind me explaining that every person is connected to a certain species of plant and we need whatever plant that might be to be healthy. And i ended up rubbing soil on to someone and they started to grow with the plant. So i start making potions out of plants.

So we decide to start again. Wipe the slate clean. Start fresh. And then we have children. Little carbon copies we can turn to and say, ""You will do what I could not. You will succeed where I have failed."" Because we want someone to get it right this time. But not me... Personally speaking I can't wait to watch life tear you apart.""

  just get a really good VPN, nowadays they have packages that give you everything you need. look on

   Why are people totally different in person than they are on social media?
  ","
  Because social media gives people the opportunity to be who they wished they were instead of being actually who they are. It breaks my heart that our society praises people who tear others down and make sure they are so uncomfortable with themselves that they just dont wanna be who they really are anymore. (Omg Billie Ellish song ?) we are taught to fear ourselves. Social media makes it possible to not live in fear for a little while. Thats why im just open about being myself and if you dont like what i say well that sucks. I didnt want to be afraid of myself.

   This isn't an attack on your logic, I'm asking out of sincere curiousity: how do we rely on frogs? Just because they control the insect population?
  ","
  “ If only there were some kind of creature that could reliably and effectively indicate the health of various ecosystems and serve as a warning sign for humans to take action. Oh yeah, frogs can do that.
  
  They serve as bio-indicators because their skin absorbs substances in their surrounding habitat. Consequently, any changes to their skin will indicate contamination or other issues present in the area. Frogs can exist in water as well as on land, meaning that these miraculous animals will be the first to react to any hazards.”

  okay bare with me on this. So you know the red & blue pill? Red meaning truth/blue meaning ignorance.
  
  Imagine if we split the world into two parts: one part being natural earth, other part would be a cement jungle. You got to choose which side you wanted to be apart of. Red pill = natural earth ; blue pill = cement jungle
  
  Now what if we translated that to people. Red pill people and blue pill people. Red pill people will look at blue pill person with open arms or will let one of there own become blue, but blue pill people would try to turn all red pill people into blue so we would be one big cement jungle.
  
  We live in a blue pill world. The matrix is real.

  I took lessons when i was in 4th grade and the horse i rode was named harley. I assume it was because he was such a good horse to cruise on but when he needed to gallop he could go. Anyways, he was very stubborn but i was even more stubborn. So he would buck & rear me so many times but i kept getting back on. I remember the owner of the place i was getting taught kept seeing me do this and she came to me and said, “life is a lot like falling off a horse, you always have to get back up. & you’re gonna do just fine in life.” & never saw her again after that.

  No, they are in the process of turning into a form of cryptocurrency.

  Speaking of experience with being around a few people who suffer with depression, they will tell you they need an outlet such as: going to the gym, reading a book, doing something artistic, playing an instrument or making music, going on hikes or other activities.. ect.

  I dont think thats why people are getting upset. Most people arent using these apps to be reminded of suffering & sadness. I agree that you’re able to post whatever you like but you have to understand where people are coming from.

It will probably be healthier for you as well, you dont need to remind yourself of your pain all the time. Im so sorry that you suffer with depression and I really hope that you have some outlet.

  ","
  Quite the opposite, its because ive experienced it deeper than you will understand is how i know its not that deep. True love makes people feel invincible. True love teaches you about your worth & is capable of making you see beauty in yourself. Also, if you two hold something super special why are you guys always testing each other? Where are all your posts of being together and spending time together?
  
  Also, the fact you took this super personally means you subconsciously know what I’m saying is true, if it wasn’t true you wouldnt have to waste your time trying to prove it to me - youd be too busy actually loving yourself and her.
