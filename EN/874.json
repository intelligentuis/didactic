We live across the street and her family used to always have dinner with mine and we have summer activities we do together so we were pretty close, but then as we became teenagers, we both became a bit more reserved with our separate lives I think. I knew there were bigs things in her life she wasn't telling me so I kinda stopped trusting her.\n  \n  I would consider her my closest friend, but at the same time, I have told some of my deeper secrets to other friends bc I felt like I could talk to them more. They told me their sh*t so I told them mine and that made us closer. If we lived nearer to each other, we might be really close by now. But since this first friend lives across the street, we are always being in each other's lives, so I may not be the closest with her, but she's the one I see the most, hang out with the most, known for longest....so basically, it's hard to answer that question.\n  ","938693":"\n  If they are surprises that I like hahah\n  ","938694":"\n  That's sweet.

After that, it just kinda stuck, but I use it more for online things -- no one really calls me it, but I like it.

No one was saying anything so I decided to say what came first to my mind and I basically said \"when we see a snake we might experience fear\" and she was all like smiled and said \"I feel like that's more disgust,\" and I get how she may not wanna write that specifically down bc not everyone is afraid of snakes and there's not always a reason to be afraid of them (though some can be dangerous). But she could have at least accepted my idea as like \"if we see something that we think might hurt us or that we have a phobia for, we may experience fear.\" I mean, that does fit the facts bc the fact is, we are afraid of snakes and so when we see one, it makes sense that we might experience fear. The dismissiveness of my suggestion just made me feel like 'why do I even bother speaking up in group... it gives me anxiety anyway and it just feels like the leaders have smth against whatever I have to say a lot of the time like maybe I just need to stay in the background' and that annoyed me bc I'm trying to work on my anxiety and it's like the world wants to keep giving me reasons on why I should feel uncomfortable... I know this is kinda unreasonable bc not everything we say is gonna be accepted, but it gets really frustrating when it feels like the ratio is really uneven. I think for this particular situation I just felt really invalidated afterward. I'm sure the leader didn't mean to make me feel that way, but she could have approached everything differently than just humiliating me bc I'm scared of snakes. After that, I just kinda tuned out for the rest of group, pretending to listen but really just chilling bc I just felt really frustrated with myself and the group and just life.\n  ","938721":"\n  Idk about \"most of all\" cus I'm not good with labeling superlatives on things in my life, but I really don't like people who are judgmental and stuck up\n  ","938722":"\n  Huh?\n  ","938723":"\n  Wack\n  ","938724":"\n  Triggers me to do what?\n  ","938725":"\n  If they save someone in any way\n  ","938726":"\n  I feel like an overly nice guy is not too bad of a thing to have\n  ","938727":"\n  Ngl, I actually kinda like it.
