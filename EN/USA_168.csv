   I take it that Amy didn't get her gift
  ","
  Alright I'm going to day this and dont take it the wrong way but kath was in charge of the fan mail and would pick it up and go through it and reply to letters and stuff. She would sometimes give us the stuff dedicated to us or for us. But kath sometimes forgets to do so or things change and we just forget about it or it becomes to much that we cant always get to it right away. I dont know if anyone checks it anymore tbh as we are all assigned to do certain roles that  fit our personality  and our strengths and so on. I apologize if the gift was returned but if you ACTUALLY  want your gift to get to amy I would wait and save it until we are able to do shows or something or travel and so on to places and try to get into one of those events or whatever to actually see amy face to face and know she received it. Because anything we get from mert and greets and so on we have to take home and 99% of the time if its something we really enjoy or can wear and use or whatever we keep it and then decide what we can like donate and so on

  I had a realization recently about happiness and pain. I think I used to think that the two can’t exist at the same time. I spent a lot of my life repressing my feelings and ignoring my pain. I wanted people to think I was put together and I was okay and that there was nothing wrong with me. A couple years ago I had a bit of an awakening to my own pain and I felt like I wanted to shout it from the rooftops. I wanted everyone to know I am in pain! I don’t have everything together! I’m not perfect! People have wronged me very deeply! I wanted to make my pain real. I wanted it to matter. And I think in the process of doing that, I started to over-identify with it. I started to think “I AM my pain” rather than “I am IN pain”. I think that was necessary at the time because of my natural inclination to dismiss myself. But recently I decided I don’t want to hold onto pain so tightly. I used to think that “cheering yourself up” was a hoax because if you have a problem, it’s a problem and cheering yourself up is not gonna change it. That is true, but I’m learning that life is not so black and white. You can be going through extreme pain and still have moments of happiness. In the midst of a tragedy you can feel gratitude for the good in the world. In an extremely stressful time you can decide to do something fun and have fun and be carefree for a moment. None of those things will change what happened. None of those things will fix your problems or the problems of the world, but they can bring a little bit of light to the darkness. Turning on a lamp when it’s dark doesn’t change the fact that it’s nighttime. Turning on a flashlight doesn’t mean you’re ignoring the dark. It just makes it easier to continue on through the night. You need some light in the dark to be able to keep going. It’s okay to turn a light on. And we can’t forget that it can never be so dark that light cannot pierce through. Even in the dead of night the stars and the moon still shine. 💫

  I think in a way I'll always prefer either the Beach or the lake considering I grew up in california and was surrounded by folsom lake and then when we moved to Malibu we were always at the beach either hanging out and enjoying the sun or filming a youtube video, or meeting up with others in the industry to collaborate

  I wasnt involved with going against guidelines and I'm pretty sure I didnt eat at specifically  his pizza place.

   What happened?
  ","
  Basically growing up until like 2015 when my family moved from California  to Tennessee  I was best friends with angela malek. But she became this person I didnt recognize  anymore or consider a sister and she was acting very plastic and stuff and so on. (I dont want to go into detail) but she tried apologizing  which I forgave her eventually  for but now it's just uncalled for. She was invited to Christina's wedding and considers christina her older sister and tried to talk to me but I wasnt really paying mind to her. However she knows Christina  miscarried her first child and how hard it was to deal with and so on but I recently  saw tweets off her twitter to a old fan of ours talking ish bc we didnt really post a whole lot at first about the BLM stuff and she was saying stuff about how we would post and promote the gender reveal. I can post pictures of it if u dont understand  what I'm talking about

   Swimming Pool or Beach? ❣️
  ","
  I have a special kind of appreciation  and love for the beach. When I lived in california I used to always be down on the beach everyday ( we sometimes even would drive). It used to be my happy place as well. A place where I went to think or find inspiration , especially on early mornings when most people were still asleep. Its quiet except for the nature surrounding  it and the waves crashing onto the shore. Something I really miss dearly now a days since I live in Tennessee

  ","
  Sometimes I do to be honest. Or when I'm out in a public place and people tend to sit there and stare it makes me feel nervous and awkward so I just look at my phone at times to avoid eye contact or something
  "
901537,"
   Ooh I think we should have some sort of like friendly nickname for each other as friends
  ","
  That would be pretty cool
  "
901538,"
   I agree with you, it always ends in arguments because people have different views on it.
  ","
  Its especially worse when people are taking a history class  that deals with current events but they also have to take speech and debate because the whole time in class or in the hallways or cafeteria whatever they're arguing over the different sides and it becomes way to heated. A big one was the views about prolife and pro choice so that's why I tend to run into the opposite direction  when politics are being talked about

  I get busy some days where I have like over 400 questions in my inbox and I always try to answer the ones on the bottom before anything but theres also days when I dont feel very sociable  and dont feel like answering questions as well and people get mad at me because it takes me normally 3-5 days before I actually get to their question

  Hespends his nights in coffee shops

  He disappears like cheshire cats do
  
  And I know and I know and I know
  
  You don't know, you don't know me well
  
  And I know and I know and I know
  
  I don't know how to be by myself
  
  I swear that I am flying while I'm walking on a wire
  
  Convince myself it's raining while you're setting me on fire
  
  So I'll follow you down this rabbit hole
  
  Till I don't know how to let you go
  
  Watch all of my sanity go up in smoke
  
  'Cause I'd rather be going crazy than to be alone
  
  (Be alone, be alone, be alone)
  
  Empty words and flying sparks
  
  With something cold to replace his heart
  
  He's perfectly assembled while I'm falling apart
  
  He looks just like a work of art
  
  He's untouchable, so far away
  
  He's further than outer space
  
  Trying to prevent it now that keeps on getting hotter
  
  But I'm okay with drowning, baby, if you are the water
  
  So I'll follow you down this rabbit hole
  
  Till I don't know how to let you go
  
  Watch all of my sanity go up in smoke
  
  'Cause I'd rather be going crazy than to be alone
  
  (Be alone, be alone, be alone)
  
  Every word he's ever said to me
  
  Has burned into my memory
  
  He ticks his time erased
  
  His need from his mind
  
  And quickly I'm all babbling
  
  He's gone and then he's back again
  
  But maybe I'm just dreamin' on
  
  Aah
  
  I drink you up, you sink me down
  
  Take myself deeper underground
  
  I can't win, I can't hide
  
  'Cause it's all in my delusional mind

  She just didnt want to be a singer for the rest of her life anymore and had other interess in life she wanted to explore.

   Miss Lauren
Now, what's the story behind this name ''Rabbit Hole''?
  ","
  This song is about plotting your own demise. It’s about going after someone who you KNOW is never gonna be with you. It’s not gonna work, it’s not gonna happen, you’re just gonna end up with a broken heart. BUT you are desperately lonely and you also have some mental issues so you do it anyway. smh. I wanted to capture the roller coaster of emotion that comes with choosing such a dark fate for yourself so this is one of the weirdest songs I’ve ever written. It changes keys like 10 times and each section kinda sounds like a different song. But when you put it all together it’s a perfect disaster. An illusory journey of sorts. Much like when Alice fell down the rabbit hole and found Wonderland. Kinda fun, kinda scary. A nice escape from reality, but ultimately a delusional dream from beginning to end. And when you wake up from it, you are just as alone as you were before it all started.

  People were lighting them off since may... they're suppose to become legal soon but it does get quite  annoying especially when its half sticks of dynamite being thrown around and scares small children or animals so you have to deal with either a screaming baby/ small child or laying on the ground trying not to get bite in fear of an animal who is scared and hiding underneath a bed with little space to reach them. Hear so many calls for disturbances and angry neighbors threatening each other with baseball bats and so on. Or it's sometimes scary when you're driving down a road and they decide to light them off behind you or something. Especially in neighborhoods that are bad and you cant really tell if it's gun shots or fireworks

  This whole corona stuff is getting ridiculous. The spike in the new cases isnt because of bars or whatever it's because they specifically said there shouldnt be any large gatherings especially ones that go against the restrictions like 6 feet apart but it's okay for thousands to go out and loot and protest and totally allow that but seniors couldnt even have a proper ceremony or people had to reschedule their wedding plans and so much more...

  Well I had mine removed under the surgeon... not like numb me with those shots in the gym whatever it's called nitrogen? Idk. I remember  going back and them hooking up the machine for your heart rate and all that and putting the in in. For some reason I dont recall why they taped me up like trying a rope around a chair and person? I guess so you dont like move while they're removing the teeth? And the doctor came in shot some tube thing into the iv and I was out.. I woke up in the car for a few minutes afterwards but it was like blurred and I slept for hours at home. They woke me up to take my medicine ( one for pain and antibiotics so I didnt get an infection and it was awful trying to talk or anything. But I heard that some people can eat regular food and not have any pain although it's not recommended  you actually do that

   How easy / hard is it for you to fall asleep? Do you have any certain conditions that needs to be met before you're able to travel to dreamland? 😴🛌
  ","
  Used to be pretty complicated, my mind was race when I tried to sleep at night sometimes making me stay awake till 8 am at times. Or I would think someone was like outside my window trying to get in the house or if I heard a certain noise I'll think someone was trying to kill me or something also when I finally did managed to sleep I would feel like someone is laying on me or calling my name only to get up and look and realize everyone is soundly asleep still. But now that I'm being treated for anxiety and that I can sleep pretty well now

  RABBIT HOLE OUT NEXT FRIDAY 7/3 🐇 This song is about plotting your own demise. It’s about going after someone who you KNOW is never gonna be with you. It’s not gonna work, it’s not gonna happen, you’re just gonna end up with a broken heart. BUT you are desperately lonely and you also have some mental issues so you do it anyway. smh. I wanted to capture the roller coaster of emotion that comes with choosing such a dark fate for yourself so this is one of the weirdest songs I’ve ever written. It changes keys like 10 times and each section kinda sounds like a different song. But when you put it all together it’s a perfect disaster. An illusory journey of sorts. Much like when Alice fell down the rabbit hole and found Wonderland. Kinda fun, kinda scary. A nice escape from reality, but ultimately a delusional dream from beginning to end. And when you wake up from it, you are just as alone as you were before it all started.

  Maybe twice... once there was no one else in the house and I walked into the kitchen to grab something. It was the middle of summer so we had a fan in the window and the toaster was on the counter top next to it. I didnt go anywhere near the window nor the counter and starting walking back towards the front door when the fan just fell out the window and the toaster almost landed in the family's  dogs water bowl... I looked out the window and around in the floor to see if there was maybe a little rodent running around but there was nothing running around inside or anything outside that would've made it just fall. Then we went to a haunted prison for like a family reunion day before we went and grabbed lunch together. We were down in the lower level that's like the basement area I think it was called the isolation cells or something  and I begin to feel really nauseated  and feeling like overheated and choked off.. so I sat down on an old bench and I just took my phone out and opened the camera app and turned off the flash and just aimed it to look behind me weirdly I didnt notice anything when I was uploading the pictures from that day but on the one specific  photo my friend posted out a glare and what appeared to be a face in the area I sat down in. There was also a bunch of buzz going around saying that a group had placed a chair against the corner of the room they used as the school at the time and would walk away or sleep in the room only to come back or wake up and find the chair sitting in the middle of the room

  I have a good relationship  mostly with the sun. I just recently  started wearing sunscreen especially when it's really hot or I'm spending all day at the pool or a amusement park  or something  where I know the sun is going to be directly  on me. Once when I was like 13 I got sunburned pretty bad. I think it was  bc it was a really hot day, the sun was directly shinning in the area and they recently cleaned the pool (it was a public pool next to a firestation) and they would clean it like every hour with 15 minute swim breaks. I got so burned that it was really uncomfortable  to sleep or have anything touching my skin really

  It would be just like the good old days being a kid and not having a care in the world. We would be going to the beach and swimming or just having fun finding games to play or things to do. The weather would be beautiful but not to hot or cold where we can enjoy it in california with my family.

  I think it's better to forget who others were at times then forget who you were because there was this one episode of law and order I watched where this girl used to be beautiful and had a family and was in college and a cheerleader but then she randomly went missing. I guess the person who like kidnapped her brainwashed her so badly that she forgot her name and went by a different  one, lived on the streets and was homeless and I think even addicted to drugs even though she was this girl who was innocent and they had to like take her back to her old life and retrace like the college dorm and stuff to see if she remembered her old life which shortly started to come back to her

   Derek is single now. Bet you are going to go after him for a date now.
  ","
  Just bc someone is single doesnt mean I'm going to go after them to try to date them. I dated his brother, I absolutely  loved his brother. I was even INLOVE with his brother. But it didnt work out and I dont think we ever will or would've and I dont have the trust or energy to even try to anymore. Derek I always seen as a brotherly figure growing up. He was always there for me when I needed advice from someone or just a life lesson. I never ever once saw him as anything more then that. If you truly knew me you would know I never dated him but his cousin and his brother and like 2 friends of his. That's it. I'm also in a relationship  with someone currently  so it's kinda disrespectful  towards me and my boyfriend that you even would claim something like this that isn't even true bc while you were writing this message I was with him.

   HAPPY 20TH BIRTHDAY TO MY DEAR BABY SISTER 🦋
  ","
  Happy birthday Dani!!!!!!!!! I already texted most of this to u but I want the rest of the world to know how special you are ❤️ Can’t believe we are both in our 20s now that’s so crazy. I still see you as the emo 13 year old you were listening to All Time Low and wearing fake gauges. Dani you are unlike anyone else on this planet. You are the funniest, funnest, most vivacious person I’ve ever met and I feel so so so deeply blessed that God put you on this earth as my sister. You have such a bright light inside of you that I would do anything to keep alive. No one could EVER replace you. No one could even come close to even thinking about replacing you. You have such a special place in my heart. No matter where life takes you, know that I will always drop everything for you. Anywhere, anytime you can always count on me. I feel so lucky when I think about all the memories we have together especially as teens when we would drive around in the truck and I would make you drive and you would play all these weird rap songs I didn’t understand the appeal of and then we would talk about how we didn’t fit in with the other kids our age but how that was okay cause we wanted to be different. It sucks that I don’t get to see you everyday anymore. You were literally like a barnacle stuck to my side for my whole life but I wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. You are the most caring, giving, and empathetic person it’s crazy. You give people chances and chances and chances even when they don’t deserve it and you always see the good in people probably a little too much sometimes lol No one has or ever will understand me quite like you do and I dare say no one can understand you quite like I do. I miss you everyday. You’re truly a national treasure ✨ I love you the absolute most. ❤️sugar & spice forever

While mom,dad, alex,christian, nick joey, dani and I all lived in the family house. Christina got married which made her buy her own house and move in with her husband nick, dani moved out as soon as she turned 18 with her now husband emmyn into his family house which they now have their own apartment  together. Lisa and katherine had the older girls house and amy and I moved into our own together which our friend arielle. Lol.

  I just came out with this song. It’s called Automatic Love. It’s about a time when I was too scared to speak up and stand up for myself because I didn’t think I could handle the conflict that might occur if I did. That lead to me feeling very alone and isolated in the relationship I was in at the time. I felt like we were both almost like robots, doing everything we thought we should do and saying everything we thought we should say to keep the peace and keep each other “happy”. I just wanted to be a “good girlfriend” and I thought that meant taking the blame for anything I was upset about and trying to change my perspective on it so I wasn’t upset anymore instead of talking about it and fixing the problem. There’s only so long you can continue like that until the problems build up and the resentment piles on and on and on until there’s no love, no trust, and all that’s left is an empty hole where something beautiful could’ve been.

  Maybe when you're  trying to keep something  from them weather it's to protect them for a few years or to make sure they really will understand  even though it will hurt them when the time comes. Or maybe you brought say a toy for their birthday or a game they wanted and you have it hidden at home but then you're out shopping and they beg you for the item you brought so y ok u try to distract them or say you will buy it later when you have money is okay

  Like 7 times I think... because our family was living in a small house when I was younger and our family was expanding so we needed more room so we moved like house twice I think. Then we moved from el Dorado hills to Malibu and moved houses twice... till we found one that fit all of us for 5 years and was easy to go from la to Malibu for our jobs. Then we moved to nashville and while the older girls had their own apartments me and dani and the younger boys lived at the family house then when dani moved out into emmyns family house l. Me and amy moved into an apartment together and eventually moved into our own house and kallen was living with us for a year and moved back to California  making it to where we needed a roommate  so arielle now lives with us

   #BLM: What's your take, stance, and/or opinion? What about your take on the riots? And the looting and burning?
  ","
  We should fight to be heard but do it respectfully  and peacefully. Some communities are rooting and looting which is different from protesting that literally makes you a criminal and as for the cops unreasonably  gassing or shooting innocent people shows that they shouldn't even wear their badges or be a police officer bc they're suppose to protect and save lives even tho not all are bad but just the ones doing that...

  We do all the things we know we should
  
  'Cause everything is always good
  
  We push it down in this automatic love
  
  Losing sleep and my priorities
  
  Cause I cant keep all these promises
  
  Watch you bleed out insecurities
  
  So you cant see
  
  That you're hurting me

  We're  screaming under our breaths
  
  Dont know how to let it show

  Not really a fan of either. Cats used to bite and scratch me when I was younger but I'm kinda used to being around them now and even have a kitten that's outside (its mom is a stray cat that just hangs out around our yard) that lays on our back patio and tries to play with us everytime we go outside. So I've kinda grown to like the little guy. Theres also a few that are hiding in our shed that i got to grab and move to a safer spot this week as well bc the family dog jessie tries to idk play with them or attack them but ends up injuring them :(. Dogs I'm terrified of bc of an incident when I was younger that happend when I was with a friend her dog started to attack me and pull on my hair and a bunch if other dogs joined in...

Is anybody worried for the kids growing up with their whole lives being recorded and broadcast by their parents?  

Do you think it is a breach of their privacy to be posting the kids acheivements and failures on facebook?
  ","
  I think the kids should have some privacy as the grow up and get older considering one : people are weird and like to steal pictures of your children off your accounts and try to rename them and claim they are theirs. 2. As the child becomes older they may start to consider their sexual preferences and gender 3. Having pictures plastered and tons of followers or people may not be the best thing for them especially if they want to become a different gender. 4. Parents also go through a grieving process with the transition bc in a way you're loosing a child

  I use this cream that my mom gave me made out of essential oils. It tends to help with my skin from becoming inflamed or broken out. I'll see if I can find the name of it for you.

   how are you
  ","
  Just so people are aware: christina and nick, this is their second pregnancy  and second child. The first child didnt get to breathe or walk on earth.  Christina miscarried. It's no ones fault and we didnt know she had a genetic blood clotting disorder which may have been the reason to her loosing their first born. It was a very emotional pain and loss for the entire family.   And we had a tour a week later which we thought about cancelling as well to allow christina to heal. She and nick ended up naming the first baby ""Sperro"" which means ""Hope"" in Latin. Sperro would've been born around this time the baby was due in may. Which is why we waited to do the gender reveal and post it today. Because it's kinda a little remembrance  towards sperro and their new son that is due in august. We will never forget sperro and love and remember  the baby that gave us hope and their rainbow child. 💙

  Just been having a run around with the pharmacy and doctor office. Pharmacy said they couldnt refill  my prescriptions  so called the doctor. Got a call today from the doctor stating  I have to make a follow up appointment  since I havent seen them since the day I was hospitalized  for coming into contact with tainted water  in Cuba. So called them the lady didnt seem to know what she was doing at all but claimed she made an appointment  for next week ( wanted to schedule me originally in September  wtheck). So had to do something for amy and noticed they refilled my prescriptions along with Amy's 🙃 so idk if I want the appointment  or not or if it's just going to continue being a mess

  Dont want to start an argument or anything or really get  involved but as a friend and fan I'm highly confused. Jack left roadtrip before all this drama even happend.

  I met him when I first moved to Tennessee.  He was in the church's youth group that I attended. So we got to know eachother over the days we attended church and my parents got to know his parents then in 2016-2017 they suggested we go to prom together which we did as friends and started dating in November of that year but broke up due to personal reasons. And we got back in contact after three years when he returned back home  from Alabama after attending university and just hung out as friends. Then started to date again which only lasted 5 months....

  To the anons/people who just want to try and ruin all my friendships or whatever with people I actually care about or try to bring me down please stop. Your obsession with me or your random obsession  with anyone I associate with is really weird. I'm trying to fix my life and deal with things i been struggling with for awhile. The past 7 months have been absolutely  a roller coaster of toxic and good and bad. I'm fi ally picking up everything that's left of me and moving forward even though 2020 has been far from good and just bad news every day. I shouldn't even have to post this but the comments, the hate the weird posession or thinking you own me like I'm some object is really sick. I'm a human, I have feelings, I care about others, I make mistakes, I'm not perfect... !!! That's life, but please have some respect for me and my friends. Please treat me and anyone else like a normal person. As for the people getting upset bc I dont want to be with them or I only see them as a friend understand  that I just got out of a really toxic relationship  and I constantly  have to deal with that and fans invading my privacy. I have to deal with being tagged in pictures I dont want to be tagged in our see his name pop up everywhere  I look. I also was shattered, lied to and hurt and i still have no explanation as to why that person chose to do that... but I'm tired, I'm exhausted and i just am done dealing with this. I really have feelings for someone who's been there through thick and thin with me and the only person who really knows everything and what i been dealing with is my sisters and my bestfriend
  
   @alicexrosexking
  
  even though we dont see eye to eye and argue from times I'm glad I have a friend like her. But that person knows my actual feelings towards him as well and right now it's just not the time to deal with anything drama related. I am a human

  Childish and immature. You shouldn't be fighting over something as someone cutting in front of you. Yeah it's a bit rude but you can just confront them and be like hey you cut in front of me can you please go to the back of the line or just let it go. As for busting glass bottles over people's heads that's uncalled for and you can be charged for that. Be kind and understanding
