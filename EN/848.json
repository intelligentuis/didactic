Something that haunts us... And before people bother to reach out to save us its to late... The demons inside already have gotten to us. I miss you so much. It just doesn't feel real to me at all. There's no explanation to how or when but just a text explaining youre never coming back. And literally all I did was blink .... And now you're gome for good. ...

Being quarantined has given me a lot of time to think and just kind of sit with myself. A lot of feelings\/problems have come up that would\u2019ve been easy to push away with all the distractions of normal life. I have spent many nights between the hours of 1am and 4am crying and trying to sort myself out. The biggest thing I\u2019m learning is to come to terms with the truths of myself and my life. Bad things happen. We make bad choices. We have demons we don\u2019t want to have. But if it happened it happened, and ruminating on how it shouldn\u2019t have happened or you should\u2019ve done something differently only prolongs your own mental torture. It\u2019s okay that it happened. I made it through. I got stronger because of it. Yeah in a perfect world it shouldn\u2019t have happened, but this world is far from perfect and this is what we have to deal with. The past can\u2019t hurt you anymore. It\u2019s gone. It\u2019s over. All you can do is accept it, learn from it, make better choices this time, or just walk in confidence knowing that if it happens again, you know how to handle it.
