there seemed to be a pattern that each sibling was extremely different than the one right above them . nick , the next brother born , was no exception to that rule . where christian was more quiet , thoughtful , and even philosophical , nick was wild , fierce , and a force to be reckoned with . nick had endless energy and hated sitting still for longer than a couple minutes . nick was very stubborn and particular about things , similar to his sister christina . christian was so excited to have a brother so close to his age , as they were months apart , and they quickly became best friends . in the year , the family was completed . the last boy of the family , joseph , nicknamed joey , was born and he completed the trio of the youngest boys . joey , like nick , was full of boundless energy . he was known to run around and play with his siblings nonstop until he would randomly fall asleep in the family room . joey was easygoing and very smiley , and like his older siblings , loved music from a young age . joey would sing often and loved to entertain his older siblings . christian and nick were so happy to have another little brother to play with , and the three of them became inseparable . to be continued . . next week , we will learn more about the early days of the cimorelli family !","784418":"only a year after amy was born , the cimorelli family welcomed another child , alexander . they started calling him alex almost immediately . along with lisa , alex was one of the more introverted and shy members of the family . whenever anyone came to the door , alex would hide behind his mom . he was very thoughtful , observant and analytical from a young age . as a kid , alex could be described as a man on a mission . he was incredibly curious and used to empty out all the drawers in the house , make huge messes and stick things into the outlets . alex was also always very sunny and smiley , and whenever people met him , they instantly loved him . two years later , lauren was born , continuing the long line of girls in the cimorelli family . lauren loved music and learned to sing twinkle twinkle little star in latin at the age of . she was also fearless and kept up with her older siblings . she loved skateboarding and swimming , and was confident in her ability to succeed . she was also very serious and focused , and sometimes if something she did seemed less than perfect to her , she would burst into tears of frustration . lauren loved fashion and putting together fun and funky outfits . christina loved dressing her up as a model for photoshoots , and as usual , lauren was up to try anything ! not long after lauren came into the family , another little girl was born . danielle , although close in age to lauren , was very different from her older sister . where lauren was more sporty , dani her nickname from a young age was more of a girly girl and was obsessed with carrying a purse and a pink toy cell phone . dani was sassy and fun , and up for any adventure . she loved making up games with her siblings , often creating her own restaurant or cafe and cooking food for her siblings . dani was quick to learn and try new things , and always excited by a new experience . the next child in the cimorelli family was another boy , christian . he was naturally deep , inquisitive and very smart . more on the introverted side , christian loved reading and music . he started playing the drums when he was , learning new rhythms very quickly and with ease . christian also loved writing songs and he made his siblings smile with the lyrics he came up with . by the time christian was born , his older sisters christina , katherine and lisa were quite a bit older than him ages and they loved having a baby brother","784419":"katherine was the third child . she was very different than her older siblings . while they were both more intense personality wise and welcomed confrontation , she was much more peaceful and avoided conflict . she was social , made friends easily and loved being with her friends more than anything . she was also sensitive and artistic , spending hours getting lost in books and poetry , as well as writing her own poems and stories . she was very passionate about musical theatre and she was in musicals . towards the end of her time in musical theatre , she was given a few comedic acting roles and realized how much she loved comedy . the fourth child was named lisa . lisa was similar to christina in that she was perfectionistic and driven , but in a very different way . lisa was very deep , self reflective and analytical from a young age . she loved to sing and perform for her family members , often original songs she made up as a young girl . she was athletic as well , excelling in triathlons and figure skating . she was very quiet until she started to slowly started to come out of her shell around the age of , and out of the oldest kids , she was by far the most introverted . amy was next . the fifth child in the family , amy was the smallest of all the kids . it got to the point where she didn t seem to be growing at all for a long time . at age , she was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called turner s syndrome , which , among other things , affects growth . other than being the smallest member of the family , amy was also the most social , outgoing and people oriented . she always had a big smile on her face . any time a guest came over , amy would take them by the hand and give them a tour of the house . she also was born with the loudest , most powerful singing voice in the family . any time amy sang , people were blown away to hear this huge , powerful voice coming out of a tiny girl . to be continued","784420":"our story begins many years ago in the small town of lodi , california where a girl named lynne fell in love with music . lynne was a focused , driven individual and she devoted many hours to her two main hobbies piano and swimming . she went on the excel in both , becoming an all american swimmer and earning her master s degree in music with a concentration in piano performance . in college , while lynne was practicing piano for hours a day for her recitals , she met and fell in love with a passionate construction engineering management major named mike . the story is that a mutual friend connected them , and they ended up meeting in the cafeteria to talk one on one for the first time . they ended up talking for so long that they lost track of time . only when people started coming into the cafeteria for the next meal did they realize they had been talking for several hours . they were friends for four years . over those four years , they remained friends but didn t date as lynne always had a boyfriend . however , once she was single , mike started dating her , and that was where they really got to know each . while they had both been raised catholic , that was as far as their similarities went . mike s family was a loud , italian crew while lynne s quieter norwegian irish family interacted completely differently . still , they fell in love , and they ended up moving to a small town in the hills of northern california . neither of them had planned on having a big family , but they were open to whatever god gave them . about every months , they had a baby and so , kids were born . oldest to youngest , they were named michael mike jr . , christina , katherine , lisa , amy , alexander alex , lauren , danielle dani , christian , nicholas nick and joseph joey . the oldest kid , michael , was born in . energetic , outgoing , and a risk taker , he had an engineering brain from a young age . he was known for working on endless projects taking computers apart and putting them back together , working on cars , and building half pipes and jumps for skateboarding escapades with friends . he begged his mom to get him a guitar , and once he received it at age , he played rock and metal for hours a day . he was friendly and social , but also fiery and fearless . next in line was the second child , christina . christina was driven , perfectionistic , and a born leader . when she was years old , she asked her mom to order her a planner she had found in a catalogue . she waited every day for it to be delivered . then when she received it , she scheduled out her days , including blocks for free time . with her focus , determination and talent , she excelled at anything she tried , achieving level in gymnastics , breaking records on swim team , learning the piano at age , and earning lead roles in musicals . she became a leader for her siblings , setting the bar high in her accomplishments and moral standards . katherine was the third child . she was very different than her older","784421":"yeah aha","784422":"hello , but on a side note i m so excited we get to go on tour and it starts in a few weeks cant wait to see y all","784423":"remove the

perfectly i could choose peace over this . and then letting it go as best i can . i m trying to start seeing succeeding and doing well as an option i get to choose rather than something that i absolutely must do or else i will die cause with the amount of anxiety that whole concept causes me , it seems to be that i ve been seeing it as a life or death thing . i m reading a book called
