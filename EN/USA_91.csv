   What's your favorite christmas tradition? 😁 You have any unique ones in your family? 😊
  ","
  Decorate the tree.. still need to do. Atleast the outside is getting lit at the moment  ❄🎄
  
  usually go to family stuff on Christmas eve. Open presents. In AZ we do a secret santa since there's so many people.
  
  have the whole day to ourselves on actual christmas day. Watch movies. Open presents. Dad gives those chocolate covered cherries as a traditional gift. Usually have Chinese food for dinner.
  
  This year will be a little different as my sister and her husband will be going to his parent's house for Christmas so we'll be having an early one?

   ~ when you picture your ideal self, what do you look like? do you look as you currently are now, or are you different entirely? what, if anything, would you change about yourself to fit this ideal image?
  ","
  A skinny/healthy/fit version of myself. I'd still be me but smaller. Nothing too dramatic besides a smaller weight. My personality and outlooks have  never changed so I don't think I have to worry about that part of myself. Even in dreams at times, I'm not ""as I am now"".
  
  I don't really feel like I'm ""changing to fit that ideal"". Goes beyond that for me. Been bigger most of my life. Didn't know it was a medical issue because apparently Massachusetts doctors suck at their job or hide the real reasons from you. Tried and failed plenty of times because of that. Time to be selfish and really do it for myself, others and life in general. Pcos and fatty liver isn't something that should be neglected due to doctors not doing their jobs. Putting in the work to match the person I see inside. Fighting for what I want and know that its obtainable, eventually. Not on any timeline.. that doesn't work for me. Just one day at a time. Not in any race. Listen to myself and body, nutrients needed. Healthy mindset.

  Could be their own ""gods"". The TheravadaBuddhismfocuses on the original teachings ofBuddha. It is all about one's own enlightenment. The main goal is to be a saint (arhat) and to live in the Nirvana (God). The MahayanaBuddhismis the way of embracing love.

   using slices as a measure of quantity is inconsequential. you can divide a pizza into more or less slices. so is saying A WHOLE pizza is. different pizzas are different sizes and thicknesses. only way to measure quantity accurately is by weight (mass). any other method is completely apocryphal.

   so only carbs matter? can you eat as many calories as you want as long as its keto? or does that matter too?
  ","
  No. All the macros do.. it's more protein and fat consumption. Low carb and sugar. You look at the net carbs more though instead of all of them.
  
  Pretty much but could count to some people. They look at net calories too.

  Idk kind of a mindfuck there. Sometimes I feel like I'm not ready to let someone in, other times I do. I'm more focused on myself. Haven't met anyone that I saw any kind of potential long term relationship with. Haven't clicked with anyone genuinely. If I had to do fwb or anything like that then I'd rather have that happen naturally instead of talking about it beforehand. The suspense there is the fun of it.

  She's added some bananas, apples, oatmeal, potatoes and some other foods back in. She's still trying for low carb.

  Bit odd. We were talking on the way back about how we like the traditional style better.
  
  The stuffing had mushrooms in it. Wasn't legit stuffing from inside the turkey type way. This lady made a ground turkey wrapped in bacon and had an egg and olives inside of it. They didn't have much veggies. There was some zucchini lasagna thing but that never got passed around. Think the turkey was cooked in a cranberry glaze or something. The potatoes had cheese and were crunchy like.
  
  Was just odd.. Traditional is way better. The ham was pretty good.

   When eating out can you see the purpose of an hors d'oeuvre - a small dish served before the main meal in European cuisine also known as a starter or appetizer?

   How do they react differently? Before you answer, keep in mind that the body converts fructose to glucose
  ","
  Fructose breaks down in your liver and doesn’t provoke an insulin response. Glucose starts to break down in the stomach and requires the release of insulin into the bloodstream to be metabolized completely.
  
  And then there's me with insulin resistance lol ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  
  Its different since fruit offers good stuff like vitamins, antioxidants and water. Whereas cake and other sugary sources don't have as much nutritional value.

489698,"
   So I don't get why one kind is okay and the other is bad
  ","
  Here are a few sweeteners that are high in carbs, can increase blood sugar levels and interrupt ketosis:
  
  Maltodextrin:This highly processed sweetener is produced from starchy plants like rice, corn or wheat and contains the same amount of calories and carbs as regular sugar (25Trusted Source).
  
  Honey:High-quality honey contains antioxidants and nutrients, making it a better choice than refined sugar. However, it’s still high in calories and carbs and may not be suitable for a keto diet (26Trusted Source).
  
  Coconut sugar:Made from the sap of the coconut palm,coconut sugaris absorbed more slowly than regular sugar. However, it’s also high in fructose, which can contribute to impaired blood sugar control (27Trusted Source,28Trusted Source).
  
  Maple syrup:Each serving of maple syrup packs a good amount of micronutrients like manganese and zinc but is also high in sugar and carbs (29).
  
  Agave nectar:Agave nectaris about 85% fructose, which can decrease your body’s sensitivity to insulin and contribute to metabolic syndrome, making it difficult for your body to regulate blood sugar levels (30Trusted Source,31Trusted Source).
  
  Dates:This dried fruit is often used to sweeten desserts naturally. Despite supplying a small amount of fiber, vitamins and minerals, dates also contain a substantial amount of carbs (32).

  Refined would be a no on keto because usually has corn syrup and all these other added sugars that would raise glucose.
  
  Natural has no chemicals added. Won't effect glucose as much. Keeps you fuller for longer. Easy to digest.

  The missing period is part of my pcos symptoms. The last one was 2017.. unexpectedly.. it was years before that.
  
  Hasn't regulated naturally since. I believe Provera or something that started with P was mentioned. But they wanted to do bloodwork before doing anything to see where I was at.. and clearly that didn't go well as hormonally stressed and estrogen was low.

   yes! all the time. yes sugar glaze! the nice thing is they are very 'durable' so they can withstand a 'hot glaze' so i can boil water and granulated sugar instead of using powdered sugar in a cold glaze. saves me having to make powdered sugar! might make some tomorrow. options......

   see its like different than people think. in italy pasta is just a given.  its the ""primo' first course. then you have the 'secondo' thats like the entree or whatever. but you use the primo (cheaper) food to fill you up the most. then move on to the entree. not a necessity now, now its just culture.

  The babies are called pups. Aw
  
  There are more than 1,300 bat species distributed across six continents; about 50 bat species live in national parks across the United States, and Indonesia hosts 219 bat species — more than any other country. Bats make up one-fifth of the mammal population on Earth, according toBat Conservation International.
  
  Some bats migrate to warmer areas, while others go into a short-term form of hibernation called torpor. During torpor, a bat reduces its metabolic rate, lowers its body temperature, and slows its breathing and heart rates.
  "
490233,"
   nowadays may be veiwed as different because times are different. hundreds of years ago or even thousand when italian cuisine was developing pasta was used daily. you may only have a small amount of meat you can afford so you use the flavor of that small amount and season a pot and then add pasta

  Being determined, knowing what you want, the end result, striving for something, can do attitude,  pushing away doubts,  doing it for yourself first, testing limits, believing in yourself, making time for whatever it is, maybe making a schedule to stick with it.

   Spam to go: Ever order appetizers only when dining out?
  ","
  No. I personally don't need appetizers. I'm fine with soup/salad if it comes with that. Never ordered appetizers for myself. Everyone else always gets stuff and shared with the whole table.
  
  I guess at Friendlys the quesadilla sample meal thing could count since it's a bunch of little samples of appetizers? I either got that or chicken and fries.

  He talked about building something before though.
  
  There was this place that had a huge wooden playground fort, mini golf, different wooden buildings and they went out of business. People could buy them. The owner was going to sell the fort part to us but at the last minute sold it to someone else.

  Yes. No matter what I write, say I was in the wrong and all that they have a go at it. That I can't comprehend anything etc

   It just makes it seem like you don’t really understand racism. Racism takes so many forms. There are racists who have sex with people of color, who work with people of color (comfortably often), etc. Let alone hold the door or hug or take a selfie with!

   If someone was being really fatphobic towards you: blaming you for your weight gain, mocking you for ever letting yourself get fat, etc. and you called them out and they said “no I held the door for a fat girl at the gym today!” Would you assume they aren’t fatphobic?
  ","
  They literally did last night. Especially when it had nothing to do with the topic at hand. You guys were out to hurt instead of me carelessly writing a word. Yes, it's still hurtful but I wasn't attacking anyone at the time.
  
  I think it depends more on the individual and the actual fat person in question instead of as a whole race.
  "

   You sound so much smarter and more polite and respectful now. Why can’t you do this T the beginning before everyone on ask forms a horrible opinion of you... :(
  ","
  The only way that I was smart in this situation is not attacking back. Calling someone stupid says more about their own intelligence than mine. Could have used other vocabulary, synyoms. Calling insults takes away what they are trying to get across as well. It doesn't add anything to the discussion.
  
  I was looking at the view point about ""hating"".. like why would I hug someone or help them if I  truly hated them based on skin color. I would have avoided them if that were the case. Yet those become ""excuses"" somehow. Other layers of racism were mentioned when I wasn't even thinking of all the different types. I'm wrong with whatever I do say.
  
  I get how the saying the actual word instead of writing it out could be an excuse.. still shouldn't get called names for it. Everyone makes mistakes. I didn't use any stereotypical descriptions about her own people.. just because I'm bigger shouldn't matter at all. Imagine if I acted the same way as they did on my own page.

  Wasn't thinking about others, didn't feel like writing out Chinese again.
  
  I don't bring race into every single answer. I don't always view the whole picture when answering questions.
  
  Just like the n word question.. I viewed it in a school setting. I didn't think of the injustice of slavery, how those kids reading would feel about it. I viewed it as a personal experience where I was in school and someone else read  it, skipped over the word or used negro instead. Yet eggsy was all QUESTION ABOUT RACE, RACIST, RACISM. Yes, I added a bad part of that where she kept talking about taking back the word etc apologized for not knowing everything.
  
  My examples this time were considered as ""excuses"" again and more racist antics.
  
  It's also wrong to call people stupid. Fat isn't nice either when I've been working hard on that too. Way smaller than I've been, especially when it's more medical reasons.
  
  They were trying to hurt. I was just not thinking. THEY were thinking about what to write to hurt. There's a difference there. Yes, stupid and fat aren't racial slurs for the millionth time but the intent that way is still there.
  "
491361,"
   prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior. That is the definition of racism and saying the word ""ch*nk"" doesn't qualify imo

  "
491364,"
   Using a racial slur doesnt mean someone is racist. Its just a word and context and frequency count for something
  ","
  It's more complex- Eggsy
  
  I agree with her on that but I don't always think of all the ways either. Race isn't always on my mind. I don't think that saying it once automatically makes you racist either. Other factors would go into it. I wasn't being malicious about it when I wrote that. I understand how it can be wrong. That should have been the end of it instead of wasting hours writing, getting called stupid, and weight/body brought into it. I wasn't trying to hurt anyone but clearly that's what they try doing.

  I'm not owning to anything. I've literally had crushes on both. I helped someone. I literally hugged a girl of a different color on Halloween. Took selfies on Halloween with others.
  
  You don't know everything.
  
  Even you make excuses when you say that attraction doesn't matter.
  
  Improving oneself comes from within not because someone tells you to do something. Obviously I'll be more mindful in general.

  I'm fine. I didn't witness the boys throwing anything or see them. Was walking and the two girls came up to me and told me what happened. The boys were already gone. They seemed fine, just shaken up that someone would do that. Didn't notice cuts or anything.
  
  I'm not sure if they called the cops because one did show up  when I was at the end of the street but the boys and girls weren't in that area anymore so idk. One of the girls did have a cellphone. Cop said hi to me as I was passing. I didn't say anything since the kids weren't there and didn't know their names or anything so bit hard to just be all ""boys throwing glass"" without  witnessing it, them being there etc

  I was looking for something at The Dollar Store but they didn't have them and as I was leaving noticed the fuzzy socks #sucker
  
  Frys (food store) - just some mission carb balance tortillas. They didn't have some of the stuff I was looking for. Almost got Rebel ice cream but I was going to the gym after so was like nah..
  
  Goodwill:
  
  Black skirt with a zipper going down the middle with the little hoop at the top
  
  Two basic tanks (red/pink color and a blue)
  
  Pair of dark grey..almost black jeans. Brand was Cotton On. Apparently $20 for them online and other ones go for $30+... not bad for getting for $4.
  
  Orange ribbed bodysuit from forever 21.
  
  ~
  
  The red jumpsuit and green 2 piece ""dress"" set were from Ross. Didn't end up getting anything from there though. Also the heels were from there too.

  Yes, a few times. I didn't feel the pulsatingness last night but my skin did feel very soft after. Sometimes it can be a hit or miss with that. Can use with water or apple cider vinegar. I did the acv. It's almost empty so might be why it wasn't as strong?

  Nah. I'm good. Too early for that sh!t. Also too early for this. Like you don't know me at all.

   what sorts of stories do you write?

  The one I was talking about was based on a Spanish soap opera. Both parents died. Has an older sister that is perfect. Looks after the father's business that he left her. Whereas the one I played was a bit of a wild card. Lots of angst towards her family, dealing with the loss. Massage therapist. Reckless abandonment.
  
  So whatever came to mind based on the character and events that were assigned.
  
  Definitely some graphic content going on in it too but still a real plot as well :p

  Watch this person not even have me there or the guy who was asking me name, age, location. Like that's wicked boring and doesn't have anything to do with being socially awkward at all.

Don't need no filler talk, man. If you follow me then you should already have known that type of information. Sound stupid asking for my name when it's on my page, people call me it and all that. I don't promote my sc anywhere else so people should know basic things about me already if they want to even talk with me especially when they were the ones to A. Get my sc name B.

  Love them. Just don't have any yet. Don't like needles, rather be 100% sure what I want and also be at goal size instead of having tats stretch out and not look good.

  Not religious but my uncle has a cross tattoo and I've always admired it. His is on his knuckle but I'd want it more on the inside of my left middle finger. Could be a good tribute piece if it came to that too.

  I've always loved roses but don't have any design or anything in mind for that. Unique ones would be better.

  Being stressed and need to do a 24 hour pee test? Living the life, man. Why do doctors have to nit pick every little thing? Like clearly normal the last time but now need to be annoying. Also get pee shy at times..
  
  Pretty sure waking up early when you didn't need to be up that early, being with someone who annoys you, going to the dr to get bloodwork that keeps dismissing you and then finally accepts you, being in a new place would all be somewhat stressful? Also hating doctors in general would add to it too.
  
  Should probably take my multivitamin again as it contains estrogen in it and mine was low.
  
  Everything else was fine though.

   What does “you’re the best of the worst” mean??

  I'd view it relationship wise. Comparing you to other people they've been with.. probably abusive, bad person or other things going on within those relationships.
  
  You are a good person but you might still process some of those traits which are bad.
  
  It could be more to do with that person and their mindset of you instead of you actually being ""the best worst"". Or maybe they aren't ready for a relationship with you so casting you off in that light without giving a chance.

  Gym would have been around 2014 but was doing other workouts in the meantime. Zumba made me like it more. Watching shanaemily on YouTube do gym videos made me feel like I could do it. Introduced me to 1stphorm. The rest is history lol
  
  Running.. my now ""1stphorm coach"" made people run for a challenge.. just a mile but I kept on doing it while at the gym's track. Seemed more fun. More my decision rather than someone forcing it on me like school days...

   what’s your thoughts on gift cards? do you like receiving those?
  ","
  Yes. I do. I have a couple on my Amazon wishlist.
  
  Kind of annoyed that 1stphorm upped their price on what I need to buy again. $15 dollar increase since the last time I bought it. Madness. Also they don't have giftcards currently.. probably only during holidays which is a bit odd.

  Some add ons and take aways..
  
  I haven't gone to the gym since late September when my 6 month membership ended. I have the money to reup it but kind of checking out other options.. checked out the community one my brother-in-law's brother has tonight.. seems decent but way smaller. A lot of the same machines as my gym. Pools.
  
  Planet Fitness is an option as well since its pretty much free/blackcard.
  
  Idk.. kind of anxious about the whole thing.. learning where everything is, not knowing anyone. The check-in girls at my gym always make me feel welcomed, see the same people usually. Feels like a family. Just seems like it will be  weird starting over elsewhere. I guess if neither are a good fit then I'll definitely reup but will atleast give it a chance I guess.

  Evolution, science and other ways. Just because I don't believe fully (agnostic at best) doesn't mean that I don't believe certain parts of the bible. Reading something won't change people - doing does, taking those actions. I'd also rather believe in myself and others instead of something you can't physically see or touch. I've prayed before and they weren't answered. Bad things happen to good people. Don't fully ""believe everything happens for a reason"" at times.

   If you ask questions about your partner’s ex out of the blue, and they give you “Can we not talk about it anymore?” Altho your partner has talked about it before. Would you say that your partner has still feelings for their ex?
  ","
  Maybe but it could mean that they have moved on? Or they just don't want to put the effort in about talking about them anymore. Memories could pop up.
  
  I don't need to know about a partner's ex anyways. Clearly things didn't work out regardless of whose fault it was. Or maybe they are cheating on you with them and not wanting to talk about it? The phasing is a little iffy... seems a little controlling if this is the way you mean it.
  
  The way I see it, the person is with you now so why worry, be insecure and all that? Unless they are cheating.. then shame on them.
  
  I guess it depends on timing too.. new relationship? Been forever? Guess it depends on what you asked as well. Doesn't seem like much open communication either.

  ","
  Why does weight always have to be a factor? If I was skinny/healthy goal weight you wouldn't say that. How come just because of weight it means someone has to be ""below average"" as well? What do you deem average and below average as too? Why be a d!ck? Probably the same anon that asked the ""fat fetish"" question before.
  
  I'd rather not feel like I'm hideous and guys are only talking to me out of pity or some crap. Fucking hate mindgames. Why not be encouraging/supportive instead of being a douche? Just because you don't find me attractive at all doesn't mean others don't or that they ALWAYS have motives. Atleast I'm trying to put myself out there a bit.
  
  So if someone even pays attention to me i guess there's no real connection happening. Got it. Nobody would ever truly want me. Thanks. 👍

  Yes. Hence asking it. Made me feel like they didn't trust me taking care of their dogs. Just because I mentioned that pickles was whining for food doesn't mean that I wasn't showing her any attention or that I kept on giving her food when she did that. Like no?? Like they've all got attention. One dog bone that day doesn't mean I'm constantly giving her anything.. just seemed really rude how she said it. Like I was doing nothing all day, not even caring for the dogs or anything. I didn't NEED to watch them this weekend if not going to trust me. I've even did THEIR dishes, cleaned up poop (they have a scoop thing otherwise F that lol) and other tasks.

  Maybe a little because everyone would want to know why it ended. Might not be comfortable yet to share everything or keep quiet for personal reasons. People take it too far as well.

   Is time relevancy important when you're finding someone attractive/unattractive? For example, when looking at someone who was considered attractive in the 80's, is their hair too big to be considered attractive now or are 90's eyebrows too thin to be attractive nowadays or does that not matter?
  ","
  I don't care about their hair or eyebrows. Whatever looks good on them is key. The attraction should be there including an actual connection.  I view the whole person not their style of doing things, its irrelevant in the end. I'd be dating them, not their hair or eyebrows. Clothing style doesn't matter much to me either, whatever they are comfortable in is good.
