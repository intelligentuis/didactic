  "
981618,"
   Would you die for Jeff?
  ","
  yes, I would.
  "
981619,"
   When will you meet Jeffy IRL if you haven’t already?
  ","
  I have!
  "
981620,"
   You said before that you never would when you were friends and had doubts about your relationship and it’s legitimacy.
  ","
  Because I didn’t think he was the type of person to met up with someone in real life who was online but once we started dating of course we did.
  "
981621,"
   So you did meet Jeffy okay ignore that question
  ","
  obviously we’ve met

981622,"
   quit being a simp other anon

  🤯
  "
981623,"
   Are you and Jeff the same person?
  ","
  lmao no🤣 we are two separate individuals
  "
981624,"
   So let’s wrap this up once and for all you really believe Jeffery truly loves you for you and if you were ugly nothing would change and he would still want to be your boyfriend and everything
  ","
  Yeah it’s true he would still be with me if I didn’t look the way I did

981635,"
   I mean like it was his plan from the start to weasel his way into being your “friend” because all he wanted was to date you but he didn’t want it to be too strong and ask you out directly so he waited. I bet if you were ugly or just decent looking he never would have wanted anything to do with you

   Does jealousy have value in driving humans to improve themselves or is it purely a negative emotion?
  ","
  I believe it just depends on the person and their personality. Like for someone people jealousy can drive them to improve themself and that’s what would motivate them to want to do better and for some people it’s just pure hatred and purely a negative emotion towards the person they’re jealous at. And from jealousy they can become obsessive and that can lead to many things. So it just mainly depends on the person and their personality

  I believe that if life has no purpose, that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth living. Maybe you just haven’t found your purpose yet. It definitely takes time. That only means you have to find your passion and create your own purpose in life.

  "
982491,"
   Why do we respect the dead more than the living?
  ","
  I feel like people respect the dead more than the living because they feel they didn’t show that they cared or respected them when they were alive. They feel now that they’re dead we should care more and have more respect for them so that they don’t haunt us and come after us. If we show that we loved them and now care about them it will make us look like we are good people. And that’s extremely saddening. You should show how much you appreciate and love someone while they’re alive so when they pass they would pass away knowing that you cared, loved, and appreciated them. But I noticed people start to care about someone after they’re dead like that’s just messed up and depressing to know. Like with Chester Bennington I noticed that people started caring about him and listening to his music more after he passed because they felt guilty that they didn’t while he was alive. And that just pisses me off so much how someone can say oh yeah I’ve been a fan of linkin park for so long and I’ve been listening to Chester ever since when really they haven’t.
  
  They just say that because he you know 🥺 and that makes me so extremely mad.

  well I believe being committed means that you’re willing to put your all and everything into a relationship and you’re willing to go through every single hardship that comes along with it and go through it with your partner only to become strong as a couple.

  The bitter truth!
  "
983305,"
   It's the truth. You always deserve to be confident and there have been times when you weren't and I would wish so much that you'd see what was obvious to everyone else. So seeing you be at that point feels like having a wish fulfilled.

  This is so sweet omg! I appreciate your kindness very much! 🥺

  "
983314,"
   Do you think it's weird that Jeffrey claims he doesn't want a picture of you both on the internet because it'll last forever, when he simultaneously says he believes you will be a couple forever? If you'll be together forever, why would it matter if the picture was also up forever?
  ","
  No it’s not weird at all. It’s because he wants his privacy and I respect that and he doesn’t want to post his pictures online and yes we are going to be a couple forever but that is completely different from posting a picture online.
  "
983315,"
   Anything coming up in the next month or so that you are really looking forward to ?
  ","
  Not really or that I know of tbh lol
  "
983316,"
   Do you usually let what other people think or say bother you ?
  ","
  No I don’t anymore. If someone has something negative or hurtful to say they can go ahead and say it because it doesn’t effect me or bother me. And that just shows what kind of person they are on the inside and outside.
  "
983317,"
   I feel you on driving. I've been doing it long enough to not be nervous I'm just an anxiety filled person though and driving gets me. Lmao

  Yeah ahha I only got my license last year so I’m not used to it yet but I could understand how it can be very anxious tbh!

  I usually like to talk about it mostly at least or sometimes I’ll just keep it to myself
  "
983319,"
   Do you believe that global peace is attainable?
  ","
  No I don’t believe that all. I feel there will always be wars and fights against countries because of disagreements and whatnot.
  "
983320,"
   What makes you nervous?
  ","
  having to socialize with other people, driving still kinda makes me nervous because I’m not used to it yet, tests and quizzes, having to work in groups, going to parties etc.
  "
983321,"
   How often do you go to the movies?
  ","
  Only when I really want to see that movie I’ll go!
  "
983322,"
   Should we forgive our enemies? Why/why not?
  ","
  I feel like it’s healthy to forgive even if it’s an enemy of yours or someone you don’t like. When you forgive them it just gives you so much inner peace and then you can just move on to much happier things after you get that inner peace from forgiving them.

   when someone said “you’re amazing and i don’t deserve you. you deserve someone who won’t doubt you or the things you say. someone who sees a future with you. not a fucked-up person like me. you deserve so much better.” what does that mean? is that an excuse to break up or what?
  ","
  I just think they believe that you deserve better because they aren’t giving you the best and so they start to doubt the relationship. It’s mainly a insecurity.  It’s also means that they’re afraid that they’re going to hurt you emotionally and that person just doesn’t want to put you through that. But it can also be a sign that they want to break up because they have a fear that they’re not giving you their all and hence why that person said you deserve so much better than me.

   Why is it when someone’s angry and they’re yelling at you even though it’s not your fault and they aren’t mad at you. You still feel like they’re blaming you?
  ","
  Because when someone’s angry they take it out on people who are near them. I guess it’s because that’s how they deal with their anger by taking it out on someone who they aren’t necessarily mad at it.

   How do you translate messages on ask?
  ","
  you can copy the question?
  "
983784,"
   Why are there so many people who are lonely? Why is it so hard for people to make real connections when almost everyone wants to make real connections?
  ","
  there’s so many people that are lonely because they’re afraid to get close to someone because some people have the mindset that not everything lasts forever and so they think if they get close to someone like that the other person can just leave at anytime and it’s sad but that’s just many peoples mindset nowadays.  It’s extremely hard for people to make connections with others because they’re scared and worried that the other person can just leave at anytime and so that’s why they become lonely they’re afraid of getting hurt.
  "
983785,"
   How does your behaviour change when you fall in love? 😊
  ","
  When you’re in love you become so much more happier with everything you do in life and that turns into motivation to go after the things you want. It really changes things in a more positive way. And it makes you more aware and conscious that your life isn’t only yours anymore it’s now also your partners life and so you become more careful in everyday life and what you do.

  it’s called euthanasia and I remember writing an essay on it in English class! I honestly think if the person is in that much pain and is suffering to the point they can’t function and do anything by themselves I think euthanasia would be the best option for them especially if they’re in so much pain and suffering to the point they can’t anymore. And it should absolutely be the patients choice entirely after all it is their life so they should have the option to choose if they want to be euthanized. It’s entirety their choice and their families choice.

  "
984774,"
   When you wear flip-flops or sandals, do you ever kick them off while sitting, or take one of them off while standing and perch your bare foot on top of your opposite foot? If you do so, why? Is it because it’s comfortable? Does it help your feet to cool off when they get too hot and sweaty?

  I mean you can be alive and not be living your life to the fullest and not doing things out of your comfort zone and you can exist but not really exist because you follow exactly what other people do instead of doing your own thing and slaying whatever you do.

   How would a guy feel getting rejected by a girl he knows and has feelings for? How would the girl feel rejecting the guy that she knows and has feelings for her, if there is any feelings? Who would you say has it was worse, the guy or girl in this situation?
  ","
  Well I think the guy would feel hurt that the girl rejected him or maybe he wouldn’t care and instead he’d go find someone else. The girl probably rejected him for many reasons to begin with so there’s that to factor in. I would say probably the guy has it the worse because he had the courage to tell this girl he liked her but she rejected him. So he’s probably feeling insecure after that.

   Hypothetical: You do a DNA test like 23AndMe and your DNA shows that you've a significant percentage of DNA from a race you didn't know you were part. Do you then get culturally educated? Start identifying as the race and reclaim their slurs? What actions do you think are/aren't appropriate?

  I mean I have taken the 23AndMe DNA test and I found out I’m races I didn’t even know I was and so I got very interested and started learning about them and their language.  I definitely think it’s appropriate to learn about their culture and language and to try their foods!

   what celebrity death shocked you the most? also, what do you think about people claiming that mourning about celebrity deaths is unnecessary cuz you didn’t know the person on a personal level?
  ","
  Chester Bennington’s death shocked me the most and was the hardest death I have ever dealt with in my life. I remember that exact day. I was sleeping and then I woke up and when I wake up I always check my phone and I have the news notifications on and the first thing I saw was that he committed suicide. And at that moment I started freaking out and telling myself no no no no this can’t be real. They’re just lying to people. This isn’t real. I was in complete denial because I couldn’t believe what I just saw. But then more people started posting it and that’s when my heart dropped and a piece of me died. I remember feeling so lost and heart broken. Completely devastated and a loss for words. I was shaken to the core. I couldn’t believe it. I honestly couldn’t. Broke my heart to know how much pain he was in really and you know what really tears me apart is that we could feel is pain through his music and if you listened carefully to the lyrics in his songs you would be able to feel his pain and misery that he was in but yet no one helped him💔 and knowing that just breaks me and shreds me to pieces. A piece of me has died with him. I’m not whole anymore my other half is along side him. It’s going to be 3 years this year in July without him and I can’t even begin to think about that. When that day comes man I’m going to feel lost and heart broken just like I did last year when it was 2 years without him but then I remember and know that he wouldn’t want us to be in depression or to be sad. He would much rather want us to be celebrating his life always and sharing his music all over the world to keep his legacy alive forever. And I could see it happening and knowing that Chester’s legacy will be lived on forever warms my heart and makes me so very happy. He deserves that much for us to keep his beautiful angelic legacy alive forever and ever. 👼🏻💕 miss you Chester so much.

    @edraegen
   
   actually know each other personally?
  ","
  We’ve been best friends for a long time but never really met in person that is until we developed and started having feelings for each other. We went on a date to see if it was real the feelings we have for each other and turns out it was very much real. We’ve been on 3 dates now and it’s been amazing! We also live pretty close to each other so that’s a plus and that helps.

  ","
  I was definitely looking for a best friend and someone I can talk to openly knowing that they wouldn’t judge me or try to change me and someone who is really kind and supportive and super loving, respectful, honest,caring, silly and loyal and then last summer I came across your page and I remember I was your first question ever answered! And we started talking and I thought to myself wow he sounds like such an amazing and one of a kind guy and then we started getting close and I started to fall for you and catch feelings for you and yes I’ll admit I was very nervous/scared to tell you I had feelings for you but then I eventually did and you felt the same and now look at us, we are so happy together and that just warms my heart and makes me cry of joy. I’m so extremely lucky that I was able to met you. I would say it was faith because I guess the man upstairs knew how much pain and sadness I was in from my previous relationship he said why not let these two cross paths and become lovers because they both deserve each other and I know that their bond will never break and plus they make each other super happy and so our paths first crossed on here and then we happened 🥰 That’s definitely faith and I couldn’t be more happier with you. I love you so muchhhhhhhhh, my everything ❤️

   In your opinion, Is heat or cool temperatures better for any injuries or sick situations. Lets sat a fever. I’ve been told by that it’s better to just sweat out the sickness. Which works In time. And other times to sleep with a ice cold towel on my forhead to regulate body temp. What do you think?
  ","
  Well I think when you’re sick and really cold it’s better to deal with in the heat so that you sweat and eventually feel better and when you are feeling hot it’s definitely better to put a wet paper towel on your forehead or something cold on you. Sickness definitely does depend on the temperature.

   That’s exactly the point. 😄 The quote goes on with: “Why is it selfish? Because the gratification, the goodness that comes to you, the good feeling that I get from helping others. Nothing’s better than that.” — Isn’t it selfish to want that warm feeling you get by helping others?
  ","
  sorry I just woke up, lol yeah I get what you mean. I could see how that can be selfish because of the feeling you get by helping others.  Yeah, it can be selfish to want that warm feeling you get when you help others. I mean maybe someone just wants to help another person just to feel that feeling.

  I mean I definitely believe love can fade away once the relationship is over. You can still love the other person but it will definitely not be the same kind of love you had before. Love definitely fades away I’ve experienced that. And I could tell you, that it truly does fade away and slowly disappears and yeah that’s very depressing but it does happen.

  Well I believe that love can remain in existence with the significant other or person you were seeing even if the relationship ends. If you two truly loved each other there would definitely still be love between you two but it will definitely be different and not the same. I like to believe that at least but I also feel that the other person can lose feelings and the love for you so it fades away and can’t remain in existence. I honestly don’t know what to believe but I feel more towards that love can’t remain because it fades away once you part ways with your significant other or partner. And you lose feelings and the love you had for them. And love is very painful and difficult to deal with it. There’s lot of issues with love and most people don’t know how to deal with or they just play and hurt the other ones feelings. Love is definitely a suffering painful emotion and I don’t believe in it anymore at least for now until maybe I find the right one someday but until then I just don’t believe in it anymore.

   What comes into your mind when I mention light and dark? Is it based off our visual senses? Or is your mind more complex than that.
  ","
  When you mention light I think of the sun and blue sky on  a nice sunny and bright day in the daytime and I think of someone who is happy and very positive and just has a overall positive outlook on life and someone who likes spreading love and happiness wherever they go. When you mention dark I think of the dark pitch black sky and I think of people who are dark in a negative way like serial killers, stalkers, people who are obsessed with other people negatively, the world we live in today, my mind, other people who cause harm to others just because they get off on it or because they’ve lost their minds etc.  I also believe the mind is more complex than our visual senses. The mind is a very complex place and I don’t think anyone can truly ever really understand it.

  that’s how it was with my ex when we dated shortly again in 2018 it was definitely one-sided and I felt it but yet I still went along with it. I don’t know why.  But if you feel that way I would tell you honestly to just walk away because you absolutely deserve better then a one- sided relationship. You deserve someone who loves you just as much as you love them. So you should definitely walk away.

   How do you feel about jealousy in a healthy relationship? Does it belong there or not? — Where does jealousy come from?
  ","
  well I don’t think jealously is a good thing even in a healthy relationship because it can lead to obsession and that can become very dark and scary so I believe jealousy isn’t a good thing at all even in a relationship that’s healthy.  Jealousy comes from someone wanting to be like another person or wanting what they have and your brain tells you that you want to be like that person and it creates an emotion called jealousy and it’s a very dangerous emotion in my opinion.

You can definitely move on by forgiving someone but you don’t have to forget what they did. And that’s what I do. I forgive but I don’t forget.

   What is the best way to say goodbye?
  ","
  honestly it’s never easy to say goodbye. But if you’re saying goodbye to a loved one that passed away I would say to tell them that you love them very much and that they’ll always be in your heart and mind. You’ll never forget them. And if it’s someone like an ex honestly the best way to say goodbye is to just let them go and move on slowly and remember that you deserve much better then them and that’s how you say goodbye to an ex lover.
