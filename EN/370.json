simply try to move forward, whether it's through finding another partner, spending more time with friends and family, engaging in a new hobby, etc etc. life isn't solely about love and relationships,

together and try to progress forward after the breakup.\n  ","397331":"\n  i'm single because we broke up, obviously. we were going steady for a long time, but things eventually fell apart and our relationship was at a standstill. we weren't where we needed to be, he didn't feel as strongly towards me anymore, and we decided to break up and remain friends.\n  ","397332":"\n  uh ... i don't know

someone play video games on twitch and drinking a margarita. :'))\n  ","397350":"\n  my normal routine has changed drastically. i'm no longer commuting to the office to work, i've been working from

want.\n  ","397351":"\n  haha, thank you for asking me my own question ~~\n  \n  i've been self-isolating for the most part. i only went out once since monday night, and that was early in the morning to go to the dunkin drive-thru for five minutes. i've also been washing my hands more frequently and cleaning the house more often.\n  ","397352":"\n  at the moment, yes. it's a relief to work from home where i don't have to worry about coming into contact with dozens of people on a daily basis. it's also been nice to roll out of bed at 8:30am to clock in at 9:00am instead of waking up at 7:00am and commuting for 45+ minutes in the morning, haha.\n  ","397353":"\n  i'm usually the one who ends up texting first. :\/ if i waited for people to text me, then i probably wouldn't have anyone to talk to.\n  ","397354":"\n  not for an entire month, no. at the moment, we have enough to last us perhaps two weeks though. either way, grocery stores are considered essential stores and i can go there at any time.\n  ","397355":"\n  not really, no. sometimes there are people i text on and it happens to be daily, but then we won't text for a few days. i don't routinely text anyone on a daily basis.\n  ","397356":"\n  #quarantinesurvivalkit\n  ","397357":"\n  not anymore, no. i'm too anxious to be in large crowds. i would rather have a small gathering of 3-4 friends at my house in a relaxed environment.\n  ","397358":"\n  i honestly don't remember. i haven't been to the movie theater in years.\n  ","397359":"\n  not really, no. i'll put on some netflix or hulu at night before i go to bed, but i don't watch television during the day.\n  ","397360":"\n  yes, i have two planned currently. i want to get a black and white writing quill on my right forearm, and then a

one hand, it would be nice to live a life that isn't filled with strife, panic, or struggle. however, on the other hand, challenges and obstacles are what make us strong & wise, and we learn to grow and evolve from those struggles.\n  ","397377":"\n  it isn't wrong to say that it originated in wuhan, china. what's wrong is referring to it as \"the chinese virus\" because it's detrimental against

and i go, \"just do it.\"\n  ","397382":"\n  a little bit of both. i follow my heart most of the time, but there's also a part of my mind that's screaming at me and telling me that what i'm feeling is irrational, lol.\n  ","397383":"\n  yeah, that's really racist.\n  ","397384":"\n  this situation doesn't really apply very much to me because i would never say \"doesn't matter, i know what i saw.\" i would try to assess the situation based on what i saw and *also* gather input from my partner regarding their perspective on the situation. i would tell them that i was uncomfortable with how they were behaving, but i don't think i would go to such lengths as to break up with them.\n  ","397385":"\n  i believe i'm living up to my potential. my talents are in writing and editing, and i'm thankful that i've been able to find a job in my field that allows me to apply my knowledge and expertise on a daily basis.\n  ","397386":"\n  i believe i was too young to really watch this movie, but \"the grudge\" scared the crap out of when i was younger and watching it for the first time. i had nightmares for months after the fact.\n  ","397387":"\n  probably the early 2010s, when i was attending school, living life to the best of my ability, spending good times with friends, going on small vacations, etc etc.\n  ","397388":"\n  yes, i feel terrible that my previous relationship fell apart. but i'm also trying hard to wrap my head around the fact that not everything is permanent, and i'm also grateful that we're remaining friends after everything that has happened.\n  ","397389":"\n  i wouldn't say i'm as far as proud of what i'm doing, but i'm content with how i'm spending my time and my reactions to certain things. i've been working from home, but i've also been

with my one last gasping breath, i apologize for bleeding on your shirt.\"\n  \n  lmaoo. just kidding. i really don't have an answer to this question.\n  ","397391":"\n  not seeking mental health treatment sooner. i only sought treatment three years ago, but really i should have done so in my teenage years. it took me nearly attempting s*icide in order for me to realize i needed professional help.\n  ","397392":"\n  i think one of the best approaches to resolving conflict is to have an open discussion with the other person regarding what the conflict is about. it's important to be communicating and candid about what you believe, as well as receptive to what the other person is saying. you should try to come to a compromise that benefits the both of you.\n  ","397393":"\n  from what i've read, it definitely isn't as bad as how italy is doing right now (particularly the death rate). however, if more people do not start social distancing like they should be doing, then it's going to inevitably get worse.\n  ","397394":"\n  i'm doing fine, just worried about a few friends of mine who are sick at the moment. i have one friend who's displaying a lot of the symptoms of the coronavirus, and she's supposed to be going to the drive-thru testing site within the next few days.\n  ","397395":"\n  i'm very organized and it's easy for me to find what i need to find within my own personal files, whether it's something physical in my house or on my desktop (my personal desktop or at work). everything is categorized into different folders and subfolders, normally organized by year and date.\n  ","397396":"\n  no, it isn't cluttered by unnecessary things at the moment. i've been focusing all of my attention on work and my friends, and i've cut out of my life people who

","397412":"\n  i mean, if it's valid then it isn't necessarily discrimination. it's just a fact at that point.\n  \n  i.e. i've been sexually harassed on countless occasions on askfm. it isn't discrimination if i choose to ignore a question that i deem to be sexually charged because the evidence is there.\n  ","397413":"\n  paranoia is different from discrimination. paranoia is a symptom of

do, and family members too. in addition, just because you're young does not mean you're not susceptible to the coronavirus.\n  ","397459":"\n  i used to use their shampoo bars and facial scrubs, and i enjoyed them a lot. i don't take baths so i don't use their bath bombs.\n  ","397460":"\n  healthy food makes me feel better about myself, but junk food is something i indulge in when i feel like i need to treat myself.\n  ","397461":"\n  listening to music calms me down a lot.\n  ","397462":"\n  a feeling of admiration for someone in light of their behavior, viewpoints, achievements, and\/or perseverence.\n  ","397463":"\n  they sound incredibly entitled and selfish. spring break in florida encompasses hundreds of people in close proximity to one another, making it a breeding ground for the virus. they're acting irresponsibly, and there's no reason they can't just have a small gathering at their house with close friends in light of the circumstances.\n  ","397464":"\n  they won't have the ceremony postponed to a later date? i understand some people enjoy graduation ceremonies, but it's for the greater good because it's a large gathering of people.\n  ","397465":"\n  no, i have absolutely nothing planned. the only thing i'm thinking about doing is calling my doctor's office and asking if my doctor can just refill my medication without an appointment, because i'm a little hesitant to go to the office. :\/\n  ","397466":"\n  no, i've been working from home.\n  ","397467":"\n  ???\n  \n  i'm not going to bars or restaurants, or even grocery stores for that matter. i went to the dunkin drive thru in my own car for two minutes, lmaoo.\n  ","397468":"\n  ... wut. lmaoo.\n  ","397469":"\n  lately, a few hours per day at the minimum. i admit that i'm probably a bit addicted to social media at this point and i'm always checking\/updating facebook, twitter, instagram, and askfm.\n  ","397470":"\n  i check my personal email once a day. however, when i'm at work, i get notifications with incoming emails so i check my work email very often. a significant portion of my day is spent emailing coworkers and clients, it's our primary form of communication.\n  ","397471":"\n  i love both cats and dogs, depending on the individual personality of the animal. prior to moving in with two cats, i didn't think i liked cats very much -- but these two cats are super sweet, lazy, and affectionate. :'))\n  ","397472":"\n  if i'm outside and i see a neighbor walking to their car or into their house, i'll wave hello. other than that, we don't talk to each other.\n  ","397473":"\n  on a national scale -- i woke up to news that the entire state of california is on lockdown.\n  \n  on a local scale -- apparently there's talk of legislators freezing mortgage payments in new york, but nothing regarding those who rent homes\/apartments.\n  ","397474":"\n  i love documentaries, and i usually watch the true crime docs that are on netflix and hulu.\n

either.\n  ","397477":"\n  happy friday !! i just went to dunkin for breakfast, and the roads were eerily empty around me.\n  ","397478":"\n  i wholeheartedly agree. that's why i mentioned how it can lead to discriminatory behavior against asian people in general, on top of the discrimination they already face.\n  ","397479":"\n  the spanish flu didn't even come from spain, lol. it was another h1n1 case much like we've seen over the past decade.\n  ","397480":"\n  from my understanding, a lot of major sports have been cancelled in the united states at least (basketball, baseball, and hockey are the ones i know of).\n  ","397481":"\n  this is true -- you get what i mean, though. if you're cheating on your partner when you're in a good relationship and you're older than 25, then that's hella immature.\n  ","397482":"\n  i never indicated otherwise. having your sh*t together doesn't correlate with being busy, lol.\n  ","397483":"\n  ???\n  \n  work, bills, family obligations, doctor appointments, errands, seeing friends, etc etc. i'm at the age where i require a partner who has their sh*t together, not someone who's untrustworthy and immature.\n  ","397484":"\n  no, i have no time or energy to give second chances.\n  ","397485":"\n  at the point in my life, any sort of lying and especially cheating.\n  ","397486":"\n  there have been myriad illnesses that come from europe, but we don't refer to them as the \"italian illness\" or \"irish illness\" (as examples). the coronavirus originated from china, but it's a global pandemic now. nearly every country has infected people at this point.\n  \n  it's offensive to asian people in particular, because they're facing even more discrimination from it. even if they're not even chinese. calling it a \"chinese virus\" perpetuates that xenophobia.\n  ","397487":"\n  it varies depending on the person, because everyone has their own individual definition of happiness.\n  ","397488":"\n  i'm not entirely sure, tbh. i've always thought of it as a coincidence or just a misfiring of neurons in the brain, but it happens *way* too often to me.\n  ","397489":"\n  it might make people find roads to express their creativity and make new clothing, so possibly !! i have a few friends who cosplay and quarantining has been giving them the free time they want in order to work on their cosplays.\n  ","397490":"\n  personally, i believe so. it only adds to the discrimination asian people face on a regular basis, and the fact that trump keeps on referring to it as the \"chinese virus\" instead of the coronavirus shows how close-minded he is and how disconnected he is from the severity of the situation.\n  ","397491":"\n  hey friends, i'm bored af so send me your questions ~~\n  ","397492":"\n  i usually berate myself, so i'm probably not the best person to ask this question to.\n  ","397493":"\n  the sun setting later & relieving a bit of my seasonal depression.\n  ","397494":"\n  just explain to them that you love them, in your own words coming from your own heart. everyone shows their love differently.\n  ","397495":"\n  i think the character count is sufficient. most questions asked don't require in depth explanation, and it's also important to learn how to keep questions\/statements concise.\n  ","397496":"\n  because they remind me of his personality, in most cases.\n  ","397497":"\n

the hell.\n  ","397501":"\n  either treasure planet or atlantis: the lost empire.\n  ","397502":"\n  i'd say i'm fairly creative, but it really depends on the day and how my mood is in that particular moment.\n  ","397503":"\n  new selfie ~~\n  ","397504":"\n  yeah, i'm missing my ex boyfriend unfortunately. which isn't unusual, but moreso now than ever before because we've only talked sporadically over the past few days.\n  \n  tbh, everything reminds me of him, lol. certain videos and memes, especially.\n  ","397505":"\n  all of the times i've spent hanging out with friends, whether in the house or around a campfire, where we're swapping meaningful and also hilarious stories until the early morning hours.\n  ","397506":"\n  neither? idk, i feel like i would feel pretty guilty about either of those.\n  ","397507":"\n  seeing ghosts in general, haha. i'm pretty certain my house is haunted, though. we always joke around about the \"demon in the basement.\"\n  ","397508":"\n  i'm doing quite well !! i'm currently on a 15 minute break from work (i've been working from home since tuesday), and it's enough to pass the time for the majority of the day.\n  \n  on my lunch breaks, i've been cleaning the house so that it's less time i have to spend doing so when i'm \"out of work,\" and it's nice not to have constant distractions like when i'm in the office.\n  ","397509":"\n  i thought i had slept too late and was going to clock in late for work, so i jumped out of bed in a panic, haha.\n  ","397510":"\n  the only gripe i would have would be that there are too many rude, inconsiderate, and invasive users (mostly on anon) and askfm seems to do nothing about them.\n  ","397511":"\n  aw, happy first day of spring !! certainly doesn't feel that way outside, though.\n  ","397512":"\n  yeah, it was acting up for me late last night and wouldn't load likes or questions. it seems to be fine today, though.\n  ","397513":"\n  i don't know who BTS is, and i don't like one direction.\n  ","397514":"\n  i've driven in a blizzard before, but i've never chased storms before. my anxiety gets way too high for that sort of sh*t.\n  ","397515":"\n  i suppose the most productive thing that has ever happened to me has been graduating from college. moving out of my parents' house has also been amazing as i've been able to work better on my mental health recovery without being impeded by my parents.\n  ","397516":"\n  \"it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.\" -- albus dumbledore.\n  ","397517":"\n  new video games that are coming out (animal

etc.\n  ","397518":"\n  depends on what you're sick with, or what you assume you're sick with, and whether or not it's contagious. if you feel sick right at this current moment, you're better off

regardless, i'm fine. my lunch break is ending in eight minutes and then i'll have to work for another 3.5 hours. working from home has been amazing, though.\n  ","397524":"\n  i've never used a quill before, but i have used a typewriter. i used to own two of them, but when i moved, i decided to donate them as i had no place to put them in my new house.\n  \n  i prefer typing over handwriting poetry and prose, because my mind often races too fast for me to keep up with it by hand. i'm a very fast typer, so it's easier for me to simply type -- especially when i think twice about something and decide to delete it. it's very convenient.\n  \n  i haven't written anything in two months or so, unfortunately.\n  ","397525":"\n  i've drunk texted my ex on a few occasions shortly after we broke up, LOL. it didn't amount to anything bad in the long run, but i was totally ashamed and embarrassed.\n  ","397526":"\n  no, not really. my life has been defined by change (as is many other people's lives) and eventually you learn to accept them as they come up and work your way through them.\n  ","397527":"\n  my last missed call was from my roommate, and i didn't answer because i wasn't around my phone at the time.\n  ","397528":"\n  i don't like frappes from starbucks or dunkin or anything, but if you ever have the chance, get a greek frappe. it's just made with instant coffee, water, and sugar, but it's delicious.\n  ","397529":"\n  i have it all in my bag, haha. i should definitely make a change jar, though ...\n  ","397530":"\n  perhaps 5-6 people IRL, 3-4 people online, and 3 coworkers.\n  ","397531":"\n  no, why would it be bad?\n  ","397532":"\n  i can't drink cranberry juice straight, but i do like vodka sodas with a splash of cranberry juice.\n  ","397533":"\n  i'm friends with two of my exes, so yeah.\n  ","397534":"\n  i have family in florida, and extended family in italy. i'm not close to any of them though, so i'm not sure how it's been affecting them.\n  ","397535":"\n  i'm just worried about some friends and other people i know who have compromised immune systems and are therefore more vulnerable to be severely ill if they come into contact with someone who's carrying the virus.\n  \n  i mean, i'm getting to work from home now, which is pretty interesting. and it's also the right call because i work in an office building with hundreds of other people, guaranteed at least one person was carrying the virus.\n  ","397536":"\n  no, the coronavirus is a global pandemic unlike anything we've seen before. it's why the news media has been focused so much on it and emphasizing social distancing to contain the virus.\n  ","397537":"\n  i didn't even realize it was st. patrick's day until later on in the afternoon, tbh. i didn't do anything special at all.\n  ","397538":"\n  omg ... i just saw them now. that's hilarious and a bit weird. i'm not entirely sure how i feel about them, LOL.\n  ","397539":"\n  i believe one of my biggest challenges has been overcoming self-destructive habits in light of mental illness, particularly my addiction to self-harm which lasted around eight years.\n  \n  i stopped hurting myself at the age of 19, and although i've relapsed here and there, it hasn't been a routine habit since that age which is almost 10 years ago. i'm incredibly proud of myself for overcoming that.\n  ","397540":"\n  i would consider that a little harsh, yes. perhaps you should talk to her about why she's been acting out and doing poorly in school, especially if it's out of character for her. communication with your children is essential.\n  ","397541":"\n  when your life, or a loved one's life, is at stake.\n  ","397542":"\n  i have too many to list, haha.\n  \n  les miserables, the crow, heathers. girl interrupted, sweeney todd, the punisher, american psycho, and the lord of the rings are among my favorites.\n  ","397543":"\n  i'm introverted with extroverted features, i.e. i can't spend time with people for long periods of time and i need solitude in order to recharge. however, i also feel at home with small gatherings of my closest friends.\n  ","397544":"\n  whenever i use the bathroom, as well as occasionally throughout the day (like after eating and whatnot).\n  ","397545":"\n  depends on the subject matter, but sure.\n  ","397546":"\n  i am neither a baby nor a girl.

worrying about germs, i can work in my pajamas, i don't have to walk very far to get another cup of coffee, and i don't have to commute for 45 minutes there & back. i rolled out of bed at 8:30am

seasonal clothing and food\/drinks.\n  ","397562":"\n  sex isn't a \"need,\" it's a want. if someone wants sex so much that they're willing to betray their partner to solely have sex, then they should either communicate with their partner and come to a compromise or break up completely.\n  ","397563":"\n  probably sleeping or reading a book, because i wouldn't be able to work from home.\n

time will tell !! working from home has been great so far. :'))\n  ","397569":"\n  i wouldn't care. i only go on social media websites anyway.\n  ","397570":"\n  no, quite the opposite. i believe that

others.\n  ","397571":"\n  i commuted to the office every day, and starting today, i'll be working from home for the next 30 days.\n  \n  public and private schools are closed for the next two weeks

recovery rate for the coronavirus. it's obviously a severe pandemic that should be taken seriously, but once every massive country begins to implement quarantine rules, it should realistically get better.\n  ","397579":"\n  no, i'm in isolation at the moment. i'm working from home for the next 30 days.\n  ","397580":"\n  it's a lethal virus that has killed thousands of people ... what sort of

getting worse by the day in every country. :\/\n  ","397583":"\n  no, that sounds like a recipe for disaster. there's really nothing good that can come out of dating a co-worker, especially if it's in an environment where it's not exactly ethical to date your co-worker (like, a lot of establishments forbid people from management dating their employees, etc etc).\n  ","397584":"\n  i think it's a bit strange, but there's also a difference between actually fighting and then having disagreements. you can have a healthy relationship and have disagreements without fighting over them.\n  ","397585":"\n  i'm not personally interested in a long distance relationship, so no. if i'm in a relationship, then i would want someone who's near me where i can see them on a routine basis.\n  ","397586":"\n  yes, i believe in ghosts and spirits. honestly, i think the house i'm living in is a bit haunted, LOL.\n  ","397587":"\n  i think that's a rather popular opinion, actually. i do agree that people in general pay too much attention to other people's business. you should realistically be only focused on yourself and your loved ones, your own progress, your own happiness, etc etc.\n  \n  it's healthy to give some attention to others, especially if you're giving other people a platform to raise their voice when they don't have much of a platform themselves, but if you're so invested in other people's business that it negatively harms you or others, then that's no good.\n  ","397588":"\n  i'll be lucky if i'm alive in 10 years, considering i can't even envision my life

don't think about anything except the task at hand and things i need to do subsequent to that task in terms of work-related things.\n  \n  i'm grateful to have a job where i feel productive every day because it helps with my mental health a lot. i don't dwell on things that i would normally dwell on if i had nothing to do because my mind is focused 100% on my work.\n  ","397596":"\n  all the time,

thigh.\n  ","397627":"\n  i have seven tattoos.\n  ","397628":"\n  it's ultimately your decision. but i believe it's important to have communication with your partner, so if you want to stop taking birth control then that's something you need to give a heads up to your partner about.\n  ","397629":"\n  depends on how close i am to that person. i haven't slept over someone else's house (besides

biden.\n  ","397632":"\n  i wouldn't really consider it a \"favorite\" or anything because that has a positive connotation, but the one i most often use is telling people that i'm fine or that i feel okay. i don't like people to unnecessarily worry about me if i'm not doing well.\n  ","397633":"\n  no one was allowed on their cell phones, regardless of management status.\n  ","397634":"\n  yeah, if it was bad enough you could get written up.\n  ","397635":"\n  very much so, yes. lately i've been experiencing ... not really flashbacks because they don't encompass my entire being, but i do get sudden flashes back into the past that shake me up sometimes.\n  ","397636":"\n  i think it can be seen as careless, yes. when i worked in retail, we were told not to be on our phones while working (which is a general rule for almost all workplaces anyway). from a customer's perspective, it appears as if the employee doesn't care or they're too preoccupied to put 100% into their work.\n  ","397637":"\n  uh ... no? lmao. i have zero children.\n  ","397638":"\n  i'm not a parent, so this does not apply to me.\n  ","397639":"\n  depends on the parent, obviously. every parent, regardless of their gender, will have different methods of discipline and parenting.\n  ","397640":"\n  i don't even know how to make my hair into a bun, lmaoo. having long hair is very new to me.\n

-- they're having people over for dinner tonight and i was supposed to be there, but i don't feel well enough to go over the house. i'm not worried i have the virus or anything, but i think i definitely need to relax and calm down because it's been a very emotionally distraught weekend.\n  ","397645":"\n  yeah, that's hella rude. you don't sound cocky or arrogant at all tbh, it's your own hair and you have the freedom to do whatever you want with it as you please. if it makes you happy and content, nobody else's opinion matters. and it's asinine that your friends would even go out of their way to tell you it's ugly.\n  ","397646":"\n  depends on what you're buying and where you're going. you can get some healthy food from the grocery store for cheap, but then you have to cook the food yourself, etc etc. fast food is a faster, alternative option for people who don't have the time to cook.\n  ","397647":"\n  oh yes, i do know this song. i believe it was one of the songs played on the store radio when i worked in retail, lmaoo.\n  ","397648":"\n  from my experience, yes. lmaoo.\n  \n  in the past when i was 18-22 years old, my hangovers would be perhaps one or two hours

only ever been *that* hungover a few times, haha. whenever i get a hangover these days, it's normally just a massive headache with some bit of nausea, nothing wild. even though i'm not hungry, i know the food will absorb the alcohol\/acids in my stomach and that's why i try to eat before going back to sleep.\n  ","397652":"\n  no, i've never heard of that concept before. i think it would only increase hysteria, though.\n  ","397653":"\n  i always tell people my foolproof cure for hangovers ;\n  \n  -- wake up early, take two ibuprofen tablets with a giant jug of water.\n  \n  -- eat a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich (i prefer fried eggs with american cheese on a croissant).\n  \n  -- go back to sleep (don't set an alarm).\n  \n  -- wake up, and you feel back to normal !!\n  ","397654":"\n  happy sunday ~~\n  \n  i honestly feel like sh*t today, i don't know why. i woke up after sleeping for like 10-11 hours straight, and now i feel really light-headed and foggy.\n  ","397655":"\n  i usually either sleep or play video games, haha.\n  ","397656":"\n  i got denied a job from a social media marketing company when i was fresh out of college. i didn't bring my resume to the interview because they told me they had it on file (and yes, now i obviously know to be prepared). when i walked in, the manager asked for my resume, and when i told him that i didn't bring it because i had e-mailed it to him, he politely escorted me out.\n  \n  i was extremely upset, but honestly i wouldn't have wanted to work for a company that stuck up anyway.\n  ","397657":"\n  no, i don't. it also depends on the individual -- you can't group everyone based on sex or gender into one category and make a blanket statement about them.\n  ","397658":"\n  no, i have a lot of empathy toward service workers, especially in retail and food establishments. they're such high pressure jobs.\n  ","397659":"\n  i haven't been to the grocery store since last week, and it was mostly paper goods and soap products that were out of stock. i'm sure it's much worse now than it was last week, though.\n  ","397660":"\n  yeah, usually just ceasar salads though.\n  ","397661":"\n  yeah, i'll get them on my pizza.\n  ","397662":"\n  cheddar cheese, spinach, and bell peppers.\n  ","397663":"\n  i'll eat hard boiled eggs, yeah.\n  ","397664":"\n  no, i quit smoking cigarettes last september.\n  ","397665":"\n  haha, i think it's a bit of an older phrase so a lot of young people probably don't recognize it.\n  ","397666":"\n  ???\n  \n  i've been active for several years, lol.\n

!! :'))\n  ","397673":"\n  if it was offered to me, then i would drink it. but normally my water of choice (if i have to buy water) is smartwater.\n  ","397674":"\n  no, i don't generally use slang.\n

that's definitely not the case, haha. i *am* a bit jealous, and it does hurt when i see them doing cute things together, but ultimately i want him to be happy. if that's with someone else right now, then so be it.\n  ","397678":"\n  i've always been comfortable spending time with him regardless of the intimacy involved. i don't really know right now if we're better off as friends as opposed to partners, it's something i've been navigating on a day-by-day basis. but our chemistry hasn't changed, we still have fun together and have great conversations.\n  ","397679":"\n  a large contributing factor was the *lack* of conflict -- like i keep indicating, we were stagnant and there was no intimacy there (not talking s*xually). we acted more like friends than partners towards the end, if that makes sense.\n  \n  people fall out of love -- it's something that happens, and the only thing i can do is accept it.\n  ","397680":"\n  we were together for 9-10 years. his girlfriend is nice and we relate on a lot of issues (she also struggles with mental health problems), but she's also very in-your-face. from my understanding, my ex's family doesn't like her very much.\n  ","397681":"\n  whoops, i meant to type neurotypical -- not typical.\n  \n  regardless, i was referring to mental illness (specifically BPD). he's been my favorite person for quite a long time, so it would be devastating if he wasn't in my life at all.\n  ","397682":"\n  we've been broken up for quite a while.\n  ","397683":"\n  thank you, i appreciate it. :'))\n  ","397684":"\n  she doesn't know that i still love him, haha. at least to my knowledge. regardless, she's obviously fine with our friendship, and if she wasn't okay with our friendship, then there would be major issues in their relationship.\n  ","397685":"\n  i can cope with him dating. just because i have bad nights doesn't mean i'm not coping well (tbh, i'm coping a lot better than i thought i would have). we talk less often now than we did in the past, so there is some disconnection there, but i wouldn't be able to handle him not being in my life at all.\n  \n  other people have suggested the same idea, and that may work with a typical person, but it wouldn't work for me.\n  ","397686":"\n  it's been fine so far. i got drunk last night on 9% abv beer, and today i made a nice breakfast, did laundry, and visited my parents briefly.\n  \n  tomorrow, i have to go back to my parents' house for an early dinner with some other relatives, which i'm not really looking forward to tbh.\n  ","397687":"\n  no, i don't believe i can do that. i wouldn't be able to cope not having him in my life at all.\n  ","397688":"\n  gender is different from feeling masculine and feminine. you can be masculine and be non-binary, and you can be feminine and be non-binary (or whatever combination of the two, it's a sliding scale).\n  ","397689":"\n  what do you mean by \"still\"? my gender hasn't changed, nor will it change in the future because it's simply who i am.\n  ","397690":"\n  no, i don't believe he was ever using me. he has always been up front and honest about his feelings, it's not as if he was trying to hide anything from me.\n  ","397691":"\n  yes, i quit smoking cigarettes last september.\n  ","397692":"\n  this song is so freakin' good.\n  \n\n

one of the things that deters me the most from being the best version of myself.\n  ","397696":"\n  my gender is non-binary. it's important to me because it gives me a small insight into my identity.\n  ","397697":"\n  i don't really feel comfortable elaborating significantly on it, but the relationship just sorta dissipated towards the end. he didn't feel strongly towards me anymore, and everything was stagnant for a long while. i gave off the impression that everything between us was fine, and although there was no conflict between us, there was a lack of intimacy that we used to have in previous years.\n  \n  i'm surviving, but i'd be lying if i said i was fine. i've had multiple meltdowns since the breakup, and i still have really bad nights. i have no interest in seeing anyone else, even on a casual basis, and i still very much feel strongly towards him. we're friends still, and we talk very often (maybe 5-6 days out of the week).\n  ","397698":"\n  i'm going to be honest with you -- i have zero clue about anything going on with israel or palestine right now. i know it's a hot topic of debate, but i've never looked into it.\n  ","397699":"\n  i'm voting for bernie sanders. i've voted in elections (although not really local ones) ever since i turned 18 years old.\n  ","397700":"\n  i like fried potato skins with cheddar cheese & bacon on top of them.\n  ","397701":"\n  courtney wasn't ever my best friend, lol. she's one of my closest internet friends, though.\n  ","397702":"\n  i honestly don't know anything about that person or that band, lol.\n  ","397703":"\n  my best friend and i met in middle school. we sat at the same lunch table, and everyone was talking about music. eventually, we came to realize that we were both interested in linkin park, and we talked endlessly about the band. we became best friends shortly thereafter.\n  ","397704":"\n  aw, lol. yeah, i've had serious talks with a coworker of mine who was going through some serious sh*t a while ago and she got emotional over what i told her, but it also made her feel better.\n  ","397705":"\n  stay-at-home writer, particularly a novelist (if i ever get the motivation to start working on writing a book, lol).\n  ","397706":"\n  i believe testing *and treatment* should be more available than it currently is so more people are aware of where the virus is escalating and people can take more accurate precautions.\n  ","397707":"\n  no, not usually. i've had a few different usernames on things over the years and they were all relatively easy to come up with.\n  ","397708":"\n  i'm not going to buy things in bulk. there's no reason for me to do so, i have enough toilet paper already to last me a few weeks and the only thing my house may need in the near future is more paper towels (which my roommate can get through his job). we have enough food since we did grocery shopping recently, and we already have a lot of hand soap.\n  \n  buying things unnecessarily in bulk when you're otherwise healthy leaves less supplies for people who actually need them.\n  ","397709":"\n  no, i'm considered healthy and i'm also quite young, so i'm not susceptible to falling ill personally from the coronavirus.\n  \n  however, many of my friends and family members *are* immunocompromised, so if i were to contract the virus, i wouldn't be able to visit or be around them for their own safety.\n  ","397710":"\n  everything that i've stated about the coronavirus over the past few days indicates quite the opposite, but all right.\n  ","397711":"\n  they're not sayings or anything, i just talk to my friends about whatever it is they're going through and i offer advice when they need it. otherwise, i just show my support of them, tell them why i value their friendship, and encourage them to continue being themselves and work toward their goals because they're beautiful people and deserve the world.\n  ","397712":"\n  i support the legalization and taxation of marijuana. it isn't much different from people being able to purchase alcohol, except alcohol is much more unhealthy for you than marijuana is (and marijuana also helps with a lot of medical conditions too).\n  ","397713":"\n  yeah, pablo neruda is my favorite poet and i find poetry in itself to be quite moving. i've written a lot of poetry throughout my life.\n  ","397714":"\n  i don't have the opportunity to do it often in terms of physical gifts and whatnot, so lately it's been things like sending encouraging messages and memes to my friends, as well as positive affirmations when they're feeling down.\n  ","397715":"\n  yeah, i believe it's a bit selfish and also ignorant to not take it seriously at this point. it's considered a global pandemic, people are dying at alarming rates, and even if you're a healthy individual you could still carry the virus and pass it on to someone else who is more susceptible to falling severely ill from it.\n  ","397716":"\n  aw, this is so sweet. thank you so much !!\n  ","397717":"\n  listening to the les miserables soundtrack again this week, after not listening to it for over a year. i forgot how genuinely beautiful and heart-wrenching it is.\n  ","397718":"\n  that's not weird at all !! i love seeing genuine reactions like that from my friends after doing something nice for them.\n  ","397719":"\n  yes, i actually saw him on tuesday night.\n  ","397720":"\n  thanks for the follow ~~\n  ","397721":"\n  sometimes, but other times i think i'm rather selfish. i'm trying to break out of that cycle of self-degradation, though. being called selfish has been instilled in me from a young age so i've been conditioned to think that about myself, and it's something i've been working on for years.\n  ","397722":"\n  no, s*x isn't terribly important to me. but i do need to see my partner on a regular basis, spend quality time with them, etc etc.\n  ","397723":"\n  long distance doesn't necessarily mean it only has to be with someone from another country, it could simply mean it's with someone with whom you don't see for months because of how far away they live from you.\n  \n  regardless, i wouldn't be in a long distance relationship. i need someone with whom i can speak face-to-face and see regularly.\n  ","397724":"\n  besides the united states, i visited the bahamas last month.\n  ","397725":"\n  i haven't written it yet, so i don't know. haha.\n  ","397726":"\n  yes, he's been dating someone.\n  ","397727":"\n  eventually make enough money to live on my own, progress further in my career, progress further in my mental health recovery, write a book, travel more often, etc etc.\n  ","397728":"\n  i believe it can do both. instant communication such as phone calls and texts and social media can bring people together on a large scale, especially from different countries, and there are more opportunities for education and growth.\n  \n  at the same time, however, i think it can make people distance themselves from close friends and family, especially if someone is sensitive and doesn't receive a text\/call\/response right away, they make think that they're not as close to their loved one as they previously thought (even when that's not the case at all).\n  ","397729":"\n  i would much prefer to lose all of the memories i have now, especially considering a lot of them are terrible memories. there are great memories in between, but by not being able to make new memories, you won't be able to progress forward in life.\n  ","397730":"\n  probably such holy texts as the bible, quran, and torah (among others).\n  ","397731":"\n  either my best friend or my roommate. both are extremely selfless people, to the point where they sometimes compromise their own happiness for the sake of other people's happiness. which isn't really the healthiest thing to do because i do believe boundaries need to be set in order to protect yourself while still caring for others, but regardless, they're very selfless.\n  ","397732":"\n  i have long term goals, but i'm comfortable with where i am currently.\n  ","397733":"\n  well yeah, it occurred within the first two years of us dating. i'm still in love with my ex in the present day.\n  ","397734":"\n  probably not as much as i previously knew when i was actually taking courses in mass communications, media, journalism, business writing, etc etc.\n  ","397735":"\n  my current job is with a publishing company, where i'm a writer and editor.\n  ","397736":"\n  because ... i'm not? i have no desire to be with another person right now.\n  ","397737":"\n  unless you have an actual question, you can leave my inbox.\n  ","397738":"\n  hello -- do you have a question?\n  ","397739":"\n  no, quite a few of my friends have differing opinions about things from me.\n  ","397740":"\n  just because someone is thinking about appealing doesn't mean they're not guilty. he's just trying to receive a lesser sentence.\n  ","397741":"\n  there has been talk about his possibly appealing the conviction, yes.\n  ","397742":"\n  i don't appreciate your victim-blaming here, so unless you have something productive to say, i'm just going to delete further inquiries from you.\n  ","397743":"\n  i said victims\/survivors, who can be someone of any gender. women aren't the only people who are ab*sed, and there's actually a lot of stigma against men who are ab*sed because they're not taken as seriously.\n  ","397744":"\n  i don't have a type, and i'm not interested in dating.\n  ","397745":"\n  a large majority of people do not fabricate accusations, especially when it comes to how many people came forward. accusing anyone of a crime could damage the accuser greatly, including their reputation if they're a public figure, and it brings up a lot of negative and traumatic emotions when discussing it publicly.\n  \n  there's no reason not to believe that weinstein is guilty. i believe victims\/survivors above all else.\n  ","397746":"\n  i used to like pokemon when i was much younger. i collected the cards and played the video games on my game boy.\n  ","397747":"\n  not closely, no. i only know much about it based on certain articles i've read after the fact.\n  ","397748":"\n  i hope you're not suggesting that weinstein was falsely accused.\n  ","397749":"\n  \"it brings a lot of closure to victims\/survivors when their ab*sers are convicted of crimes.\"\n  ","397750":"\n  i think seeing people's passions and love for what they do or who they're around is beautiful. when you see someone's eyes light up when they're talking about something they're passionate about, that's beautiful in my view.\n  ","397751":"\n  beauty in music, beauty in the arts, beauty in the natural environment, beauty in community, etc etc.\n  ","397752":"\n  eh, yes and no. my emotions make me an empathetic person and i can see the beauty in a lot of different things. however, my mood swings associated with my emotions can be hazardous.\n  ","397753":"\n  i agree. i never said it was a bad thing.\n  ","397754":"\n  accusations aren't as fulfilling as convictions, because you can accuse someone of a crime and have your voice ultimately unheard of the person is not convicted of that crime. it brings a lot of closure to victims\/survivors when their ab*sers are convicted of crimes.\n  ","397755":"\n  because he s*xually assaulted multiple people, and he could have received a life sentence had the jury found him guilty of predatory s*xual assault.\n  ","397756":"\n  i don't even remember at this point. i graduated seven years ago.\n  ","397757":"\n  he's doing well for himself, and i'm happy for him.\n  ","397758":"\n  i started out as a creative writing major, but after i transferred schools, i changed my major to communications with a focus in english literature.\n  ","397759":"\n  i did, yeah. it took me another semester extra to complete my courses because a lot of my courses didn't transfer over, though.\n  ","397760":"\n  i don't really have any regrets at this moment. i think it's useless to think back on regrets you may have, especially if there's nothing you can do to change them. it leads up unnecessary guilt and anger and sadness.\n  ","397761":"\n  probably crying to certain songs that aren't even meant to be sad songs, lmaoo. i'm an extremely emotional person and nearly anything can make me cry if it moves me enough.\n  ","397762":"\n  i believe the biggest risk i've taken has been traveling back home from my first year away at college in order to be supportive of my ex and his family during a tragedy. i didn't really have a back-up plan in mind, i just knew it was something i needed to do at that time. i didn't enroll back in college until a few months later, and i also didn't even have a job or a car at the time.\n  ","397763":"\n  somewhat, yes. i believe that in certain circumstances, your love for a person can blind you to their toxicity if they exhibit toxic traits, and you may find yourself justifying their behavior even if it's harmful out of your pure love for that person. a lot of people don't even realize that it was harmful until after they've broken up or distanced themselves from their partner.\n  ","397764":"\n  any time i went on a vacation with my ex is a cheerful memory, particularly when it was just the two of us and we were able to disconnect from technology and social media for a few days and spend time enjoying each other's company.\n  ","397765":"\n  i wouldn't call myself vengeful, but i've also never been in a situation where i've felt the need to seek revenge.\n  ","397766":"\n  no, i believe that their decision to be under lockdown is completely justified. it's honestly the only way to contain such a widespread pandemic like this, and hospitals are already at maximum capacity.\n  ","397767":"\n  i'm glad he was sentenced to 23 years in prison, but i also feel like it should have been a much longer sentence.\n  ","397768":"\n  i'm iffy on this situation, because while he shouldn't have pursued someone so young when he was that age, it's hard to call someone a p*do when it happened over 40 years ago and was an isolated incident. even though she wasn't technically an adult yet, there are some places where the age of consent is 17, and at the time, it was probably younger than that.\n  \n  i wouldn't say it *isn't* a big deal, but i also don't know if it would be accurate to consider him a p*do at this time. it was extremely common for these types of things to occur in that day, and people were not as cognizant of predators as they are now.\n  ","397769":"\n  i try not to think about the future because it causes major anxiety within me. my old therapist previously taught me how to be mindful of the present moment, which i think is important in regulating your emotions and setting priorities in order.\n  ","397770":"\n  i don't believe there's any silver lining to the coronavirus. people are passing away across the globe, italy is under complete lockdown, and i guarantee that flights coming in and out of the united states are going to be barred soon.\n  ","397771":"\n  i don't believe i've ever completely broken an expensive item before. i cracked the screen of my ipad once a very long time ago, but it still worked afterwards.\n  ","397772":"\n  i love fish as pets, and they're extremely interesting and complex to maintain depending on the sort of fish they are (and depending on whether they're salt water or fresh water fish). i've had a few fish in the past, and even with watching my ex's fish tanks, you can see their different personalities.\n  ","397773":"\n  greed, particularly when it comes to money.\n  ","397774":"\n  linkin park was the first band to come to mind because their music changed genres a lot throughout the course of their career. starting out as nu-metal, and then they progressed to an alternative rock feel, to sorta like a hybrid pop-rock feel.\n  \n  i love all of their music, but i do admit i stopped listening partially after minutes to midnight (which is one of my favorite albums). but since chester bennington passed away, i've been listening to them more and more often.\n  ","397775":"\n  robbery or m*rder, haha.\n  ","397776":"\n  it's difficult to compare the feelings of a father to a mother when it comes to miscarriages. obviously it may affect the father's feelings too, but the reason why most of the focus is on the mother is because they're the ones carrying the fetus, and they probably already developed an intimate connection with them. it can also be a very traumatic experience for the mother.\n  ","397777":"\n  i believe that the coronavirus is a huge threat to everyone's safety, particularly those in vulnerable communities. just because you're healthy and young and will survive easily doesn't mean that you cannot carry the virus to those who *are* immunocompromised, and that's a huge issue.\n  \n  it makes sense for schools to be operating remotely, closing campuses, and for large office buildings to close and events to be canceled. we want to isolate the virus and reduce the number of those infected, especially considering hospitals can only hold so many people.\n  \n  i believe the hoarding of goods is extremely bad, though. people who are otherwise healthy are buying out supermarkets of all of their paper goods, hygiene products, etc etc., leaving those who actually need them to be in poor shape because they didn't get a chance to buy them.\n  ","397778":"\n  yellow, perhaps? it's my least favorite color, but i would be hesitant to remove *any* color from the world because of all of the natural environments that boast those colors. yellow roses, for example, are my favorite type of roses.\n  ","397779":"\n  \"you've gotta be kidding me.\"\n  \n  or,\n  \n  \"what the f*ck. are you serious?\"\n  ","397780":"\n  no? it's classified as a pandemic and countries are shutting their borders to keep the virus isolated. everybody's safety is at the forefront of everyone's minds.\n

the only thing you can really do in this time is go through with your words and promises and support them. re-establishing trust in someone is very difficult and you need to respect that.\n  ","397785":"\n  i don't know if they have grounds to sue them, but either way, i want to keep my job so i'm not going to say anything unless it's absolutely necessary. who knows if they'll turn their back on me too.\n  ","397786":"\n  ???\n  \n  if you don't have a question, then there's nothing for me to respond to.\n  ","397787":"\n  upper management apparently said that if finances are better by june, they can \"come back.\" but honestly, they gave my coworkers zero warning with no respect for their personal lives. they told them today right before the end of the day, and they cannot come back. i'm talking to one of my coworkers about it all now, and she said \"it left a really bad taste in my mouth, and i probably won't come back knowing that the company has no regard for my personal feelings or life.\"\n  ","397788":"\n  honestly, i believe so (although i haven't heard any confirmation of it). people are buying less of our programs because they're prioritizing other needs, which is why our sales are dropping.\n  ","397789":"\n  i thought i did, but things didn't work out in my favor. only time will tell.\n  ","397790":"\n  i don't know the full story, but from what i've gathered so far, we've plummeted in sales which has caused the company to make budget cuts, so they had to let people go because they couldn't afford to pay their salaries.\n  \n  but i mean ... 10 people? how can you let go an entire third of a department with no resources available for us who remain? i'm not concerned that i'll be let go, otherwise i would have been in that initial meeting. but i'm so angry and upset for everyone who was, including a coworker who was essentially my right-hand man.\n  ","397791":"\n  see above.\n  ","397792":"\n  i explained it in more detail in an earlier answer from a few minutes ago. this afternoon, 30 minutes before we leave for the day, 10 people from my department got laid off. people who were genuinely good at their job. that equals out to perhaps 1\/3 of my entire department who are now gone.\n  \n  i'm angry. i'm upset. i'm frustrated. they didn't deserve to be let go, and this entire company is going to fall to shambles without adequate staffing.\n  ","397793":"\n  no, i do not believe in horoscopes.\n  ","397794":"\n  i think holding online classes is a good alternative so that students and faculty aren't being kept closely together on campus, which will only make outbreaks worse. there are dozens of campuses which are closing and offering distance learning opportunities for students.\n  ","397795":"\n  a lot of alcohol, at this rate. i'm so f*ckin' upset and angry at the moment.\n  ","397796":"\n  i heard that he called a national state of emergency, but i don't know what else he said about it. i've been at work all day.\n  ","397797":"\n  standard true crime shows and documentaries, such as forensic files, women behind bars, deadly women, i am a killer, etc etc. forensic files is a big one for me because there are like hundreds of episodes, haha.\n  ","397798":"\n  lately i've been listening to music and playing video games more than anything else.\n  ","397799":"\n  i'm extremely upset, frustrated, angry, and in disbelief right now. my job laid off 10 people in my department alone this afternoon, and it was totally unexpected. we're losing some really good people and upper management made a huge mistake.\n  ","397800":"\n  yes, i'll be at work unless they instruct us to work remotely from home.\n  ","397801":"\n  i'm not excited exactly, but i am happy to be off from work for the next two days. i'm planning on doing absolutely nothing.\n  ","397802":"\n  yes, my boyfriend (well, now ex) and i broke up.\n  ","397803":"\n  yes !! i just found the disc and popped it into my xbox one,

","397805":"\n  i'm all right. i'm currently drinking a beer and watching netflix.\n  ","397806":"\n  i haven't considered the thought of popularity since i was in high school. in those days, i was known but i wasn't popular.\n  ","397807":"\n  linkin park is one of my all-time favorite bands, as you know (lol). i would choose them in a heartbeat.\n  ","397808":"\n  i'm fine with any question, as long as it isn't harassment, sexual questions, trolling, etc etc.\n  ","397809":"\n  no, i prefer jeans and leggings.\n  ","397810":"\n  seeing an email from upper management today, where they basically stated that if you're uncomfortable going to work due to the coronavirus then you can use your vacation time\/PTO to cover the days.\n  \n  which i think is ridiculous, tbh. we're in an office building with hundreds of people, the risk of people getting the coronavirus is ridiculously high, especially considering the amount of cases on long island right now.\n  ","397811":"\n  communication. you have to be open and communicating your needs with your partner in order for things to work. there should be mutual understanding between the both of you as you're working towards the same goals.\n  ","397812":"\n  i have a personality disorder, so this is difficult to answer. lmaoo.\n  ","397813":"\n  probably the terrorist attacks on 9\/11.\n  ","397814":"\n  no, i can't even keep cacti alive. lmaoo.\n  ","397815":"\n  listening to music late at night while drinking a beer and just enjoying the moment.\n  ","397816":"\n  no, but they unsettle me slightly. i've only ever been to the hospital for bad reasons.\n  ","397817":"\n  no, large gatherings make me extremely anxious and i prefer closer one-on-one settings, or settings with at maximum 4-5 people.\n  ","397818":"\n  yes, i would be a hell of a lot happier if i won the lottery. i would be financially stable, out of debt, and able to afford the primary things i need to thrive.\n  ","397819":"\n  i don't have an all-time favorite song, no. my taste in music varies wildly and my favorite music all depends on what sort of mood i'm in.\n  \n  one of my favorite musicians is coming out with his album around midnight, though, and i'm debating on staying up late just so i can listen to it, lmaoo.\n  ","397820":"\n  i promise on bea smith that it will never happen again.\n  ","397821":"\n  there's a particular pizza place that's closer to my parents' house that i used to order from sometimes, and their pizza was always the best. i haven't had their food since i moved out.\n  \n  new york pizza is always good though, so you're getting good pies regardless of where you go (unless you're going to somewhere like domino's).\n  ","397822":"\n  a few months ago.\n  ","397823":"\n  obviously i believe cheating is terrible, because you're going against your partner's trust and loyalty to you in order to satisfy whatever urge you're feeling, whether it's sexual or emotional. if you're thinking about cheating on your partner, then that's a conversation you need to have with your partner themselves because it's an indication that the relationship isn't as great as it seems.\n  \n  when it comes to people taking them back even though they cheated, i think it can only be judged on a case by case basis, and it's also important to note that we're not really in any position to judge other people or their decisions. some people could be in ab*sive relationships and they're acting out of fear.\n  ","397824":"\n  skin-picking (dermatillomania). it's wrecked havoc on my life for years upon years, and i'm littered with scabs and scars all over my body.\n  ","397825":"\n  there are many men who are skinnier than me, and guaranteed there are also men who are weaker than me (even though i'm weak af, lol). people shouldn't be categorized in stereotypes.\n  ","397826":"\n  i love making bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches in the morning, even though they're hella unhealthy, haha. bonus points if it's on a croissant.\n  ","397827":"\n  writing, playing video games, reading, watching netflix or hulu, painting and drawing, and photography.\n  ","397828":"\n  i haven't been to therapy in months unfortunately, but my medication has been my primary form of management for at least three years now. i also try to fall back on healthy coping mechanisms, i.e. listening to music, playing video games, and venting to friends.\n  ","397829":"\n  you're going to need to give me more context because this could mean a plethora of different things.\n  ","397830":"\n  i like questions pertaining to mental health, music, video games, writing, literature, my own hobbies and education and career, controversial opinions, etc etc.\n  ","397831":"\n  lately because of the VIP program, i've been receiving a lot of random questions from users that can apply to a general audience. which is nice for a change, instead of logging in and seeing a bunch of anonymous nonsense (lol).\n  ","397832":"\n  i would say that i'm talented in writing, but there's also always room for improvement.\n  ","397833":"\n  i'm currently just enjoying being in the house alone, listening to calming music, smelling the scent of the candle burning, and browsing the internet.\n  ","397834":"\n  that sounds awfully selfish, tbh. if you're having trouble in the bedroom with your partner and\/or you're not sexually compatible, then that doesn't justify cheating on your partner.\n  ","397835":"\n  i just delete their messages or questions. there's no use in entertaining a troll, they feed into it and your commitment to responding to them, and it isn't worth the energy or time.\n  ","397836":"\n  all of the sex-based questions are always aggravating, especially considering i've made it clear time & time again that i don't answer questions of that nature.\n  ","397837":"\n  well school distracts and colleges are closing -- that doesn't mean there won't be online classes and remote learning, though.\n  ","397838":"\n  they probably don't actually love you as much as they insist that they do if they're willing to put your trust and emotions on the line.\n  ","397839":"\n  i'm assuming it's when numbers begin to decline after enough quarantine periods.\n  ","397840":"\n  not necessarily, no. having a mental illness and lashing out at undeserving people are two different things. the person lashing out is certainly inconsiderate and brash, but that doesn't mean they're mentally ill.\n  ","397841":"\n  i would say that's more privileged than shallow. you can always postpone your trip.\n  ","397842":"\n  i believe that's a stereotype and that a person can be a cheater regardless of their gender, it has more to do with their personality and insecurities than anything else.\n  ","397843":"\n  october or november. i don't prepare for christmas very much ahead of time, and these past few years haven't been big christmases anyway.\n  ","397844":"\n  it already has. the stock market has plummeted in the united states alone, and there are other countries who have it much worse than the united states does at the moment (especially china and italy).\n  ","397845":"\n  no, i believe it's an intelligent thing to do. school districts and colleges are closing on long island where i live, and i think it's smart to try to contain the virus instead of having carriers of the virus spreading their germs in such small public spaces.\n  ","397846":"\n  obesity and being unhealthy aren't *directly* correlated to some degree, and i'm with the understanding that everyone's body chemistry is different so we cannot collectively take a stand without understanding the nuances of obesity.\n  \n  being overweight and obese is a concern because it does lead to further complications, especially musculoskeletal and heart problems. but just because a person is overweight doesn't necessarily mean that they're unhealthy -- they could have absolutely normal blood charts, have a good diet, etc etc.\n  \n  i understand the \"love your body\" rhetoric, but i also understand your perspective that it can also be harmful in particular circumstances as it may encourage people to engage in unhealthy behavior.\n  ","397847":"\n  yes, i touched upon this perhaps 20 minutes ago or so in a previous answer. the media likes to report the bad news, not necessarily the good news, so there's over-reporting on all of the severe illnesses and deaths associated with the coronavirus as opposed to the thousands of people who have recovered.\n  \n  on the one hand, i'm concerned since this is officially deemed a pandemic now, and it's almost impossible to contain it unless everyone is quarantined. people with compromised immune systems are susceptible especially, which is concerning in itself because a healthy person could carry the virus without knowing and pass it on to someone who cannot handle the virus.\n  \n  but overall, the mass panic and hysteria is ridiculous among consumers. buying cartfuls of toilet paper and hygiene products, etc etc. this is harmful because it's leaving less product for those who actually *do* need them.\n  ","397848":"\n  because i am not in a relationship, and the object of my affection does not return the feelings.\n  ","397849":"\n  LOL. I'M SORRY, I TOTALLY FORGOT.\n  ","397850":"\n  i prefer clothing that is too big. i'm self conscious about my figure and my weight, so i usually buy shirts on the larger side to begin with.\n  ","397851":"\n  i like both classical and jazz music.\n  ","397852":"\n  ah, that's awesome !! i don't use reddit, so i wouldn't have known, plus i was at work at the time most likely.\n  ","397853":"\n  i agree that the reason askfm is implementing these sorts of changes is because they want to liven up the site. activity did decrease for a while, so they introduced incentives to keep people active.\n  \n  i don't really think it's pointless because it *is* making people ask more questions, but i do think it's ridiculous that they're offering the option to use real money to buy coins, lol.\n  ","397854":"\n  i've never had braces, so i wouldn't know from personal experience. however, that sounds normal because they're essentially a \"foreign\" object in your mouth and it'll take some time to get used to the feeling.\n  ","397855":"\n  bob's burgers and king of the hill.\n  ","397856":"\n  it's remained the same overall. although i am getting more questions from reputable users who need to fulfill their VIP requirements, which is nice.\n  ","397857":"\n  i go to the dentist, but i've never had work done before besides usual cleanings.\n  ","397858":"\n  there's a docu-series on netflix called \"i am a killer,\" and it's basically a series of interviews with a murderer as well as their family and friends about what had happened, and most of the people are on death row.\n  \n  i'm always a sucker for anything revolving around death and crime, so it immediately caught my attention.\n  ","397859":"\n  --\n  \n   @shehitsback\n  \n\n  --\n  \n

salads.\n  ","397861":"\n  i splurged on an iced matcha latte with soy milk this evening after work.\n  ","397862":"\n  it depends on my mood. i listen mostly to alternative rock and nu-metal, but i also like indie rock, classical music, hip hop, jazz, the blues, metal, pop, etc etc.\n  ","397863":"\n  i've been noticing less people on the roads as i commute to and from work, probably because some workplaces are closing and school districts are closing in light of the threat of the virus. there are dozens of confirmed cases on long island right now.\n  ","397864":"\n  as much as i want to like black coffee, i cannot drink black coffee because it's usually too bitter for my liking. i like my coffee to taste obviously like coffee, but i also put a little bit of cream and sugar in it as well.\n  ","397865":"\n  i only know of a few bands that could be classified as \"symphonic metal,\" and they're pretty all right. it's not my favorite genre of music, but i can tolerate it.\n  ","397866":"\n  not really, no. i've never seen an opera before, but it doesn't appear to be something i would be interested in.\n  ","397867":"\n  i just answered a similar question a few minutes ago.\n  \n  in short -- no, i'm not afraid of the coronavirus. i'm young and relatively healthy, so i know that it won't personally affect me very much. however, i also realize that everyone should remain vigilant about their personal hygiene and avoiding crowds because a healthy individual could be carrying the virus without knowing, and then subsequently spread it to someone who *is* susceptible to getting severely ill.\n  ","397868":"\n  my favorite video games are skyrim, the fallout series (particularly fallout 3 and 4), destiny and destiny 2, halo: reach, stardew valley, the jackbox party pack, ultimate chicken horse, speedrunners, GTA V, the wolf among us, life is strange, assassin's creed: syndicate, and the bioshock series.\n  ","397869":"\n  a hot cup of coffee or tea in the evening after i get home from work. or if it's a really stressful day, i'll grab a beer from the fridge.\n  ","397870":"\n  i've had near death experiences on quite a few occasions, and it only made me more s*icidal.\n  ","397871":"\n  still very much a 10, to my dismay.\n  ","397872":"\n  i don't generally like celebrating my birthday in a generic sense, but i'll usually get together with a few close friends.\n  ","397873":"\n  hell fuckin' yes. i absolutely love ranch dressing, lmaoo.\n  ","397874":"\n  how i met your mother, parks and recreation, it's always sunny in philadelphia, criminal minds, NCIS, ghost hunters, paranormal lockdown, the x files, bones, castle, you, and forensic files.\n  ","397875":"\n  no, the world wouldn't be better off because the substances would not

black mirror before, but i've heard from others that it's a terrific show.\n  ","397878":"\n  i've never watched the walking dead before, although people have recommended it to me countless times. i read the first few comics and played some of the video games, though.\n  ","397879":"\n  i was born in november, so my birth stone is topaz.\n  ","397880":"\n  i like questions pertaining to my life and my interests, such as video games, art, writing, literature, true crime, mental health, my career and education, etc etc.\n  ","397881":"\n  no, i've never attempted string art before. all of the art i've created in the past was done with acrylic paint, oil paint, watercolors, pastels, colored pencils, charcoal, etc etc.\n  ","397882":"\n  i enjoy white peach sangria (i once made a sangria with peaches, white wine, and raspberries). i'm not much of a fan of sangria made with red wine, though.\n  ","397883":"\n  my sleep schedule isn't very consistent, so it depends on the night. some

bernie sanders over elizabeth warren.\n  ","397925":"\n  that's exactly the reason why i haven't watched that documentary yet, haha. i don't know if i want to put myself through that anguish.\n  \n  the last time something disgusted, yet intrigued me, however was when i watched the documentary \"don't f**k with cats.\" it moved me so emotionally and it was so hard to watch, but i couldn't stop watching it.\n  ","397926":"\n  i don't watch SNL. i used to watch a few skits here and there many, many years ago but i haven't watched it recently.\n  ","397927":"\n  i've never twerked before, so no.\n  ","397928":"\n  i look up to my best friend. she's been through so much hardship during her life, but she's managed to not only survive but thrive in all of her endeavors. she's such an inspirational figure.\n  ","397929":"\n  ???\n  \n  like i stated earlier, your feelings are unhealthy and useless here. there's no point in professing your feelings towards me because nothing is going to happen. you'll be much better off directing your attention elsewhere instead of dwelling on a fantasy.\n  ","397930":"\n  both, depending on how tired i am, haha. most days i brush my teeth twice a day, but other times i only brush them in the morning.\n  ","397931":"\n  \"sit down with you,\" lmaoo. you're an anon who lives hundreds, if not thousands, of miles away from me. your feelings are useless and unhealthy, and you'll find more happiness in pursuing someone who's actually in close proximity to you.\n  ","397932":"\n  thanks, i chose it myself.\n  ","397933":"\n  probably because i'm not a girl -- if you knew anything about me, you would know that i'm non-binary.\n  ","397934":"\n  mental health advocacy, writing, and music.\n  ","397935":"\n  absolutely nothing. there's no logical reason to be interested in me, so you should move on and pursue someone else.\n  ","397936":"\n  i use wikipedia on occasion, yeah. mostly to read up on people i find interesting to learn more about them.\n  ","397937":"\n  yes, she was one of the first artists i was interested in as a pre-teen.\n  ","397938":"\n  i've never done a shout out before, so i really don't know.\n  ","397939":"\n  LOL FOR REAL.\n  ","397940":"\n  right now, it's around 45 degrees fahrenheit and sunny.\n  ","397941":"\n  if you two aren't connecting emotionally anymore, then you should discuss with her the idea of breaking up regardless of how attractive she is. physical appearances only go so far, and a relationship cannot be based on physical attraction alone.\n  ","397942":"\n  i would rather live in a country that was cold all the time. i can't stand the heat tbh, i'm really sensitive to hot weather and i always prefer to layer up in the cold anyway.\n  ","397943":"\n  i like both long and short hair on myself, since i've had everything from a pixie cut to the length it is now.\n  ","397944":"\n  this is perhaps the weirdest thing i've ever seen in my inbox, lmaoo.\n  \n  besides, if i were to invite\n  \n   @IsoleLemuria\n  \n  over, it wouldn't be in a party setting because she doesn't drink alcohol. i would rather have her over to just chat, have a cup of coffee or tea, etc etc.\n  ","397945":"\n  i'm voting for bernie sanders.\n  ","397946":"\n  i can appreciate the beauty of the nature and its environment, but on a political and social level, no. there's too much injustice in the united states.\n  ","397947":"\n  no, i've never used icy hot because i've never really had a reason to use it.\n  ","397948":"\n  yeah, i check my personal email every day, and i use email all the time for work. it's my primary form of correspondence with my coworkers and clients.\n  ","397949":"\n  i normally just get up and grab it.\n  ","397950":"\n  i would be more than happy to invite\n  \n   @IsoleLemuria\n  \n  to my house !!\n  ","397951":"\n  i don't even know what that is, so no.\n  ","397952":"\n  i can only speak english.\n  ","397953":"\n  no, not any anons. considering i don't know anyone, it's difficult to really establish a connection.\n  ","397954":"\n  yeah, both in romantic and platonic relationships. my ex and i were like that, and i recently felt that way when i first started talking to one of my coworkers.\n  ","397955":"\n  i've encountered plenty of people with stutters, so i can somewhat understand. it isn't really something you can help, but just remember that those who truly care about you and want to be around you will do so regardless of this.\n  ","397956":"\n  yeah, i've never had any conflict with any of my coworkers before. i talk to a few of them on a regular basis.\n  ","397957":"\n  no, not necessarily. i believe it's important to focus on what's going well because that's integral to move forward, but you should also acknowledge what's going wrong as well in an effort to remedy the situation.\n  ","397958":"\n  i would either assume they simply do not care or they're not aware of what they're doing still. in those cases, if you've talked to them multiple times about their behavior and they still haven't made any efforts to change, it might be like beating a dead horse. i would personally question the relationship at that point.\n  ","397959":"\n  i'm supposed to go out drinking with my roommate, but he hasn't mentioned anything. so i think i might try to meet up with a friend, and if my roommate wants to join us later on, then maybe he'll stop by.\n  ","397960":"\n  yes, i've experienced the same thing. it's just a part of growing older -- everyone lives their own independent lives and sometimes we grow apart from other people. it's natural and common.\n  \n  i wasn't social or popular in high school or anything, but when i was in college, i did make a few friends. most of my current friends are people who have remained from high school or old coworkers.\n  ","397961":"\n  i would just treat them like any one of my other friends, and if they came to me with worries about their stutter, then i would try to explain to them that their stutter doesn't define who they are. and that if others are treating them differently for it then they're not worth having in their life.\n  ","397962":"\n  i avoid eye contact at all costs.\n  ","397963":"\n  i haven't made new friends in quite some time, besides two of my coworkers if that even counts. i'm not sure how someone would go about making new friends unless they're frequently in social settings, like at school or work.\n  ","397964":"\n  depends on the person because it can manifest in different ways. for me personally, they're usually physical symptoms like heart palpitations, feeling lightheaded, being shaky, not being able to catch my breath, etc etc. there's also a sense of fear involved (for me at least) but i can never pinpoint what the fear is -- it's like a sense of impending doom.\n  ","397965":"\n  yes. they're using drinking as a coping mechanism to deal with their mental health, which isn't healthy. that's how a lot of people become dependent on alcohol (or any other sort of substance for that matter).\n  ","397966":"\n  a bit anxious, but otherwise fine. i'm just listening to music and my roommates talk rn.\n  ","397967":"\n  aw, thank you !! i appreciate it ~~\n  ","397968":"\n  everything, haha. my appearance, my personality (or lack thereof), my friendships, etc etc. the only constant factor in my life that i am confident in is my job.\n  ","397969":"\n  if the friendship is draining you of energy and you're putting more into the friendship than what you're receiving, then perhaps it's time to reevaluate the friendship. overall, your friendships should fulfill you and help you toward your goals, not hinder you in any way.\n  ","397970":"\n  no, i'm not a very confident person. i'm rather insecure.\n  ","397971":"\n  not really, no. i've gotten pretty angry and frustrated, but i've never lost my temper.\n  ","397972":"\n  i don't, haha. i don't have much confidence to begin with, so if i'm having a bad day, there's not much i can really do to help it. my bad days don't have anything to do with self confidence, anyway.\n  ","397973":"\n  in a way, yes. it's not the amount of talking i do, it has more to do with what i'm willing to talk about.\n  ","397974":"\n  i'm personally not, but i'm aware of the risks it comes with for other people.\n  ","397975":"\n  from my understanding, it doesn't correctly portray BDSM practices and could lead to dangerous situations if people model their behavior after those in the book. things like consent, safe words, etc etc. also, apparently the man in the book is a manipulative person -- this is all that i've heard from other people though, i've never read it myself.\n  ","397976":"\n  no, we just did our normal grocery shopping on thursday night. we already have an abundance of hand soap in the house anyway, which is what's most important.\n  ","397977":"\n  depends on the context of their argument. if they're denouncing every organized religion and are simply voicing their opinion, then i see nothing wrong with that. however, if they're targeting a specific religion and being discriminatory, and you feel the need to challenge their views, then i think it's appropriate to discuss why they perhaps feel that way.\n  ","397978":"\n  i'm sure it's already banned in some places, lol. but i don't personally believe so -- it *is* a very problematic book (and movie, i'm assuming) and i think people should be more aware of how dangerous it is, though.\n  ","397979":"\n  it isn't a matter of shying away, because there are some schools with s*x education courses. the problem is funding, i believe, because most schools do not have adequate funding to provide comprehensive s*x education courses.\n  ","397980":"\n  p*rn objectifies women because it gives off the impression that women are simply s*x objects and not a living, breathing human being. there's more of an emphasis on male satisfaction than female satisfaction.\n  ","397981":"\n  no, it's an absolute terrible way to learn about s*x. it doesn't teach you about consent or foreplay, and there's no communication involved. for proper s*x education, there are informative videos you can watch as well as being honest with your partner about your likes\/dislikes.\n  \n  even s*x education in schools is lackluster.\n  ","397982":"\n  i believe the oldest game i've played is duck hunt on the original NES when i was a child. i remember being in my cousin's living room playing it with them when i was very young.\n  ","397983":"\n  plaid leggings with rips in them and fishnets underneath. i don't have a picture, but they're super comfy and also my aesthetic ~~\n  ","397984":"\n  eh, somewhat. it entirely depends on what the person did to screw up the first chance they were given. every situation is unique.\n  ","397985":"\n  i've always wanted to travel cross-country via car and stop at all of the scenic rest stops and other various nature preserves along the way. nature and traveling are both deeply important to me because i believe they help in a person's development.\n  \n  i'm not sure if i'll ever have the chance to actually travel cross country, but if the opportunity presented itself, then i would totally do it.\n  ","397986":"\n  eventually, sure. not necessarily in the form of children, but i would like to have a partner and various adopted animals.\n  ","397987":"\n  \"there is an idea of a patrick bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though i can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: i simply am not there.\"\n  ","397988":"\n  i'm doing well. i'm listening to a fallout 4 ambient soundtrack while working on some freelance writing for my job for extra cash.\n  \n  i'm trying to be productive today because it helps my mental health, so i have some laundry going, i made a pot of coffee, and i cooked breakfast earlier this morning. i'm thinking about cleaning the house a little bit later on in the afternoon.\n  ","397989":"\n  struggling writer who cannot finish a single piece of work while also relying too dependently on things such as drugs and alcohol in an effort to enhance creativity.\n  ","397990":"\n  i believe it's different for everybody. some people are ready for marriage at a younger age, while others are comfortable waiting many years to find someone with whom they click on an intimate basis.\n  \n  i believe a person may be ready for marriage if they simply cannot fathom a life without the other person in it somewhat, if their communication is pristine, and if they're able to navigate through disagreements without hostility. there should be a sense of emotional intimacy there, and ideally your partner should not only be your lover, but also your best friend.\n  ","397991":"\n  i try my hardest not to, but it's inevitable for everyone to judge a person based solely on how they look or present themselves without getting to know them on a personal level. it's something i'm cognizant of -- we're humans and we're not perfect, and as much as we all know that it's wrong to judge someone at face value, we do it anyway.\n  ","397992":"\n  mobula rays can leap multiple meters into the air and belly flop back into the water. some scientists believe that it's to attract a mate, but there are also some sources that believe they simply do it just for fun.\n  ","397993":"\n  go through life at your own pace, regardless of how other people show off their lives (especially on social media). there is no exact timeline for how you should and will complete things, and everything will settle in its place when the time is right.\n  ","397994":"\n  perishing alone with no one by your side, whether it's in an emotional or physical context. my worst fear is being abandoned by others, so if i were to pass away, it unsettles me that there's the chance i will be completely and utterly alone.\n  ","397995":"\n  yes, there's a significant difference between being honest and being rude. it all depends on your intention and how you phrase things, how you come across to the other person and how cognizant you are of your tone of voice.\n  \n  being honest is always a good thing, within reason, but you should be careful with how you word your thoughts if the other person is sensitive or in a bad mindset. being rude, on the other hand, is when you have no regard for the other person's feelings to where your honesty is hurtful.\n  ","397996":"\n  i've always felt most at peace in the woods -- so going on vacation in a snow-covered region in a small cabin in the forest sounds most ideal to me.\n  \n  i recently went on a tropical vacation, and while it was certainly fun, it wasn't really \"me,\" so to speak. i liked laying out in the sunshine and having a stiff drink, but i would much prefer scenery such as mountains and forests and streams.\n  ","397997":"\n  having a mental illness doesn't excuse you from exhibiting poor, problematic, or toxic behavior. you cannot blame mental health on your inability to uphold friendships, relationships, etc etc., because you're acting in the wrong. of course, some mental illnesses *explain* the behavior -- but it does not excuse it. you still should be held accountable for your actions.\n  ","397998":"\n  yes to all of the above. someone's sex, gender, race, religion, disability, etc etc., should not determine what rights they're entitled to.\n  ","397999":"\n  yes, depending on the situation. obviously every situation is unique, though. there will be some situations where it works, meanwhile other situations where it doesn't.\n  ","398000":"\n  i'm not sure i understand exactly what you're asking. you answered your own question in the former half of your statement.\n  ","398001":"\n  it depends entirely on the situation. sometimes a conclusion does not necessarily justify the means by which a person goes to accomplish something because it could hurt others in the process.\n  ","398002":"\n  the answer should be quite obvious, if you know what \"equal rights\" means. if not, i suggest you google it.\n  ","398003":"\n  rights that involve equity for all people regardless of their gender, sex, social status, race, disability, religion, etc etc.\n  ","398004":"\n  it's been my default means of coping with difficult situations and trauma since i was a pre-teen. eventually it becomes ingrained into your subconscious, and it's hard to break the cycle.\n  ","398005":"\n  similar to my last answer from you, i believe people deserve equal rights, including oppressed\/minority groups such as the lgbtq+ community, women, trans people, disabled people, jewish people, etc etc.\n  ","398006":"\n  mayonnaise, ugh. i can't stand the sight, sound, or smell of it.\n  ","398007":"\n  i haven't checked my wishlist in a long time, haha. right now, i have various books on there, as well as a small treadmill, a backlight for my television, and candles.\n  ","398008":"\n  yes, i believe so. feelings of love should be mutual in relationships, and if one person is feeling less strongly or more strongly than the other, and it's causing a detrimental effect to the relationship, then it's a conversation worth having.\n  ","398009":"\n  i'm not in a bad mood -- i'm actually doing okay this morning. i just made breakfast, and i'm about to start working soon.\n  ","398010":"\n  things like swim suits, perhaps mesh shirts that show the entirety of a person's upper body, things of that nature that would be more appropriate in a going-out, adult setting rather than being in school.\n  \n  please be advised that i'm in no mood to have a heated discussion about things, so if this conversation turns hostile, i'm going to simply delete your message.\n  ","398011":"\n  being disloyal and disrespectful to your partner by establishing another relationship or otherwise cheating on them, and then lying about that relationship to your partner. any healthy relationship would establish trust and communication, and if someone was feeling a certain way other than love towards their partner, they should feel comfortable talking about those feelings.\n  \n  there's also the issue of domestic violence against spouses and partners, which obviously is terrible and more than just a \"mistake.\"\n  ","398012":"\n  that's your opinion, and i respect that. i believe quite the opposite.\n  ","398013":"\n  i'm pretty sure it's this one. i chose it because it's a gorgeous photograph that i took when i was on the cruise.\n  ","398014":"\n  it takes a lot of time for me to be comfortable around new people, especially because most of my friendships are at least two or three years old at this point (with my longest friendship because 15 years old).\n  ","398015":"\n  i believe people can wear whatever they want to school, within reason, and crop tops aren't really that big of a deal in my opinion. school systems just have a tendency to chastise women and girls for wearing certain clothing items because they might be \"distracting,\" meanwhile they don't chastise other people in the same school systems for items of clothing they might wear, especially men and boys.\n  ","398016":"\n  it's not really an ornament, per say, but my favorite aspect of my house is my bedroom -- particularly a painting my friend drew for me on a commission that shows all of my favorite fallout 4 characters and other things from the video game.\n  \n  i don't have a picture of it since i'm on my laptop right now, unfortunately.\n  ","398017":"\n  i don't go to restaurants enough to really have a favorite. i used to like IHOP, though.\n  ","398018":"\n  as my bio indicates, i'm 28 years old.\n  ","398019":"\n  striving for a better life turns unhealthy when you're more focused on your goals than you are on our own self-care, when you don't know how to take time out for yourself because you're too worried about progressing forward in life. self-care is absolutely important, and as motivated you might be to better your own life, it's essential to make sure you're emotionally and physically healthy too.\n  ","398020":"\n  i don't generally make bets with people, so i honestly can't remember the last time i did something like that. if anything, it was over seven years ago.\n  ","398021":"\n  no, i'm super impatient and even waiting on line at the pharmacy or grocery store is very frustrating to me, haha.\n  ","398022":"\n  i judge others by lower standards than i judge myself. i'm super critical of myself and i always set high expectations for myself, which sometimes is my downfall because when i don't meet those expectations, i become extremely disappointed, frustrated, and angry.\n  ","398023":"\n  i believe that i would rather have one intimate soul mate with no close friends rather than having no soul mate with a lot of friends. i've never liked having a large circle of friends because it's difficult to keep up with everyone, and the idea of having one person who understands your soul better than anything else is extremely appealing to me.\n  ","398024":"\n  eh, i have both healthy and unhealthy coping mechanisms. i wasn't doing well last night, so i drank semi-heavily. however, i also find that talking to other people and distracting yourself with work and hobbies is effective as well.\n  ","398025":"\n  i believe they're equally as important -- to love means to show vulnerability and compassion towards others, whether in a platonic or romantic way, and it also keeps us humble. to be loved by others is also important because it's crucial to have a support system of others to have around when you're going through difficult times.\n  ","398026":"\n  freedom is having the rights you deserve in order to think, act, or be treated equally to others without any interference or restraint from other people.\n  ","398027":"\n  i hope you have a lovely day as well !!\n  \n  my day has been short thus far -- i only woke up maybe 30 minutes ago, haha. i just made a pot of coffee, and i'm perusing social media before starting on my weekend work.\n  ","398028":"\n  no, i believe having rights and having responsibilities are two entirely different things. to have rights means to have equality among others in both a social and legal aspect, such as civil rights, gay rights, women's rights, etc etc.\n  \n  responsibilities, on the other hand, are obligations we have on a daily basis to live our lives successfully. responsibilities are often seen as things like paying bills on time, going to work, making time out for ourselves, fixing things when they go wrong, etc etc.\n  ","398029":"\n  depends on my mood in that particular moment. i like alternative rock, indie rock, hip-hop, classical music, jazz, the blues, heavy metal, and nu-metal.\n  ","398030":"\n  yes -- i have a black lace shirt that i wear with ripped camouflage leggings with fishnets underneath, as well as combat boots.\n  ","398031":"\n  my best quality, in my opinion, is my compassion for others as well as my passion in my hobbies. my worst flaw, on the other hand, is being self-critical and self-destructive.\n  ","398032":"\n  i prefer tattoos over piercings. i don't have any piercings, but i have seven tattoos with plans for a few more at the moment.\n  ","398033":"\n  i'm not much of a fan of EDM, they all sound the same to me, lol.\n  ","398034":"\n  no, i tried a few VR games in the past and they just made me incredibly dizzy.\n  ","398035":"\n  i've only ever watched movies such as \"spirited away\" and \"howl's moving castle,\" but i thoroughly enjoyed them and i'm more than interested in watching more of his productions.\n  ","398036":"\n  i'm almost too good at convincing other people of things, tbh. i have quite a good poker face and i can tell someone what is believed to be a \"fact\" and have them believe me without any corresponding evidence whatsoever. it is both a blessing and a curse.\n  ","398037":"\n  true crime, writing, literature, video games, music, the arts, politics, television shows about law and law enforcement, civil rights, alcoholic beverages, animals, the supernatural, conspiracy theories, and comedy.\n  ","398038":"\n  no, i wouldn't want anyone famous subjected to the horrors of askfm.\n  ","398039":"\n  my aesthetic ~~\n  ","398040":"\n  my personal favorite, yet very unhealthy, coping mechanism is drinking alcohol. however, if you do not want to be like me and drown my sorrows, i would suggest healthier coping mechanisms such as venting to friends\/family, partaking in hobbies which you enjoy, and working.\n  ","398041":"\n  i'm not doing the greatest, but i'm better now than i have been in the past few days. i also took two shots of jack daniels and have had four beers, so ...\n  ","398042":"\n  i would say a 3, giving myself the benefit of the doubt. lmaoo. i enjoy singing, but i'm aware that i'm absolutely horrible at it.\n  ","398043":"\n  no, he can simply sign away his rights to the child. it all depends on the situation, though, as to whether or not i *personally* think it's appropriate. if a man doesn't want to be involved in his child's life at all but doesn't sign away his rights, and then falls behind on child support payments besides, then that shows that he's basically a sh*tty human being.\n  ","398044":"\n  i used to watch\/listen to the rooster teeth podcast or \"off topic\" by achievement hunter, but it's been quite a few months since i've turned into their podcasts.\n  ","398045":"\n  i've never really lifted weights before, besides doing regular arm exercises on the machines at the gym. i mostly have done cardio in the past.\n  ","398046":"\n  i listen to the radio every morning, actually. it's easier to turn the radio on in the morning rather than plug in my phone to use spotify. i also like the different programs on various radio stations that they do in the mornings.\n  ","398047":"\n  yes, without a doubt. i would try to \"fix\" my past relationship and ensure that it wouldn't have failed at the end.\n  ","398048":"\n  i used to think it was twice, but now i only believe it has been once.\n  ","398049":"\n  i don't like cooking, but i like making scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and sausages in the morning. i like breakfast foods over anything else.\n  ","398050":"\n  perhaps the basement. i only go in there once per week or so in order to do laundry.\n  \n  the other option would be my roommates' rooms, haha.\n  ","398051":"\n  i had thought i left my lamp on all night when i woke up this morning, but it turns out it was just the sunlight seeping in through the window shade. it was a lot later in the morning than i had expected it to be.\n  ","398052":"\n  i do not have a tiktok account, nor do i cosplay. so this is inaccurate on both accounts.\n  ","398053":"\n  i like the combination of beards & moustaches, but it really depends on the person and whether or not it suits them.\n  ","398054":"\n  i've always had differing tastes of people, so it depends entirely on how they portray themselves. i don't have an \"ideal\" image of what someone should look like in order for me to be attracted to them.\n  ","398055":"\n  i'm in the process of reading \"you\" by caroline kepnes.\n  ","398056":"\n  i don't foresee myself dating anyone else, at least at this time, so this is a pretty unrealistic hypothetical.\n  ","398057":"\n  LOL. i wish i was on your level rn.\n  \n

it would be interesting to see who all of our anons are for 24 hours. their identities just magically revealed.\n  ","398063":"\n  no, i don't believe so.\n  ","398064":"\n  not personally, no. i have a friend or two who have been arrested for DUIs, though.\n  ","398065":"\n  if those were true cases in the scenario, then it sounds like he was in a manipulative and ab*sive relationship. regardless, even if she *did* try to \"trap him,\" a miscarriage is still a traumatic event and there's no excuse for abandoning someone at the hospital where they'll have no means of getting back home.\n  \n  they'd both be wrong in that example.\n  ","398066":"\n  it's literally illegal to serve underage people alcohol, and i think arrests are warranted in these situations. there are so many ways to ensure that an ID is real (the bar i go to, for example, has one of those ID scanners they place the ID inside and determines whether it's real or fake).\n  \n  obviously not every place will have that sort of technology, but i believe underage drinking is a serious matter because of how normalized alcohol is in today's society.\n  ","398067":"\n  i like cheeseburgers with lettuce and tomatoes. i don't like onions or ketchup or pickles or anything else on my burgers.\n  ","398068":"\n  new belgium's fat tire or voodoo ranger. i also like yuengling, corona light (only with the lime), and montauk's wave chaser IPA.\n  \n  i also drink a lot of local beer since long island has a hell of a lot of breweries, but i can't remember any of their names.\n  ","398069":"\n  i feel as if this question is a bit inappropriate -- for me, at the very least. i'm uncomfortable sharing my darkest thoughts because they're quite grotesque and i don't want to implicate myself.\n  ","398070":"\n  no, i'm not interested in sports.\n  ","398071":"\n  i'm terrified of places that are alleged to be haunted, haha. i wouldn't want to stay in a haunted house or hotel or anything, even if i was paid money to go there.\n  ","398072":"\n  i'm just listening to music, answering questions in my inbox, and drinking a beer.\n  ","398073":"\n  i haven't been to the store to assess the situation, but there have been suspicions of some cases on long island and they're carefully monitoring everything. upper management at my job sent a company-wide email yesterday about taking precautions about the coronavirus and how we're going to all be setting our computers up to work remotely from home if the office building ends up getting shut down.\n  ","398074":"\n  i wouldn't wish to live to the age of 1,000 regardless of how i looked. that sounds like a terrible existence.\n  ","398075":"\n  wow ... that was such a d*ck move on his part -- to abandon his girlfriend at the hospital? to not support her (i'm assuming) through a miscarriage, which is normally traumatic? he sounds like a terrible person.\n  \n  i would have cut him off too. i wouldn't want that sort of person in my life.\n  ","398076":"\n  i could never go into a customer service position, where you have to deal with irate customers or clients on a daily basis. i wouldn't be able to emotionally handle that.\n  ","398077":"\n  yes, haha. five years isn't much time in the long run, and i would rather be confident in myself than live a longer life where i'm absolutely miserable.\n  ","398078":"\n  get an actual alarm clock, set it to a particular time, and place it across the room so that you're forced to get out of bed in order to turn the alarm off.\n  ","398079":"\n  coffee, haha. it was the only thing keeping me motivated to continue working this morning.\n  ","398080":"\n  i think it's silly, but it's a good way for people to receive extra coins, if they care about that sort of thing. i've never paid coins to view someone's secret answer.\n  ","398081":"\n  everyone i know isn't looking forward to it because we lose an hour, but tbh, i'm happy about daylight savings because now i don't have to worry about driving home from work in the dark anymore.\n  ","398082":"\n  abandonment by my loved ones.\n  "}}
