  Spirituality is a state of mind ?
  
  You can be spiritual about what you like - it’s more about you being one with yourself and your beliefs.

   But have you ever prioritized attracting someone who could cover everything financially? It seems like you choose who you're interested based on other things, which is your right, but don't confuse that w/ it not being possible to do the other thing.

   I didnt mean have his way like that (although that too). I meant you wouldn't be lying down all day drinking wine.

  uh if youre telling me that i being able to lie down all day drinking wine and just doing whatever the fuck you want isnt lucky? ill let a man have his way with me if he gives me all his money and just lets me shop all day.

   Now men and women are equal. Women that men can do can do the same. Go to war, be a miner, be a president. For example, a woman president just elected in Finland! The world doesn't need men. Now technology is advanced, and women can reproduce asexually

  DRAGON: You inspire fear and awe, and you're fiercely protective of the people and possessions you cherish. You're a creature of comfort and you enjoy living luxuriously, but you're by no means lazy. If provoked, you're a fearsome enemy, but you're not easily angered. You enjoy time to yourself, but you also require intellectual stimulation, because behind all that raw power, you're also sharp as a tack.

  ","
  A charity that celebrities choose a month and they give away there earnings in any way they would like
  
  Example: let’s say lebron James chooses June to be his month. That month he goes around the world and helps those basketball lovers with groceries or putting a better roof over there heads.. idk anything just as long as they took 2 million which is a few hundred to them and shared it with the world... instead of just making all this money so they can just have it... do celebrities not realize if they each just took 2 million and focused that on the poor and the hungry the world would be a little bit better...

  ","
  Yes I have for about 3 years... and there were a lot of ups and downs but would I ever do it again? You fucking bet. It was probably the best time of my life. There were no worries and nothing but hanging out with friends and laughing. I often think about it from time to time and I regret not realizing at the time how great it was and how lucky I was to have such great friends... I wish I made more of those years. My health wasn’t good then but it wasn’t because of all the drugs. I had my own battles I had to overcome and major insecurities. Before I got braces I was super insecure about my teeth and it held me back from a lot of things and made me an angry person. If I just got braces as soon as I was 18... those years would have been a lot better.

  I love my cat so much. I tried to imagine what life would be like without her and all I think is wow I would be fucking lonely. I don’t mind spending time by myself because she’s around.

  great sayings... if you think of anymore please let me know and start using the phrases I already know in our convos if you can, lets make them a thing.
  "
619116,"
   Saying #5... ""Kitty cat central"".... Kitty cat central is my home because we have 2 cats. I'm like ""I love living in kitty cat central!"" It's like a play on Grand Central Station in New York. It started when my mom had 5 kitties at her house. That's how I started it because there were so many!
  ","
  super fucking cute.
  "
619117,"
   Saying #4.... ""CBS"" .... just like the tv channel CBS. But I make CBS stand for ""Captain Big Sh*ts""... I think that's self explanatory. lol. Also I sometimes use ""SBS"" for ""Senor Big Sh*ts"" when it's due to eating Mexican food (I love Mission style California burritos).

  SENOR BIG SHITS AHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA best one yet

  this one is way too long to say haha
  "

   Saying #2.... ""Jub-Jubs"". That's that when I eat a ridiculous amount of food and am so stuffed, I become ""Jub-Jubs""... that's basically a nickname I gave myself when I pig out. I'm like ""uuuugh... I'm Jub-Jubs right now.""

  wow, thank you for these nice words. I know im a hard worker and I try my hardest to be a good person. all I want to do is help better his life, and honestly all ive done is that since we have been together.... and I know that hurts his mom a little bit.. all those years she thought she was the one that was going to save him and it ended up being me in less than a year.

  heres a really good example;
  
  so my bf has OCD and he has had OCD his entire life. his mom said that she thought he had slight OCD when he was younger but it wasn't fully developed so she just thought that it never was going to develop. so my bf ended up starting to do drugs because his OCD has gotten so bad and it helped. well his mom doesn't put the two and two together when he first started doing drugs (before it was too late) she blamed the drugs but didn't realize that the drugs were his way of solving his OCD... and it took a few more years for her and doctors to really figure that out and I figured it out less than an hour of just talking to him. when he told me about his history with drugs I asked ""why did you do them?"" and he said it was because he liked them and it made him feel normal. so I asked ""is your OCD worse without drugs."" and he was so caught off guard that I noticed he had OCD. its very small things he does but my sister has OCD so I know what it all looks like. so I notice things like that and other things as well.

  apparently working two jobs so that im completely full time isn't enough. they want me work out everyday. not sleep in on my days off. clean every time I come home. basically just never be home.. and I should probably find the cure for cancer since nothing I do is ever good enough. its fucking annoying but I really think its because they just don't want me ever home because they want to have their house and their son to themselves. I truly believe that my bfs parents did not realize that they were going to have to let go and mentally prepare themselves that their son will need to have a life without them and so since thats happening now they don't know how to react or live. sorry I just went on a rant but their relationship is sickening.

  Let Down
  
  By: Savannah Ames

  We will always experience the pain of being let down,
  
  But we will also have to decide how much they are worth to go through all that pain.
  
  We will always let down someone we love,
  
  But we will also try our hardest to make everything right again.
  
  Breathing consists of constantly losing and gaining trust,
  
  As often as you inhale and exhale oxygen into your lungs.
  
  When you find that person that is worth all the pain and all the fight,
  
  Make sure that person knows your heart cannot beat without them.

  we are all focused on whats wrong or what all the problems are... we need to slow down and look at all we have accomplished and be proud how far we have come. as soon as we achieve something its right on the next issue that we have to fix... nobody takes a moment or a breath. I realized that my depression/anxiety came from all the things I wasn't doing or haven't accomplished yet... I no longer have bad anxiety because I started to slow down and focus on what I have achieved already and take each day one day at a time.

  theres a lot of great men that are addicts. just because a person has an addiction doesn't make them a bad person. you can google all celebrities that suffer with addiction and I think youll be pretty surprised how many there actually are.

  this is beyond fucked up to say to someone. why would you put an idea like that in someones head. thats so much negativity. and maybe I already have some major trust issues and he and I are going through some personal issues together.

   Also, I thought the Falcons mascot design was weird. It was like a robot falcon. I thought it should be more pretty looking. Although the Mavricks logo was pretty blah in my opinion as well. And LCC's colors reminded me of sea puke or something. haha. I like La Jolla's colors but not the viking.

  I liked torrey pines colors tho. did not like there logo either.

619849,"
   Well I guess Torrey Pines isn't creepy, but going to their stadium for an away football game is kinda scary with all their students yelling and stuff at you. haha. All the people from Rancho Santa Fe that went there, I used to say that they were from ""the ranch"". lol

   I don't think when a white guy shot students in a school you would call him by his religion or  race you would rather call him a criminal which would make more sense tbh
  ","
  Well the news said they were Muslim. Don’t get mad at me when everybody else is saying they were Muslim.
  
  Also if those white people who shot up a school ended up being some denomination of Christianity I guarantee people who be calling them by there religion because when people think of religion they think of peace and harming others doesn’t sound very peaceful..

   Ash is a one house kitty as well. I feel like a lot of strays are like that. Maybe it's because it was so hard for them to find food and they probably fought with other cats, so they do not want to share anything with any other animal. My kitty growls so much and hisses when she sees other cats.

  Well honestly I don’t blame them cause I don’t wanna share either hahahahaha

  So today I did something out of my comfort zone. Today I decided that I was going to give a box of fruit cake to a homeless person. And so I saw one this morning and so I parked my car and went up to him.. I was so nervous. But I handed him the cake and he was in shock.. we ended up talking and both ended up tearing up a little bit. I’m going to make 2019 about doing small things while nobody is watching! It was an amazing experience honestly.

   Like, would you fight for your country in a war?
  ","
  I would not do well in war.
  
  But I don’t believe the only people who are brave are those who fight for their country.
  
  I think bravery is when you wake up in the morning wanting to die but you still manage to get up and do what you need to do in the day.
  
  Bravery is someone who suffers from addiction and instead of letting that addiction kill them - they conquer it.
  
  Bravery is someone who was born without something they need to live, such as; limbs,sight,hearing ect and they still manage to smile everyday..

  Red;
  
  You feel it build up in your chest.
  
  A warm fire burning
  
  They keep igniting the spark
  
  Till you burst into flames.
  
  Your world changes to the color red
  
  And you have to fight every thought in your head
  
  Not to hurt everyone
  
  And make sure they are all dead.
  
  Being pushed to your breaking point
  
  Wishing you could jump off the edge
  
  Don’t have that much more fight in you
  
  Remembering oxygen is needed for a fire to burn.

  Well i know they know who they are. They are so special to me and always will be. They were always there for me when i needed a smile or a good laugh. They knew me better than anyone has ever known me. There were times where i believed i would never be happy unless they were in my life. They showed me what love truly felt like. I wish they would talk to me and wish they would stay in my life. I miss them.
