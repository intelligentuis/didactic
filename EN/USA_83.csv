  Dad's mom - I was too young. Only know from pictures and stories.
  
  Dad's dad - We weren't that close. Mostly just talked about school and my friends when I did see him. Christmas with everyone. He was sick and old... didn't really hit me as hard.. first person I knew to die though. At the ""after party"" we went back to the house and the mailman came. My sister and I were outside on the porch. He asked how he was doing. So ya that was awkward after just burying him. We just kind of looked at eachother and pointed upwards ü§£ he got the message. There wasn't much to grieve over? The funeral was sad though. Just a moment in life I suppose. Sharing stories and all that. It was also creepy how a guy showed up at the service that looked like him. Everyone talked about it in the parking lot XD
  
  Mom's dad - hit more hard. Didn't have a proper goodbye. Went in his sleep outside. Was in the next state over, my mom and I drove back home that night. The whole time the radio had sad music playing death, love, remembrance so that was comforting. I also saw an orb in my room that night before sleeping. I guess just knowing our bond was stronger than the other relatives. that love was there even if we didn't always vocalize it. More memories with. Knowing they were in a better place now. Felt worse for my nana. They almost had 50 years together.

  Depends on the person you get? If you really need it.
  
  I was young and didn't really have a choice. Nor did it always last. The food wasn't the problem.. my undiagnosed issues were. Doesn't really help to be all ""eat this, eat that,  exercise more"".
  
  Even the pcos lady was all ""exercise "" when I was literally going to the gym pretty much every day. They dont really look at medical issues it seems.. maybe its different today.. who knows.

   No matter where you are, stay indoors stay safe stay away from windows, charge your devices, stay connected. Don‚Äôt accept any rides. Don‚Äôt open the door to anyone, I wouldn‚Äôt even order food unless you have to for the safety of the driver (if you reside by state capital). Make a safety bag.

  Stagnation? Cheating the whole time? You two didn't grow together, grew apart. Wanted to explore more. If it's a high school situation.. probably didn't feel 100% ready to commit. Wanted to explore college.Age gap. People got to him about the relationship.
  
  Only you and him would know WHY.

I'd follow people's pages to get to know them better/their stories/life. You probably do this to every girl on here trying to get that sympathy vote. Everyone has been through heartbreaks. If you are going to talk about it write a lot instead of just being all ""she fucking hates me"" pity party crap. One word sentences aren't fun to read chapter by chapter. Heartbreak is what people don't like. People constantly complaining about it (like YOU) is what we don't like. Bless you. I hope you heal from this heartbreak and any future heartbreaks.
