you","761583":"just a friend of the family lol","761584":"probably because the guy lol","761585":"i had a realization recently about happiness and pain . i think i used to think that the two can t exist at the same time . i spent a lot of my life repressing my feelings and ignoring my pain . i wanted people to think i was put together and i was okay and that there was nothing wrong with me . a couple years ago i had a bit of an awakening to my own pain and i felt like i wanted to shout it from the rooftops . i wanted everyone to know i am in pain ! i don t have everything together ! i m not perfect ! people have wronged me very deeply ! i wanted to make my pain real . i wanted it to matter . and i think in the process of doing that , i started to over identify with it . i started to think i am my pain rather than i am in pain . i think that was necessary at the time because of my natural inclination to dismiss myself . but recently i decided i don t want to hold onto pain so tightly . i used to think that cheering yourself up was a hoax because if you have a problem , it s a problem and cheering yourself up is not gonna change it . that is true , but i m learning that life is not so black and white . you can be going through extreme pain and still have moments of happiness . in the midst of a tragedy you can feel gratitude for the good in the world . in an extremely stressful time you can decide to do something fun and have fun and be carefree for a moment . none of those things will change what happened . none of those things will fix your problems or the problems of the world , but they can bring a little bit of light to the darkness . turning on a lamp when it s dark doesn t change the fact that it s nighttime . turning on a flashlight doesn t mean you re ignoring the dark . it just makes it easier to continue on through the night . you need some light in the dark to be able to keep going . it s okay to turn a light on . and we can t forget that it can never be so dark that light cannot pierce through . even in the dead of night the stars and the moon still shine .","761586":"just the photos with the girls or ?","761587":"about what

history class that deals with current events but they also have to take speech and debate because the whole time in class or in the hallways or cafeteria whatever they re arguing over the different

demise . it s about going after someone who you know is never gonna be with you . it s not gonna work , it s not gonna happen , you re just gonna end up with a broken heart . but you are desperately lonely and you also have some mental issues so you do it anyway . smh . i wanted to capture the roller coaster of emotion that comes with choosing such a dark fate for yourself so this is one of the weirdest songs i ve ever written . it changes keys like times and each section kinda sounds like a different song . but when you put it all together it s a perfect disaster . an illusory journey of sorts . much like when alice fell down the rabbit hole and found wonderland . kinda fun , kinda scary . a nice escape from reality , but ultimately a delusional dream from beginning to end . and when you wake up from it , you are just as alone as you were before it all started .","761873":"lunch","761874":"both","761875":"i just went through a really bad breakup at the beginning of this year and i

them off since may . . . they re suppose to become legal soon but it does get quite annoying especially when its half sticks of dynamite being thrown around and scares small children or animals so you have to deal with either a screaming baby small child or laying on the ground trying not to get bite in fear of an animal who is scared and hiding underneath a bed with little space to reach them . hear so many calls for disturbances and angry neighbors threatening each other with baseball bats and so on . or it s sometimes scary when you re driving down a road and they decide to light them off
